Indonesian official says Habibie to attend APEC, despite unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
will travel overseas as planned to attend a summit of Pacific Rim
nations, despite a week of domestic unrest in which more than a
dozen people were killed, the foreign minister said Monday.
	   ``There's no change in his itinerary,'' Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said. ``It has calmed down now, it's peaceful. Everything's
all right.''
	   Habibie is to join 20 other Pacific Rim leaders in Kuala Lumpur
for the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum. Ali Alatas arrived earlier for meetings of APEC foreign
ministers.
	   The Indonesian leader was scheduled to arrive on Tuesday and to
depart the following day. Officials had earlier said he was
reluctant to leave the country because there is no vice president
to act on his behalf during his absence.
	   Habibie had also considered boycotting the APEC summit in
Malaysia because of unhappiness over the treatment of his friend,
former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been
arrested on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   The APEC leaders are expected to discuss ways of coping with the
region's economic crisis, which contributed to extensive riots in
Indonesia in May that forced Indonesian President Suharto from
office.
	   Habibie has accused opponents of also trying to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   Habibie's efforts to implement political reforms have not
satisfied students who want faster change.

About one fifth of locals will leave for games: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ About half a million local residents
are aiming to get out of town during the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
according to a report released Monday.
	   An independent report by the Center for Visitor Studies found
that the numbers of those saying they would leave during the games
had leveled out at just under 20 percent after a period of steady
rise.
	   The report was made public on the same day that new tourism and
sports minister Jackie Kelly predicted an Olympics-driven boom in
overseas tourists.
	   ``I think Sydneysiders can see the Olympics coming up on the
horizon,'' center director Rob Hall said in a statement Monday.
``Some people have made up their minds to leave town while others
are waiting to see what will happen over the next two years.
However, one-fifth of the adult population does mean over half a
million people. It still represents a significant exodus.''
	   The center's first survey, taken in 1995, showed six percent of
Sydneysiders intended leaving for the duration of the games. The
figure increased to eight percent in 1996, 16 percent in 1997 and
19 percent in two studies this year.
	   New South Wales Olympics Minister Michael Knight last month said
organizers believed the best indication of the numbers of people
planning to leave was the number trying to rent their houses
through the Home Host and Home Stay programs. Those numbers did not
indicate anything other than a small proportion of people planning
to leave, he said.
	   ``The fact is, that if anybody leaves they'll regret it for the
rest of their lives,'' Knight said. ``It's the most extraordinary
event in our lifetime and if people leave, that's what they are
going to miss out on.''
	   Meanwhile Kelly told a tourism conference that a government
report showed the games would attract an additional 1.6 million
international visitors to Australia between 1997 and 2004, creating
150,000 jobs.
	   ``Clearly the Olympic Games present an unprecedented opportunity
to show the world what this country has to offer,'' Kelly said.

Japan bankruptcies rise for 17th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's recession pushed 1,707 corporations into
bankruptcy in October, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier,
a private credit research agency said Monday.
	   It was the 17th month in a row that the number of bankruptcies
increased. Debt left behind swelled 55 percent in October from the
same month last year to 739.27 billion yen (dlrs 6.06 billion).
	   Bankruptcies rose in sectors including construction,
manufacturing, transportation, communications and real estate, said
the agency, Teikoku Databank Ltd.
	   Sluggish exports and domestic sales, falls in goods prices,
reduced output, inventory buildups and damage to balance sheets
from the stock market's drop are creating ``a vicious circle of
deflation,'' the agency said.
	   Although the government legislated a 60 trillion yen (dlrs 492
billion) scheme to stabilize the financial system in October, banks
are expected to remain reluctant to support weak companies, meaning
bankruptcies may continue at high levels, Teikoku added.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs; RECASTS throughout; UPDATES with analyst comment in graf

 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister, on his way to a major
regional economic conference, unveiled the largest stimulus package
in the country's history Monday and promised it will turn the
recession-bound economy around by next year.
	   But analysts said the 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) in new
public spending and tax cuts will offer only temporary relief.
	   The package is aimed at stopping the economy from contracting
for a third consecutive year _ a pledge Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
made after taking office in July.
	   ``With this plan, our country can free itself from its current
severe situation,'' Obuchi told reporters before flying to Malaysia
for a summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
	   Obuchi, who's been under intense international pressure to do
more to ease Asia's economic woes, said the spending package also
contains 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8 billion) in aid for the region.
	   The package surpasses the record 17 trillion yen (dlrs 139
billion) the government released last April and brings the total
amount Tokyo has spent in stimulus since 1992 to close to 100
trillion yen (dlrs 820 billion).
	   Previous spending accomplished little more than keeping Japan's
economy afloat and failed to end a stubborn downturn triggered by
the collapse of land and stock prices in the early 1990s.
	   Economists said the results of the new package will likely be
more of the same, restoring the economy to anemic growth without
addressing Japan's deeper problems, such as its debt-ridden banking
system.
	   ``I'm not sure if they've put in place the mechanism'' for
economic recovery, said Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson (Asia). He said the economy could expand by 1
percent next year with the package.
	   Japan can use a shot in the arm.
	   The economy has sunk into its longest recession since the
government started keeping records after World War II. It shrank
last fiscal year for the first time in more than two decades, and
official forecasters say things will only get worse. Unemployment
and bankruptcy debts are stuck at record highs.
	   Obuchi said the package would include more than 17.9 trillion
yen (dlrs 147 billion) in spending, most of it on public works and
steps to help smaller companies ride out a severe credit crunch as
Japan's banks dispose of their massive bad loans.
	   Tax cuts worth about 6 trillion yen (dlrs 49 billion) will bring
Japanese income and corporate tax rates in line with those in major
Western economies, Obuchi said.
	   Another feature of the package is an innovative plan to entice
consumers to spend more by distributing 700 billion yen (dlrs 5.7
billion) in shopping vouchers.
	   The plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special
session of Parliament.
	   Obuchi, however, said the plan did not include a reduction of
the 5 percent national sales tax, as investors and opposition
politicians have been calling for.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the consumption tax
from 3 percent was widely blamed for choking off a growth spurt and
tipping the economy back into recession.
	   Obuchi said the tax revenue was needed because of Japan's
mounting budget deficit.
	   ``Judging from the current fiscal situation, it's difficult to
comply with that,'' he said.

Diversity can help business success: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Cultural diversity could boost
company profits, according to a report claiming a multicultural
group of people is more likely to come up with an innovative idea
than a group from a single culture.
	   The report, in the Monash Mt. Eliza Business Review journal, was
written by Dr. Goran Lindahl, chief executive of Swedish-Swiss
engineering company ABB ASEA Brown Boveri.
	   Lindahl said senior managers must be able to extract the
diversity of ideas in a multicultural group and steer them into
profitable action.
	   ``They must respect other and respect differences. They must
lead by example,'' Lindahl said in the report. ``They must
cultivate the trust of their people by involving them in decision
processes, getting them to take their ownership of new ideas.''
	   Companies should look to cross-cultural team building, Lindahl
said. One method is to have at least three nationalities on any
management team.
	   Lindahl said his company, which employs more than 200,000 people
in 140 countries, engaged psychologists to survey cultural
attitudes among managers from different countries.

Bomb explodes accidentally, 7 Tamil rebels killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Seven Tamil Tiger rebels were killed
and several others injured when a bomb intended for government
forces exploded accidentally in northern Sri Lanka, the rebel radio
said Monday.
	   The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio monitored in this northern
town said the bomb exploded when it was being transported to launch
an attack on the government forces on Saturday in the Vanni
jungles. It did not give the exact location. The radio did not say
how many were injured.
	   The Vanni jungles are about 25 kilometers ((16 kilometers) north
of Vavuniya, which is 210 kilometers (130 miles) north of the
capital, Colombo. The rebels are now concentrated in the Vanni
jungles and the nearby town of Kilinochchi.
	   The area's government cooperative marketing chief Suppaui
Veerasingham was shot and wounded Monday morning. Police said they
believe the attack was carried out by rebel infiltrators.
Veerasingham is a Tamil and the rebels often target Tamils who work
for the government.
	   Rebels from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been
fighting Sri Lankan troops for the past 15 years for an independent
Tamil homeland in the north and east of this island country off
India's southern coast. They say Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils are
discriminated against by the 14 million Sinhalese. The government
denies this

Italian priest freed by kidnappers in the Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with priest saying he plans to meet relatives
in Italy then return to Mindanao; details of captivity &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada announced
Monday that an abducted Italian priest has been freed unharmed by
kidnappers in the southern Philippines after more than two months
of captivity.
	   The kidnappers handed over the Rev. Luciano Benedetti to Muslim
rebels belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a thickly
forested area in southern Zamboanga province late Sunday.
	   The rebels then turned the priest over to government officials.
	   ``This is good news. Father Benedetti was not hurt. He's strong
and we greeted each other over the phone,'' Estrada told a Manila
radio station.
	   Officials had planned to escort Benedetti to a meeting with
Estrada in Manila but the president left to attend a summit of
Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia without being able to see the
priest.
	   Wearing a black bonnet and looking gaunt and sleepless,
Benedetti was flown by jet to an air force base in Manila. He later
appeared before reporters, cracking jokes and saying he was being
seized again, this time by a horde of journalists.
	   ``I'm a bit weak but I'm recovering from the ordeal,'' Benedetti
said, adding that he plans to visit his family in Italy before
returning to missionary work in southern Mindanao. He said he was
freed on the 20th anniversary of his assignment in the country.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province. His
kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 10 million pesos (dlrs
250,000).
	   The priest said his abductors treated him well but forced him to
walk constantly, at one point for nine hours. He also said he was
taken from island to island by boat and once was smuggled into
Basilan Island when a large contingent of government troops was
searching for him in the hinterlands of nearby Zamboanga.
	   Despite Benedetti's release, several other people remain in the
hands of different groups of kidnappers, including the family of a
Taiwanese businessman, a pair of Hong Kong citizens and a
Malaysian, all kidnapped in Mindanao.
	   The kidnappings have embarrassed Estrada's administration, which
launched a high-profile campaign against kidnappings for ransom and
promised upon taking office in June to end such abductions.
	   Last month, the government scored a major victory with the
rescue of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors
in Manila.
	   Fellow missionaries of Benedetti's in the Pontifical Institute
for Foreign Missions, a worldwide society of missionaries, thanked
the government for securing Benedetti's release and said his
abduction would not scare them into leaving the Philippines.
	   ``There is one thing which is very clear and that is we will
stay. Two of our people had been killed in the past, do you think
we were scared of that?'' said the Rev. Giampiero Bruni, who is
based in southern Zamboanga province.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Carzedda Salvatore was killed in an
ambush in Zamboanga in 1992 and another, the Rev. Tulio Favali was
killed in 1985 by an anti-communist vigilante group. Both belonged
to the institute, which has 17 missionaries in the volatile
southern region of Mindanao.
	   Al Haj Murad, the vice chairman of the MILF for military
affairs, said the MILF secured Benedetti's release without paying a
ransom. Government sources, however, said an unspecified amount of
ransom was paid to the kidnappers.
	   Murad said the kidnappers, who included former Muslim rebels and
company security guards, were allowed to escape after releasing the
priest.
	   Another MILF leader, Ghazali Jaafar, said MILF rebels surrounded
the kidnappers' lair then pressured them into giving up Benedetti
peacefully. ``We made sure no shots would be fired. We didn't want
the priest to be hurt,'' he said.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling
the central government in an attempt to establish a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   It is involved in on-and-off peace negotiations with Manila and
has promised to help the government combat rampant kidnappings in
Mindanao, although the military says the rebels might be involved
in some abductions.

Former PM Keating in private eye controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former prime minister Paul Keating has
accused political rivals of a ``virulent and despicable'' smear
campaign against him following revelations that they paid for a
private eye to probe his investments.
	   Keating, who was prime minister from 1991 until his election
defeat in 1996, said members of the conservative Liberal party
attacked him with ``rumor-mongering, dirt-peddling and dirty
tricks.''
	   ``Senior members of the parliamentary Liberal Party and its
organizational machine have been complicit in it, and have been
fully aware of its scope,'' Keating said in a statement Monday.
	   ``The campaign has gone well beyond the usual political
roughhouse.''
	   Keating's statement followed reports that the conservatives had
hired a private detective to investigate rumored real estate
investments in the Netherlands in 1994.
	   ``As with every other dimension to this campaign, the
Netherlands investigation was a complete waste of time and money
for the (Liberal Party),'' Keating said. ``There was, and is, no
substance to the rumor they were investigating.''
	   South Australian Liberal Senator Grant Chapman blamed a rogue
former staffer acting on his own for the 1994 incident.
	   But Keating said it ``defied credibility'' for Senator Chapman
to claim that he did not know members of his staff were engaged in
such activity. Keating said he was aware while he was in office
that ``this sort of private investigation was going on.''
	   Liberal party leader and prime minister John Howard said he knew
nothing about the issue until he read about it in the paper Monday.
	   ``I certainly knew nothing about it at the time,'' Howard told
reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting
in Kuala Lumpur. ``It sounded quite bizarre.''

Malaysia, South Korea want G22 to overhaul financial system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Asian nations should take their
demands for an overhaul of the global financial system to a larger
body than the wealthy Group of Seven nations, officials said
Monday.
	   ``We've come up with an agreement that we should not let G7 be
the sole authority to determine issues on global financial
structure and world finance, or to set the direction,'' Malaysia's
trade minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters Monday.
	   She was speaking after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
met with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. The South Korean
leader is in the Malaysian capital to attend the summit of leaders
from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   ``They agreed to promote G22 as the core group to be the
catalyst'' to come up with a better world financial structure,
Rafidah said.
	   Asian nations have been demanding a louder voice in deciding how
the architecture of the global finance system is overhauled. In
response to those demands, the United States last year created an
ad hoc group of 22 nations to come up with recommendations on
economic reform.
	   The group, which represents all of the rich G7 nations and
developing nations from around the world, issued its preliminary
set of proposals in Washington in October.
	   The Group of Seven -- which comprises the United States, Canada,
Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- last month announced a
series of new policies for global finance, including International
Monetary Fund and World Bank lending facilities for countries to
draw on in times of crisis.

Cyclone causes heavy damage to Indian city, three deaths reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OMER FAROOQ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ A cyclone ripped roofs from houses,
badly damaged power lines and left streets and railwaya clogged
with downed trees and utility poles in a southern Indian industrial
city.
	   Casualties were low because tens of thousands of people had fled
before it hit, officials said Monday.
	   The Andhra Pradesh state relief control room reported one person
was killed in Vishakhapatnam when Sunday's storm hit the port city
that is the state's industrial hub.
	   Three fishermen were also reported missing after their boat
capsized in seas off Vishakhapatnam, and two people were killed
when winds destroyed their house in nearby East Godavari.
	   A 1996 storm in the same area killed more than 2,000 people.
This time, some 32,000 people heeded cyclone warnings, fleeing
before the storm from the Bay of Bengal struck Vishakhapatnam, 800
kilometers (480 miles) northeast of the state capital, Hyderabad,
and some 1,400 kilometers (875 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   The storm brought heavy rains that flooded low-lying areas and
winds of 150 to 180 kilometers (93 to 112 miles) an hour that
toppled thousands of trees and electric and telephone poles in
Vishakhapatnam. The downed trees and poles blocked roads and
railway tracks, bringing traffic to a halt.
	   Many areas remained without electricity Monday. The state
electricity board said much of the electricity supply network will
have to be replaced.
	   Relief officials reached by phone in Vishakhapatnam said the
city, home to a steel plant and hundreds of petroleum processors
and chemical factories, looked as if it had been bombed, with roofs
ripped from hundreds of houses and streets strewn with debris.
	   ``It is one of the worst calamities the city has faced,'' said
Vishakhapatnam Relief Commissioner B.P. Acharya.
	   It was the second time in two months that Andhra Pradesh was hit
by a natural disaster. Floods in September killed an estimated 200
people. The state is buffeted by cyclones every year.

Report: Diversity can help business success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Cultural diversity could boost
company profits, according to a report claiming a multicultural
group of people is more likely to come up with an innovative idea
than a group from a single culture.
	   The report, made public Monday in the Monash Mt. Eliza Business
Review journal, was written by Dr. Goran Lindahl, chief executive
of Swedish-Swiss engineering company ABB ASEA Brown Boveri.
	   Lindahl said senior managers must be able to extract the
diversity of ideas in a multicultural group and steer them into
profitable action.
	   ``They must respect others and respect differences. They must
lead by example,'' Lindahl said in the report. ``They must
cultivate the trust of their people by involving them in decision
processes, getting them to take their ownership of new ideas.''
	   Companies should look to cross-cultural team building, Lindahl
said. One method is to have at least three nationalities on any
management team.
	   Lindahl said his company, which employs more than 200,000 people
in 140 countries, engaged psychologists to survey cultural
attitudes among managers from different countries.

England scrapes a win

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Tailenders Robert Croft and Alan
Mullally led England to an unconvincing one-wicket victory Monday
in their final tour match ahead of the five-test Ashes series
against Australia.
	   Croft (15) and Mullally (23) put on a 36-run stand to take
England from 106-9 to the target of 142 in the four-day match
against Queensland.
	   England opener Michael Atherton, in some minor doubt for the
first test because of a back injury, made an appearance down the
order but was out stumped for one.
	   Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz put his state in sight of
victory with six wickets including three early on the final day as
England lost 4-15. Kasprowicz, named earlier in the test team,
finished with 6-31.
	   England's win followed draws against Western Australia and South
Australia earlier on tour. The first test starts in Brisbane on
Friday.
	   The form of England's leading batsmen is causing most concern.
Captain Alec Stewart has three ducks and one half century from his
four innings while opener Mark Butcher has scored just nine runs
from five appearances.
	   The last-wicket pair showed strong resilience to last 78 minutes
and 65 balls on the deteriorating pitch.
	   Croft's effort reflected his work on his batting after he was
embarrassed by Glenn McGrath's pace when Australia toured England
last year.
	   He played a major role in England's test series win over South
Africa when he lasted 190 minutes to defy Allan Donald and secure a
draw in the Old Trafford test.
	   ``It reminded me a bit of Old Trafford, but it was a little
warmer here,'' Croft said. ``After all the hours of work you put in
it's nice to get a bit of success, but unless we perform well in
the Ashes series, then this performance here won't be worth much.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police on Monday picked up two
opposition figures at their homes for questioning after President
B.J. Habibie accused opponents of trying to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   At least five activists were in police custody following mob
riots and clashes between student protesters and police and
soldiers last week. At least 16 people, including eight students,
were killed.
	   There were no reports of unrest in Jakarta on Monday. Many shops
opened and rush-hour traffic crawled along the Indonesian capital's
main boulevard, the site of battles Friday night between riot
officers and students demanding swifter democratic change.
	   The unrest was the worst in the Indonesian capital since May,
when much heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat
authoritarian President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   About 100 student protesters gathered Monday at Trisakti
University, where the military fatally shot four activists in May,
triggering the violence that led to Suharto's downfall.
	   Wreathes were laid along the street outside Atma Jaya Catholic
University, where security forces shot and killed students with
plastic bullets last week.
	   Most Jakarta campuses were quiet.
	   In the eastern city of Palu, thousands of anti-government
student protesters occupied the local parliament building, the
official Antara news agency reported. The demonstration was
peaceful.
	   Habibie, a former Suharto protege whose efforts to implement
political reforms lack credibility among students, said the
violence would only jeopardize Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   After Habibie ordered the military to get tough on those trying
to topple him, police this weekend rounded up activists who have
campaigned for a more sweeping overhaul of Suharto's rigid
political system.
	   Among those in custody Monday were former political prisoner and
politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide
to opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Early in the morning, officers detained Haryono, an intellectual
who is active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association,
and Permadi Satrio Wiwoho, an outspoken fortune teller.
	   Another activist, 75-year-old retired Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, was
released late Sunday night after several hours of questioning.
Kemal has campaigned to replace Habibie with a transitional
government led by a presidium of community leaders.
	   Habibie has indicated he will stick by military chief Gen.
Wiranto despite outrage over the killings of the students by
security forces.
	   The clashes triggered riots by thousands of young men who burned
buildings and cars and attacked police on Saturday. Several
security personnel and pro-government civilian guards were also
killed.
	   In a meeting with local journalists Sunday, Wiranto expressed
regret for the shootings of the students and promised to take
action against officers involved.
	   Backed by armored personnel carriers and small tanks, Wiranto's
troops ringed the presidential palace and Parliament Monday.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   But the assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era,
did not heed a student demand to ban the military from politics.
Instead, it decided to gradually reduce the role of the armed
forces in Parliament.

Chicago ties 2-2 with Ottawa Seniors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Eric Daze's power-play goal at 5:47 of the third
period lifted Chicago to a 2-2 tie with the Ottawa Senators on
Sunday night, but the Blackhawks' winless streak still reached 10
games (0-8-2).
	   Daze converted a deflection from the slot 49 seconds after
Ottawa's Shaun Van Allen had given the Senators a 2-1 lead with a
shorthanded breakaway goal.
	   Tony Amonte also had a power-play goal for Chicago, which did
manage to snap a four-game losing streak. Amonte's 12th goal tied
him for the league lead with Edmonton's Bill Guerin.
	   Lance Pitlick also scored for the Senators, who are winless in
their last six games (0-3-3). The Blackhawks have not won since a
5-4 victory at home over Nashville on Oct. 24.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Monday, the eighth attack
in as many days, security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area, some 12 kilometers
(seven miles) north of the market town of Nabatiyeh, the Lebanese
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6 a.m. (0400
GMT) air raid, the second on Sojod in two days.
	   The jets returned 15 minutes later and fired two more missiles
at Jabal al-Rafih, a mountainous area also in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the
officials said.
	   No casualties were reported in that raid.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed Monday's raid. An army
spokesman said the warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in
south Lebanon.
	   Monday's air strike came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas fired
rockets and mortars at Israeli positions in southern Lebanon along
the Israel border with the Jewish state as well as outposts of the
South Lebanon Army militia, which is armed and financed by Israel.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that the attacks were in response
to daily Israeli air raids on South Lebanon for the past week.
	   Israeli warplanes have raided suspected bases of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group mainly in Iqlim al-Tuffah
daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in casualties.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone that
Israel carved out in in 1985 to protect against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

New Zealand leader to express concern over jailed politician
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley will meet with the Malaysian leader Tuesday and express
hope that jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim gets a fair trial, an
official said Monday.
	   ``It's my belief that the best way we can help the Anwar family
is to make it clear to Mahathir that we do feel strongly about the
rights of people to enjoy political freedom and also the right of
people to a fair trial,'' Shipley told reporters.
	   Shipley planned to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, a
spokeswoman for the prime minister said.
	   Shipley, the first woman to attend the APEC leaders' summit, did
not plan to meet with Anwar's wife who is leading the campaign to
have him freed while he stands trial for corruption and sexual
misconduct.
	   Azizah Ismail has sought international criticism for the way her
husband, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, has been treated
since he was arrested and put on trial.
	   Anwar showed up for his arraignment with a black eye and
bruises, injuries he sustained while in jail. A police
investigation into the beating has yet to be concluded.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Azizah
Sunday, calling her husband a ``highly respected leader.''
	   Shipley also planned to meet with leaders from several
APEC-member countries, including South Korea, Canada, Thailand and
Vietnam, said the spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Outgoing finance minister hopes for entry into ASEAN next month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Eager for a resumption of foreign
aid and entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
Cambodia's outgoing finance minister said Monday he hoped a new
government would be rapidly approved by parliament.
	   Speaking outside a conference on ASEAN relations, Keat Chhon
said it was still possible for Cambodia to gain entry into ASEAN
next month when the regional grouping meets in Hanoi, Vietnam.
	   Foreign ministers from ASEAN countries are reportedly
pessimistic that Cambodia's parliament will be able to approve a
government before the meeting, but Keat Chhon predicted one would
be formed by the first week of December.
	   ``Parliament will convene on Nov. 25, so for me I am optimistic,
but we will have to wait and see,'' Keat Chhon said. ``We are
ready, but if they decide otherwise, it's up to them.''
	   Scheduled to join ASEAN along with Laos and Myanmar last year,
Cambodia's acceptance into the group was put on hold after
strongman Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a violent coup d'etat.
	   Parliamentary elections were held in July to choose a new
government, but Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy refused to
recognize Hun Sen's narrow victory, alleging widespread fraud and
intimidation.
	   The two sides remained deadlocked until last week, when King
Norodom Sihanouk brokered a deal that will see Hun Sen appointed
sole prime minister of a coalition government including Ranariddh's
party.
	   Hun Sen's party conceded the presidency of the National Assembly
to Ranariddh in the compromise, despite its majority in parliament.
	   Key to the deal was an agreement to create a new Senate to be
led by ruling party president Chea Sim, the outgoing president of
the National Assembly.
	   Keat Chhon said one of the first tasks of Hun Sen's
administration will be to ask for a meeting of the Consultative
Group for Cambodia, a grouping of foreign governments and major
donor organizations.
	   The Consultative Group provided Cambodia with roughly half of
its annual budget until the coup, which caused most donors to
indefinitely delay any new pledges of aid.
	   The finance minister said he hoped the Consultative Group would
pledge dlrs 500 million for Cambodia's 1999 budget.
	   He also predicted a windfall of new investment in Cambodia,
saying a new government should be able to attract dlrs 500 million
in foreign direct investment next year.

Former PM Keating hits out at rivals over private eye probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former prime minister Paul Keating has
accused political rivals of a ``virulent and despicable'' smear
campaign against him following revelations that they paid for a
private eye to probe his investments.
	   Keating, who was prime minister from 1991 until his election
defeat in 1996, said members of the conservative Liberal party
attacked him with ``rumor-mongering, dirt-peddling and dirty
tricks.''
	   ``Senior members of the parliamentary Liberal Party and its
organizational machine have been complicit in it, and have been
fully aware of its scope,'' Keating said in a statement Monday.
	   ``The campaign has gone well beyond the usual political
roughhouse.''
	   Keating's statement followed reports that the conservatives had
hired a private detective to investigate rumored real estate
investments in the Netherlands in 1994.
	   ``As with every other dimension to this campaign, the
Netherlands investigation was a complete waste of time and money
for the (Liberal Party),'' Keating said. ``There was, and is, no
substance to the rumor they were investigating.''
	   South Australian Liberal Senator Grant Chapman blamed a rogue
former staffer acting on his own for the 1994 incident.
	   But Keating said it ``defied credibility'' for Senator Chapman
to claim that he did not know members of his staff were engaged in
such activity. Keating said he was aware while he was in office
that ``this sort of private investigation was going on.''
	   Liberal party leader and prime minister John Howard said he knew
nothing about the issue until he read about it in the paper Monday.
	   ``I certainly knew nothing about it at the time,'' Howard told
reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting
in Kuala Lumpur. ``It sounded quite bizarre.''

Taiwan to arrange dlrs 300 million in SE Asian loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Taiwan will arrange a dlrs 300
million financial aid package for Southeast Asian countries and has
singled out Malaysia as the first loan recipient, a Malaysian
official said Monday.
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz also said a Taiwanese
company called Southeast Asia Investment Holding Corp. would invest
about dlrs 37 million in crisis-struck countries.
	   Southeast Asia Investment is a venture capital company led by
China Development Corp., which is backed by Taiwan's ruling party.
	   Rafidah didn't provide further details, or say what share of the
aid package Malaysia would receive.
	   The decision was reached after Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad met with Chiang Pin-kung early Monday. Chiang,
chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning and
Development, is Taiwan's representative attending the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   On Sunday, Chiang said a Malaysian request for a dlrs 1 billion
loan could be used as prepayment for oil purchases. Taiwan's China
Petroleum Corp. began discussing such a deal after Malaysia offered
oil in exchange for a loan, Chiang said.
	   Malaysia has been seeking financial help from Taiwan and other
countries to see the country through a liquidity crunch.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stocks, dollar, bond rates, quotes, volume,
advances and retreats &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen Monday
afternoon in Tokyo after the government announced an economic
stimulus package that contained few surprises. Japanese stocks
gained.
	   The dollar was trading at 122.49 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT)
Monday, up 0.81 yen from its level of 121.68 yen late Friday in
Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 122.72 yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 160.06
points, or 1.12 percent, to 14,428.27 points by the close of the
afternoon session at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT). On Friday, the average
closed 193.15 points higher, or 1.37 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar held its strength from Friday's
trading in New York, especially after the government announced a 24
trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) stimulus package.
	   Though the package _ aimed at powering the economy out of its
deepest recession in decades _ is the biggest in Japanese history,
traders said the plan contained few surprises.
	   ``The package was mostly as expected. Initially there was no
impact on the dollar from the release of the package. But since
nothing new was included in the package, there was some
dollar-buying to cover short positions,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo.
	   Also bolstering the dollar was U.S. government data showing
strength in the economy, which may keep the Federal Reserve from
lowering interest rates for a third time this year when its
policy-making committee meets on Tuesday.
	   The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales, which
account for a third of the country's economic activity, rose 1
percent to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 227 billion in October.
	   In stocks trading, markets were mildly disappointed that the
government stimulus package didn't contain much that hadn't already
been leaked to the media in recent days. The Nikkei stock average
hit a high of 14,450.56 points in early trading but eased back
slightly after the announcement.
	   Masaaki Higashida, deputy manager of investment at Nomura
Securities, said the size of the package showed that the government
was making efforts to stimulate the economy, but questioned whether
it would be enough to boost growth significantly next fiscal year
beginning in April.
	   Nevertheless, traders said investors were hesitant to sell
stocks because the government might still unveil further measures
to bolster growth.
	   ``It is still unclear what other measures there will be,'' said
Hideaki Nakagawa, general manager of the stock division at Meiko
Securities. He said the market will remain near current levels for
the time being while investors eye the government's moves.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 11.98, or 1.09 percent, to 1,105.50 points. The
TOPIX closed up 10.59 points, or 0.98 percent, on Friday.
	   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 430 million shares, down from 450 million Friday.
Advances outnumbered retreats 816 to 315, while 136 issues were
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.840 percent from Friday's 0.815 percent, driving its
price down to 108.51 yen from 108.75 yen.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Paceman Jason Gillespie has forced his
way back into Australia's test team for the opening match of the
Ashes series against England after a miserable 15 months of injury
trouble.
	   Gillespie was just establishing himself as a front-line partner
to Glenn McGrath during the Ashes tour of England in mid-1997 when
he broke down. He peaked with 7-37 to bowl Australia to victory in
the Headingley test but was unable to finish the series because of
a stress fracture in his back. He has since been further hit by
groin and ankle injuries but bowled well in England's draw against
South Australia last week.
	   ``It is a vote of confidence for me,'' Gillespie said Monday.
``I didn't think it would happen this soon _ but I'll take it.''
	   Ricky Ponting also expressed surprise after winning back the
contentious No. 6 batting spot from Darren Lehmann, a decision
criticized by former captain Greg Chappell.
	   Lehmann took over on Australia's recent tour of Pakistan because
he is rated a better player of spin bowling, but with England's
attack revolving around seamers, Ponting won a recall.
	   ``I was a little surprised when I found out,'' Ponting said. ``I
thought they would probably go for the same side (from the third
test in Pakistan) but I've been keeping my fingers crossed.
	   ``Over in Pakistan they picked Lehmann because he could handle
the spin better and I had no dramas about that.''
	   Chappell coaches Lehmann at South Australia and admitted he
might be biased.
	   ``He's done all that could be asked of him and he's been
rebuffed,'' Chappell said. Asked if the selectors had made a
mistake, Chappell said, ``In my opinion they have. But that's only
my opinion and I'm probably a bit biased too.''
	   Ponting's superior record at the Gabba venue was another factor
which swung a tight decision his way.
	   ``Darren Lehmann deserves to play test cricket,'' said selector
Allan Border. ``But it was a tough call for us.''
	   Star spinner Shane Warne missed out, as expected, because of his
shoulder injury. Warne is hoping to return in time for the third
test on Dec. 26 but there remains some doubt that he will take any
part in the five-test series.
	   Also back after missing the Pakistan tests is paceman Michael
Kasprowicz, who put his name in front of the selection panel with a
fiery burst in the current four-day match between Queensland and
England in Cairns.
	   Kasprowicz took 6-31 but was unable to send England to the Gabba
as a losing team. Robert Croft and Alan Mullally guided the
tourists to a one-wicket victory, giving them an unbeaten lead-in
to the five-test series.
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor, who made a stunning 334 in
Pakistan, will play his 100th test this week.
	   Team: Mark Taylor (captain), Steve Waugh (vice-captain), Michael
Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Jason
Gillespie, Damien Fleming, Stuart MacGill, Glenn McGrath, Michael
Kasprowicz (12th man to be named).

Atherton to see back specialist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England opener Michael Atherton will
consult a back specialist in Brisbane on Tuesday as he battles to
be fit for the first test against Australia from Friday.
	   Atherton said he hoped anti-inflammatory injections would soothe
stiffness in his back so he could play in Brisbane.
	   The veteran opener has a history of back problems and was hit by
a similar ailment on the 1996-97 tour of Zimbabwe.
	   ``Obviously I haven't been playing at 100 percent in this game
so I'm keen to get it sorted out before the test match,'' Atherton
said after making one in the one-wicket win against Queensland on
Monday.
	   ``Since the end of last year it's been a bit of a problem for
me. I rested it and it was good for the start of this tour.
Normally a couple of injections sorts the problem out and I hope to
have another long period of pain-free cricket.''
	   Atherton is one of only two specialist openers in England's
squad. The other, Mark Butcher, has scored just nine runs in five
innings.
	   Atherton said he did not want to put a percentage figure on his
chances of being fit for the first of five tests.
	   ``I have certainly played before when less than 100 percent fit,
'' Atherton said. ``But you don't want to make a fool of yourself
but equally you want to play if at all possible.''
	   England has called up Graeme Hick to join the Ashes squad in
case Atherton's back pain persists.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's
decision to call off a trip to Malaysia has left the capital's
glitziest hotel with a dilemma: what to do with 89 rooms reserved
for his entourage?
	   The gleaming, five-star Renaissance Hotel wants the U.S.
government to pay up. Washington hopes to skip out on the bill.
	   Barely two years old, the Renaissance drew envious looks from
bigger hotels when it signed a contract to house the entire U.S.
delegation in its 400 deluxe rooms.
	   But now Clinton isn't coming.
	   And the Renaissance is saddled with heaps of uneaten
presidential fare as well as the last-minute cancellations for 89
rooms. Each is worth about 320 ringgit a night, or dlrs 85 under
Malaysia's sharply devalued currency.
	   ``In the contract they signed with us, the U.S. guaranteed that
they'll pay us for all the rooms they booked,'' said an aide in the
office of general manager Robert Frager.
	   The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United
States was now trying to get out of its contract.
	   ``They're trying to negotiate. We're sorting out this issue with
them,'' the aide said.
	   A U.S. official involved in planning Clinton's trip confirmed
the government wants out of the contract.
	   ``We're trying to get rid of all the spare rooms and our folks
are scrambling to negotiate the cancellation fees,'' the official
said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Yeah, I'm sure they laid down a lot of food. But we're still
giving them an incredible amount of business, especially in
November, when the occupancy rate is low. This is a boom time for
them,'' he said.
	   No one was talking about the amount of money involved, possibly
because the hotel can try to minimize its losses by finding new
guests for some or all of the 89 rooms.
	   For the staff at Renaissance Hotel, it's a letdown.
	   ``Naturally, we're disappointed with their last-minute
cancellations,'' said hotel concierge Khairul Anwar.
	   The U.S. president canceled the trip for a Pacific Rim summit
here because of the weapons showdown with Iraq. Instead he sent
Vice President Al Gore, who has brought with him a much
slimmed-down entourage.
	   ``But that's also quite good,'' Khairul added, cheering up a
little. ``That also means we've lots of rooms available for
last-minute guests.''

Loss of bridges complicates Mitch relief

<TEXT>
	   CHOLUTECA, Honduras (AP) _ The graceful arches of the New
Choluteca Bridge stand abandoned, a white concrete sculpture far
from shore, linking nothing to nowhere.
	   A fitting monument to Hurricane Mitch.
	   Mitch turned the usually amiable Choluteca River into a killer.
Its muddy waters roared through this southern city, carrying off
people and houses and wiping out nearly a mile (a kilometer) of
roads leading to the bridge.
	   Today, two weeks after the storm killed 10,000 people in its
rampage through Central America, one of the most urgent tasks
Honduras faces is rebuilding the 94 bridges that were lost.
	   ``Bridges are the top priority for us,'' said Moises Starkman
Pinel, minister for international cooperation. ``We are not asking
for the money. We are asking the different donor countries for
their help in setting up temporary bridges.''
	   Without bridges, the government must rely on planes and
helicopters to get emergency food and medicine to needy areas. It's
costly and inefficient _ and Hondurans know this type of aid can't
last.
	   In the long run, Starkman said, the loss of bridges could worsen
hunger and unemployment, frustrating the efforts of farmers and
businesses to get their good to market.
	   This month, 224 Marines and 200 members of the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers are to arrive at Soto Cano Air Base in the midwestern
province of Comayagua to began building bridges.
	   The quickest and easiest to install is a vintage World War II,
iron-and-plank affair called a Bailey bridge. The United States
plans to send nearly a kilometer (a half-mile) of Bailey bridges,
which could be installed within 12 days. But it is not clear when
they will get here.
	   ``I understand they're driving them down,'' said Army Capt.
Geoff Fischer.
	   For now, the government said only two bridges were being
rebuilt. But no work crews were visible at those sites in
Tegucigalpa and Choluteca.
	   The National Emergency Committee said the bridge at Choluteca
was being repaired by Japanese teams. But no work was being done
during a recent visit, and the Japanese workers who finished the
bridge in May were actually pulling out and heading to the north of
the country.
	   The employees of the Hazama Corporation said they needed to
build a flood-control dam to repair damage done by Hurricane Fifi
in 1974.
	   The Choluteca bridge itself is perfect, the Japanese engineers
said _ except that it now straddles dry land. Mitch changed the
course of the Choluteca River, and there is water where the access
roads used to be.
	   Chunks of asphalt jut from a plain of fine brown silt that once
was river bed. A few black rubber irrigation lines are all that
remain of the former melon plantation. A crushed taxi lies on the
bank where the road washed out.
	   ``Now, there is no solution,'' said Kinoshita Kenichi, a
28-year-old civil engineer from Tokyo. ``It is very difficult to
change the current. (The river) is in a totally different place.''
	   For now, the city depends on the old bridge, a one-lane relic
built by the United States in 1937. Under a blazing sun, long lines
of cars form on either side as drivers wait their turn to cross.
	   About 120 miles (190 kilometers) to the northwest, residents of
Comayagua wait anxiously for someone to repair their link with La
Paz, an important coffee-growing region.
	   Mitch knocked out the 307-foot (95-meter) bridge across the
Umuya River, and the only way to cross is in leaky wooden barges
pulled by ropes.
	   Elmer Roberto Chinchilla, a lawyer, climbed slowly up the sandy
bank, limping from a scorpion bite. Instead of his normal hour-long
commute, it took him three.
	   ``This is too much sacrifice,'' he said. ``We need help from the
Americans or the Japanese, but I think they have forgotten us.''

Bangladesh faces disaster from arsenic in underground water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HATHKOPA, Bangladesh (AP) _ After a tough game of soccer,
panting children cluster around a well and pump up gushes of cool
water, gulping it down greedily.
	   The well pipe is painted red, a warning that its water is
tainted with arsenic. The children, ages 5 to 13, drink anyway.
	   ``My parents have warned me not to drink from this tube well.
But I'm too thirsty,'' says sixth-grader Nazmul Khan.
	   Eight years ago, as part of a two-decade-old project financed by
the World Bank and UNICEF, government engineers sank more than 100
wells in Hathkopa, a village of 2,000 people 30 miles (50
kilometers) east of the capital, Dhaka.
	   For the first time, the people of Hathkopa, who had repeatedly
been sickened by drinking from bacteria-infested ponds, got pure,
tasty water.
	   Then last year, public health surveyors made a stunning
revelation: Most of the millions of wells across Bangladesh are
contaminated by naturally occurring arsenic that is leaching into
underground aquifers. All but 10 of Hathkopa's hand-operated wells
pump up tainted water.
	   Low concentrations of arsenic like that in the water slowly
build up in the body, causing deadly cancers and other illnesses
that may not arise for years.
	   Authorities have no idea of the extent of the health disaster
because of the varying degrees of arsenic contamination, but many
of Bangladesh's 130 million people relied on well water.
	   A six-month study last year by Dhaka Community Hospital, which
specializes in studying arsenic poisoning, estimated that up to 76
million people could be at risk.
	   Adults have stopped drinking from the dangerous wells, although
they still use the water for washing dishes and clothes. Many
people have gone back to collecting water from the village pond,
which they now boil or sterilize with purifying tablets. But
parents find it hard to keep the children away from the poisoned
wells.
	   ``I don't drink water from this well, but my children sometimes
do,'' said Mumtaz Begum, a mother of three sons and two daughters.
	   Bangladeshis are used to disasters that come with a fury:
cyclones roaring in from the turbulent Bay of Bengal, or floods
swamping as much as two-thirds of this country that is mostly a
vast, low-lying river delta. Each year, nature's rage kills
thousands.
	   But this latest affliction crept up slowly, quietly. What people
had welcomed for two decades as a bounty has become a deadly curse.
	   ``Thousands of Bangladeshi villagers have been unwitting victims
of what may be the biggest mass poisoning in history,'' the
Bangladesh office of World Bank said in a report.
	   Conservative estimates suggest at least 100 people have died of
arsenic-related diseases in the past year and 1,000 have become
ill.
	   ``This is just a tip of a huge iceberg. Most deaths from
arsenic-related poisoning is not known because the problem was not
detected until 1993,'' said Dr. Shibtosh Roy, a physician at Dhaka
Community Hospital.
	   Prolonged exposure to arsenic can cause kidney, liver,
intestinal, neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders.
	   The initial symptom is a thickening of the skin, like corns and
calluses on the hands and feet. In more advanced stages, black
patches appear on the skin, a form of cancer known as blackfoot
disease.
	   Early diagnosis is difficult because the warts look like
calluses from farming. It can take 10 to 20 years of prolonged
consumption before a person dies, and the process is reversible
only if the consumption is halted early.
	   Until the arsenic was first discovered in some wells five years
ago, the project that gave Bangladesh 4 million simple wells was
hailed as a major public health success story. It saved tens of
thousands of people who would have died from waterborne diseases
caused by drinking pond water.
	   In its study last year, the Dhaka Community Hospital examined
thousands of wells in 52 of the country's 64 districts. Most of
them were found to contain higher than the permissible level of
arsenic.
	   Under European and U.S. environmental laws, the maximum for
arsenic in drinking water is .05 gram per liter, although the World
Health Organization recently revised that to .1 gram per liter. In
some areas of Bangladesh, well water contains as much as 100 to 900
times higher levels than that.
	   The World Bank and others are now searching for easy and
affordable alternatives to well water. Boiling pond water is one
answer, but most people are too poor to pay for the fuel. Building
systems to collect rain water is another possibility.

Japanese honeymoon couple admit to animal smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A Japanese honeymoon couple was fined
Monday after admitting an attempt to smuggle 13 lizards and three
turtles out of Australia.
	   Shinji Sugimoto, 28, was fined Australian dlrs 16,500 (U.S. dlrs
10,400) and his wife Mikako Segami, 27, was fined Australian dlrs
6,000 (U.S. dlrs 3,750) in Perth Magistrate's Court.
	   They pleaded guilty to four counts of attempting to export
Australian natives, two cruelty to animals charges and nine counts
of capturing a protected species.
	   Prosecutor Stephen Davies told the court if all tourists treated
Australian fauna and flora with a similar disregard, there would be
nothing left to see.
	   ``These offenses are very serious, especially as international
fauna trading is on the increase,'' Davies told the court.
	   Sugimoto and Segami were stopped by customs officials at Perth
airport on Nov. 10. They tried to board a flight for Japan carrying
three oblong turtles, four shingle-back lizards, one thorny
mountain devil and one gecko.
	   Last week customs officials intercepted a package addressed by
Sugimoto and Segami to a corporate address in Japan. Inside were
six bobtail skinks and one Western blue-tongue lizard, packaged in
the same way as those in the couple's luggage.
	   The reptiles would have fetched a total of about $45,000 on
Japan's black market
	   Davies said the animals in Sugimoto's hand luggage were stuffed
in socks then placed in plastic containers which the couple had
wrapped to look like presents.
	   ``Socks were taped against their bodies and the lizards were
curved and compacted to fit into the boxes,'' Davies said.
	   The thorny mountain devil lizard died the day after the animals
were discovered.
	   Sugimoto, a self-described animal-lover, married Segami soon
after they arrived in Brisbane on October 29 and they traveled to
Perth, stopping in Western Australia's goldfields and southwest.
	   The court heard the couple intended to add the reptiles to their
private menagerie, but Davies said the manner of packaging and the
fact that they bought a snake-hook with them from Japan indicated
otherwise.
	   ``These offenses were committed for profit. The number of
animals involved and the relatively large numbers of each species
indicate they were not for addition to Sugimoto's private
collection,'' Davies said.
	   The couple were forced to surrender their passports until their
fines were paid.

U.N. to start long-delayed Jaffna land mine clearing project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A long-delayed land mine clearing
project in the former Tamil Tiger rebel capital of Jaffna will
start soon, the United Nations Development Program said Monday
after resolving a communications problem.
	   Jaffna was captured by Sri Lankan forces in 1995. Thousands of
lands mines were planted, mainly in rice fields, by rebels and
government troops during more than a decade of fighting.
	   Land mines still remain under farms, dirt roads and wild areas
of Jaffna peninsula, situated 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of
the capital Colombo and home to some half a million people. Since
1995, the military has reported more than 100 land mine injuries.
Most of those hurt were civilians walking on deserted roads or
farmers plowing their fields.
	   The UNDP will set up its communication equipment in Jaffna next
week.
	   ``We will first have to test the communication equipment and
only after that we will be in a position to say when the actual
ground work will start,'' said Douglas Higgins of the UNDP in
Colombo. If everything goes on well, mine detecting and destroying
work will start early next year.
	   The project was to have started earlier this year, but the Sri
Lankan defense ministry objected to UNDP plans to use
communications equipment that could have interfered with military
communications. After a series of discussions, the UNDP agreed to
use different equipment to allow workers in the field to contact
headquarters in Jaffna and Colombo.
	   The rebels want a homeland in the north and east of the country
for minority Tamils, who they say are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese, who control the army and the government. The
government denies the charges.
	   Tamils account for 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million
people. They have a distinct language, religion and culture from
that the Sinhalese, who are 76 percent of the population.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed in the 15-year war.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police picked up two opposition
figures at their homes for questioning Monday after President B.J.
Habibie accused opponents of trying to overthrow his 6-month-old
government.
	   So far eight prominent activists, including two retired military
generals, have been interrogated following mob riots and clashes
between student protesters and police and soldiers last week.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed in the
violence.
	   Normality returned to Jakarta Monday. Many shops opened and
rush-hour traffic crawled along the Indonesian capital's main
boulevard, the site of battles Friday night between riot officers
and students demanding swifter democratic change.
	   Last week's unrest was the worst in Jakarta since May, when much
heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat authoritarian
President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   About 300 student protesters gathered Monday at Trisakti
University, where the military fatally shot four activists in May,
triggering the violence that led to Suharto's downfall.
	   Wreathes were laid along the street outside Atma Jaya Catholic
University, where security forces shot and killed students with
plastic bullets last week.
	   In a separate demonstration, about 100 anti-government activists
chanted and sang as they marched through a suburb dotted with the
homes of the city's elite and foreign diplomats.
	   ``We hold Habibie responsible for the shootings of the
students,'' said Sonia Virgen, a 21-year-old business
administration student.
	   In the eastern city of Palu, thousands of anti-government
student protesters occupied the local parliament building, the
official Antara news agency reported. The demonstration was
peaceful.
	   Habibie, a former Suharto protege whose efforts to implement
political reforms lack credibility among students, said the
violence would only jeopardize Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   After Habibie ordered the military to get tough on those trying
to topple him, police this weekend rounded up activists who have
campaigned for a more sweeping overhaul of Suharto's rigid
political system.
	   Among those in custody Monday were former political prisoner and
politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide
to opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Early in the morning, officers detained Haryono, an intellectual
who is active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association,
and Permadi Satrio Wiwoho, an outspoken fortune teller.
	   Another activist, 75-year-old retired Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, was
released late Sunday night after several hours of questioning.
Kemal has campaigned to replace Habibie with a transitional
government led by a presidium of community leaders.
	   His family said he would return to police headquarters later
Monday. So too would Lt. Gen. Ali Sadikan, a former Cabinet
minister, Jakarta governor and longtime government critic.
	   Habibie has indicated he will stick by military chief Gen.
Wiranto despite outrage over the killings of the students by
security forces.
	   The clashes triggered riots by thousands of young men who burned
buildings and cars and attacked police Saturday. Several security
personnel and pro-government civilian guards were also killed.
	   In a meeting with local journalists Sunday, Wiranto expressed
regret for the shootings of the students and promised to take
action against officers involved.
	   Backed by armored personnel carriers and small tanks, Wiranto's
troops ringed the presidential palace and Parliament Monday.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   But the assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era,
did not heed a student demand to ban the military from politics.
Instead, it decided to gradually reduce the role of the armed
forces in Parliament.

U.S. special envoy leaves for North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A high-ranking U.S. diplomat left for
North Korea Monday for difficult talks with its secretive, Marxist
government about a suspected underground nuclear facility.
	   Charles Kartman, special envoy for Korean affairs, will press
North Korea to open the underground construction site to inspection
under terms of a 1994 nuclear accord.
	   North Korea already has objected strenuously to the U.S.
request, calling it unwarranted meddling in its internal affairs.
It says the facility is a civilian, non-nuclear project.
	   Kartman flew to Pyongyang via Japan on a military plane after
spending three days in Seoul coordinating policies with South
Korean officials.
	   Spy satellites have photographed thousands of workers burrowing
into a mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Yongbyon,
the North's main nuclear complex. Some American officials believe
that the new site is being built to develop nuclear weapons.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, North Korea promised to replace
plutonium-producing nuclear reactors with safer light water
reactors financed largely by South Korea and Japan.
	   Last week, a senior Clinton administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States is ready to drop the
agreement if the North Koreans don't permit inspections.
	   He said collapse of the agreement could affect a series of
diplomatic initiatives with North Korea, including an effort to
negotiate a peace treaty on the peninsula and U.S.-North Korean
talks on curbing Pyongyang's export of missiles and missile
technology.

Two soldiers in Russian Far East hang selves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two soldiers in Russia's Far East have died in
apparent suicides, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   The soldiers, aged 18 and 21, hanged themselves over the weekend
in Birobidzhan, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the report said,
citing local investigators.
	   However, the local military prosecutor told ITAR-Tass that
police have not excluded the possibility that the two soldiers were
murdered.
	   Birobidzhan is about 4,700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   The suicide rate is high in Russia's armed forces, where for
many the conditions are miserable and food is scarce. Younger
conscripts are often subject to brutal hazing by officers and older
soldiers.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by their
fellow servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.

Japanese honeymoon couple admit to animal smuggling

	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A Japanese honeymoon couple was fined
Monday after admitting an attempt to smuggle 13 lizards and three
turtles out of Australia.
	   Shinji Sugimoto, 28, was fined 16,500 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 10,400) and his wife Mikako Segami, 27, was fined 6,000
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,750) in Perth Magistrate's Court.

Gore arrives for APEC summit set back by weak tariff deal

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As Pacific Rim leaders arrived in
Kuala Lumpur on Monday for their annual economic summit, two
unrelated issues kept surfacing: human rights in Malaysia and the
absence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Soon after Vice President Al Gore arrived in place of Clinton,
the leader of Singapore suggested that the charisma quotient of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum had just fallen.
	   ``Obviously, when we sit down we are all equal,'' Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong of Singapore told reporters. ``It is the quality of
ideas which counts.''
	   But Goh also said that Clinton had probably reduced the amount
of coverage the APEC summit would get by sending Gore in his place.
``Of course, some leaders are more charismatic, and the press is
more interested in them,'' Goh said.
	   Clinton, the leader of the world's largest economy and its only
superpower, canceled his trip over the weekend while considering a
military attack on Iraq to punish it for once again expelling U.N.
weapons inspectors from the country.
	   Malaysia, the host of the APEC forum, also took at swipe at the
United States, depicting Clinton as Rambo in a cartoon in the
government-backed New Straits Times newspaper on Monday.
	   At the bottom of the cartoon, one small snake said to another,
``Clinton is threatening war on Iraq!'' The other replied: ``An
excuse not to attend the APEC summit.''
	   Like other top APEC officials, Gore spent the day conducting
bilateral meetings with other leaders, ahead of the APEC summit
that will bring them all together on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In his meeting with China's leader, Jiang Zemin, the two
discussed Tibet, Taiwan and China's efforts to join the 124-member
World Trade Organization, a Chinese official said.
	   Without providing any details, Zhu Bangzao, the Chinese Foreign
Minister spokesman, said Gore and Jiang had not changed their
longstanding positions on these subjects.
	   During lower-level APEC meetings over the weekend, protesters
held two demonstrations demanding the resignation of Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. During one, police opened fire
with guns in the air. During the other, authorities doused the
protesters with yellow-dyed water fired from cannons. On Monday,
protesters threatened to demonstrate at the auditorium where Gore
was to deliver Clinton's speech.
	   The protests were held in support of Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy
prime minister who was fired, arrested and then placed on trial
after launching an anti-Mahathir reform movement.
	   Over the weekend, the foreign ministers of Canada and the United
States angered the Malaysian government by meeting with Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, and expressing concern over the fairness of
Anwar's trial on corruption and sex charges.
	   For the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human
rights concerns were being discussed by the leaders, whose goal is
to promote free trade in the region.
	   During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard also discussed the treatment of Anwar, whose
trial was in recess during the APEC meetings.
	   ``I expressed the concern that was felt in Australia about the
issue and we had a lengthy discussion about it,'' Howard said.
	   Anwar claims the charges against him were trumped up by the
government and that he was badly beaten after being arrested.
Howard said he told Mahathir that he hopes the judiciary will
remain completely open and independent during the trial.
	   Howard declined to say how Mahathir responded.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Mahathir because of his standoff with Anwar.
	   On Monday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
intends to meet with Mahathir on Tuesday, using it to express
concern over Anwar getting a fair trial.
	   ``It's my belief that the best way we can help the Anwar family
is to make it clear to Mahathir that we do feel strongly about the
rights of people to enjoy political freedom and also the right of
people to a fair trial,'' Shipley told reporters.
	   Shipley, the first woman leader to attend an APEC summit, said
she did not plan to meet with Anwar's wife.
	   The presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines are both friends
of Anwar, so people will be watching closely to see whether they
meet Azizah and join Gore in snubbing Mahathir.
	   On Sunday, the APEC nations failed to achieve a landmark
agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global
trade, but did manage to keep the effort from totally collapsing.
	   The fight now goes to the 124-nation World Trade Organization,
where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff Japanese resistance
to cutting tariffs in two sectors it considers politically
sensitive _ wood and fish products.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the APEC leaders will meet in Kuala
Lumpur to endorse the work done on the trade initiative, plus
review an action plan being put together to deal with reforms
intended to halt the current financial turmoil and prevent it from
occurring in the future.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's
decision to call off a trip to Malaysia has left the capital's
glitziest hotel with a dilemma: what to do with 89 rooms reserved
for his entourage?
	   The gleaming, five-star Renaissance Hotel wants the U.S.
government to pay up. Washington hopes to skip out on the bill.
	   Barely two years old, the Renaissance drew envious looks from
bigger hotels when it signed a contract to house the entire U.S.
delegation in its 400 deluxe rooms.
	   But now Clinton isn't coming.
	   And the Renaissance is saddled with heaps of uneaten
presidential fare as well as the last-minute cancellations for 89
rooms. Each is worth about 320 ringgit a night, or dlrs 85 under
Malaysia's sharply devalued currency.
	   ``In the contract they signed with us, the U.S. guaranteed that
they'll pay us for all the rooms they booked,'' said an aide in the
office of general manager Robert Frager.
	   The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United
States was now trying to get out of its contract.
	   ``They're trying to negotiate. We're sorting out this issue with
them,'' the aide said.
	   A U.S. official involved in planning Clinton's trip confirmed
the government wants out of the contract.
	   ``We're trying to get rid of all the spare rooms and our folks
are scrambling to negotiate the cancellation fees,'' the official
said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Yeah, I'm sure they laid down a lot of food. But we're still
giving them an incredible amount of business, especially in
November, when the occupancy rate is low. This is a boom time for
them,'' he said.
	   No one was talking about the amount of money involved, possibly
because the hotel can try to minimize its losses by finding new
guests for some or all of the 89 rooms.
	   For the staff at Renaissance Hotel, it's a letdown.
	   ``Naturally, we're disappointed with their last-minute
cancellations,'' said hotel concierge Khairul Anwar.
	   The U.S. president canceled the trip for a Pacific Rim summit
here because of the weapons showdown with Iraq. Instead he sent
Vice President Al Gore, who has brought with him a much
slimmed-down entourage.
	   ``But that's also quite good,'' Khairul added, cheering up a
little. ``That also means we've lots of rooms available for
last-minute guests.''

Planes carrying Russians from Baghdad arrive in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two planes carrying Russian women and children
evacuated from Baghdad arrived at an airport outside Moscow early
Monday morning, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   More than 100 people, most of them relatives of Russians working
in the Iraqi capital, had been taken overland to Kermanshah, Iran
on Sunday. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry sent two
planes to retrieve them.
	   The decision to evacuate the Russians was made ``in a rather
tense psychological situation,'' before the West, led by the United
States, backed down from its threat to carry out attacks on Iraq,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Sunday.
	   One Ukrainian citizen was also on board the plane, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein reversed his decision to halt the
United Nations' monitoring of weapons sites on Sunday. U.S.
President Bill Clinton had already given the go-ahead to launch
strikes.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment by Japanese official, grafs 10-11 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister, on his way to a major
regional economic conference, unveiled the largest stimulus package
in the country's history Monday and promised it will turn the
recession-bound economy around by next year.
	   But analysts said the 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) in new
public spending and tax cuts will offer only temporary relief.
	   The package is aimed at stopping the economy from contracting
for a third consecutive year _ a pledge Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
made after taking office in July.
	   ``With this plan, our country can free itself from its current
severe situation,'' Obuchi told reporters before flying to Malaysia
for a summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
	   Obuchi, who has been under intense international pressure to do
more to ease Asia's economic woes, said the spending package also
contains 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8 billion) in aid for the region.
	   The package surpasses the record 17 trillion yen (dlrs 139
billion) the government released last April and brings the total
amount Tokyo has spent on stimulus since 1992 to 100 trillion yen
(dlrs 820 billion).
	   Previous spending accomplished little more than keeping Japan's
economy afloat and failed to end a stubborn downturn triggered by
the collapse of land and stock prices in the early 1990s.
	   Economists said the results of the new package will likely be
more of the same, restoring the economy to anemic growth without
addressing the inefficiencies at the root of the problem.
	   ``I'm not sure if they've put in place the mechanism'' for
economic recovery, said Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson (Asia). He said the economy could expand by 1
percent next year with the package.
	   Japanese officials said this package differs from previous ones
because it follows a 60 trillion yen (dlrs 490 billion) bill last
month to help the nation's banks write off massive bad loans and
clean up the financial system.
	   ``By taking such bold and large-scale measures, I'm sure the
Japanese financial system will recover,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, head
of the Economic Planning Agency.
	   One thing's for sure: Japan can use a shot in the arm.
	   The economy has sunk into its longest recession since the
government started keeping records after World War II. It shrank
last fiscal year for the first time in more than two decades, and
official forecasters say things will only get worse. Unemployment
and bankruptcy debts are stuck at record highs.
	   Obuchi said the package would include more than 17.9 trillion
yen (dlrs 147 billion) in spending, most of it on public works and
steps to help smaller companies ride out a severe credit crunch as
Japan's banks dispose of their massive bad loans.
	   Tax cuts worth about 6 trillion yen (dlrs 49 billion) will bring
Japanese income and corporate tax rates in line with those in major
Western economies, Obuchi said.
	   Another feature of the package is an innovative plan to entice
consumers to spend more by distributing 700 billion yen (dlrs 5.7
billion) in shopping vouchers.
	   The plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special
session of Parliament.
	   Obuchi, however, said the plan did not include a reduction of
the 5 percent national sales tax, as investors and opposition
politicians have been calling for.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the consumption tax
from 3 percent was widely blamed for choking off a growth spurt and
tipping the economy back into recession.
	   Obuchi said the tax revenue was needed because of Japan's
mounting budget deficit.
	   ``Judging from the current fiscal situation, it's difficult to
comply with that,'' he said.

New vehicle sales rise in Thailand, but analyst cautious
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's new vehicle sales in October
rose 0.2 percent to 12,805, but analysts cautioned against seeing
the improvement as a sign of economic recovery.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. released the monthly sales figures Monday and
noted they represented a 23.2 percent jump from September. On a
year-on-year basis, however, Toyota said sales in the first 10
months of 1998 were down 66.3 percent to 112,808 vehicles.
	   Toyota said the boost in October was due to an increase in
commercial vehicle and one-ton truck sales, while passenger car
sales continued to decline.
	   Michael Dunne, analyst for Automotive Resources Asia Ltd., said
the increased October total vehicle sales were promising but warned
against interpreting the figures as a sign of economic improvement.
	   ``It's a welcome sign but it's too early to call it a trend,''
Dunne told Dow Jones Newswires. ``People are only going to start
buying cars again when there is confidence the economic upswing is
in place.''
	   Dunne said passenger car sales were a better indicator of
economic recovery because people only buy these luxury items in
times of economic prosperity.
	   Thailand's economy is expected to contract by 8 percent this
year, before recovering sometime next year, government officials
hope.
	   Part of the reason for the pickup in truck sales was Toyota's
aggressive marketing of its new Hilux Tiger truck, amid tough
competition with Isuzu and Mitsubishi, Dunne said.

Australian, Malaysian leaders discuss jailed dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard raised concerns with his Malaysian counterpart Monday about
the treatment of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``I expressed the concern that was felt in Australia about the
issue and we had a lengthy discussion about it,'' Howard said after
meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Howard said the conduct of Anwar's trial, currently under way,
would influence the country's international reputation.
	   ``I hope that there will be a completely transparent and
independent judicial hearing of the issue,'' he said.
	   Howard arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for meetings this week of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
in September after Mahathir said he was morally unfit to take over
the leadership of the country. Anwar is standing trial for
corruption and sexual misconduct charges which he vehemently
denies.
	   Howard declined to say how Mahathir responded to his comments,
but described the conversation as ``frank and courteous.''
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters that
Mahathir had given a complete explanation of Anwar's arrest and
trial.
	   ``We have explained it fully,'' she said.
	   Asked if the two sides had agreed on the explanation, she
replied: ``This is something (on which) you don't need to reach an
agreement.''
	   Rafidah also said Australia planned to announce an economic
assistance package for troubled Asian nations during the 21-member
APEC summit.
	   Howard had been criticized back home for going ahead with plans
to meet with Mahathir despite Anwar's arrest and alleged beatings
he received from police.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien both canceled bilateral talks with Mahathir.

Moscow mayor forming his own political movement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a potential
presidential candidate in 2000, said he has begun forming his own
political movement, a news report said Monday.
	   Luzhkov has repeatedly called for a social-democratic party,
similar to those led by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
	   In an interview on the influential Itogi television program on
Sunday, Luzhkov said he had started forming a movement that will be
called Fatherland.
	   Luzhkov said the movement would advocate free-market principles
and preserve a strong state sector in the economy, drawing
``everything logical from the left and right,'' according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Still, the movement will have ``no radicalism _ not right, not
left,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Luzhkov maintained his non-committal attitude about running for
the presidency in 2000. He said he would join the race if there
were ``figures dangerous for the country's future'' among the
candidates.
	   Luzhkov is popular in Moscow, and has strong ratings in opinion
polls. However, it is unclear how strong a popular following he has
in Russia's outlying regions, where many resent the capital's
relative prosperity.
	   Others expected to run in 2000 are Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, a former general
who is now governor of a vast region in Siberia.

Singapore's PM has low expectations for APEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said Monday he doesn't expect a summit of Pacific Rim leaders
to produce any dramatic new initiatives.
	   Goh was speaking to reporters before the summit Tuesday and
Wednesday of leaders from the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group.
	   Goh said some previously announced initiatives -- such as
Japan's dlrs 30 billion aid package for the region -- would
probably be discussed. ``Beyond that, I don't expect anything big
at this stage.''
	   On Sunday, APEC ministers failed to agree on a nine-industry
trade package for the region, and referred the debate to the World
Trade Organization.
	   Goh also said he would discuss Malaysia's plans to borrow funds
through Singapore and his city-state's hopes to arrange a
water-supply agreement with Malaysia.
	   ``There's a convergence of views now,'' on those issues, he
said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police picked up two opposition
figures at their homes for questioning Monday after President B.J.
Habibie accused opponents of trying to overthrow his 6-month-old
government.
	   So far eight prominent activists, including two retired military
generals, have been interrogated following mob riots and clashes
between student protesters and police and soldiers last week.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed in the
violence.
	   A human rights group accused Habibie's government of trying to
make the activists into scapegoats as condemnation mounted over the
student deaths.
	   Last week's unrest was the worst in Jakarta since May, when much
heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat authoritarian
President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   Normality returned to much of Jakarta Monday. Many shops opened
and rush-hour traffic crawled along the Indonesian capital's main
boulevard, the site of battles Friday night between riot officers
and students demanding swifter democratic change.
	   However, there were some small protests
	   About 300 student protesters gathered Monday at Trisakti
University, where the military fatally shot four activists in May,
triggering the violence that led to Suharto's downfall.
	   More than 200 Islamic students staged a peaceful protest in East
Jakarta, demanding military commander Gen. Wiranto's resignation
and a full inquiry into the shootings.
	   Wreathes were laid along the street outside Atma Jaya Catholic
University, where security forces shot and killed students with
plastic bullets last week.
	   In a separate demonstration, about 100 anti-government activists
chanted and sang as they marched through a suburb dotted with the
homes of the city's elite and foreign diplomats.
	   ``We hold Habibie responsible for the shootings of the
students,'' said Sonia Virgen, a 21-year-old business
administration student.
	   Another 50 protesters said they would try to march to Suharto's
home.
	   ``Suharto is the root of all of Indonesia's problems,'' said
Hendrik Siriat, a 25-year-old political science student.
	   In the eastern city of Palu, thousands of anti-government
student protesters occupied the local parliament building, the
official Antara news agency reported. The demonstration was
peaceful.
	   Habibie, a former Suharto protege whose efforts to implement
political reforms lack credibility among students, said the
violence would only jeopardize Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   After Habibie ordered the military to get tough on those trying
to topple him, police this weekend rounded up activists who have
campaigned for a more sweeping overhaul of Suharto's rigid
political system.
	   Among those in custody Monday were former political prisoner and
politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide
to opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Early in the morning, officers detained Haryono, an intellectual
who is active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association,
and Permadi Satrio Wiwoho, an outspoken fortune teller.
	   Another activist, 75-year-old retired Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, was
released late Sunday night after several hours of questioning.
Kemal has campaigned to replace Habibie with a transitional
government led by a presidium of community leaders.
	   His family said he would return to police headquarters later
Monday. So too would Lt. Gen. Ali Sadikan, a former Cabinet
minister, Jakarta governor and longtime government critic.
	   Indonesian Legal Aid Institute secretary Munir said police had
not laid charges against the questioned activists. He described
their interrogation as ``intimidation'' and an attempt to pin the
blame for the deaths on opposition groups by suggesting they
incited students to fight with security forces.
	   ``The government needs scapegoats for this situation,'' Munir
said.
	   Habibie has indicated he will stick by Wiranto despite outrage
over the killings.
	   The clashes triggered riots by thousands of young men who burned
buildings and cars and attacked police Saturday. Several security
personnel and pro-government civilian guards were also killed.
	   In a meeting with local journalists Sunday, Wiranto expressed
regret for the shootings of the students and promised to take
action against officers involved.
	   Backed by armored personnel carriers and small tanks, Wiranto's
troops ringed the presidential palace and Parliament Monday.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   But the assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era,
did not heed a student demand to ban the military from politics.
Instead, it decided to gradually reduce the role of the armed
forces in Parliament.

U.N. aid workers returning, arms inspectors to test Iraq's pledges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 140 U.N. relief workers evacuated to
Jordan in fear of U.S. missile strikes were heading back to Baghdad
on Monday, and the arms inspectors at the crux of the crisis were
ready to test Baghdad's pledge to cooperate.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission
which oversees weapons inspections, said UNSCOM teams would return
to the Iraqi capital from Bahrain on Tuesday to resume their search
for Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   ``We will get up and running as soon as we reach Baghdad,'' Ms.
Cross told reporters in the Bahraini capital Manama.
	   She said the inspectors hoped for full cooperation as pledged in
an Iraqi letter Saturday that ended the confrontation just before
the United States and Britain were to strike Iraq to force renewed
cooperation with the arms inspections.
	   ``It is the inspectors' job to go there and destroy weapons.
They will be the first to know if the cooperation is full and
unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said in Bahrain.
	   Before the latest crisis, UNSCOM had more than 100 inspectors on
the ground to handle spot checks and long-term monitoring of Iraq's
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   In addition, visiting UNSCOM teams _ as well as inspectors from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency _ came
and went for special inspections.
	   The United Nations ordered all inspectors and most relief
workers out of Baghdad last week as the United States and Britain
built up their forces in the Gulf.
	   The relief workers coordinate the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities to oil to buy
need food and medicine. The food is distributed in monthly rations
to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   The two countries had threatened a military strike if Iraq did
not reverse decisions made in August and October to limit the
inspectors' work.
	   Iraq relented on Saturday, and U.S. President Bill Clinton
accepted the deal Sunday but warned that the threat of force
remained.
	   ``Iraq has backed down,'' Clinton declared in a news conference
at the White House. ``But that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up
to its obligations.''
	   He said U.S. forces would stay in the Gulf and added: ``We
remain ready to act.''
	   The U.N. Security Council on Sunday acknowledged Iraq's pledge
in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan allowing the
inspections to resume.
	   But the council warned in a statement: ``Taking note of past
experience with Iraq, council members underlined that their
confidence in Iraq's intentions needs to be established by
unconditional and sustained cooperation with the Special Commission
and the IAEA in the full range of their activities.''
	   Editorials in Iraq's state-run newspapers on Monday echoed the
remarks late Sunday by Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, who said
Iraq had won a victory in the latest dispute.
	   Iraq, Ramadan said, had been able ``to prove to the whole world
that our views are correct'' and that the Americans were misguided.
	   Al-Jumhuriya, an Arabic daily, emphasized that Iraq's goal had
been to world draw attention to the country's plight under U.N.
sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit oil sales and
prohibit most trade dealings _ devastating Iraq's once-wealthy
economy. The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be
lifted before U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The Security Council has before it a new chance to accomplish
justice by lifting sanctions from the Iraqi people and ending their
suffering,'' Al-Jumhuriya said.
	   It urged the council ``not to be the slave of evil power _
Clinton and his colonial administration.'' Iraq long has accused
U.N. inspectors of working on behalf of the Americans to prolong
the sanctions.
	   Babil, which is published by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein' son
Odai, said ``Iraq has taken its decision so the Clinton
administration will not have an excuse to attack Iraq.''

Japanese stocks gain on hopes of more stimulus measures

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rose moderately Monday on hopes the
government's new economic recovery package will be followed with
more stimulus measures. The U.S. dollar gained against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 160.06
points, or 1.12 percent, closing at 14,428.27. On Friday, it had
gained 193.15 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The dollar was trading at 122.14 yen in late afternoon, up 0.46
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of
122.72 yen. It ranged between 121.65 yen and 122.70 yen in Monday's
trading.
	   The Japanese government on Monday announced a 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 196 billion) spending and tax cut plan intended to jog the
economy out of its deepest recession in decades.
	   Markets were mildly disappointed that the package didn't contain
much that hadn't already been expected. The Nikkei stock average
hit a high of 14,450.56 in early trading but eased back slightly
after the announcement.
	   Masaaki Higashida, deputy manager of investment at Nomura
Securities, said the size of the package showed that the government
was making efforts to stimulate the economy, but questioned whether
it would be enough to boost growth significantly next fiscal year
beginning in April.
	   Nevertheless, traders said investors were hesitant to sell
stocks because the government might still unveil further measures
to bolster growth.
	   ``It is still unclear what other measures there will be,'' said
Hideaki Nakagawa, general manager of the stock division at Meiko
Securities. He said the market will remain near current levels for
the time being while investors watch the government's moves.
	   One major hope is that the government will reduce the 5 percent
consumption tax. The levee was raised from 3 percent last year _ a
move widely blamed for helping to sour the economy.
	   ``Everybody is still hopeful that there will be more out, and
part of it will be a sales tax cut,'' said Louis Tseng, head of
derivatives trading at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 11.98, or 1.09 percent, to 1,105.50 points. It had
gained 10.59 points, or 0.98 percent, Friday.
	   Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
estimated at 430 million shares, down from 450 million Friday.
Advances outnumbered retreats 816 to 315, while 136 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar held its strength from Friday
in New York, especially after traders saw the stimulus package
contained little more than what had been expected since last week.
	   ``Since nothing new was included in the package, there was some
dollar-buying to cover short positions,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo.
	   Also bolstering the dollar were new U.S. government data showing
strength in the economy, which may keep the Federal Reserve from
lowering interest rates for a third time this year when its
policy-making committee meets Tuesday.
	   The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales, which
account for a third of the country's economic activity, rose 1
percent to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 227 billion in October.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.850 percent from Friday's 0.815 percent, driving its
price down to 108.41 yen from 108.75 yen.

U.N. aid workers returning, arms inspectors to test Iraq's pledges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 140 U.N. relief workers who had been
evacuated to Jordan in fear of U.S. missile strikes were heading
back to Baghdad on Monday, and the arms inspectors at the crux of
the crisis were ready to test Baghdad's pledge to cooperate.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission
which oversees weapons inspections, said UNSCOM teams would return
to the Iraqi capital from Bahrain on Tuesday to resume their search
for Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   ``We will get up and running as soon as we reach Baghdad,'' Ms.
Cross told reporters in the Bahraini capital Manama.
	   She said the inspectors hoped for full cooperation as pledged in
an Iraqi letter on Saturday that ended the confrontation just
before the United States and Britain were to strike Iraq to force
renewed cooperation with the arms inspections.
	   ``It is the inspectors' job to go there and destroy weapons.
They will be the first to know if the cooperation is full and
unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said in Bahrain.
	   Before the latest crisis, UNSCOM had more than 100 inspectors on
the ground to handle spot checks and long-term monitoring of Iraq's
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   In addition, visiting UNSCOM teams _ as well as inspectors from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency _ came
and went for special inspections.
	   The United Nations ordered all inspectors and most relief
workers out of Baghdad last week as the United States and Britain
built up their forces in the Gulf.
	   The relief workers coordinate the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities to oil to buy
need food and medicine. The food is distributed in monthly rations
to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   The two countries had threatened a military strike if Iraq did
not reverse decisions made in August and October to limit the
inspectors' work.
	   Iraq relented on Saturday, and U.S. President Bill Clinton
accepted the deal Sunday but warned that the threat of force
remained.
	   ``Iraq has backed down,'' Clinton declared in a news conference
at the White House. ``But that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up
to its obligations.''
	   He said U.S. forces would stay in the Gulf and added: ``We
remain ready to act.''
	   The U.N. Security Council on Sunday acknowledged Iraq's pledge
in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan allowing the
inspections to resume.
	   But the council warned in a statement: ``Taking note of past
experience with Iraq, council members underlined that their
confidence in Iraq's intentions needs to be established by
unconditional and sustained cooperation with the Special Commission
and the IAEA in the full range of their activities.''
	   Editorials in Iraq's state-run newspapers on Monday echoed the
remarks late Sunday by Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, who said
Iraq had won a victory in the latest dispute.
	   Iraq, Ramadan said, had been able ``to prove to the whole world
that our views are correct'' and that the Americans were misguided.
	   Al-Jumhuriya, an Arabic daily, emphasized that Iraq's goal had
been to world draw attention to the country's plight under U.N.
sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit oil sales and
prohibit most trade dealings _ devastating Iraq's once-wealthy
economy. The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be
lifted before U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The Security Council has before it a new chance to accomplish
justice by lifting sanctions from the Iraqi people and ending their
suffering,'' Al-Jumhuriya said.
	   It urged the council ``not to be the slave of evil power _
Clinton and his colonial administration.'' Iraq long has accused
U.N. inspectors of working on behalf of the Americans to prolong
the sanctions.
	   Babil, which is published by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son
Odai, said ``Iraq has taken its decision so the Clinton
administration will not have an excuse to attack Iraq.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Three rockets fired by the
northern-based opposition forces landed close to Kabul aiport on
Monday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties,
witnesses said.
	   All the rocket landed near the combined military and civilian
airport and the Taliban sealed off the area soon after the attack,
the second in as many days.
	   This was the second rocket attack on Kabul since a cease fire
between the Afghan warring factions ended last week.
	   In recent days there has been fierce fighting between the
Taliban fighters and the opposition forces loyal to Ahmed Shah
Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami fighters in northern Takhar and Baghlan
provinces.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are
mostly Pashtun _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan. The
Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of the country, including the
capital.
	   The opposition comprise mainly of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.

Public services slashed in new Papua New Guinea budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The government on Monday
announced a ``back to basics'' 1999 budget that slashed the size of
Papua New Guinea's public service but promised better services in
neglected rural areas.
	   Up to 7,000 of the country's 65,000 public servants will be axed
and 15 statutory authorities, agencies and committees abolished.
	   The public service retrenchments, which will cost 120 million
kina (U.S. dlrs 59 million) over three years, are expected to save
the government 96 million kina (U.S. dlrs 47 million) in 1999.
	   ``The 1999 budget is a revolutionary budget,'' Treasurer Iairo
Lasaro said in his speech to Parliament. ``It is about a leaner but
more efficient government.''
	   Lasaro said citizens were ``fed up'' with the ever-growing
government and bureaucracy and were frustrated with the lack of
basic infrastructure, education and health services in many parts
of the country.
	   ``Furthermore, an alarming level of corruption among public
officials and rising law and order problems had created such a
heavy tension which could have triggered civil unrest,'' Lasaro
said.

Philippines president ignores discussion of Anwar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Philippines President Joseph
Estrada met with his Malaysian counterpart Monday, but did not
bring up the plight of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said that while
other foreign officials had found it necessary to bring up the
Anwar case during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit,
``we don't.''
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific Rim countries and Hong Kong were
arriving in the Malaysian capital Monday, ahead of the formal trade
summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The case of Anwar -- ousted as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, then jailed and beaten up by police -- has dominated the
summit sidelines.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, on Sunday night. On Saturday, two top Canadian
officials at the APEC forum also met with Azizah.
	   Estrada was the first foreign leader to publicly criticize the
jailing of Anwar, whom he considers a friend. He even considered
boycotting the formal APEC summit Tuesday and Wednesday, but later
changed his mind.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his ouster set off
massive anti-government protests. He has pleaded innocent to 10
charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Siazon said the trial appeared to be going well.
	   ``There is transparency,'' he said. ``So far so good.''
	   Five Filipino congressmen, concerned about Anwar's human rights
and prison conditions, attended the first week of the trial along
with dozens of other foreign observers.

French foreign minister differs from US on force against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Diverging from U.S. policy toward Iraq on two key
points, France's foreign minister said Monday that only the U.N.
Security Council can decide whether to use force, and that France
doesn't believe in interfering in Iraq's internal affairs.
	   France has ``a very clear principled position: it is the council
that determines the use of force,'' Hubert Vedrine said on Europe-1
radio.
	   Vedrine was responding to comments by U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger that a future strike against Iraq would not
need prior Security Council approval.
	   Although calling President Bill Clinton's actions over the
weekend ``wise,'' Vedrine took issue with Clinton's stated goal of
helping the Iraqi opposition overthrow Saddam Hussein.
	   ``France does not have the political or diplomatic tradition of
doing what the United States, by virtue of a right that it has
given itself, considers itself able to say and do,'' Vedrine said.
	   But he added that he hopes Iraq ``will get out of this tunnel.''
	   Vedrine emphasized that France always has the right to set a
different course from its ally across the Atlantic.
	   ``France is a friend of the United States, and they (the
Americans) know that we will never be tied automatically or
mechanically,'' Vedrine said.

Suspect in dramatic German kidnap case escapes from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Police were searching Monday for an
escaped prisoner who had been awaiting trial in the dramatic
kidnapping of a young man left to die in a pit in the woods.
	   Sergei Serov, 38, disappeared from the jail in Potsdam, just
south of Berlin, sometime between late Saturday and midday Sunday,
police said. He was considered to be very dangerous.
	   Serov and fellow Russian Vyacheslav Orlov were to go on trial
early next year on charges of kidnapping leading to death.
Authorities said the two had made partial confessions in the case
of Matthias Hintze, a 20-year-old kidnapped Sept. 14, 1997 and
buried in a pit, where he slowly suffocated.
	   His body was found Oct. 8, 1997, a day after the two Russians
were arrested while trying to pick up the 1 million mark (dlrs
625,000) ransom.
	   Last week, Berlin prosecutors filed kidnapping charges against
the two in the case of a Berlin-based Russian businessman,
Alexander Galius, who disappeared in June 1997. One million marks
was demanded in that case as well.
	   Galius was never found and police suspect he died in an
underground shaft like Hintze.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade jumped more than
70 percent in September from a year earlier, the government
announced Monday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.93 trillion yen (dlrs 15.8 billion) in September, up 70.4
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise marked the 18th consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, has announced sweeping administrative reforms that
will close provincial-level branches and shift their management to
nine regional branches, the official China Securities News
reported.
	   The reforms will strengthen financial supervision and improve
the central bank's ability to quickly adjust monetary policy, the
report quoted Vice Premier Wen Jiabao as saying.
	   The central bank headquarters in Beijing will regulate municipal
and provincial branches, the report said.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's recession pushed 1,707 corporations into
bankruptcy in October, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier,
a private credit research agency said Monday.
	   It was the 17th month in a row that the number of bankruptcies
increased. Debt left behind swelled 55 percent in October from the
same month last year to 739.27 billion yen (dlrs 6.06 billion).
	   Bankruptcies rose in sectors including construction,
manufacturing, transportation, communications and real estate, said
the agency, Teikoku Databank Ltd.
	   Sluggish exports and domestic sales, falls in goods prices,
reduced output, inventory buildups and damage to balance sheets
from the stock market's drop are creating ``a vicious circle of
deflation,'' the agency said.
	   Although the government legislated a 60 trillion yen (dlrs 492
billion) scheme to stabilize the financial system in October, banks
are expected to remain reluctant to support weak companies, meaning
bankruptcies may continue at high levels, Teikoku added.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea said Monday it was
delaying international bidding for the sales of Korea First Bank
and Seoulbank to Jan. 31, 1999, from the original deadline of Nov.
15, 1998.
	   In an updated memorandum on South Korea's economic program after
the International Monetary Fund's fourth quarterly review of the
country's financial reform program last month, the Ministry of
Finance and Economy said it and the IMF agreed to receive bids from
strategic (foreign) investors with sufficient capital and expertise
to manage the two banks.
	   A ministry said the two sides agreed to delay the deadline as
the ministry ``just needs more time'' to sell the two banks to
foreign investors.
	   In January, the Korean government recapitalized the two banks
and holds a 93.8 percent stake in each. Also, the ministry, in a
bid to sweeten sales terms, said later it would spend as much as
7.8 trillion won (dlrs 5.87 billion) to buy up to 80 percent of bad
loans that may appear from the two banks in the future.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's inflation rate, as
measured by the official consumer price index, rose 5.2 percent
year-on-year in October, down from September's 5.5 percent and
August's 5.6 percent increases, the state news agency Bernama
reported Monday.
	   October was the second month of Malaysia's new capital-control
regime, crafted to curb flows of speculative funds. The central
bank also fixed the value of the ringgit at 3.80 ringgit to the
dollar.
	   For the first 10 months of the year, the consumer price index
rose 5.2 percent year-on-year as well, Bernama reported, citing the
government's Statistics Department.
	   ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's new vehicle sales in October
were up 0.2 percent to 12,805, according to figures released by
Toyota Motor Corp. Monday.
	   October sales represented a 23.2 percent jump from sales in
September. September sales had been up 6.2 percent from the
previous month.
	   Toyota said in a statement that in the first 10 months of this
year, new vehicle sales were down 66.3 percent from a year earlier
to 112,808 vehicles.

Hong Kong share prices surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Monday, with
the key index rising 3 percent on expectations of cuts in interest
rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 300.10 points, closing at
10,298.09, its highest level since Nov. 4.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.944 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
890 million), up from Friday's 4.23 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 542 million).
	   Brokers said share prices rose on expectations that the U.S.
Federal Reserve may cut interest rates Tuesday when its Federal
Open Market Committee meets.
	   A move in U.S. interest rates is usually matched by Hong Kong
banks because the Hong Kong currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
	   The Hong Kong market was also boosted by Friday's gains on Wall
Street, brokers said.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 3.25 Hong Kong
dollars to 55.25, and Cheung Kong rose 3.00 dollars to 58.75.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 5.00 dollars to
183.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 75 cents to 65.25.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 2.25 dollars to 56.00, and
Hong Kong Electric rose 10 cents to 26.15.

Peru's Fujimori backs global financial reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Peru President Alberto Fujimori
said Monday his nation backed the movement to reform the global
financial system, in the context of continuing trade
liberalization.
	   Fujimori, whose Latin American country was inducted into the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation on Saturday, spoke at a business
conference on the sidelines of the APEC leaders summit, to be held
Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Fujimori said reform was necessary to restore confidence in
global markets, and to ``address structural problems in the
financial sector.''
	   ``We should build an international system that minimizes the
risk of future crises, and anticipate them and when they can't be
avoided, resolve them swiftly, and with the least possible social
and financial cost,'' he said.
	   Fujimori said the management of the deepening financial crisis
shouldn't compromise trade liberalization. Free trade ``is an
important element for sustained economic growth.''

Hong Kong unemployment rises to 17-year high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Unemployment rose to a record high of 5.3
percent for the three months ended Oct. 31, the government reported
Monday. The figure was the highest since the government began
keeping unemployment statistics in 1981.
	   Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department said 188,000 people
were out of work in the August-October period, compared with
179,400 in July-September, when unemployment was at a 15-year high
of 5 percent.
	   Officials said the latest figures reflected higher unemployment
mainly in Hong Kong's construction sector and, to a lesser extent,
in the restaurant and manufacturing sectors.
	   People have been laid off in the construction sector as many
private property projects have slowed down. The territory's
property values have fallen drastically, by as much as 50 percent
since their peak last year.
	   Higher unemployment in manufacturing and restaurants was
attributed to the decline in the territory's exports and subdued
consumer spending, acting government economist Elley Mao said.
	   Hong Kong's economy, mired in recession for months, shrank by
5.3 percent in the second quarter.
	   Government infrastructure projects are expected to create at
least 60,000 jobs by the end of 1999, Secretary for Education and
Manpower Joseph W. P. Wong said.
	   Although Hong Kong's unemployment is low compared with some
countries, people in the territory had been used to years of
healthy economic growth.
	   In the past several months, many companies have announced pay
cuts of 10 percent, while others said they will freeze wages to
keep costs low.
	   Rising unemployment and wage cuts have prompted unions and
politicians to lobby for unemployment benefits and stricter
guidelines on laying off staff.
	   In a sign that some companies are trying to find other ways to
cut costs, Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., one of the largest
employers in Hong Kong, on Monday pledged no salary or job cuts for
the next 13 months.
	   In September, about 1,500 people protested the company's
announcement that it would cut all wages by 10 percent. Hong Kong
Telecommunications later retracted the decision.

Arafat softens his harsh rhetoric; implementation on track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each
other Monday of violating the new peace agreement with inflammatory
rhetoric, but the dispute did not disrupt this week's time table
for an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   In another step toward implementation, Israel's parliament was
to begin its two-day debate of the agreement on Monday afternoon
with a major policy speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   A vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120 legislators
likely to support the agreement under which Israel withdraws from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's shaky coalition, meanwhile, was a little more steady
Monday after the National Religious Party, the patron of the Jewish
settlement movement, voted Sunday not to seek early elections over
the transfer of land to the Palestinians.
	   Under a time table worked out Sunday night between Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
Israel will withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank in a first
installment and release 250 Palestinian security prisoners by
Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, will hold a first round of negotiations on a
permanent peace agreement.
	   Such a deal is to be in place by May 1999, at the end of the
five-year period of autonomy. However, at this stage it appears
unlikely the deadline can be met since complex issues, such as
final borders and the future of Jerusalem, are on the agenda.
	   In recent days, Arafat has said again that he would declare
independence in May, regardless of whether a peace accord is in
place by then.
	   Israel's Cabinet warned last week that it reserved the right to
annex parts of the West Bank in response to such a declaration.
	   The Israeli Haaretz said Monday that Arafat and U.S. President
Bill Clinton had reached a verbal understanding during last month's
Mideast summit that if little progress had been made in final
status talks by May, the United States would not oppose a
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   In a tough speech to loyalists from his Fatah movement on
Sunday, Arafat hinted that the Palestinians kept open the option of
armed struggle and that ``our rifle is ready.''
	   Israel protested sharply and hinted at walking away from the
peace accord, but never followed through. ``If the Palestinians
keep the agreement, they will receive what was promised,'' Sharon
told American Jewish leaders Monday.
	   ``If they don't keep it, they won't receive anything, and I
think that this week, they brought the situation in which they will
not receive very much closer,'' Sharon said.
	   Arafat softened his statement Monday, saying that the
Palestinians had made peace their strategic choice and that they
remained committed to the Wye agreement. The clarification was
issued by Arafat adviser Nabil Amr.
	   Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, suggested that Arafat's
renewed talk about declaring independence in May was little more
than an attempt to make sure Israel is not dragging out the
negotiations. ``The only thing President Arafat wants is to end
final status talks on May 4,'' Erekat said.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
to Jewish settlers Sunday to grab West Bank hilltops now before the
two sides reach a permanent territorial agreement over the area
where the Palestinians want to build their future state.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Sharon of
incitement and demanded an apology from Netanyahu. ``If matters are
left to this new political terrorist,'' Asfour said, referring to
Sharon, ``then we are facing a catastrophe.''
	   Sharon said Monday he had only encouraged the settlers to take
what is rightfully theirs. ``If we are talking about seizing the
hills, there are ... hills that dominate the existing settlements,
state land, and this is aimed not at increasing tension but on
decreasing tension in the future,'' Sharon said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there, with the stated aim of
seizing as much land as they can before the troop withdrawal.
	   The settlers acted without government permission, but Sharon's
remarks showed that they had its quiet backing.

Coming to terms with disco fire in Sweden a long process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Facing a group of teen-age boys whose
friends had been at a dance hall when a catastrophic fire broke
out, Taha Abdu spoke words of cold comfort.
	   ``All of us will die. We don't know when, maybe tomorrow,'' he
said. ``You must go on.''
	   Going forward with life is a wrenching process in the aftermath
of the Oct. 29 fire that killed 63 people between the ages of 12
and 20.
	   The 500-foot-long (150-meter-long) pile of flowers, stuffed
animals and candles outside the fire site is weather-beaten but
still draws visitors, even at midnight. The chill rains that
afflict Goteborg in the winter sometimes put out the candles, but
when the skies clear, hundreds of flames return.
	   In Stockholm, 250 miles (400 kilometers) northeast of Goteborg,
a similar but smaller assemblage of bouquets and candles in a main
square is rarely without a few people gazing quietly at it.
	   There's no defined point at which mourning veers from being a
healthy natural process to becoming a bitter obsession, but youth
counselors such as Abdu are worried.
	   On an evening tour of Hammarkullen, a suburb from which many of
the victims came, Abdu enters a youth center. At first, it hardly
seems like a scene of mourning: two boys play a comically wild
pingpong match and a coed crowd flirt at a pool table.
	   But in the crowd, Abdu spots a familiar troubled face and takes
the boy outside. The boy says he was one of the organizers of the
disco at the rented hall, but won't give his name or talk to Abdu
with a journalist present.
	   Later, Abdu tells his story: he hasn't been to school since the
fire, is having trouble sleeping and comes to the noise of the
youth center to avoid having to think about the tragedy.
	   Then he gathers a group of about 10 other boys and takes them to
the neighborhood Muslim center. Abdu, of the Goteborg Sunni Muslim
center, focuses his work on Islamic youth, who were hit
disproportionately hard by the blaze. The hundreds of kids at the
dance hall were mostly immigrants or children of immigrant parents,
primarily Muslims.
	   It wasn't a segregated crowd: 12 of the 63 dead were Swedes. But
the large number of nonnative Swedes killed aggravated the sense of
resentment among many of Sweden's immigrants. They complain of
being treated coldly by Swedes and of having little opportunity to
move from the giant, outlying housing developments where they are
concentrated.
	   In the first days after the fire, rumors spread that it was
arson. An anonymous flyer blaming neo-Nazis appeared, and a
grieving relative shrieked at government officials attending a
memorial service, ``Those who killed our children are sitting there
at the front!''
	   When asked whether he was concerned about immigrant youths
mistrusting the police, Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said
it was natural for teens to be skeptical of authority.
	   But Swedes of all origins are frustrated by authorities' failure
to determine the cause of the fire. The investigators' competence
was widely questioned after they revealed that one victim's body
was in the rubble for five days before it was discovered.
	   At a memorial concert Sunday for the victims, television
journalist Alexandra Pascalidou read a statement from the victims'
relatives demanding a European Union investigation of the fire.
	   ``Multicultural Sweden has lost many of those who would build
its future,'' the statement said.

Kurds in Moscow on hunger strike to protest treatment of leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 100 Kurdish residents of Moscow were on
the third day of a hunger strike Monday in support of a Kurdish
rebel leader who was arrested last week in Rome, a news agency
said.
	   The hunger-strikers are protesting what they call an
international conspiracy against Abdullah Ocalan, who leads the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The group has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey,
where the PKK has been outlawed. Some 37,000 people have been
killed in the 14-year-old conflict.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday in Rome on a Turkish warrant after
stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he had fled after being
forced out of Syria. Russia denied him asylum; Italy has still not
decided whether to grant him refuge.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings. The charges can bring the death
penalty.
	   Thousands of Kurds demonstrated in support of Ocalan in Rome and
in towns across Germany over the weekend.

	   Delalic briefly looked down and swallowed when he heard the
first ``not guilty'' verdict read against him. He was cleared of
six war crimes charges and six counts of grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions.
	   Tribunal prosecutors had sought to convict Delalic as someone
who allegedly either ordered atrocities or knowingly failed to
prevent them at the Bosnian government-run Celebici camp.
	   Inmates were beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats,
wooden planks and rifle butts, according to testimony during the
10-month trial. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit
sexual acts with members of their own family.
	   The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts
that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner was
beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a
witness claimed.
	   Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic for humanitarian
gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some prisoners and
releasing others.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police questioned 11 prominent
opposition figures Monday over deadly student protests after
President B.J. Habibie accused opponents of trying to overthrow his
6-month-old government.
	   The activists, including two retired military generals, were
interrogated following mob riots and clashes between student
protesters and police and soldiers last week in which 16 people,
including eight students, were killed.
	   National police chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi the 11 had been
questioned but not detained. He warned that more activists would be
called in for interrogation.
	   Education Minister Yuwono Sudarsono said the protests had been
organized by ``radical groups'' that made sure young students were
at the front of the confrontations, knowing that deaths or injuries
would stir public anger.
	   He said the groups had occupied offices in buildings near
protest areas from which they coordinated the demonstrations.
	   A human rights group accused Habibie's government of trying to
make the activists into scapegoats as condemnation mounted over the
student deaths.
	   Habibie was expected to make a televised address to the nation
Monday night.
	   Last week's unrest was the worst in Jakarta since May, when much
heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat authoritarian
President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   Many shops reopened Monday and rush-hour traffic crawled along
the Indonesian capital's main boulevard, the site of battles Friday
night between riot officers and students demanding swifter
democratic change.
	   However, there were some small protests that were peacefully
blocked by riot police.
	   Wreathes were laid along the street outside Atma Jaya Catholic
University, where security forces shot and killed students with
plastic bullets last week.
	   About 100 anti-government activists chanted and sang as they
marched through a suburb dotted with the homes of the city's elite
and foreign diplomats.
	   ``We hold Habibie responsible for the shootings of the
students,'' said Sonia Virgen, a 21-year-old business student.
	   Another 50 protesters who tried to march to Suharto's home were
blocked in a park adjacent to the residence of the U.S. ambassador.
	   ``Suharto is the root of all of Indonesia's problems,'' said
Hendrik Siriat, a 25-year-old political science student.
	   About 200 protesters on buses were turned back by the military
when they tried to reach the Parliament.
	   In the eastern city of Palu, thousands of anti-government
student protesters peacefully occupied the local parliament
building, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Antara also reported that hundreds of students in Yogyakarta,
400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta, staged a protest to
condemn last week's shootings.
	   Habibie, a former Suharto protege whose efforts to implement
political reforms lack credibility among students, said the
violence would only jeopardize Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   After Habibie ordered the military to get tough on those trying
to topple him, police rounded up activists who have campaigned for
a more sweeping overhaul of Suharto's rigid political system.
	   Most of those being questioned signed a petition last week
calling for Habibie's replacement with a transitional government
led by a presidium of community leaders, and for general elections
to be held immediately.
	   Among those in custody Monday were former political prisoner and
politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide
to opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Early Monday, officers detained Haryono, an intellectual who is
active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association, and
Permadi Satrio Wiwoho, an outspoken fortune teller.
	   Another activist, 75-year-old retired Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, was
released late Sunday night after several hours of questioning.
	   His family said he would return to police headquarters later
Monday. So too would Lt. Gen. Ali Sadikan, a former Cabinet
minister, Jakarta governor and longtime government critic.
	   Indonesian Legal Aid Institute secretary Munir said police had
not laid charges against those questioned. He described their
interrogation as ``intimidation'' and an attempt to blame the
deaths on opposition groups by suggesting they incited students to
fight with security forces.
	   ``The government needs scapegoats for this situation,'' Munir
said.
	   Students timed their demonstrations to coincide with a meeting
last week of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, which agreed to hold parliamentary elections
in May or June and make other political reforms.
	   But the assembly, filled with holdovers from the Suharto era,
did not heed a student demand to ban the military from politics.
Instead, it decided to gradually reduce the role of the armed
forces in Parliament.

Suspect in dramatic German kidnap case escapes from prison

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ German police were searching Monday for
a dangerous escaped prisoner who had been awaiting trial in the
dramatic kidnapping of a young man left to die in a pit in the
woods.
	   Sergei Serov, 38, used bed sheets to climb down from the roof of
the jail in Potsdam, just south of Berlin, late Saturday, police
said. Jail officials didn't realize he was missing until midday
Sunday, although a surveillance camera on a neighboring building
had captured the escape on videotape.
	   A nationwide search was underway for Serov, who is considered to
be potentially violent and very dangerous, police spokesman Geert
Piorkowski said.
	   Serov and fellow Russian Vyacheslav Orlov, 28, were to go on
trial early next year on charges of kidnapping leading to death.
Authorities said the two had made partial confessions in the case
of Matthias Hintze, a 20-year-old kidnapped Sept. 14, 1997 and
buried in a pit, where he slowly suffocated.
	   His body was found Oct. 8, 1997, a day after the two Russians
were arrested while trying to pick up the 1 million mark (dlrs
625,000) ransom.
	   Last week, Berlin prosecutors also filed kidnapping charges
against the two in the case of a Berlin-based Russian computer
dealer, Alexander Galius, who disappeared in June 1997. One million
marks was demanded in that case as well.
	   Galius was never found and police suspect he died in an
underground shaft like Hintze.

Kurds continue hunger strike in support of detained leader

	   ROME (AP) _ About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a
military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is
believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his
detention.
	   Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome
to show their support for Ocalan (Ojalan), who was arrested
Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had been
seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in
Syria.
	   He has now appealed to Italy for asylum.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and the country's
most-wanted criminal. The Turkish government is pressuring Italy to
extradite Ocalan, who leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party,
PKK.
	   The party has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey since 1984 and the conflict has killed nearly 37,000 people.
	   Kurds in Germany, Austria and Romania also launched protests and
hunger strikes over the weekend to show their solidarity with the
rebel leader.
	   The Red Cross and local volunteers have been distributing
blankets and medicines to the Kurds camped out in front of Rome's
Celio hospital. Prefabricated toilets are also being installed.
	   The Kurds have reportedly said they will call off the hunger
strike Tuesday when Italian authorities plan to interrogate Ocalan
to evaluate his asylum request.
	   Ocalan risks the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has
heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there
have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has
consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a
possibility of capital punishment.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 150 U.N. relief workers evacuated to
Jordan in fear of U.S. missile strikes were heading back to Baghdad
on Monday, and the arms inspectors at the crux of the crisis were
ready to test Baghdad's pledge to cooperate.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission
which oversees weapons inspections, said UNSCOM teams would return
to the Iraqi capital from Bahrain on Tuesday to resume their search
for Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   ``We will get up and running as soon as we reach Baghdad,'' Ms.
Cross told reporters in the Bahraini capital Manama.
	   She said the inspectors hoped for full cooperation as pledged in
an Iraqi letter Saturday that ended the confrontation just before
the United States and Britain were to strike Iraq to force renewed
cooperation with the arms inspections.
	   ``It is the inspectors' job to go there and destroy weapons.
They will be the first to know if the cooperation is full and
unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said in Bahrain.
	   Before the latest crisis, UNSCOM had more than 100 inspectors on
the ground to handle spot checks and long-term monitoring of Iraq's
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   In addition, visiting UNSCOM teams _ as well as inspectors from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency _ came
and went for special inspections.
	   The United Nations ordered all inspectors and most relief
workers out of Baghdad last week as the United States and Britain
built up their forces in the Gulf.
	   The relief workers coordinate the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities to oil to buy
need food and medicine. The food is distributed in monthly rations
to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   About 150 humanitarian workers left Amman for Baghdad on Monday
morning, with about 30 senior staff flying back and the rest
traveling across the desert aboard four red and blue Iraqi buses
laden with luggage.
	   ``We are pleased to return to Iraq and we will resume our work
as soon as we get there,'' Abdullah Odeh, a Jordanian with the U.N.
Development Program in Baghdad, said before the buses left at about
11 a.m. (0900gmt).
	   Washington and London had threatened a military strike if Iraq
did not reverse decisions made in August and October to limit the
work of the arms inspectors.

Nike claims great strides in ridding workplace of dangerous

chemicals &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The U.S. company Nike has reduced the
amount of potentially unhealthy solvents used in the making of its
shoes by almost three-fourths in the past three years, company
officials said Monday.
	   It has set a goal of a 90 percent reduction by 2001, they added,
and intends to see that by the end of this year, no worker is
exposed to dangerous levels of vapors.
	   The proportion exposed now has fallen to less than one percent
on an an average per factory basis, the Beaverton, Oregon-based
company said at a seminar.
	   The company said it has installed new ventilation systems.
	   It also has replaced petroleum-based solvents with water-based
chemicals, which have been equal in quality and cheaper to use,
said Dick Crosbie, Nike's director of footwear chemical engineering
operations.
	   The effort followed accusations of poor working conditions at
the Asian factories where Nike makes its shoes.
	   Other shoe companies manufacture their products under similar
conditions, but Nike attracted the most criticism because of its
position as a market leader.
	   In May this year, Nike chairman Phil Knight promised to raise
the minimum age for workers at Nike's contract plants in Asia to
18, improve factory air quality, allow independent monitoring and
provide free education for workers.
	   Nike shoes are made at 37 factories belonging to contractors in
six Asian countries: China, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam
and South Korea. The factories employ 180,000 people in all.
	   Representatives of Nike's competitors, such as Adidas and
Reebok, attended Monday's seminar by invitation. Nike is keen to
share its experiences of replacing petroleum-based chemicals with
water-based ones, said Dusty Kidd, Nike's director for labor
practices.
	   ``In the areas of labor relations and environment, we're not
competitors,'' he said.
	   The use of petroleum-based chemicals _ technically known as
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs _ poses serious health hazards
when their vapors are present in high concentrations. VOCs are
commonly used in the production of many products, including
footwear, where they are used in adhesives, primers, cleaners and
flushing agents.
	   Tests conducted in 1997-98 under the auspices of Nike's risk
insurer, Reliance Insurance, identified 25 VOCs used in factories
making Nike shoes, and found seven of the chemicals present at
levels exceeding industry-standard permissible exposure limits. It
was estimated that of the 180,000 workers in Asia, 1,600 faced
exposure to the hazardous chemicals.
	   The new water-based chemicals have generally been developed by
Nike's existing chemical suppliers under the shoe company's
guidance, said Crosbie.
	   They are slightly cheaper to use, he said, and there are further
savings from reduced storage and shipping costs. Fire insurance
costs can also be reduced from their level when a factory would
have had ``a warehouse full of flammable solvents,'' he added.
	   About nine out of ten pairs of Nike shoes now use water-based
adhesives, said Crosbie.

France announces two new cases of mad cow disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two more cows affected with mad cow disease have
been discovered in France, the Agriculture Ministry said Monday,
bringing the total since 1990 to 45.
	   The cases, this year's 13th and 14th, were discovered in the
regions of La Manche and l'Ille-et-Vilaine. The discoveries meant
the slaughter of 216 other cows in the same herds.
	   The disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was first
detected in 1985. It causes holes in the brain, making cattle
stagger and drool. There is no known cure.
	   Scientists believe mad cow disease may be linked to an equally
fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

Schroeder arrives in Moscow for two-day visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder arrived in
Moscow on Monday for a two-day official visit, during which he is
expected to hear pleas for western aid from top-ranking Russian
officials.
	   Schroeder was scheduled to head for a meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov after landing in Moscow, and to meet with
other Russian politicians at the German ambassador's residence
later in the day.
	   On his first visit to Russia as Germany's leader, Schroeder will
meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin for talks and a working
breakfast at the Kremlin on Tuesday.
	   During the meetings, Russian officials will push for more
Western aid to deal with the country's crippling economic crisis,
the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
	   Russian leaders ``may ask Schroeder to use his influence in the
European organizations, the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank to have those organizations make decisions aimed at
providing economic aid to Russia,'' the ministry said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder and Russian officials will also discuss the Iraqi
crisis, the situation in Kosovo and NATO, the Russian Foreign
Ministry said.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed U.S. and NATO threats to use force
in Iraq and Kosovo, and protests NATO's intention to incorporate
former Soviet allies in Central and Eastern Europe.
	   During his visit, Schroeder will also meet with speakers of both
chambers of the Russian parliament, take a stroll on Moscow's Red
Square and take part in a meeting with Russian college students.

U.S. special envoy arrives in North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kartman's arrival in North Korea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A high-ranking U.S. diplomat arrived
in North Korea Monday for difficult talks with its secretive,
Marxist government about a suspected underground nuclear facility.
	   Charles Kartman, special envoy for Korean affairs, and his
entourage arrived in Pyongyang by plane, the North's Korean Central
News Agency said in a one-sentence dispatch.
	   U.S. officials in Washington said Kartman will press North Korea
to open the underground construction site to inspection under terms
of a 1994 nuclear accord.
	   North Korea already has objected strenuously to the U.S.
request, calling it unwarranted meddling in its internal affairs.
It says the facility is a civilian, non-nuclear project.
	   Kartman flew to Pyongyang via Japan on a military plane after
spending three days in Seoul coordinating policies with South
Korean officials.
	   Spy satellites have photographed thousands of workers burrowing
into a mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Yongbyon,
the North's main nuclear complex. Some American officials believe
that the new site is being built to develop nuclear weapons.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, North Korea promised to replace
plutonium-producing nuclear reactors with safer light water
reactors financed largely by South Korea and Japan.
	   Last week, a senior Clinton administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States is ready to drop the
agreement if the North Koreans don't permit inspections.
	   He said collapse of the agreement could affect a series of
diplomatic initiatives with North Korea, including an effort to
negotiate a peace treaty on the peninsula and U.S.-North Korean
talks on curbing Pyongyang's export of missiles and missile
technology.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The International Atomic Energy Agency is
sending its inspectors back to Iraq on Tuesday following Saddam
Hussein's pledge to let them resume their work, a spokesman for the
agency said Monday.
	   Nine nuclear inspectors who were pulled out last Wednesday for
safety reasons will return to Baghdad from Bahrain, David Kyd said.
Another 10 or so will be sent from Vienna later this week to help
their colleagues restart the suspended work.

nothing was moved while IAEA teams were out of the country,

Arafat softens his rhetoric; withdrawal on track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis and Palestinians accused each other
Monday of violating the new peace agreement, but Yasser Arafat
softened his earlier stance and said Palestinians have chosen peace
over armed conflict with the Israelis.
	   The dispute did not disrupt this week's timetable for an Israeli
troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Israel's parliament was to begin a two-day debate of the
agreement this afternoon after a major policy speech by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   A vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120 legislators
likely to support the agreement that calls for Israel to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's shaky coalition, meanwhile, was a little more steady
Monday after the National Religious Party, the patron of the Jewish
settlement movement, voted Sunday not to seek early elections over
the transfer of land to the Palestinians.
	   Under a timetable worked out Sunday night between Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
Israel will withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank in a first
installment and release 250 Palestinian security prisoners by
Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, will hold a first round of negotiations on a
permanent peace agreement.
	   Such a deal is to be in place by May 1999, at the end of the
five-year period of autonomy. However, at this stage it appears
unlikely the deadline can be met since complex issues, such as
final borders and the future of Jerusalem, are on the agenda.
	   In recent days, Arafat has said again that he would declare
independence in May, regardless of whether a peace accord is in
place by then. Israel's Cabinet warned last week that it reserved
the right to annex parts of the West Bank in response to such a
declaration.
	   The Israeli Haaretz said Monday that Arafat and President
Clinton had reached a verbal understanding that if little progress
had been made in final status talks by May, the United States would
not oppose a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   In a tough speech to loyalists from his Fatah movement Sunday,
Arafat hinted that the Palestinians kept open the option of armed
struggle and that ``our rifle is ready.''
	   Israel protested sharply and hinted at walking away from the
peace accord, but never followed through. ``If the Palestinians
keep the agreement, they will receive what was promised,'' Sharon
told American Jewish leaders Monday.
	   Arafat softened his statement Monday, saying the Palestinians
had made peace their strategic choice and that they remained
committed to the Wye agreement. The clarification was issued by
Arafat adviser Nabil Amr.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
to Jewish settlers Sunday to grab West Bank hilltops now before the
two sides reach a permanent territorial agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Sharon of
incitement and demanded an apology from Netanyahu. ``If matters are
left to this new political terrorist,'' Asfour said, referring to
Sharon, ``then we are facing a catastrophe.''
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there, with the stated aim of
seizing as much land as they can before the troop withdrawal.

U.N. aid workers returning, arms inspectors to test Iraq's pledges

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 150 U.N. relief workers who had been
evacuated to Jordan in fear of U.S. missile strikes were heading
back to Baghdad on Monday, and the arms inspectors at the crux of
the crisis were ready to test Baghdad's pledge to cooperate.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission
which oversees weapons inspections, said UNSCOM teams would return
to the Iraqi capital from Bahrain on Tuesday to resume their search
for Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   ``We will get up and running as soon as we reach Baghdad,'' Ms.
Cross told reporters in the Bahraini capital Manama.
	   She said the inspectors hoped for full cooperation as pledged in
an Iraqi letter Saturday that ended the confrontation just before
the United States and Britain were to strike Iraq to force renewed
cooperation with the arms inspections.
	   ``It is the inspectors' job to go there and destroy weapons.
They will be the first to know if the cooperation is full and
unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said in Bahrain.
	   Before the latest crisis, UNSCOM had more than 100 inspectors on
the ground to handle spot checks and long-term monitoring of Iraq's
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   In addition, visiting UNSCOM teams _ as well as inspectors from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency _ came
and went for special inspections.
	   The United Nations ordered all inspectors and most relief
workers out of Baghdad last week as the United States and Britain
built up their forces in the Gulf.
	   The relief workers coordinate the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities to oil to buy
need food and medicine. The food is distributed in monthly rations
to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   About 150 humanitarian workers left Amman for Baghdad on Monday
morning, with about 30 senior staff flying back and the rest
traveling across the desert aboard four red and blue Iraqi buses
laden with luggage.
	   ``We are pleased to return to Iraq and we will resume our work
as soon as we get there,'' Abdullah Odeh, a Jordanian with the U.N.
Development Program in Baghdad, said before the buses left at about
11 a.m. (0900gmt).
	   Washington and London had threatened a military strike if Iraq
did not reverse decisions made in August and October to limit the
work of the arms inspectors.

Report: Taiwan's ruling Nationalists suffer fall in profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's ruling Nationalists, considered
the world's richest political party, suffered a profit slowdown
this year that may affect their ability to run future election
campaigns, a newspaper said Monday.
	   Profits from party investments are set to fall by almost a third
this year, to about 10 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 312
million), the United Daily News reported.
	   The party still has an estimated U.S. dlrs 3 billion in assets.
But a long-term downturn in profits from the party's investment
houses could affects its ability to compete in 2000 presidential
elections, the paper said.
	   Party officials wouldn't comment on the report, but the paper
quoted its business manager, Liu Tai-ying, as saying last year's
profits would be reinvested if necessary.
	   The Nationalists' massive campaign war chest is considered key
to their retaining power during a decade-long transition to
democracy, and opponents say it gives them an unfair advantage.
Some observers say the Nationalists' candidate for Taipei mayor in
the Dec. 5 elections has spent 100 million Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 3 million) on television advertising so far in the race, far
outstripping the opposition incumbent.
	   The 103-year-old party, brought to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek
after he was swept out of China in 1949, also has investments in
newspapers and television.
	   About 80 percent of the party's operating income, or about 5
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 156 million) a year, comes from
its business investments, the party said.
	   This year's decline was due mostly to Taiwanese stock losses,
the paper said. Declines in real estate prices at home and abroad,
along with the falling values of other overseas investments, also
bit into profits, the paper said.

Cambodians hope new government can avoid past mistakes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian politicians expressed hope
Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun
Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition
government would not end in more violence.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed
in 1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed
over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from
the crumbling Khmer Rouge.
	   Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return
until a few months before elections in July.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the polls, but a
strong second-place finish by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the
royalist party leverage in post-election negotiations.
	   After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a
coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and
Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
	   ``This will not be a repetition of 1993 because there will not
be two prime ministers,'' said Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who
attended last week's summit. ``When we had two prime ministers,
everything moved very slowly and decisions were made more
politically than technically.''
	   Ranariddh said Saturday that the two parties agreed to keep the
ministries of interior and defense under co-ministers.
	   Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya revealed Monday that it
was also agreed that the CPP would control the foreign affairs and
finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice and information.
	   The parties are to form working groups this week to divide
remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment to
form a new Senate.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet Nov. 23 _ two days
before parliament reopens _ to review the results of the working
groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said.
	   Their ability to repair their relationship and work together
will be the key to a stable coalition.
	   ``I consider this a remarriage,'' Ahmad Yahya said. ``They have
to be careful with the way they work and what they say. They will
have to compromise to achieve results.''
	   Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third
in the election, was left out of last week's deal.
	   Sam Rainsy, a virulent critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14
other members of parliament have remained outside Cambodia since
September amid fears for their security.
	   In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam Rainsy
complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the
reconvening of parliament.
	   Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that his party and
former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by Hun Sen in a
rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. Authorities
have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen.
	   A police general investigating the attack said Monday that
likely suspects have been identified, but he would not reveal names
or their political affiliation.

Australian, Malaysian leaders discuss jailed dissident

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard raised concerns with his Malaysian counterpart Monday about
the treatment of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Howard also revealed that his foreign minister met secretly with
Anwar's wife Sunday to discuss his case.
	   ``I expressed the concern that was felt in Australia about the
issue and we had a lengthy discussion about it,'' Howard said after
meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Howard said the conduct of Anwar's trial, currently under way,
would influence the country's international reputation.
	   ``I hope that there will be a completely transparent and
independent judicial hearing of the issue,'' he said.
	   Howard arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for meetings this week of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   He further risked bilateral tension by having Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer meet secretly with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail for
an hour on Sunday.
	   ``Australia has been careful to take care of its bilateral
relations between our countries,'' Azizah told The Associated Press
in an interview Monday.
	   She said Downer ``asked me all sorts of things about Anwar, how
are his spirits, how is his health.''
	   Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
in September after Mahathir said he was morally unfit to take over
the leadership of the country. Anwar is standing trial for
corruption and sexual misconduct charges which he vehemently
denies.
	   Howard declined to say how Mahathir responded to his comments,
but described the conversation as ``frank and courteous.''
	   ``I don't believe for a moment that the bilateral relation,
which is very important to us and always has been and always will
be, has been anything other than strengthened by the candor of the
exchanges that took place at the meeting,'' he said.
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters that
Mahathir had given a complete explanation of Anwar's arrest and
trial.
	   ``We have explained it fully,'' she said.
	   Asked if the two sides had agreed on the explanation, she
replied: ``This is something (on which) you don't need to reach an
agreement.''
	   Rafidah also said Australia planned to announce an economic
assistance package for troubled Asian nations during the 21-member
APEC summit.
	   Howard had been criticized back home for going ahead with plans
to meet with Mahathir despite Anwar's arrest and alleged beatings
he received from police.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien both canceled bilateral talks with Mahathir.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Smiling and looking relaxed, about 150 U.N.
staff evacuated from Iraq last week for fear of U.S. missile attack
left Monday to return to Baghdad.
	   About 120 of them boarded four red and blue Iraqi buses laden
with luggage to begin the 12-hour journey across the desert to the
Iraqi capital, leaving at 11:10 a.m. (0910 gmt).
	   Another 30, mostly senior U.N. humanitarian workers, were
scheduled to depart around mid-day (1000 gmt) in a U.N.- chartered
plane from Marka Airport in the outskirts of Amman.
	   ``We are pleased to return to Iraq and we will resume our work
as soon as we get there,'' said Abdullah Odeh, a Jordanian
representative of the U.N. Development Program in Baghdad.
	   ``Any U.N. agent is happy to see that the crisis were resolved
without any bloodshed,'' said Jurgen Lissner, UNDP's representative
in Jordan as he bid farewell to the workers .
	   The humanitarian workers were evacuated last Wednesday together
with U.N. weapons inspectors as the United States and Britain
continued a military buildup in the Gulf region in response to
President Saddam Hussein's Oct. 31 decision to halt all cooperation
with the world body's weapons inspectors
	   Iraq on Saturday reversed its decision and said it was allowing
the inspectors back, averting what looked like certain military
strikes by the United States and Britain.
	   The relief workers coordinate the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
needed food and medicine.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in
1990. Its latest tussle with the United Nations stems from its
charges that the weapons inspectors were prolonging their work,
thus delaying the lifting of the sanctions.
	   The inspectors must verify that Iraq has dismantled all its
mass-destruction weapons and long-range missiles before they can
recommend the lifting of the sanctions to the United Nations.

Former defense minister speaks against Yeltsin at impeachment
</HEADLINE>
meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former Russian defense minister blamed President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday for the decline of Russia's military.
	   ``I came to the conclusion that Yeltsin, as commander-in-chief
of the armed forces, doesn't understand many issues relating to the
national defense, doesn't want to understand them and isn't paying
any attention to them at all,'' said former Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov.
	   Rodionov was testifying before the parliamentary committee that
is trying to impeach Yeltsin. Impeachment supporters accuse Yeltsin
of destroying Russia's armed forces, instigating the 1991 collapse
of the Soviet Union, illegally sending troops and tanks against his
foes in the previous parliament in 1993, and launching the
unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya.
	   The impeachment motion is unlikely to succeed. It would need a
two-thirds majority to pass in both the upper and lower houses of
parliament, and would require approval by both the Constitutional
and Supreme Courts.
	   Yeltsin fired Rodionov in May 1997 over his failure to make
radical cuts in Russia's military.
	   Rodionov said Monday that all of Russia's armed forces except
for the Strategic Rocket Forces are ``in stagnation.'' He accused
Yeltsin of ignoring his attempts to bring the military back into
shape.
	   Rodionov also denounced a government drive to persuade the lower
house of parliament, the State Duma, to ratify the START II arms
control treaty.
	   Ratification of the U.S.-Russian treaty would be ``a betrayal of
Russia,'' Rodionov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``Russia still has time to leave the START II treaty
unilaterally.''
	   The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996, but Russian
hard-line opponents have stalled on ratification. They say the
treaty would deprive Russia of its last remaining military strength
_ its nuclear stockpiles.

Justice at last in case involving atrocities against Serbs

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
Monday acquitted a Muslim military commander of war crimes against
Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in
the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a
Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb
captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.
	   Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's
acquittal, and asked judges to keep him in custody pending the
outcome of the appeal.
	   The U.N. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat,
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
because he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
Mucic smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison read
out.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War
II tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes
of their subordinates.
	   ``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those
under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without
taking any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus
Karibi-Whyte.
	   Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found
guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing
other inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years.
	   Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of three murders and
the torture of at least three other inmates. He was jailed for 15
years.
	   All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment, the
maximum punishment at the tribunal, which has no death penalty.
	   Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused
on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed
for the vast majority of the conflict's war crimes.
	   During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122
witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed
against Serbs in the area.
	   Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by
guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts,
according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced
to commit sexual acts with members of their own family.
	   The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts
that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner was
beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a
witness claimed.
	   Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic for
humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some
prisoners and releasing others.
	   The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has
convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb
Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing
and torturing Muslims in 1992.
	   Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the
tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need for trials.

Protests in China over lost investment funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Investors who claim to have been cheated out of
millions of yuan (millions of dollars) have staged protests in
several Chinese cities, including Beijing.
	   Several dozen Beijing residents gathered near the U.S. Embassy
Monday, planning a demonstration to demand that the American
government take action against a company they said had defrauded
them of a total of 10 million yuan (dlrs 1.21 million) in money
spent on fake land sales in Florida.
	   The group had prepared banners and placards accusing Income
Investment Properties and its representatives of fraud, and
demanding compensation.
	   Police forced the group to disperse before it had moved into a
street near the embassy.
	   Embassy officials contacted for comment did not return the
calls.
	   Chinese citizens appear increasingly willing to defy the
government's ban on unauthorized protests to express their anger
over money lost to unscrupulous businesses.
	   Investors who said they lost money to a group of investment
companies shut down by authorities in May protested for five hours
Sunday in Zhengzhou, in central Henan province, local police said.
	   A police official who gave only his surname, Jia, said the group
was dispersed peacefully. But he denied a report by a Hong
Kong-based human rights group that 2,000 people had joined in the
demonstration, saying that there were fewer than 100 protesters.
	   The protesters, who accused local officials of helping the
companies dupe them by allowing them to advertise in official
publications, were seeking help in regaining their lost
investments, he said.
	   According to the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China, more than 10,000 people in
Zhengzhou had contributed a total of 3 billion yuan (dlrs 360
million) to the funds, some of which is now alleged to be missing.
	   In June, a month after local authorities closed down the
companies, several thousand investors protested outside Zhengzhou's
city hall, the group said.
	   Similar protests have been reported throughout the country. In
Beijing last week, dozens of investors bilked in a futures swindle
mobbed China's official Xinhua News Agency demanding government
help in retrieving their losses.
	   The protesters claimed to be customers of the failed Xinguoda
Futures Brokerage Co. Ltd. The company stopped trading in August
and its chairman disappeared, leaving thousands of investors with
tens of millions of dollars in losses.
	   Authorities have reacted mildly to most protests. But organizers
of the demonstration against Xinguoda said Monday they had decided
to suspend their public demonstrations after some of their group
were detained by police.
	   The disputes over lost investment funds highlight the Chinese
government's difficulties in policing its fledgling financial
markets. Unscrupulous operators have moved into everything from
financial securities to door-to-door sales, often preying on
China's struggling working class.

German, French finance chiefs to set euro strategy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German and French finance ministers met
Monday to discuss strategy for boosting Europe's economy and for
the introduction of the single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
	   The talks, also attended by both countries' central bank chiefs,
were the first in a regular series since the left took power in
Germany following September elections.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has caused controversy
with repeated calls for the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to
lower interest rates to spur the economy.
	   But he has recently toned down his attacks, stressing the
independence of the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank that
will take over setting interest rates in 11 countries with the
introduction of the euro.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn has restrained
himself in the interest rate debate.
	   Speaking before Monday's talks outside Bonn, Lafontaine said the
discussions would focus on economic and finance policy in light of
the ``new challenges'' posed by the introduction of the euro and
recent economic turmoil.
	   Cooperation within the euro area is vital and ``it makes sense
to start with France,'' he said.
	   Lafontaine also moderated his calls for another pet project _
global cooperation to control swings in exchange rates of leading
currencies. He has said he wants a joint proposal with Britain and
France on financial system reforms.
	   ``We can't shoot from the hip,'' he said, ``We will discuss the
issue carefully.''

Steve Waugh predicts tough Ashes battle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket vice-captain Steve
Waugh said Monday his team faces its toughest Ashes series in 10
years beginning Friday in Brisbane.
	   Waugh, who was confirmed in the side for the opening test, is
the only member of the team to have played in a losing Australian
Ashes combination, in 1986-87.
	   Speaking at the launch of his new book, ``Images of Waugh,'' he
applauded the surprise selection of paceman Jason Gillespie and
sympathized with demoted batsman Darren Lehmann.
	   Waugh said he expected England to start the series in a fired-up
fashion.
	   ``On paper they look a very good side with a lot of experience
and have got the know-how to win a test series now,'' Waugh said.
	   ``This is a crucial tour for a lot of those guys, a lot of them
haven't beaten Australia, like (captain) Alec Stewart, they will be
desperate to beat us so I expect this to be our toughest series in
probably 10 years.''
	   Waugh said the inclusion of Gillespie following his recovery
from injury would be something the English did not want to see.
	   ``I think he may have a mental edge over them, particularly
after his seven for at Headingley last year, they wouldn't have
expected to see him so early, so I think that's a good selection.''
	   Waugh said Australia has to avoid a repetition of its disastrous
batting performance on the opening day of the last series in
England.
	   ``We've got to be careful we don't do what we did at Edgbaston,
when they had us 5 for about 30, so we've got to have a good first
session and I think that's the key.''

	   --
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The private Rwanda Airlines said Monday it
will start regular flights to rebel-held towns in eastern Congo,
including Goma, Kisangani, Kindu and Bunia.
	   An airline spokesman said Congolese airport authorities said
they needed at least a week to organize landing procedures,
including fees, and immigration offices before flights could start.
	   Along with Uganda, Rwanda has sent troops and equipment to back
the rebels fighting to overthrow President Laurent Kabila. Both
countries accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border of
Ugandan and Rwandan rebels.
	   Most of the airports, used for resupplying and reinforcing rebel
troops and their allies, are controlled by either Rwandan or
Ugandan forces.
	   There has been no reaction from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa,
on the airlines' announcement. Kabila has demanded an unconditional
withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan forces and vowed to defeat them
with the help from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
	   The one-way fare from Kigali to Goma will be about dlrs 100. The
airlines' 78-seater twin-propeller on Sunday made an inaugural
flight to Goma and Kindu.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Authorities have closed at least 10
schools in northern Uganda because of an infiltration of rebels
from southern Sudan, Radio Uganda said Monday.
	   The government radio quoted the civilian head of Kitgum District
saying the measure was taken for the safety of students, who are
taking final examinations.
	   Sudan-based rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army periodically
swoop down on settlements and schools and abduct youngsters to use
as bearers, soldiers and concubines.
	   Kitgum town is 450 kilometers (280 miles) north of Kampala.
	   Meanwhile, the government-owned newspaper New Vision reported
Monday that eight people, including six government soldiers, lost
their lives when the South African-made armored personnel carrier
in which they were riding swerved off the road and plunged into the
River Nile at Karuma, 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of Kampala.
	   The vehicle, popularly known as a ``mamba,'' was on a routine
patrol, Karuma military bridge Capt. George Rwabanga told New
Vision.
	   He said four survivors were pulled from the river.
	   --
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ U.S. envoy Anthony Lake was expected back
in the Eritrean capital Monday after meeting with Ethiopian
officials over the weekend to discuss the six-month border conflict
between the two neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
	   Reports Monday from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa,
indicated Lake was to have returned to Washington, D.C. Sunday
evening, but a government source in Asmara said Lake was expected
to continue his meetings with Eritrean officials Monday.
	   Lake arrived in Addis Nov. 8 on the second round of U.S. shuttle
diplomacy to work out a solution to the festering dispute.
	   Ethiopia has agreed to earlier proposals put forth by the United
States and the Organization of African Unity, both of which require
Eritrea to pull out of areas under dispute before observers can
move in and proper demarcation can begin.
	   Eritrea has not agreed to the plan.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The government said an escalation of
fighting in neighboring Angola forced 65,000 more refugees to flee
into western Zambia in recent weeks.
	   The Home Affairs Ministry, monitoring the influx, said most of
the fugitives arrived through the town of Mwinilunga in remote
northwestern Zambia.
	   In a statement released late Sunday, Home Affairs Minister
Katele Kalumba said the refugees were seeking asylum in Zambia,
joining at least 30,000 Angolans already there.
	   A peace accord between the Angolan government and rebels of
UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, has been crumbling with renewed fighting
and the government's decision to negotiate only with a group of
UNITA dissidents who split with rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   The government accuses Savimbi of wanting to destabilize Angola
despite the signing in the Zambian capital of Lusaka of a peace
pact in 1994 to end a two-decade civil war.
	   Kalumba said the Zambian government urged both sides in the
Angolan conflict to return to the conditions of the Lusaka pact.
	   That agreement required UNITA to demobilize its 70,000 guerrilla
fighters and relinquish control of almost half the country.
	   It also committed the government to guarantee the former rebels
the right to full political participation as civilians.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian
Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first
U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a
Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb
captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.
	   Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's
acquittal, and asked judges to keep him in custody pending the
outcome of the appeal.
	   The U.N. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat,
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
because he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
Mucic smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison read
out.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War
II tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes
of their subordinates.
	   ``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those
under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without
taking any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus
Karibi-Whyte.
	   Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found
guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing
other inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years.
	   Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of three murders and
the torture of at least three other inmates. He was jailed for 15
years.
	   All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment, the
maximum punishment at the tribunal, which has no death penalty.
	   Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused
on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed
for the vast majority of the conflict's war crimes.
	   During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122
witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed
against Serbs in the area.
	   Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by
guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts,
according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced
to commit sexual acts with members of their own family.
	   The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts
that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner was
beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a
witness claimed.
	   Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic for
humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some
prisoners and releasing others.
	   The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has
convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb
Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing
and torturing Muslims in 1992.
	   Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the
tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need for trials.

U.S. diplomat to press Milosevic over Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo, a senior American diplomat planned to press
the Yugoslav president Monday to abide by the terms of a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, President Slobodan Milosevic had
promised to pull out security forces, end a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a
mission of international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, was
scheduled to meet Milosevic in Serbia's capital Belgrade to discuss
the situation in the troubled province and raise international
concerns with the persisting level of violence in Kosovo.
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into sharp focus
Sunday after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun
rounds over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central
Kosovo.
	   A spokesman for the mission said a car from the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observers Mission was near Dulje, 35 kilometers (22
miles) southwest of Pristina, when it encountered an army column
coming the other way.
	   As the bright orange observers' car passed, the army vehicle,
equipped with a heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead,
observers' spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   On Monday, the Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the
bursts came from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their
engines slowed down to pass the monitors.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said Sunday, saying random firing was not in the spirit
of the cease-fire agreement and that the monitors had security
guarantees from Milosevic.
	   Beside expressing concern about ``the deterioration of the
agreement,'' Walker will aslo suggest Milosevic withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said in
Belgrade.
	   ``We're going to see what he has to say, and see if he can in
fact maybe even pull more of the Serbian police out of the
region.'' Philips added.
	   The incident came amid hopes for progress toward a political
settlement for the restive, Albanian-majority province.
	   Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, invited Kosovo
Albanians to hold face-to-face talks this Wednesday, with
international officials in attendance.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, one of Milosevic's closest
aides, was due to travel to Pristina and initiate the talks.
	   Members of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team, who have
rejected several Serb invitations in the past, were planning to
decide Monday whether to accept the offer.
	   Veton Surroi, a member of the Albanian team, expressed doubts
whether direct talks would start and said their main concern was
the sincerity of the invitation.
	   ``It looks for now as if the Serbian side is only attempting to
present itself as a party willing to cooperate,'' Surroi was quoted
as saying by the independent Beta news agency.

Chechen police fail to capture rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the
Chechen capital Grozny on Monday to protest a court conviction
against a prominent opposition leader, Russian media reported.
	   Chechnya's Supreme Sharia Court sentenced former rebel leader
Salman Raduyev on Nov. 4 to a four-year prison term for attempting
to overthrow the government.
	   The protesters, mostly pensioners, gathered in front of Grozny's
main court building and demanded that Raduyev's case be reviewed.
	   Raduyev and his forces captured the main television center in
Grozny on May 21, killing the national security chief. That was
apparently the basis for the charge against him.
	   More than 200 Chechen policemen joined in the search for Raduyev
on Monday, but failed to capture him, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Chechnya has suffered a wave of violence, theft, and kidnappings
for ransom since its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. No
country has recognized its claims of sovereignty.
	   Also Monday, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov told the regional
prosecutor general's office to open a case against the organizers
of the Chechen People's Congress, which called for the president's
removal. The congress is led by rebel leaders Raduyev, Shamil
Basayev and Khunkar Israpilov.
	   Maskhadov said the congress ``may destabilize the situation in
Chechnya and split society,'' according to the Interfax news
agency, but added that ``attempts of destructive forces to shake
the state power loose are doomed to failure.''

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities negotiated with an
imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release
of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into
extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said.
	   The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage Sunday by a
group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for
the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's
most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome.
	   Calascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his
detention in August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police
Monday. He is wanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection
with a killing.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free
his hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back
Ocalan who is Turkey's most wanted man.
	   ``He is not in any life threatening danger. We are not alarmed
for his safety,'' said prosecutor Celil Demircioglu. ``The
negotiations are continuing, we believe he will be freed very
soon.''
	   Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition would now be delayed
by a few days.
	   He denied Turkish press reports that the Italian was being held
at gun point.
	   Oz is currently on trial on drugs-related charges. The mob has
often supported right-wing parties and ultranationalist causes. At
a time when the state is under pressure to crack down on the mob,
it seemed convenient for Oz to show he was backing the government's
cause.

recovery and information about a Japan-US financial plan;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hoping to restore confidence in a
region of the world suffering through its worst economic crisis in
decades, U.S. Vice President Al Gore declared Monday that
``economic recovery can and must start in Asia.''
	   In another positive development, U.S. officials said that Japan
and America were close to agreement on a plan to provide additional
financing to cash-strapped Asian nations.
	   The initiative would tap resources from the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank, and Japan to restructure corporate and
financial debt, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Gore, a last-minute stand-in for President Clinton, arrived in
this Asian capital along with many other world leaders to attend
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meetings. He
will deliver a message of assurance that the United States, as the
world's largest economy, stands ready to try to help its allies out
of a serious economic difficulties.
	   Clinton canceled his trip to this year's APEC summit at the last
minute on Saturday because of the showdown with Baghdad, during
which he considered a military attack on Iraq to punish it for once
again expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   While the president is scheduled to still make official visits
to Japan and South Korea later this week, Gore was sent in his
place to the APEC meetings in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The vice president kept the president's schedule on Monday,
which included a series of bilateral meetings with Chinese
president Jiang Zemin and Thailand's leader, Chuan Leekpai.
	   In a speech later Monday to an Asia-Pacific business group, Gore
sought to explain a U.S. strategy to stabilize shaken financial
markets and restore growth to Asian nations whose economies have
been leveled by plunging currencies and stock values.
	   ``This much is clear _ just as the global crisis started here in
Asia, the global economic recovery can and must start in Asia as
well,'' Gore said in prepared remarks.
	   U.S. officials traveling with Gore said that the United States
and Japan were near an agreement on a Clinton proposal to provide
more financial assistance to the region's debt-strapped
corporations and banks. The Clinton plan would also provide
increased support to social safety net programs to help the
millions of people who have been plunged into poverty by the
crisis, the officials said.
	   Japan has offered its own dlrs 30 billion assistance package for
troubled economies, and the expectation was that the final
agreement would see Japanese officials pledging that part of their
resources would be used to fund the Clinton proposal.
	   A senior administration official, briefing reporters on Gore's
speech, said the vice president would use it to allude to the
situation in Malaysia, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad first
fired and then jailed his one-time protege, former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   While not mentioning Anwar by name, the Clinton administration
official said the speech would talk of the need to promote
democracy around the world. But the official, who spoke on
condition that his name not be used, said the remarks were ``not
aimed like a pointed finger,'' but rather attempted to make
relevant points about human rights.
	   As Gore and other Pacific Rim leaders arrived in Malaysia for
the APEC summit on Tuesday and Wednesday, others seemed concerned
about the Anwar case and Clinton's absence.
	   Soon after Gore arrived, the leader of Singapore suggested that
the charisma quotient of the APEC forum had just fallen.
	   ``Obviously, when we sit down we are all equal,'' Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong of Singapore told reporters. ``It is the quality of
ideas which counts.''
	   But Goh also said that Clinton had probably reduced the amount
of coverage the APEC summit would get by sending Gore in his place.
``Of course, some leaders are more charismatic, and the press is
more interested in them,'' Goh said.
	   Malaysia, the host of the APEC forum, also took at swipe at the
United States, depicting Clinton as Rambo in a cartoon in the
government-backed New Straits Times newspaper on Monday.
	   At the bottom of the cartoon, one small snake said to another,
``Clinton is threatening war on Iraq!'' The other replied: ``An
excuse not to attend the APEC summit.''
	   Like Gore, man other APEC officials spent the day conducting
bilateral meetings with other leaders.
	   On Monday, anti-government protesters threatened to demonstrate
at the auditorium where Gore was to deliver his speech.
	   Over the weekend, the foreign ministers of Canada, Australia and
the United States angered the Malaysian government by meeting with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. They expressed concern over the
fairness of Anwar's trial on corruption and sex charges.
	   For the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human
rights concerns were being discussed by the leaders, whose goal is
to promote free trade in the region.
	   During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's treatment and
trial. And New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
planned to do that on Tuesday.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Mahathir because of his standoff with Anwar.
	   On Sunday, the APEC nations failed to achieve a landmark
agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global
trade, but did manage to keep the effort from totally collapsing.
	   The fight now goes to the 124-nation World Trade Organization,
where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff Japanese resistance
to cutting tariffs in two sectors it considers politically
sensitive _ wood and fish products.

	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru
suffered his third defeat, and lower-ranked Kotonishiki remained
the only undefeated wrestler Monday, ninth day of the 15-day Kyushu
Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   No. 12 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kotonishiki grabbed the belt
of No. 6 maegashira Wakanosato (5-4) and drove him backward out of
the ring.
	   One victory behind at 8-1 was No. 9 maegashira Tosanoumi, who
beat No. 9 maegashira Minatofuji (5-4).
	   Wakanohana suffered his second defeat, losing to No. 4
maegashira Tamakasuga (6-3), and was tied with his brother and
fellow yokozuna (grand champion), Takanohana, and ozeki Takanonami
at 7-2.
	   Takanohana, who has won 20 tournaments, beat komusubi (junior

	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, was slapped down by sekiwake
(junior champion) Chiyotaikai, leaving both at 6-3, tied with
Tamakasuga, No. 1 maegashiras Kaio and Tochiazuma, and komusubi
Musoyama.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan (3-6), or Mongolian Batbayar
Davaa, lost to No. 7 Shikishima (5-4) of the juryo division, just
below the senior makuuchi division.
	   Top juryo wrestlers have been filling in for Hawaiian-born
yokozuna Akebono, or Chad Rowan, who is sitting out the tournament
with a leg injury.
	   In a regular juryo match, Mongolian Kyokutenho, or No. 2-ranked
Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, improved to 4-5 by beating No. 7-ranked Daishi,
also 4-5.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango (5-4), or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, defeated No. 9-ranked Kitakachidoki (4-5).
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 5-ranked Hoshiandesu
(1-4), or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, lost to No. 7-ranked
Tominagayama. No. 11-ranked Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from
Brazil, slipped to 2-3 after losing to No. 7-ranked Towanoyama.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 15-ranked
Ryuko, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, improved his record to 3-2 by
defeating No. 13 Tanaka. No. 47-ranked Azumakaze (3-2), or
Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, beat No. 51-ranked Chaen.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the

Russian defense minister meets with Egyptian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said
his country's remains opposed to any military strike on Iran after
a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak on military cooperation with
Egypt.
	   Sergeyev's comment came a day after U.S. President Bill Clinton
pulled back a threat to attack Iraq following Baghdad's agreeing to
a resumption of U.N. arms inspections. But Clinton said an attack
could still come if Iraq does not cooperate with arms inspectors.
	   Sergeyev said that though Moscow opposed an attack, it also
criticized Iraq for failing to cooperate with the inspectors and
hoped Baghdad would now do so to end eight years of U.N. Security
sanctions on Iraq.
	   The United States and Britain threatened a military strike if
Iraq did not reverse decisions made in August and October to limit
the inspectors' work. Iraq relented on Saturday.
	   Sergeyev told reporters that he is in Egypt to prepare for
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit early next year. No date
has been set. He handed Mubarak a letter from Yeltsin.
	   The defense minister did not give details on Russia's military
cooperation with Egypt, but said Mubarak gave instructions so that
meetings between the two countries' defense ministries would have
positive results.
	   Sergeyev later met with Defense Minister Mohammed Hussein
Tantawi and visited a factory that manufactures gun barrels.
	   In the U.N. Security Council, Russia, France and China have
consistently taken a less strident stand on Iraq than the United
States and Britain. Russia has called for an easing of economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Spanish court hands down first sentence for Holocaust denial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A Barcelona court set a precedent in
Spain on Monday by convicting and sentencing a bookshop owner to
five years in jail Monday for denying the Holocaust and for
promoting racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Pedro Varela, a former head of the defunct Spanish pro-Nazi
group, CEDADE, was tried last month following his arrest in
December, 1996 after police confiscated thousands of pro-Nazi books
and videos as well as hundreds of swastikas and other Nazi
propaganda material in a raid on his ``Europa'' bookshop in central
Barcelona.
	   News reports said Varela was sentenced to two years for denying
the Holocaust and another three years for encouraging racism and
anti-Semitism.
	   He was also fined 730,000 pesetas (dlrs 5,000), the private news
agency Europa Press said.
	   It was the first time a person has been tried for such crimes in
Spain since they were outlawed in the new Penal Code of 1996.

Pacific Rim leaders warn against tilt toward protectionism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Key leaders of Pacific Rim nations
Monday warned against letting the global economic gloom obscure
free-market ideals and allow a tilt toward protectionism.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard acknowledged there was a
need to examine the huge amounts of funds sloshing in and out of
regional economies, but said there could be no regulation.
	   ``The idea of supervisory structures is not desirable,'' Howard
told a meeting of business chiefs being held on the sidelines of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
	   There is growing concern among APEC leaders that the Asian
contagion and a slowdown of Western industrialized economies could
halt the organization's drive toward free markets.
	   The failure over the weekend of ministers to reach a massive
agreement to reduce tariffs in nine industries added to the
pessimism.
	   The goal was to eliminate or at least drastically cut tariffs on
dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of global trade. The deal failed because of
heavy opposition from Japan to lowering barriers in wood and fish
products.
	   ``The trade ministers' outcome is second-best from the APEC
point of view,'' Howard said, noting that at least the 21-member
trade group had agreed to send the pact onto the World Trade
Organization for resolution.
	   He said the watered-down trade plan should not weaken the
resolve to keep markets open.
	   In a move that could assuage many Asian nations who feel richer
nations don't sympathize with their plight, Howard said Australia
would take a proposal to the leaders' summit Tuesday and Wednesday
that would set up two task forces to study the causes of the Asian
economic crisis.
	   The first would examine international hedge funds and the
movement of large amounts of capital in and out of regional
economies. This would be a boost to host Malaysia, as Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad has blamed currency speculators and hedge
funds for many of his country's economic problems.
	   Malaysia says it is being forced to insulate its economy to
protect itself from attacks by currency speculators and from being
swamped by multinational companies.
	   Howard said the task force would be chaired by the United
States, but would also have to involve Britain because of London's
role as a major world financial center.
	   Howard also announced Australia would provide dlrs 30 million
over the next three years to help train central bank officials and
strengthen supervision of financial institutions in a dozen Asian
countries.
	   Supporting Howard on the need to stay away from closing markets,
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said: ``If countries resort to
protectionism, then all economies in the region will contract as a
chain reaction.''
	   Kim urged the richer nations to ``take positive actions and come
up with concrete and tangible plans for helping resolve the current
financial crisis in Asia.''
	   Peru's President Alberto Fujimori backed the movement to reform
the global financial system, in the context of continuing trade
liberalization.
	   Fujimori, whose Latin American country was inducted into the
APEC on Saturday, said reform was necessary to restore confidence
in global markets, and to ``address structural problems in the
financial sector.''
	   ``We should build an international system that minimizes the
risk of future crises,'' he said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,
with share prices surging in Hong Kong and Singapore on
expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   Thai share prices also gained sharply on heavy buying in bank
shares as investors were encouraged by rallies in most regional
markets and falling interest rates among domestic commercial banks.
	   In Tokyo, stocks rose moderately on hopes the government's new
economic recovery package will be followed with more stimulus
measures.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose 300.10 points,
or 3 percent, closing at 10,298.09.
	   Brokers said share prices rose on expectations that the U.S.
Federal Reserve may cut interest rates Tuesday when its Federal
Open Market Committee meets.
	   A move in U.S. interest rates is usually matched by Hong Kong
banks because the Hong Kong currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
	   Singapore shares rose as investors willing to gamble that the
United States would cut interest rates snapped up blue chips,
dealers said. The key Straits Times Index surged 2.9 percent, or
34.83 points, to 1,241.74.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 11.60 points, or 3.4
percent, to 345.19.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 160.06
points, or 1.12 percent, closing at 14,428.27. On Friday, it had
gained 193.15 points, or 1.37 percent.
	   The Japanese government on Monday announced a 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 196 billion) spending and tax cut plan intended to jog the
economy out of its deepest recession in decades.
	   Markets were mildly disappointed that the package didn't contain
much that hadn't already been expected. The Nikkei stock average
hit a high of 14,450.56 in early trading but eased back slightly
after the announcement.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.14 yen in late
afternoon, up 0.46 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late
New York rate of 122.72 yen.
	   Share prices in Taiwan closed sharply higher for the second
straight session, boosted by the government's latest stock-market
support package.
	   The support plan announced by Taiwan's Ministry of Finance late
last week included the establishment of a task force to buy
blue-chip stocks and allowing financially troubled companies to
apply for a suspension of trading.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 174.25
points, or 2.55 percent, to 7,003.87.
	   Elsewhere:
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, driven largely by
speculation over a possible bidding war for control of Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Co., traders said. The Philippine Stock
Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose 33.62 points, or 2
percent, to 1.745.60.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 3.87 points, or 0.19 percent,

Lebanese Prime Minister in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri arrived
here Monday on a visit aimed at expanding ties between Lebanon and
Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi received Hariri at Tehran's
Mehrabad Airport, the agency said.
	   Hariri then left to meet with Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   During his visit, he is also expected to hold talks with Habibi
and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who heads an influential
advisory council.
	   Hariri told reporters at the airport that during his visit he
will be looking into ways of expanding ties with Iran and
discussing regional developments with Iranian officials.
	   Hariri said that ties between Lebanon and Iran were growing and
that the two countries consult each other regularly, the agency
said.
	   Hariri, a Sunni Muslim backed by Syria and Saudi Arabia, had
been at odds with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
The Shiite Muslim guerrilla group has been leading the campaign to
drive Israeli forces from an enclave they occupy in southern
Lebanon.
	   Hariri's government has been concerned as well about Shiite
Iran's influence over Lebanese Shiites, who make up more than
one-third of Lebanon's 3.2 million people.

Hong Kong unemployment rises to 17-year high
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tung comments, grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Unemployment rose to a record 5.3 percent for
the three months ended Oct. 31, the government reported Monday. The
figure was the highest since the government began keeping
unemployment statistics in 1981.
	   Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department said 188,000 people
were out of work in the August-October period, compared with
179,400 in July-September, when unemployment was at a 15-year high
of 5 percent.
	   Officials said the latest figures reflected higher unemployment
mainly in Hong Kong's construction sector and, to a lesser extent,
in the restaurant and manufacturing sectors.
	   Construction workers have been laid off as many private property
projects have slowed down. The territory's property values have
fallen drastically, by as much as 50 percent since their peak last
year.
	   Higher unemployment in manufacturing and restaurants was
attributed to the decline in the territory's exports and subdued
consumer spending, acting government economist Elley Mao said.
	   Hong Kong's economy, mired in recession for months, shrank by
5.3 percent in the second quarter.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa
expressed concern over the latest figures. Tung, who is attending a
meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, said,
``We're still walking on a very difficult path.''
	   ``Unemployment is worsening. We're all very concerned and the
concern is understandable,'' he added.
	   Government infrastructure projects are expected to create at
least 60,000 jobs by the end of 1999, Secretary for Education and
Manpower Joseph W. P. Wong said.
	   Although Hong Kong's unemployment is low compared with some
countries, people in the territory had been used to years of
healthy economic growth.
	   In the past several months, many companies have announced pay
cuts of 10 percent, while others said they will freeze wages to
keep costs low.
	   Rising unemployment and wage cuts have prompted unions and
politicians to lobby for unemployment benefits and stricter
guidelines on laying off staff.
	   In a sign that some companies are trying to find other ways to
cut costs, Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., one of the largest
employers in Hong Kong, on Monday pledged no salary or job cuts for
the next 13 months.
	   In September, about 1,500 people protested the company's
announcement that it would cut all wages by 10 percent. Hong Kong
Telecommunications later retracted the decision.

Justice at last in case involving atrocities against Serbs

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal Monday convicted
three men of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but
acquitted their top commander in its first case to focus on
anti-Serb atrocities.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a
Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb
captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his overall
command.
	   Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal
Delalic's acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of
the appeal.
	   ``Let me thank you for a just and fair judgment,'' Delalic told
the court. ``I think it is a very wise judgment and a very
courageous one ... the judgment has even increased my trust in this
institution.''
	   The tribunal convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of
11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because
he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic,
wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his neck,
smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War
II tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes
of their subordinates.
	   ``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those
under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without
taking any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus
Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria.
	   Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found
guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing
other inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years by Karibi-Whyte, who
denounced rape as ``a despicable act which strikes at the very core
of human dignity and physical integrity.''
	   Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of three murders and
the torture of at least three other inmates. He was jailed for 15
years.
	   All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment, the
maximum punishment at the tribunal, which has no death penalty.
	   Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused
on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed
for the vast majority of war crimes committed during the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict.
	   During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122
witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed
against Serbs in the area.
	   Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by
guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts,
according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced
to commit sexual acts with members of their own family.
	   The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts
that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner was
beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a
witness claimed.
	   Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic for
humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some
prisoners and releasing others.
	   The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has
convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb
Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing
and torturing Muslims in 1992.
	   Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the
tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need for trials.

Russian banks face doomsday as debt moratorium expires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing widespread bankruptcy, Russia's banks
prepared themselves Monday for a stream of lawsuits from Western
partners after a three-month moratorium on Russia's foreign debt
repayments expired.
	   Analysts say the debts coming due, estimated at more than dlrs 6
billion, may deal a fatal blow to half of the country's 1,500
commercial banks.
	   Some western creditors have already moved to freeze Russian bank
assets abroad. A tidal wave of lawsuits is expected within days,
now that even the most powerful Russian banks are facing severe
cash shortages.
	   On Aug. 17, the government defaulted on its domestic debt and
simultaneously devalued the ruble, inflicting multi-billion dollar
losses to investors. On the same day, it announced a 90-day
moratorium on commercial debt payments in an effort to keep Russian
banks from collapsing.
	   The moratorium only postponed the showdown, since the Russian
government failed to persuade foreign investors to drop their
claims against Russian banks.
	   Russian media have reported that a number of western banks have
already hired the international corporate investigative firm Kroll
Associates to locate foreign assets belonging to Russian banks.
	   Two of Russia's western creditors, Deutsche Bank and Lehman
Brothers, have already filed suit against Russian banks.
	   Foreign investors made the massive loans, called forward
contracts, to protect the value of their Russian treasury
investments against a plunge in the ruble. Many leading Russian
banks took forward contracts that exceeded their total assets many
times over.
	   The outcome of the legal battles is uncertain because many
courts consider forward contracts a form of gambling. They may
decide depositors and other creditors should have a higher priority
when bank assets are distributed.
	   The Russian Central Bank has moved to bail out some of the
largest Russian banks, but made it clear that it wouldn't try to
save all of them.
	   Assets of the 30 largest Russian banks totaled 547 billion
rubles before the latest crisis hit in mid-August, about dlrs 33
billion at the current exchange rate.
	   The Russian currency has resumed its downhill plunge in recent
days, and officials said it may drop to 20 rubles per U.S. dollar
this fall, further eroding the dollar value of the bank holdings.
The exchange rate is currently 16.8 to the U.S. dollar.

Laurence Gandar, crusading SAfrican editor, dead at 82
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Laurence Gandar, a
crusading editor of the 1960s who was one of the first prominent
journalists to challenge apartheid, has died. He was 82.
	   Gandar died at an elderly care home after a long battle with
Parkinson's disease, said Raymond Louw, a friend and Gandar's
successor as editor of the now-defunct Rand Daily Mail.
	   Gandar took over as editor of the paper in 1957. It was one of
the country's major dailies, and Gandar quickly made his imprint.
	   ``He introduced investigative journalism to daily journalism in
this country, and most of that was on the deprivation and other
disadvantages the blacks were undergoing,'' Louw said.
	   He campaigned against apartheid, earning the wrath of the
government and white business establishment.
	   Gandar ``was the first editor of an established paper to have
put the issues created by apartheid clearly before the white
electorate,'' Louw said. His efforts helped plant the seed in the
minds of whites that apartheid could not be sustained.
	   That, in turn, created the conditions for a peaceful transition
from white minority rule to government by the black majority after
the African National Congress was unbanned and free elections took
place in 1994, Louw said.
	   Gandar's major investigative project was a four-part series that
exposed horrendous prison conditions. The government prosecuted him
for violating a law on prison information, and Gandar was convicted
and fined.
	   Gandar left his job as editor and was moved upstairs as
editor-in-chief in 1966. He served in the post for three years
before leaving the industry for a press institute and then
retiring.
	   Among his many recognitions was the World Press Achievement
Award, granted in 1966 by the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
	   Gandar served during World War II as an intelligence officer,
and his exposure to Nazi atrocities influenced him in his
opposition to apartheid's oppressive policies, Louw said.
	   Gandar's wife Isobel died in 1989 and his son Mark died earlier
this year. He is survived by a grandson. Funeral arrangements were
not immediately available.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to suspend an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
scheduled for this week, unless the Palestinians drop plans to
declare statehood in May, Israeli radio reports said.
	   The office of Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said
the radio reports are correct, but Bar-Illan himself was not
immediately available for comment.
	   The dispute was only the latest in a long series of disruptions
that have delayed implementation of the agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.

British-Norwegian Kvaerner group announces nine month loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The British-Norwegian Kvaerner ASA concern
Monday announced a pretax loss of 1.151 billion kroner (dlrs 155
million) in the first nine months of this year compared to a
903-million-kroner profit for the same period in 1997.
	   The concern, with interests in shipbuilding, engineering, metals
and construction, said the loss was partly due to a comprehensive
review of the company's finances after a change in its top
management.
	   Last month, Erik Toenseth was forced to step down after nine
years as president of Europe's largest shipbuilder because the
value of Kvaerner's stocks plunged 80 percent in one year. Toenseth
led Kvaerner through a period of aggressive expansion that included
the 1996 purchase of Britain's Trafalgar House Ltd.
	   He will be replaced on Jan. 1 by Kjell Almskog, an executive
vice president of the Swiss-Swedish ABB group.
	   Kvaerner, with more than 55,000 employees in 100 countries, said
its profits were dragged down by a one-time adjustment of 1.230
billion kroner (dlrs 166 million) following the management review.
It also said the company was stung by a weakening of the world
economy.
	   ``The underlying trading performance of the group showed
continued weakness during the third quarter due to soft and
difficult market conditions and losses on contracts,'' said
Kvaerner's board chairman Christian Bjelland.
	   After buying Trafalgar House, Kvaerner has sold assets to cut
debt, including those worth 4.158 billion kroner (dlrs 560 million)
in the first nine months of the year.
	   The concern's turnover was 61 billion kroner (dlrs 8.2 billion)
and an operating profit of 726 million kroner (dlrs 97.7 million)
for January through September, compared with a 53 billion kroner
turnover and 366 million kroner in operating profits for the same
period of 1997.

hijacking to Mogadishu &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, German (AP) _ Monika Haas, whom authorities long
suspected of being a member of the Red Army Faction, was jailed for
five years Monday for her involvement in a spectacular 1977 plane
hijacking.
	   Haas, 50, was found guilty by the Frankfurt high state court of
accessory to hostage-taking, to kidnapping, to two counts of
attempted murder and to an attack on air transport.
	   State prosecutors had demanded a 10-year sentence.
	   Haas went on trial in January 1996 charged with delivering
pistols, hand grenades and explosives to four members of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who carried
out the hijacking.
	   She denied up to the end of the trial she had anything to do
with the plot, saying she was falsely and ``systematically set up
as an agent and a top terrorist.''
	   On Oct. 17, 1977 the PFLP members hijacked a Lufthansa plane,
forcing it to make stops across the Mediterranean and North Africa.
	   The hijackers were demanding dlrs 15 million and the release of
imprisoned members of a German extreme left Red Army Faction
terrorist group, responsible for the September 1977 kidnapping of
Hanns-Martin Schleyer, president of the German employers'
federation.
	   The pilot was killed in South Yemen, and three hijackers were
killed when German commandos stormed the plane in Mogadishu,
Somalia.
	   A fourth, Suhaila Al-Sayeh, also known as Suhaila Andrawes, was
wounded, and disappeared after being released by Somalian
authorities after serving a year of a prison term, to be found
again in Norway. She was sentenced to a 12-year jail term in
Hamburg in 1996.

U.S. diplomat to press Milosevic over Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo, a senior American diplomat planned to press
the Yugoslav president Monday to abide by the terms of a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, President Slobodan Milosevic had
promised to pull out security forces, end a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a
mission of international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, was
scheduled to meet Milosevic in Serbia's capital Belgrade to discuss
the situation in the troubled province and raise international
concerns with the persisting level of violence in Kosovo.
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into focus Sunday
after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun rounds
over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central Kosovo.
	   A spokesman for the mission said a car from the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observers Mission was near Dulje, 35 kilometers (22
miles) southwest of Pristina, when it encountered an army column
coming the other way.
	   As the bright orange observers' car passed, the army vehicle,
equipped with a heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead,
observers' spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   On Monday, the Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the
bursts came from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their
engines slowed down to pass the monitors.
	   The incident came amid hopes for progress toward a political
settlement for the restive, Albanian-majority province.
	   Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, invited Kosovo
Albanians to hold face-to-face talks this Wednesday, with
international officials in attendance.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that began in
February has left hundreds dead and made thousands of people
refugees.

 &UR; Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli soldier killed, five wounded in bomb
attack, CHANGES dateline

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon Monday,
killing an Israeli soldier and wounding five others, security
officials said.
	   The bombing follows almost daily Israeli air raids on suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the south, including an air strike earlier
Monday.
	   The bomb was detonated by remote control as an Israeli infantry
patrol was combing the road between the villages of Houla and
Markaba.
	   The area is three kilometers (1.8 miles) west of the Lebanese
border with Israel, and some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of
Marjayoun, the main town in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the midday (1000GMT) bombing. Six hours earlier,
Israeli warplanes raided suspected guerrilla bases in the south in
the eighth attack in as many days, the Lebanese officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied
zone, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area in Sojod, which was
also attacked on Saturday.
	   The jets returned 15 minutes later and fired two more missiles
at Jabal al-Rafih, also in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raids on
the mountainous area, 10 kilometers (six miles) northwest of
Marjayoun.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel on the casualties
from the bombing.
	   But an army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed Monday's raid,
saying the warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in south
Lebanon.
	   Monday's air strike came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas fired
rockets and mortars at Israeli positions in southern Lebanon along
the border with the Jewish state as well as outposts of the South
Lebanon Army militia, which is armed and financed by Israel.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that the attacks were in response
to the continuing Israeli air raids on South Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes have raided suspected Hezbollah bases mainly
in Iqlim al-Tuffah daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted
in casualties.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone that
Israel carved out in in 1985 to protect against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

JERUSALEM: Islamic militants.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Israel's parliament was to begin its two-day debate of the
agreement on Monday afternoon with a major policy speech by
Netanyahu.
	   A vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120 legislators
likely to support the agreement under which Israel withdraws from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Under a time table worked out between Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat and Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, Israel was
to withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank in a first installment
and release 250 Palestinian security prisoners by Friday.
	   However, Israel radio and Israel army radio quoted Netanyahu as
saying Monday that he would not go ahead with the withdrawal unless
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat retracted statements that he is
planning to declare a Palestinian state in May.
	   May marks the end of the five-year period of Palestinian
autonomy. By this time, Israel and the Palestinians are to have
worked out a permanent peace agreement. However, at this stage it
appears unlikely the deadline can be met since complex issues, such
as final borders and the future of Jerusalem, are on the agenda.
	   In recent days, Arafat said repeatedly that he would declare
independence in May, regardless of whether a peace accord is in
place by then and despite Israel's warnings that it might annex
parts of the West Bank in response.

Habibie not opposed to earlier Indonesian presidential ballot:
</HEADLINE>
aides &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In an apparent concession to
opposition groups, President B.J. Habibie says he won't block moves
to bring forward a ballot for a new president next year, close
aides said Monday.
	   Under a plan to inject more democracy into Indonesia's
authoritarian political system, Habibie has said previously that a
new president would be selected in December 1999.
	   That would be about six or seven months after parliamentary
elections that are expected to be held in May or June.
	   After that poll, elected lawmakers and government appointees
would form an assembly to choose a new president.
	   Habibie, who took over from authoritarian former President
Suharto in May, plans to run again.
	   Several leading opposition figures have demanded that the
selection of a president be held no more that three months after
the parliamentary election.
	   A senior Habibie aide, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, said Habibie would
not oppose this if the Parliament wanted it.
	   ``As soon as the election at the end of May is over, new
legislators can create the new government by choosing the new
president in one or two months,'' she said.
	   ``But we have to consider that there will be several parties in
the next Parliament, and it depends on them when they want to have
a new president.''
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung also said that Habibie would have
no objections to the presidential ballot being held earlier than
planned.

Congo official blasts Rwanda and Uganda for role in war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Congo's foreign minister on Monday
kept up a tough line against Rwanda and Uganda, which are backing
rebels seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   The official, Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, met with his South
African counterpart, Alfred Nzo, in the latest meeting here with
players in the complex Congo war.
	   ``The transgressors are still in large parts of our country,
destabilizing economic activities and putting the brakes on the
process of democratization in our country,'' he told reporters
after meeting with Nzo.
	   Rwanda and Uganda say their troops are in Congo because of a
threat from their own rebels operating there.
	   Lolakombe called on South Africa to press for the withdrawal of
Ugandan and Rwandan forces from Congo. Nzo said his country would
not take sides.
	   Lolakombe has criticized President Nelson Mandela for meeting
Congo rebel leader Ernst Wamba dia Wamba. Last week, Mandela met
with Rwanda's Deputy President Paul Kagame.
	   The fighting, which began in August, also involves Namibia,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad on Kabila's side.

International Monetary Fund: Position on Russian aid unchanged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has not changed
its stance on aid to Russia, an IMF official was quoted as saying
Monday by the Interfax news agency.
	   Martin Gilman, the head of the IMF's Moscow office, said an IMF
mission expected in Moscow on Wednesday will ``continue
negotiations with the Russian government under the same conditions
as were presented at the end of the previous mission,'' Interfax
said.
	   Russia is not expected to receive any additional money until it
comes up with a recovery program that meets with IMF approval. The
IMF criticized a blueprint the government delivered late last
month, saying the plan was too vague and including too much state
intervention in the economy.
	   Gilman said it was very difficult to talk of ``concrete
results'' so far in IMF talks with Russian officials because of the
``great uncertainty'' in Russia's current situation.

Germany says doors to Europe still open to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Despite all its problems, Yugoslavia could
still be integrated into European institutions if certain
conditions were met, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said
Monday.
	   After a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart, Knut Vollebaek,
Fischer said a political solution to Yugoslavia's Kosovo conflict
would be an important step forward.
	   If Belgrade would cooperate, ``we'd all be happy,'' Fischer
said.
	   ``Europe is a community of values,'' he said, and those who want
to belong must fulfill certain criteria.

guerrilla hideouts in the south, including an air strike earlier
Monday.
	   The bomb was detonated by remote control as an Israeli infantry
patrol was combing the road between the villages of Houla and
Markaba.
	   The area is three kilometers (1.8 miles) west of the Lebanese
border with Israel, and some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of
Marjayoun, the main town in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the midday (1000 GMT) bombing. Six hours
earlier, Israeli warplanes raided suspected guerrilla bases in the
south in the eighth attack in as many days, the Lebanese officials
said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied
zone, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area in Sojod, which was
also attacked on Saturday.
	   The jets returned 15 minutes later and fired two more missiles
at Jabal al-Rafih, also in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raids on
the mountainous area, 10 kilometers (six miles) northwest of
Marjayoun.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel on the casualties
from the bombing.
	   But an army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed Monday's raid,
saying the warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in south
Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes have raided suspected Hezbollah bases mainly
in Iqlim al-Tuffah daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted
in casualties.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone that
Israel carved out in in 1985 to protect against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

hijacking to Mogadishu &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, German (AP) _ Monika Haas, whom authorities long
suspected of being a member of the Red Army Faction, was jailed for
five years Monday for her involvement in a spectacular 1977 plane
hijacking.
	   Haas, 50, was found guilty by the Frankfurt high state court of
accessory to hostage-taking, to kidnapping, to two counts of
attempted murder and to an attack on air transport.
	   State prosecutors had demanded a 10-year sentence.
	   Haas went on trial in January 1996 charged with delivering
pistols, hand grenades and explosives to four members of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who carried
out the hijacking.
	   She denied up to the end of the trial she had anything to do
with the plot, saying she was falsely and ``systematically set up
as an agent and a top terrorist.''
	   On Oct. 17, 1977 the PFLP members hijacked a Lufthansa plane,
forcing it to make stops across the Mediterranean and North Africa.
	   The hijackers were demanding dlrs 15 million and the release of
imprisoned members of a German extreme left Red Army Faction
terrorist group, responsible for the September 1977 kidnapping of
Hanns-Martin Schleyer, president of the German employers'
federation.
	   The pilot was killed in South Yemen, and three hijackers were
killed when German commandos stormed the plane in Mogadishu,
Somalia.
	   A fourth, Suhaila Al-Sayeh, also known as Suhaila Andrawes, was
wounded, and disappeared after being released by Somalian
authorities after serving a year of a prison term, to be found
again in Norway. She was sentenced to a 12-year jail term in
Hamburg in 1996.

	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said he was surprised by
the change of direction, noting that the Israeli government
informed the Palestinians as late as Sunday evening that the
withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled.
	   ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop trying to evade the agreements by
using excuses,'' Asfour said.
	   Israel was also angered by an Arafat speech to loyalists from
his Fatah movement Sunday in which he hinted that the Palestinians
were keeping open the option of armed struggle and that ``our rifle
is ready.''
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Monday that Arafat
was close to prompting Israel to walk away from the agreement.
	   `If the Palestinians keep the agreement, they will receive what
was promised,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders.
	   ``If they don't keep it, they won't receive anything, and I
think that this week, they brought the situation in which they will
not receive very much closer,'' Sharon said.
	   Arafat softened his statements Monday, saying that the
Palestinians had made peace their strategic choice and that they
remained committed to the Wye agreement. The clarification was
issued by Arafat adviser Nabil Amr.
	   Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, suggested that Arafat's
renewed talk about declaring independence in May was little more
than an attempt to make sure Israel is not dragging out the
negotiations. ``The only thing President Arafat wants is to end
final status talks on May 4,'' Erekat said.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
to Jewish settlers Sunday to grab West Bank hilltops now before the
two sides reach a permanent territorial agreement over the area
where the Palestinians want to build their future state.
	   Asfour accused Sharon of incitement and demanded an apology from
Netanyahu. ``If matters are left to this new political terrorist,''
Asfour said, referring to Sharon, ``then we are facing a
catastrophe.''
	   Sharon said Monday that he had only encouraged the settlers to
take what is rightfully theirs. ``If we are talking about seizing
the hills, there are ... hills that dominate the existing
settlements, state land, and this is aimed not at increasing
tension but on decreasing tension in the future,'' Sharon said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there, with the stated aim of
seizing as much land as they can before the troop withdrawal.
	   The settlers acted without government permission, but Sharon's
remarks showed that they had its quiet backing.

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies vice-captain Carl
Hooper went eight better than his skipper, Brian Lara, in scoring a
chanceless 109 against Griqualand West at the De Beers Oval in
Kimberley on Monday.
	   By lunch on the third day of the four-day fixture the tourists
had pushed their overnight 327/6 wkts along to 419/9 in reply to
Griquas first innings 271.
	   With a lead of 119, the West Indies were well in command, but
there was still no indication of a declaration from Lara, who had
contributed a brilliant 101 Sunday.
	   Hooper, who resumed on 64 in the morning went on to his 100
(10x4 1x6) in 243 minutes, but was out 15 balls later when he skied
a delivery from Swanepoel to Botha on the mid-off boundary.
	   A powerful gusting wind blew the ball all over the place and in
the end Botha did well to hang onto a difficult swirling catch.
	   Deon Kruis had earlier found himself in a similar situation in
dismissing Franklyn Rose off his own bowling with the ball
seemingly shifting all the way from mid-on to the bowler's left.
	   The other wicket to fall was that of wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs
who was trapped leg-before by Pat Symcox after rattling up an
aggressive 40 (5x4s 1x6) off 58 deliveries.

Fourteen killed by flooding in western Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Floods in western Ukraine have claimed 14
lives and many more people are at risk of infection from polluted
water, officials said Monday.
	   Water has receded from most of the 118 settlements that were
flooded over the past two weeks in the Zakarpattia region, and 17
villages remained inundated Monday, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   More than 9,000 emergency workers will remain in the region to
repair hundreds of buildings, bridges, dams, roads and railways
that were damaged by flooding, the ministry said.
	   More than 230 local residents have been hospitalized. Doctors
said many more of the 300,000 people affected by the disaster could
fall ill because a third of the drinking water in Zakarpattia has
been polluted in the flooding.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the relief effort. International organizations
including the Red Cross and United Nations, and countries such as
Poland, Hungary, Italy and Germany have sent aid, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   Neighboring Russia promised to send aid in the next two days,
the Russian embassy in Kiev said.
	   No official estimates of the flood damage have been provided so
far.

Pakistani police bar opposition lawmakers from holding assembly

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Hundreds of armed policemen used water
trucks to seal off the assembly building of Sindh province on
Monday in an attempt to stop opposition lawmakers from holding a
session which the government says is illegal.
	   On the orders of Sindh Governor Moiniddin Haider, police blocked
roads to the assembly and did not allow some 54 lawmakers from
entering.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government dismissed Sindh
government on Oct. 30 and said Sindh's governor would rule instead.
Sharif said the move was an attempt to stop violence in the port
city of Karachi _ the capital of Sindh.
	   The governor in an order issued Sunday bars the provincial
assembly speaker from allowed to convene a session of the ousted
lawmakers. It was the attempt to convene a session that led to the
police action.
	   Members of the ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement and supporters of
former prime minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples' Party
protested in front of the barricades for around three hours. Bhutto
had are normally rivals, but have united over this issue.
	   ``The step is unconstitutional. The government can not stop the
assembly from holding a session,'' said Farooq Sattar, an MQM
lawmaker.
	   ``The assembly has neither been dissolved or suspended. . . The
constitution does not gives power to the (federal) government to
stop the assembly from holding its sessions,'' he said.
	   The MQM was an ally and a coalition partner of Sharif's Pakistan
Muslim League. But it parted ways with Sharif after he accused the
party of violence in Karachi and the of assassinating a former
Sindh province governor Hakim Said, who was shot dead on Oct 17.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed in violence in Karachi
this year.
	   Sharif's party does not have a majority in the Sindh Assembly
and is unable to form a government alone.
	   The governor's rule effectively places the province under the
federal government control, with orders coming from Islamabad.
	   The MQM is comprised of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at
independence from Britain in 1947 and their descendants.
	   The party is locked in a conflict with its splinter faction
known as the MQM (Haqiqi) which broke from the party several years
ago.
	   Sharif's government has vowed to restore peace in the troubled
southern city, Pakistan's financial center.

Turkey to replace capital punishment with life in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said
Monday he had completed a draft bill to abolish the death penalty
and gain the extradition of the leader of a Kurdish rebel group who
is considered the country's most wanted criminal.
	   ``At the moment, the draft law for the lifting of the death
penalty is finished. I am on my way to see the prime minister,''
Denizkurdu told reporters.
	   The draft bill, which will replace the death penalty with a
sentence of life in prison, was rushed out in a bid for the
extradition from Italy of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of a
14-year-old Kurdish guerrilla war for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
	   Ocalan was captured in Rome upon his arrival from Russia last
week.
	   It was unclear if the move to abolish the death penalty would
convince Italy.
	   Turkey has not carried out any executions since 1984 despite
issuing death sentences, but Italy has consistently opposed
extradition to any country if there is even the possibility of
capital punishment.
	   The proposal is expected to be debated in the Cabinet this week,
the daily Radikal said Monday.
	   A newspaper columnist suggested that the death penalty could be
reintroduced shortly after the rebel leader's return.
	   ``Let's first lift the death penalty and get (Ocalan) back.
After that let's bring back the death penalty. That is the only way
to please public opinion,'' wrote columnist Rauf Tamer in the daily
Sabah Monday.
	   He was referring to public outrage against Ocalan, who is blamed
in Turkey for the death of thousands of people.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict since Ocalan's
group launched a guerrilla war for autonomy in 1984.
	   Under the current penal code Ocalan could face the death
sentence for charges of leading a terrorist organization,
threatening the country's territorial integrity and ordering
killings. He is being tried in absentia.

JERUSALEM: Islamic militants.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Israel's parliament was to begin its two-day debate of the
agreement on Monday afternoon with a major policy speech by
Netanyahu.
	   A vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120 legislators
likely to support the agreement under which Israel withdraws from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Under a time table worked out between Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat and Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, Israel was
to withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank in a first installment
and release 250 Palestinian security prisoners by Friday.
	   However, Israel radio and Israel army radio quoted Netanyahu as
saying Monday that he would not go ahead with the withdrawal unless
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat retracted statements that he is
planning to declare a Palestinian state in May.
	   May marks the end of the five-year period of Palestinian
autonomy. By this time, Israel and the Palestinians are to have
worked out a permanent peace agreement. However, at this stage it
appears unlikely the deadline can be met since complex issues, such
as final borders and the future of Jerusalem, are on the agenda.
	   In recent days, Arafat said repeatedly that he would declare
independence in May, regardless of whether a peace accord is in
place by then and despite Israel's warnings that it might annex
parts of the West Bank in response.

Former defense minister speaks against Yeltsin at impeachment

meeting &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with committee chairman comment in new 7th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former Russian defense minister blamed President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday for the decline of Russia's military.
	   ``I came to the conclusion that Yeltsin, as commander-in-chief
of the armed forces, doesn't understand many issues relating to the
national defense, doesn't want to understand them and isn't paying
any attention to them at all,'' said former Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov.
	   Rodionov was testifying before the parliamentary committee that
is trying to impeach Yeltsin. Impeachment supporters accuse Yeltsin
of destroying Russia's armed forces, instigating the 1991 collapse
of the Soviet Union, illegally sending troops and tanks against his
foes in the previous parliament in 1993, and launching the
unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya.
	   The impeachment motion is unlikely to succeed. It would need a
two-thirds majority to pass in both the upper and lower houses of
parliament, and would require approval by both the Constitutional
and Supreme Courts.
	   Yeltsin fired Rodionov in May 1997 over his failure to make
radical cuts in Russia's military.
	   Rodionov said Monday that all of Russia's armed forces except
for the Strategic Rocket Forces are ``in stagnation.'' He accused
Yeltsin of ignoring his attempts to bring the military back into
shape.
	   Still, committee chairman Vadim Filimonov said that Rodionov had
failed to provide sufficient evidence that Yeltsin had actually
intended to ruin the armed forces. The question ``remains open,''
Filimonov said, according to Interfax.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A miner was killed by falling rocks at a
mine in eastern Ukraine, bringing the number of Ukrainian miners
killed on the job so far this year to more than 330, officials said
Monday.
	   The accident occurred Sunday at the Kalinina mine in the Donetsk
region, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   No further details were provided.
	   About 1,400 workers have died in job-related accidents in
Ukraine since the beginning of 1998, according to the Labor
Ministry.
	   Of these, the largely state-owned coal industry already has
accounted for at least 330 deaths, against 290 last year.
	   Despite frequent miner strikes, the cash-strapped government has
failed to modernize the deteriorating coal mines and improve safety
conditions.

Philippines shares, peso close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA (AP) _ Philippine shares closed higher Monday, driven
largely by speculation about a possible bidding war for control of
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., traders said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks soared
33.62 points, or 2 percent, to 1,745.60 after retreating 22.17
points Friday.
	   The broader All Shares Index gained 7.51 points to 560.32 after
sliding 4.97 points Friday.
	   Gainers beat losers 51 to 41, with 38 issues unchanged.
	   The Philippine peso closed higher in moderate trading, buoyed by
minimal commercial demand for dollars and expectations of dollar
inflows in the coming sessions, traders said.
	   The postponement last Thursday of Hong Kong-based First Pacific
Co.'s deal to acquire a substantial stake of PLDT renewed
speculation over a possible bidding contest for control of the the
country's dominant telephone company.
	   PLDT, which accounted for 46 percent of total turnover Monday,
gained 85 pesos to 1,085.
	   ``Anytime there is talk of a new bidder (for PLDT), speculation
of a bidding war surfaces to drive its share price up,'' said
Spencer Yap, analyst for BPI Capital Corp.
	   Other parties, including U.S.-based Southwest Bell Corp., were
reported interested in buying a stake in PLDT, although First
Pacific appears to be closest to clinching a deal. Last Thursday,
trading in First Pacific's shares was suspended in Hong Kong
pending the announcement of a ``major acquisition,'' but the deal
didn't go through.
	   The dollar averaged 40.286 pesos, down 35.5 centavos from
Friday's average of 40.641 pesos.
	   It traded in a thin range of 40.150 pesos to 40.40 pesos, and
was last traded at 40.185 pesos. Volume slowed to dlrs 112 million
from dlrs 178 million Friday.
	   Traders said commercial demand for dollars was low since
importers and other companies had covered their U.S. currency
requirements in previous sessions.
	   Some companies have postponed their foreign exchange dealings,
awaiting fresh news that could give the peso a clearer direction,
they added.
	   Traders expect the peso to appreciate further Tuesday, easily
breaking the level of 40 to the dollar.
	   Dollar inflows, meanwhile, are expected to come from foreign
direct investments, remittances from Filipinos working overseas and
portfolio investments.

Ethnic Albanians unlikely to attend talks

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo said Monday his team was unlikely to attend talks with the
Serbian government, called for by President Milan Milutinovic.
	   Fehmi Agani, a top aide to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, said ``conditions have not been made'' for a meeting
between Serb and Albanian sides. Agani said indirect, U.S.-mediated
talks should continue instead.
	   ``I doubt there will be direct talks between Pristina and
Belgrade the way Serbian President Milutinovic suggested,'' said
Agani. He said the Albanian politicians would hold another round of
consultations before making the final decision.
	   ``The positions of the two sides are still far apart and they
should be brought closer together before the direct talks could
start. That is what Ambassador (Christopher) Hill has been doing,''
said Agani referring to the U.S. envoy's shuttle diplomacy efforts
between Belgrade and Pristina.
	   Hill, as well as representatives from Russia, China and the
European Union were invited to attend the talks Wednesday called
for by Milutinovic.

Vice president touts Taiwan as model for China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's model of modernization remains
valid for China, and spreading democracy in the mainland remains
Taipei's ``solemn goal,'' Vice President Lien Chan said Monday.
	   The island's model of full democracy and free markets, though
flawed, is ``what the Chinese people have been striving for for the
past 150 years,'' Lien told delegates to a congress of political
parties arranged by Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party.
	   ``We are convinced that since we both share the same cultural
origin, the experience developed by the Chinese on Taiwan can and
will serve as a valuable and irreplaceable reference for the
mainland,'' Lien said.
	   ``The Republic of China has a solemn goal, that of disseminating
democracy on the Chinese mainland,'' he said, referring to Taiwan
by its formal name.
	   Taiwan's leaders frequently allude to democracy when discussing
China ties, highlighting Taipei's demand that China become
democratic before the sides can reunify.
	   Though they were joined for just four of the last 100 years,
China still claims Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunified
with the mainland by force if necessary. The Nationalists say they
believe in eventual reunification, but not on China's terms.
	   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates
permanent and formal independence from China, also has a strong
following on the island.
	   Over the past decade, Taiwan has evolved fully into a democracy,
discarding the single-party rule established by strongman Chiang
Kai-shek when he fled here from China in 1949.
	   Taiwan elected its first president by universal suffrage in
1996, and polls for the mayors and councils of its two largest
cities and members of the national legislature are scheduled for
Dec. 5.
	   Describing that transition as ``not an easy process,'' Lien said
electoral politics have become entrenched in Taiwan.
	   ``After almost half a century, elections as the only legitimate
mechanism for power transition have become an unassailable belief
in this society,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder held talks with
high-ranking Russian officials Monday at the start of a two-day
official visit, his first to Russia as Germany's leader.
	   Schroeder met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and
both pledged to ensure that Russian-German relations would continue
to flourish. Primakov said the relationship with Germany was a
``priority'' for Russia.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said at the
start of the meeting, according to the Interfax news agency.
``Naturally, we would like to learn more about your experience.''
	   Schroeder was scheduled to meet with other Russian politicians
at the German ambassador's residence later in the day, and with
President Boris Yeltsin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Twenty-five people were killed and
20 were seriously injured when a loaded passenger bus slammed into
a tree near the capital of Yamoussokro, newspapers reported Monday.
	   Witnesses were quoted as saying the bus which was traveling to
the northern town of Korhogo was speeding before the collision over
the weekend.
	   As the bus neared the village of Toumodi, 145 kilometers (90
miles) north of Abidjan, one of its front tires exploded, causing
the driver to lose control, veer off the road and slam into a tree,
the French-language Le Jour newspaper reported
	   At least 28 rescue workers worked to pry the victims out of the
twisted wreck. At least seven survivors later died while being
treated for the injuries at a local hospital.

Agreement of center-right parties unlikely before second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Cooperation among center-right
opposition parties is unlikely before the second round of voting,
despite their strong results in the first round of Senate
elections, a party leader said Monday.
	   The Civic Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced
the most candidates to the second round of voting. Based on results
from the vote Friday and Saturday, the party qualified to take part
in runoffs in 22 of 27 districts.
	   A grouping of four other opposition parties, led by the
Christian Democrats and Freedom Union, finished third with 14
candidates advancing.
	   But hard feelings among the four and Klaus make any agreement on
joint strategy in the runoff against the ruling Social Democrats
impossible. The Social Democrats have 15 candidates in the second
round of voting.
	   When asked whether his party was likely to work together with
the opposition coalition, Klaus told the daily Lidove Noviny,
``from what I heard from them, I think this question belongs to
science fiction.''
	   A third of the seats in the 81-member Senate are at stake. The
top two vote-getters in each district will faceoff in Friday and
Saturday runoffs.
	   Leaders of the Civic Democratic Party fear election results
could be reversed in the next round, as in 1996.
	   In those elections, Klaus' candidates advanced to the second
round in most districts. His coalition partners at the time, led by
the Christian Democrats, then called on their electorate to vote
against Civic Democratic Party candidates, fearing Klaus would
become too strong.
	   Cooperation also may be difficult at the local level,
particularly in the capital, Prague, where Klaus' party finished
first with 21 of 55 seats. The opposition coalition placed second,
with 16 seats, followed by the Social Democrats with 10 and the
Communists with eight.
	   That could jeopardize the re-election of Prague Mayor Jan
Koukal, a member of the Civic Democratic Party who is strongly
opposed by the four-member grouping.
	   Unofficial results from local elections indicated that
independent candidates fared well in small villages while the Civic
Democratic Party led in bigger towns.
	   The turnout for local elections was 45 percent.
	   More than 60,000 local posts were at stake. Official results are
expected Tuesday.

hijacking to Mogadishu &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, Haas free on probation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Monika Haas, whom authorities long
suspected of being a member of the Red Army Faction, was sentenced
to five years in jail Monday for her involvement in a spectacular
1977 plane hijacking to Mogadishu.
	   But the Frankfurt high state court ruled Haas, who already has
been in custody for 2 1/2 years while on trial, did not have to
return to jail and could serve the rest of the sentence on
probation.
	   Haas, 50, was found guilty of accessory to hostage-taking, to
kidnapping, to two counts of attempted murder and to an attack on
air transport.
	   State prosecutors had demanded a 10-year sentence.
	   Haas went on trial in January 1996 charged with delivering to
the Spanish island of Mallorca pistols, hand grenades and
explosives to four members of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine (PFLP) who carried out the hijacking.
	   Prosecutors said Haas had a special interest in the group
because she was once married to one of them.
	   Haas denied ever having been to Mallorca and said up to the end
of the trial she was innocent, ``systematically set up as an agent
and a top terrorist.''
	   On Oct. 17, 1977 the PFLP members hijacked the Lufthansa plane
``Landshut,'' forcing it to make stops across the Mediterranean and
North Africa.
	   The hijackers demanded dlrs 15 million and the release of
imprisoned members of a German extreme left Red Army Faction
terrorist group, responsible for the September 1977 kidnapping of
Hanns-Martin Schleyer, president of the German employers'
federation.
	   The pilot was killed in South Yemen, and three hijackers were
killed when German commandos stormed the plane in Mogadishu,
Somalia.
	   A fourth, Suhaila Al-Sayeh, also known as Suhaila Andrawes, was
wounded, and disappeared after being released by Somalian
authorities after serving a year of a prison term, to be found
again in Norway. She was sentenced to a 12-year jail term in
Hamburg in 1996.
	   Prosecutors said information she gave to Oslo police, along with
newly discovered East German secret police files, was the basis for
the charges against Haas.
	   Haas, a mother of three and medical assistant at a university
clinic in Frankfurt, was arrested and freed in 1992, to be charged
again in 1994.
	   Her intrigue-filled life has fascinated Germans for years.
	   Haas was active in the 1970s in the leftist Frankfurt scene,
which spawned some of the leaders of the Red Army Faction. She
occupied buildings to thwart real estate speculation, and was a
member of a group that helped free jailed activists.
	   When she disappeared, authorities believed she had gone
underground to join the Red Army Faction.
	   Haas turned up in a training camp for Palestinian guerrillas in
Aden, where she became known as the ``Pretty Woman.'' She was a
companion of Zaki Helou, a top PFLP official.
	   In January 1976, Haas was arrested in Nairobi, Kenya, in a
failed attempt to hijack an El Al airliner. Her release prompted
speculation that she had been ``turned'' by the Israeli secret
service, Mossad, something Haas has always denied.
	   In news interviews, Haas said she became so scared during her
brief custody in Nairobi that she withdrew from the terrorism
scene.
	   Haas said that during the so-called ``hot autumn'' of 1977 when
terrorist attacks rocked Germany, she was in Aden in the ``most
middle-class and unpolitical phase of my life.''

category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 150 U.N. relief workers who had been
evacuated to Jordan in fear of U.S. missile strikes were heading
back to Baghdad on Monday, and the arms inspectors at the crux of
the crisis were ready to test Baghdad's pledge to cooperate.
Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission which
oversees weapons inspections, said UNSCOM teams would return to the
Iraqi capital from Bahrain on Tuesday to resume their search for
Iraq's forbidden weapons. U.S. President Bill Clinton said Saddam
Hussein must cooperate unconditionally with the inspectors or again
face punishing military strikes he avoided this weekend by agreeing
to work with the United Nations. (IRAQ, US-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to suspend an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
scheduled for this week, unless the Palestinians drop plans to
declare statehood in May, Israeli radio reports said. The office of
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the radio reports
are correct. The dispute was only the latest in a long series of
disruptions that have delayed implementation of the agreement under
which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants. Israel's
parliament was to begin debating the agreement Monday afternoon and
a vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120 legislators
likely to support the agreement to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal Monday convicted
three men of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but
acquitted their top commander in its first case to focus on
anti-Serb atrocities. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared
Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes
committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison
camp under his command. ``Let me thank you for a just and fair
judgment,'' Delalic told the court. ``The judgment has even
increased my trust in this institution.'' Along with two others,
the tribunal convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11
war crimes and sentenced him to seven years in prison. His
conviction was the first by an international court on the basis of
so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of
their subordinates. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police questioned 11 prominent
opposition figures Monday over deadly student protests after
President B.J. Habibie accused opponents of trying to overthrow his
6-month government. The activists, including two retired military
generals, were interrogated following mob riots and clashes between
student protesters and police and soldiers last week in which 16
people, including eight students, were killed. National police
chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi the 11 had been questioned but not
detained. He warned that more activists would be called in for
interrogation. (INDONESIA)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Kwame Ture, who as Stokely Carmichael made the
phrase ``black power'' a rallying cry of the U.S. civil rights
upheavals of the 1960s, died Sunday in the West African country of
Guinea, a member of Ture's All-African People's Revolutionary Party
said. He was 57. Sharon Sobukwe, a member of the organization in
Philadelphia, said Ture died of prostate cancer. She learned of his
death from Amadou Ly, an AAPRP member and one of Ture's closest
friends, who was with him when he died. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a
top civil rights leader, said he visited with Ture three times at
his home in Guinea during a trip to Africa last week. ``He was one
of our generation who was determined to give his life to
transforming America and Africa,'' Jackson added. ``He was
committed to ending racial apartheid in our country. He helped to
bring those walls down.'' (OBIT-TURE)

Reports: Netanyahu threatens to suspend troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous, UPDATES with quote by Cabinet minister;
EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to suspend an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
scheduled for this week, unless the Palestinians drop plans to
declare statehood in May, Israeli radio reports said.
	   The office of Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said
the radio reports were correct, but Bar-Illan himself was not
immediately available for comment.
	   Israeli Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav said that if Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat ``does not retract those declarations he has
made ... there is no point in continuing to give him strategic
territory.'
	   It was not clear whether Katsav, who abstained when the Cabinet
ratified the peace accord last week, expressed his personal view.
Israel army radio said Netanyahu phoned Katsav and told him that he
was in favor of suspending the troop pullback.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu of trying
to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop
trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour said.
	   The dispute was the latest to hold up the agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Israel's parliament was to begin its two-day debate of the
agreement on Monday afternoon with a major policy speech by
Netanyahu. A vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120
legislators likely to support the agreement.
	   Under a time table worked out Sunday night, Israel was to
withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank and release 250
Palestinian security prisoners by Friday.
	   However, Israel radio and Israel army radio said Netanyahu
decided Monday that he would not go ahead with the withdrawal
unless Arafat retracts his statements regarding independence.
	   May marks the end of the five-year period of Palestinian
autonomy. By this time, Israel and the Palestinians are to have
worked out a permanent peace agreement. However, at this stage it
appears unlikely the deadline can be met since complex issues, such
as final borders and the future of Jerusalem, are on the agenda.
	   In recent days, Arafat said repeatedly that he would declare
independence in May, regardless of whether a peace accord is in
place by then and despite Israel's warnings that it might annex
parts of the West Bank in response.
	   Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, suggested that
Arafat's renewed talk about independence was little more than an
attempt to make sure Israel is not dragging out the negotiations.
``The only thing President Arafat wants is to end final status
talks on May 4,'' Erekat said.
	   Asfour said he was surprised by the change of direction, noting
that the Israeli government informed the Palestinians as late as
Sunday evening that the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled.
	   Israel was also angered by an Arafat speech to loyalists from
his Fatah movement Sunday in which he hinted that the Palestinians
were keeping open the option of armed struggle and that ``our rifle
is ready.''
	   Arafat softened his statement Monday, saying that the
Palestinians had made peace their strategic choice and that they
remained committed to the Wye agreement. The clarification was
issued by Arafat adviser Nabil Amr.
	   Still, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Monday that
Arafat was close to provoking Israel into walking away from the
agreement.
	   `If the Palestinians keep the agreement, they will receive what
was promised,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders.
	   ``If they don't keep it, they won't receive anything, and I
think that this week, they brought the situation in which they will
not receive very much closer,'' Sharon said.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
to Jewish settlers Sunday to grab West Bank hilltops now before the
two sides reach a permanent territorial agreement over the area
where the Palestinians want to build their future state.
	   Arafat said Sharon's remarks constituted a violation of the
peace accord. Asfour accused Sharon of incitement and demanded an
apology from Netanyahu.
	   Sharon said Monday that he had only encouraged the settlers to
take what is rightfully theirs. ``If we are talking about seizing
the hills, there are ... hills that dominate the existing
settlements, state land, and this is aimed not at increasing
tension but on decreasing tension in the future,'' Sharon said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there, with the stated aim of
seizing as much land as they can before the troop withdrawal.

Philippines' largest broadcast network reports profits up 2.7
</HEADLINE>
percent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp., the
Philippines' largest broadcast network, said Monday its net profit
grew 2.7 percent in this year's first nine months.
	   Even though overall spending by the nation's advertisers dropped
an estimated 20 percent amid the Asian financial crisis, the
company said its own advertising draw remained strong and revenues
grew by 18 percent from January-September last year to 4.87 billion
pesos (dlrs 121.75 million).
	   But it said start-up costs associated with its local ultra-high
frequency channel and its international broadcasting venture cut
into profits.
	   Net profit rose to 1.24 billion pesos (dlrs 31 million) from
1.21 billion (dlrs 30.25 million) a year earlier.
	   ABS-CBN attributed its strong advertising draw to innovative
programming that has resulted in a steady rise in its audience
share. In September, the company said its audience share was 56
percent for Metro Manila and 83 percent in the provinces, up four
points from their levels at the start of the year.
	   ABS-CBN said its movie-making venture, Star Cinema, also
contributed to profits. Of the 12 movies it has released so far,
Star Cinema has scored eight blockbuster hits, the company said.
	   The company said it also kept a tight lid on operating expenses
with a rigorous cost-cutting program.

U.S. troops greet stand down on Iraq with mixed emotions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ON BOARD USS EISENHOWER (AP) _ Rows of F-14 and F-18 strike
aircraft had stood ready on deck, loaded with their deadly arsenal.
On one bomb raised onto an aircraft's belly, sailors had scrawled
in white chalk: ``To Saddam: we come in love.''
	   That was on Saturday when the United States was only hours away
from striking Iraq. Then the message from Washington came through:
freeze military action for 24 hours. Officers said troops greeted
the news with ``mixed emotions.''
	   After preparing for months for the attack, it had became clear
in recent days ``that we were going to actually end up doing an ...
operation,'' said Capt. Carlton Jewett, head of the aircraft
operations aboard the aircraft carrier, USS Eisenhower.
	   ``You ramp up your emotions, get high, and you are ready go out
and do your business. Then when you find out things are put on
hold, you have mixed emotions.
	   ``It is good in the sense that we don't have to go out right
now. Now the challenge is to maintain a level of readiness, a level
of mental toughness with the knowledge that we may have to go out''
later, Jewett said after the operation was put on hold.
	   The U.S. Navy flew television crews to the carrier on Saturday
morning when the commander of the Eisenhower battle group, Rear
Adm. Scott Fry, announced that his forces would launch strikes
later that night. The news was embargoed until Monday.
	   In the event, the 24-hour suspension turned into a full stand
down after President Clinton on Sunday accepted Iraq's promise to
unconditionally allow the resumption of disarmament work by the
United Nations. He warned, however, that the military option
remained open if Iraq refused to cooperate with inspectors.
	   To ensure that Iraq does not go back on its word, the United
States will keep its naval force in the Gulf, which besides the
Eisenhower comprises 14 ships: destroyers, cruisers, supply vessels
and an attack submarine.
	   Fry, Jewett and other officers or sailors did not give
interviews on Sunday for a reaction to the easing of tensions.
	   Before word came through to hold the attack, Fry told
journalists: ``We will conduct strikes all night from the aircraft
carrier.'' He refused to say what the targets were and how many
days would the strikes last.
	   Fry said the ship carries 10 F-14A Tomcat and 36 F/A-18C Hornet
aircraft, which carry a range of missiles and bombs. He refused to
say how many would participate. He said Tomahawk cruise missiles
were also planned to be used.
	   Jewett said the operation was called off with only an hour to
go. ``We were actually walking over to the aircraft and starting
engines,'' he said, adding that the strike could have been stopped
even if the aircraft had taken off.
	   ``However, once cruise missiles are launched they are on their
way,'' he said.
	   He said the operation had been planned over a long time. ``It is
very well developed, very well choreographed. It would have had a
strong effect, strong impact.''
	   The U.N. weapons inspectors are responsible for destroying
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long range missiles.
Clinton said the strikes would have considerably reduced that
capability.

16 arrested for alleged support of Cambodian resistance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Sixteen people have been arrested in
northwestern Cambodia for alleged support of resistance forces that
make the region one of the country's less secure areas, the defense
minister said Monday.
	   Defense Minister Tea Banh said they were arrested last Thursday
in the former Khmer Rouge town of Phnom Malai after organizing a
demonstration against Hun Sen, the country's top leader.
	   Tea Banh said the demonstrators had been tricked by ``resistance
propaganda calling on them to create unrest.''
	   The prisoners, a mix of soldiers and civilians, were taken to
the city of Battambang, 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of
Phnom Penh, where they were detained over the weekend before being
brought before a provincial court Monday.
	   The defense minister said all 16 had been released, but human
rights workers in Battambang contacted Monday evening said they
were still detained and had not been formally charged by the court.
	   The arrests came as Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, reached an agreement for formation of a coalition
government.
	   The Friday compromise brokered by King Norodom Sihanouk will
make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the
National Assembly.
	   Part of the deal was an agreement to reunite army factions that
split along political lines last year when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh
as his co-prime minister in a violent coup.
	   Ranariddh's forces were pushed back to Cambodia's mountainous
northwest border with Thailand, where they dug in and fought the
attacking government army to a stalemate.
	   State-run television broadcast appeals over the weekend for
resistance commanders to hold their positions and provide lists of
names of their soldiers to the nearest regional army base.
	   Complicating the integration effort is the presence of a
crumbling Khmer Rouge army in the northwest. Several divisions of
the dying Maoist movement defected to the government this year, but
others are believed to have joined with the royalist resistance.
	   The weekend television broadcast called on all resistance
fighters ``to clearly state their non-involvement'' with Khmer
Rouge army chief Ta Mok.
	   Resistance commander Serey Kosal said Monday that a list of
names of army officials and soldiers was already prepared for
integration. He claimed 20,000 names were on the list, a number
that far exceeds independent estimates of resistance troop
strength.
	   ``All of them will have to be integrated and given back their
former ranks,'' Serey Kosal said by phone from Thailand. ``We
cannot abandon them.''
	   Serey Kosal and resistance army chief Nhek Bunchhay, convicted
in March by a military court of treason, were given pardons by
Sihanouk as part of the coalition deal.
	   However, Tea Banh said the integration deal did not guarantee
the two resistance generals would regain their former positions.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,
with share prices surging in Hong Kong and Singapore on
expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates. The blue-chip Hang
Seng Index in Hong Kong rose 300.10 points, or 3 percent, closing
at 10,298.09. Thai share prices also gained sharply on heavy buying
in bank shares as investors were encouraged by rallies in most
regional markets and falling interest rates among domestic
commercial banks. In Tokyo, stocks rose moderately on hopes the
government's will follow its economic recovery package with more
stimulus measures. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
climbed 160.06 points, or 1.12 percent, closing at 14,428.27.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.14 yen in late
afternoon, up 0.46 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late
New York rate of 122.72 yen. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister, on his way to a major
regional economic conference, unveiled the largest stimulus package
in the country's history Monday and promised it will turn the
recession-bound economy around by next year. But analysts said the
24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) in new public spending and tax
cuts will offer only temporary relief. The package is aimed at
stopping the economy from contracting for a third consecutive year
_ a pledge Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made after taking office in
July. ``With this plan, our country can free itself from its
current severe situation,'' Obuchi told reporters before flying to
Malaysia for a summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing widespread bankruptcy, Russia's banks
prepared themselves Monday for a stream of lawsuits from Western
partners after a three-month moratorium on Russia's foreign debt
repayments expired. Analysts say the debts coming due, estimated at
more than dlrs 6 billion, may deal a fatal blow to half of the
country's 1,500 commercial banks. Some western creditors have
already moved to freeze Russian bank assets abroad. A tidal wave of
lawsuits is expected within days, now that even the most powerful
Russian banks are facing severe cash shortages. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hoping to restore confidence in a
region of the world suffering through its worst economic crisis in
decades, U.S. Vice President Al Gore declared Monday that
``economic recovery can and must start in Asia.'' In another
positive development, U.S. officials said that Japan and America
were close to agreement on a plan to provide additional financing
to cash-strapped Asian nations. The initiative would tap resources
from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and Japan to
restructure corporate and financial debt, the officials said on
condition of anonymity. (APEC)
	   OJOCHAL, Nicaragua (AP) _ An uncounted number of Central
Americans are surveying the destruction of Hurricane Mitch, whose
impact will be felt in the region's economy for years. Governments,
overwhelmed by the 10,000 deaths, the need for relief work and
stymied by broken communication links, have yet to calculate the
full magnitude of the economic loss. The storm destroyed as much as
70 percent of the important banana and coffee crops in Honduras and
Nicaragua, along with most of the roads and bridges needed to carry
produce from the rural mountains to central markets. The
Inter-American Development Bank has estimated up to 90 percent of
roads and other infrastructure was destroyed in Honduras, the
worst-hit nation. (MITCH-ECONOMIC RUIN)

U.S. diplomat to press Milosevic over Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian negotiator saying his team
unlikely to attend talks, report of shooting in Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo, a senior American diplomat planned to press
the Yugoslav president Monday to abide by the terms of a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Under the Oct. 12 agreement, President Slobodan Milosevic had
promised to pull out security forces, end a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a
mission of international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, was
scheduled to meet Milosevic in Serbia's capital Belgrade to discuss
the situation in the troubled province and raise international
concerns with the persisting level of violence in Kosovo.
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into sharp focus
Sunday after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun
rounds over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central
Kosovo.
	   A spokesman for the mission said a car from the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observers Mission was near Dulje, 35 kilometers (22
miles) southwest of Pristina, when it encountered an army column
coming the other way.
	   As the bright orange observers' car passed, the army vehicle,
equipped with a heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead,
observers' spokesman Duncan Bullivant said.
	   On Monday, the Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the
bursts came from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their
engines slowed down to pass the monitors.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said Sunday, saying random firing was not in the spirit
of the cease-fire agreement and that the monitors had security
guarantees from Milosevic.
	   Beside expressing concern about ``the deterioration of the
agreement,'' Walker will also suggest Milosevic withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said in
Belgrade.
	   ``We're going to see what he has to say, and see if he can in
fact maybe even pull more of the Serbian police out of the
region.'' Philips added.
	   The meeting came as ethnic Albanians were throwing cold water on
hopes for imminent progress toward a political settlement for the
restive, Albanian-majority province.
	   A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in Kosovo indicated the
Albanians were likely to reject the new initiative by Serbian
authorities for long-sought direct talks.
	   Fehmi Agani, a top aide to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, said ``conditions have not been made'' for a meeting
between the Serb and Albanian sides. Agani said indirect,
U.S.-mediated talks should continue instead.
	   A formal decision was expected later Monday.
	   President Milan Milutinovic had proposed over the weekend to
chair face-to-face talks with the ethnic Albanians in Pristina on
Wednesday, with international officials in attendance.
	   Scattered violence continues in Kosovo. A Serb police station in
the town of Orahovac in central Kosovo was attacked Monday morning,
the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
	   ``Terrorist gangs of (ethnic) Albanian separatists fired from
surrounding hills at the Orahovac police station,'' the report
said. There were no injuries but a civilian vehicle in front of the
station was riddled with bullets.

U.S. pledges technical help to Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore
pledged technical assistance to Thailand as well as assistance to
develop human resources, Thailand's government spokesman Akapol
Sorasuchart said Monday.
	   Gore pledged the assistance at a meeting with Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Akapol also said that Thailand has asked Malaysia to relax
capital control regulations on the ringgit in so-called ringgit
zones in Thailand.
	   Malaysia in September pegged its currency to 3.80 to the U.S.
dollar in an effort to curb capital flow.
	   In certain regions in Thailand that border Malaysia, the ringgit
had been used freely along with the Thai baht. But since Malaysia
implemented capital controls in September, trade and tourism along
the Thai border has slowed because the Malaysian currency now can't
be used in Thailand, Akapol said.
	   ``It creates a black market,'' Akapol said.
	   Malaysia said it would send officials to Thailand to look into
the issue, he added.

Museum curator doubts authenticity of Egyptian statue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An Egyptian statue auctioned last week in France
for 5.1 million francs (about dlrs 911,000) may be a fake, a German
museum curator says in an article published Monday.
	   The statue, which depicts the Eygptian pharaoh Sesostris III
sitting on a throne, set a French record for an archaeological
piece when it was sold at the Drouot auction house.
	   But a German museum curator, speaking anonymously to the
newspaper Liberation, said his museum had turned down an offer to
buy the statue in the early '80s.
	   ``I had serious reasons to think it had been made in the first
half of the 20th century,'' the curator was quoted as saying. The
statue is dated to 1878-1843 B.C.
	   The curator, who said he requested anonymity because he didn't
want to get his institution involved, told the paper the
proportions of the body to the throne were ``abnormal,'' as were
those of the legs and the head.
	   A spokesman for the auction house declined comment Monday.
	   But auctioneer Olivier Coutau-Begarie told the newspaper he was
aware of the curator's doubts, but that other specialists had
vouched for the statue's authenticity.

Thailand asks Malaysia to relax currency controls on border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thailand asked Malaysia on Monday
to relax currency controls along its border because they've hurt
trade and tourism, a Thai official said.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai made the request in a meeting
with his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, Thai government
spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said.
	   The Malaysian currency, the ringgit, has been used freely along
with the Thai baht in some areas in Thailand that border Malaysia.
But since Malaysia implemented capital controls in September, trade
and tourism have slowed in the areas because the ringgit now cannot
be used in Thailand, Akapol said.
	   ``It creates a black market,'' he said.
	   Malaysians are the biggest foreign tourists in Thailand, most of
them crossing the border to visit the southern part of the
Southeast Asian country.
	   Malaysia said it would send officials to Thailand to look into
the issue, Akapol added.
	   In an effort to protect itself from the effects of Asia's
currency crisis, Malaysia fixed the ringgit in September at 3.8 to
the U.S. dollar, banned trading in ringgit outside the country and
limited Malaysians and non-residents to carrying only 1,000 ringgit
abroad.
	   The two leaders are in Malaysia for meetings of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.

Bahrain jails eight, including two for life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A special court jailed eight Bahraini men
for periods ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment on charges
of sabotage, government-controlled newspapers reported Monday.
	   The State Security Court, which also tried two men in absentia,
sentenced one to life imprisonment and the other to 10 years.
	   It acquitted two others, Bahrain's Arabic and English-language
newspapers said, adding that the verdicts were handed down
Saturday. There was no explanation for the delay in reporting them.
	   The newspapers did not give any details of the case, which was
apparently linked to the unrest by Bahrain's Shiite community which
is demanding for political reforms.
	   The defendants were charged with ``possessing, manufacturing and
using explosives and committing arson and subversive acts in public
places, a hotel and a commercial complex'' between 1995 and 1996,
the English-language Gulf Daily News said.
	   It said two men were jailed for life while one was sentenced to
15 years and five to 10 years in jail.
	   The State Security Court was set up in March 1996 to deal with
cases arising from political unrest in Bahrain, which has left more
than 40 people dead since its outbreak in 1994. The court's
verdicts cannot be appealed.
	   Bahrain, an island nation that is home to an important U.S. Navy
base, has been shaken by unrest blamed on Shiite Muslim activists,
who demand political and social reforms.
	   Hundreds of activists have been detained in connection with the
violence, which has included bombings and arson attacks.
	   Shiites are in slight majority among Bahrain's 400,000 citizens.
The ruling Al Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream Sunni sect
of Islam.

Cambodian Asian Games team still waiting for budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Less than a month before the opening
of the Asian Games, impoverished Cambodia's team is still waiting
for money promised by the cash-strapped Phnom Penh government, a
sports official said Monday.
	   Meas Sarin, secretary-general of Cambodia's Olympic Committee,
said the Asian Games team has attracted some outside sponsorship,
but a promised dlrs 72,000 budget from the Finance Ministry has not
been disbursed.
	   ``I am very worried,'' Meas Sarin said after an Olympic
Committee meeting. ``Now we are already running our budget, so I
will have to go to the Finance Ministry to be sure on that.''
	   Finance Minister Keat Chhon evaded reporters' questions about
the Asian Games budget Monday, saying the government was hard-hit
by a general budget shortage and that paying civil servants was its
first priority.
	   ``We will have to decide on that,'' Keat Chhon said of the
Cambodian team's budget. ``I don't want to be very specific on that
issue.''
	   The approved budget is less than the dlrs 92,800 requested by
the committee, but Meas Sarin said the addition of outside
sponsorship had boosted the team for the games in Bangkok to 70
athletes.
	   The 18-member soccer team has attracted a private sponsor, and
the Cambodians will send 25 athletes to compete in sepak takraw
after Thailand's sepak takraw association lent a helping hand, Meas
Sarin said.
	   Sepak takraw, resembling a fusion of volleyball and soccer, is
popular in Thailand.
	   Cambodia's remaining 27 athletes are to compete in taekwondo,
karate, boxing, wushu, track and field events, badminton, beach
volleyball, swimming and table tennis.

Rebels near Brazzaville kill 45 worshipers in church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ An outlawed militia force
gunned down 45 worshipers in a church during a weekend raid in the
Republic of Congo, witnesses and state-run radio reported Monday.
	   At least six of the victims were members of an independent peace
delegation trying to halt the increasingly frequent attacks.
	   The killings took place in a church in the town of Mindouli,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) southeast of the capital,
Brazzaville, the radio report said.
	   Townspeople contacted by telephone confirmed the attack and said
12 women and several local officials were killed in the attack.
	   The ``Ninja'' rebel group responsible for the attack have links
to former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas.
	   The bodies of 20 rebels were found in the church with the other
victims, triggering speculation the attack may have been motivated
by an internal dispute within the militia force.
	   The weekend killings are just the latest in a growing number of
attacks on civilian and government targets in the southern Republic
of Congo. The violence in recent months has shattered the relative
peace enjoyed here since the end of this central African country's
brutal civil war last year.
	   Just weeks earlier, 13 people were killed during a clash between
Ninja rebels and Congolese security forces.
	   The dead included three civilians and ten policemen, caught in
the crossfire as security forces launched an assault on the Ninja
militia in the town of Mouyondzi, 350 kilometers (560 miles)
southwest of Brazzaville.
	   The Ninjas have stepped up a campaign of violence in the region
against the government of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
	   Dozens of officials have been killed over the past few months,
news reports say.
	   The Ninjas backed Kolelas during Republic of Congo's civil war
last year. Kolelas, a sometime-ally of ousted President Pascal
Lissouba, went into exile when the war ended, but elements of his
militia have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign against
his government.
	   Lissouba was ousted by Sassou-Nguesso, a former Congolese
president, during the five-month war. Sassou-Nguesso was later
declared president again.
	   Since his take over, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including his own Cobras.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Self-proclaimed anarchists pelted Greece's
premier and education minister with eggs and tomatoes Monday during
a ceremony to mark a 1973 student uprising against military rulers.
	   Premier Costas Simitis and Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis
hastily left after placing wreaths outside the Athens Polytechnic,
where as many as 37 students died in clashes with soldiers and
police on Nov. 17, 1973.
	   The student rebellion was credited with helping topple the
1967-74 military junta.
	   Arsenis reportedly received the worst of the bombardment by a
small group of demonstrators who claim to oppose all forms of
authority. Simitis' security guards shielded him with umbrellas.
	   Riots, including attacks on businesses and police, have often
followed the marches and memorials on the anniversary. Greece's
most deadly terrorist group, November 17, takes it name from the
day of the crackdown on the student revolt.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cold weather in Moscow killed 13 people over the
last week, Russian news agencies reported Monday.
	   The 13 died from hypothermia, while 37 others were hospitalized
with frostbite, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the city's
health committee.
	   The deaths brought the number of people killed by the cold in
Moscow over the last two weeks to 22. Temperatures were below
freezing through much of last week.
	   The cold claims dozens of lives in Moscow each winter. The
majority of victims are either homeless or drunk.

Brazilian star launches institute for slum children

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ronaldo on Monday launched a new institute aimed
at offering children from Brazilian slums a way off the streets
through training in football and other sports.
	   The Instituto R9 will be part of a privately funded foundation
being set up in a southern suburb of Rio de Janeiro, intended to
receive some 3,000 children and teen-agers.
	   The sports and leisure complex should open by the end of next
year.
	   It will be partly funded by proceeds from a new watch made by
Swiss manufacturer Montega, Ronaldo told a news conference.
	   ``You could consider me the big brother of these children,''
added the Brazil star, who plays for Inter Milan of Italy.
	   Ronaldo is also in Geneva to promote a United Nations campaign
to increase awareness of the dangers of the AIDS virus among young
people. He joined the campaign in May.
	   The striker was upbeat about a knee injury that kept him out of
league action last weekend. ``Hopefully I'll be able to play again
very soon,'' he said.
	   Suffering from World Cup stress and troubled by tendinitis in
both knees, Ronaldo has been often sidelined this season.
	   But ``my health is fine,'' he said. ``I'm getting much better.''

New U.S. ambassador arrives in Luanda, urges peace in Angola, Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The new U.S. Ambassador arrived Monday and
told reporters he aimed to push for the conclusion of Angola's
ailing peace process and a cease-fire in neighboring Congo, where
Angola has deployed troops.
	   ``I will work to widen and deepen the relations between our two
peoples and governments and intensify talks on national and
regional matters,'' Joseph Sullivan said in a brief statement at
Luanda airport.
	   He said that at the top of his agenda was the full
implementation of Angola's 1994 peace accord, which ended a
two-decade civil war, and bringing peace to Congo.
	   ``This is a difficult moment for Angola and Africa. The conflict
in neighboring Congo is a serious threat to stability in the entire
region,'' Sullivan said.
	   The peace pact between the government and rebel group UNITA has
still not been fully implemented because UNITA has refused to hand
over its central highland strongholds and the government has
threatened to take them by force.
	   Angola and three other countries have provided troops to help
Congo President Laurent Kabila quell a rebellion backed by Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   Sullivan replaced Donald Steinberg who left the country last
week.

Dion Dublin looks set to start in England vs. Czechs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dion Dublin, who has scored five goals in two
games since moving from Coventry to Aston Villa, is expected to
spearhead an aging England attack in Wednesday's friendly against
the Czech Republic at Wembley.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle looks set to give the 29-year-old
Dublin a starting place up front with 35-year-old Ian Wright _ a
strike force with a combined age of 64.
	   Another old-timer expected to play Wednesday is 30-year-old
forward Paul Merson.
	   Hoddle is forced to juggle his lineup after a rash of injuries
has depleted his squad, with top strikers Michael Owen, Alan
Shearer and Teddy Sheringham among those sidelined.
	   Owen pulled a hamstring last Tuesday in Liverpool's 3-1 League
Cup defeat to Tottenham, while Shearer suffered the same injury
Saturday in Newcastle's 1-1 tie against Sheffield Wednesday.
	   Manchester United forward Paul Scholes is also doubtful for
Wednesday's game after he, too, suffered a hamstring injury during
United's 3-2 win Saturday over Blackburn.
	   Sheringham has been sidelined for some time already, while young
Leicester striker Emile Heskey suffered an ankle injury last week
after winning his first England call-up.
	   Despite the injuries, it would be hard for Hoddle to ignore
Dublin, who has been in spectacular form since making a
5.75-million-pound (dlrs 9.2 million) transfer to Aston Villa
earlier this month.
	   Dublin scored twice in his Villa debut and added a hat track in
Saturday's 4-1 win over Southampton, giving the club a three-point
lead over Manchester United at the top of the Premier League.
	   Dublin played for England in World Cup warmups last spring
against Chile, Morocco and Belgium but failed to make the squad for
the World Cup in France.
	   Wright, meanwhile, is playing as well as ever this season since
moving from Arsenal to West Ham. He hasn't played for England since

Mahathir explains Malaysia's political turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Monday attempted to deflect the mounting criticism of the
government's treatment of his former deputy.
	   Mahathir said he explained the political situation in Malaysia
to several leaders who are in Kuala Lumpur for the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit beginning Tuesday.
	   ``Some asked about the case of conflict in the country, and we
explained,'' Mahathir told Malaysian reporters.
	   Mahathir's comments were released by the government news agency,
Bernama.
	   Mahathir has made angry comments about the coverage of
anti-government protests by the foreign press, describing these
reports as exaggerated.
	   On Monday, Australian Prime Minister John Howard joined a
growing list of leaders who have expressed concern for Anwar
Ibrahim, who is in jail facing trial on 10 counts of corruption and
illegal sex acts.
	   ``I expressed the concern that was felt in Australia about the
issue and we had a lengthy discussion about it,'' Howard said after
meeting with Mahathir.
	   ``It is not a question of being slighted, but according to our
customs here we will not interfere in the affairs of other
countries,'' Mahathir said. ``If other people feel they want to
interfere, that is their right, we do not question.''
	   Howard said his foreign minister met secretly with Anwar's wife,
Azizah Ismail, Sunday to discuss his case. He described the
conversation as ``frank and courteous.''
	   Mahathir also met with Philippines President Joseph Estrada, but
they did not discuss Anwar, a Filipino official said.
	   But Estrada has openly expressed support for the former No. 2,
whose arrest and subsequent beating in by police in custody
triggered a wave of condemnation worldwide.
	   After the meeting, Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon
said Anwar's trial was transparent because Malaysia had allowed
international observers to monitor it.
	   On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with
Azizah and described Anwar as a ``respected leader.'' Malaysian
officials described the meeting as an undiplomatic interference in
its affairs.
	   Mahathir said he did not know if the leaders who met him Monday
had changed their views about Anwar.
	   ``That we do not know. They did not vote, but only listened,''
he said. ``We are happy that they could see the actual situation.''
	   Mahathir also held bilateral talks with South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Chinese
Taipei Representative Chiang Pin Kung, Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Brunei's Sultan
Hassanal Bolkiah.
	   None of these countries has commented on the Anwar case.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph
Estrada met with his Malaysian counterpart Monday but did not bring
up the plight of jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   While officials from some other countries attending this week's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have discussed Anwar's
case, the Philippines did not think it was necessary, Philippine
Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said.
	   ``Anwar is not an official issue between the two countries,'' he
said.
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific Rim countries and Hong Kong are in
Malaysia for an annual APEC summit.
	   The case of Anwar -- ousted as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, then jailed and beaten by police -- has dominated the
summit sidelines.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, on Sunday night. On Saturday, two Canadian
Cabinet members also met with Azizah.
	   Estrada was the first foreign leader to publicly criticize the
jailing of Anwar, whom he considers a friend. He even considered
boycotting the APEC summit, but later changed his mind.
	   His meeting with Mahathir was arranged only on Saturday,
reportedly because Estrada was uncertain whether he wanted to see
the Malaysian prime minister.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his ouster set off
massive anti-government protests. He has pleaded innocent to 10
charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Siazon said the Philippines believes the trial is going well.
	   ``There is transparency,'' he said. ``So far so good.''
	   Several Philippine congressmen, concerned about Anwar's human
rights and prison conditions, attended the first week of the trial
along with dozens of other foreign observers.
	   In their meeting, Estrada and Mahathir also agreed on the need
for better surveillance of international capital flows, especially
of short-term capital and hedge funds, Siazon said.
	   The two leaders also discussed the political situation in
Indonesia, and ``both hope that the political transformation
process can proceed smoothly,'' Siazon said.

Italian priest feasts on favorite foods after 68-day captivity

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ An Italian priest feasted on pasta,
red wine and cappuccino ice cream Monday after being freed by the
kidnappers who held him for 68 harrowing days in the jungles of the
southern Philippines.
	   Gaunt, bearded and 10 kilograms (22 pounds) lighter, the Rev.
Luciano Benedetti was freed late Sunday. Since his kidnapping Sept.
8 in the southern Zamboanga peninsula, he had survived on little
food, consisting mostly of rice and dried fish.
	   His fellow Italian missionaries welcomed him back with a feast,
mostly his favorite dishes _ tortellini, pork chop in tomato sauce
and fruit cake.
	   The locally made ice cream is ``good but it's still not Italian
ice cream. It's better than nothing,'' he told reporters.
	   While in captivity, Benedetti said, he was forced to walk
barefoot for hours day and night in Zamboanga's jungles. His
captors fed him rice, dried fish, boiled jackfruit seeds and, if he
was lucky, cheap noodles.
	   At one point, he thought of going on hunger strike to pressure
his captors to free him but never got to do it.
	   A few hours out of captivity, the 54-year-old priest immediately
savored the taste of freedom _ in style. He was whisked off in a
white Lear jet from Mindanao to Manila, accompanied by top aides of
President Joseph Estrada.
	   In a Philippine air force base lounge, he was hugged by fellow
Italian missionaries, got a buss on the cheek from Graziella
Simbolloti, Italy's ambassador to Manila, and was mobbed by
journalists. He was then taken to a religious house in a limousine
flying the Italian flag.
	   Benedetti said he was freed on the 20th anniversary of his
assignment as a missionary in the Philippines. He plans to see his
mother and vacation briefly in Italy, and then return to missionary
work in Mindanao, a politically volatile region, despite the
abduction. ``I'll be careful next time,'' he said.

Brazilian star launches institute for slum children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ronaldo launched a new institute Monday meant to
offer children from Brazilian slums a way off the streets through
training in football and other sports.
	   The Instituto R9 will be part of a privately funded foundation
being set up in a southern suburb of Rio de Janeiro, intended to
receive some 3,000 children and teen-agers.
	   The sports and leisure complex should open by the end of next
year.
	   It will be partly funded by proceeds from a new watch made by
Swiss manufacturer Montega, Ronaldo said at a news conference.
	   ``You could consider me the big brother of these children,''
added the Brazilian star, who plays for Inter Milan of Italy.
	   Ronaldo is also in Geneva to promote a U.N. campaign to increase
awareness of the dangers of the AIDS virus among young people. He
joined the campaign in May.
	   The striker was upbeat about a knee injury that kept him out of
league action last weekend. ``Hopefully I'll be able to play again
very soon,'' he said.
	   Suffering from World Cup stress and troubled by tendinitis in
both knees, Ronaldo has been often sidelined this season.
	   But ``my health is fine,'' he said. ``I'm getting much better.''

German parliament to debate Holocaust Memorial in early 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ Parliament will debate plans for a
national Holocaust Memorial early next year, the government's new
culture secretary said Monday.
	   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl put the much-delayed project on
hold this summer, saying the subject was too sensitive to risk
letting it become part of the election campaign.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, who defeated Kohl in the Sept. 27 election,
has expressed doubts about the appropriateness of the design and
site, a large square in the heart of Berlin.
	   His culture czar, Michael Naumann, renewed his criticisms after
visiting the former Nazi concentration camp Sachsenhausen, just
north of Berlin.
	   Naumann has argued that the memory of the Holocaust can better
be passed on to future generations by preserving the crumbling
concentration camps as ``authentic'' museums.
	   ``For me supporting the concentration camps has political
priority,'' he said.
	   However, he also said he would meet next month with U.S.
architect Peter Eisenman to discuss his design for the Holocaust
Memorial, which was favored by the project backers.
	   His design proposes a labyrinth of 2,700 pillars resembling a
cemetery.

Iglesias skips Jakarta visit because of riots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias has
canceled a planned concert in Jakarta because of recent violence
triggered by student protests, promoters said Monday.
	   Iglesias was due in the Indonesian capital Nov. 14-17 for a
promotional tour, but overflew the city and landed on the tourist
island of Bali after learning of the violence, the official Antara
news agency reported.
	   At least 16 people have been killed since last Thursday in
protests by students demanding democratic reforms, and in rioting
in which rampaging mobs burned buildings and cars and attacked
police.
	   ``The developments in Jakarta have prompted us to cancel Julio's
promo tour because we don't want to take any risk,'' said Sundari,
an official of Soni Music Indonesia, which organized the tour.
	   She said Iglesias, who came in his private jet, had been
scheduled to land at Jakarta's Halim Perdana Kusumah airport
Friday.
	   In Bali, Iglesias was to shoot a video clip for the song ``To
All The Girls I've Loved Before,'' which he was to perform along
with Indonesian singer Andre Hehanussa.

Justice at last in case involving atrocities against Serbs

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal Monday convicted
three men of war crimes against Bosnian Serbs in 1992, but dropped
some murder and torture charges against them and acquitted their
top commander.
	   In its first case to deal with atrocities against Serbs, the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of
responsibility for war crimes committed at a Bosnian government-run
prison camp under his overall command.
	   Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal
Delalic's acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of
the appeal.
	   ``Let me thank you for a just and fair judgment,'' Delalic told
the court. ``I think it is a very wise judgment and a very
courageous one ... the judgment has even increased my trust in this
institution.''
	   The tribunal convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of
11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because
he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic,
wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his neck,
smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison.
	   Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia said he
was considering appealing Mucic's ``inadequate'' sentence.
	   Mucic's conviction was the first by an international court on
the basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of
their subordinates.
	   ``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those
under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without
taking any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus
Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria.
	   Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found
guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing
other inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years by Karibi-Whyte, who
denounced rape as ``a despicable act which strikes at the very core
of human dignity and physical integrity.''
	   Delic's defense attorney, Tom Moran of Texas, said he would
likely appeal Delic's conviction and sentence.
	   Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three
prisoners and torturing at least three others and was sentenced to
15 years. His attorneys also are likely to appeal the conviction.
	   All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment, the
maximum punishment at the tribunal, which has no death penalty.
	   A charge against Delic and Mucic of plundering property was
dismissed by the three-judge panel.
	   Mucic also was cleared of responsibility for four murders and
three cases of mistreatment or torture of prisoners. Delic was
cleared of two murders, and of command responsibility for other
killings at Celebici. He was also acquitted of three cases of
torture and of responsibility for other tortures at the camp.
	   Landzo was cleared of one murder charge and one torture count.

Iraq raises exports to 2 million barrels per day despite crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Despite tension over U.N. weapons
inspections, Iraq honored an earlier pledge to boost its exports up
to 2 million barrels per day since the beginning of November,
senior Oil Ministry officials said Monday.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said at times exports hit 2.2 million barrels when more than three
tankers were available for loading at export terminals.
	   They said they hoped to maintain this level of exports until the
end of the current phase of the oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations despite lack of spare parts and the dilapidated state of
facilities.
	   The Oil Ministry has contingency plans to minimize impact of
bombing on production, refining and export facilities. The
officials acknowledged that such measures were taken. They did not
specify what they were.
	   The crisis deepened when Iraq decided on October 31 to end all
forms of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission disarming it
under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms.
	   Baghdad on Saturday agreed to allow the inspectors to resume
their activities, averting air and missile strikes by the United
States and Britain to force full compliance.
	   The Oil Ministry officials said they were determined to honor
the 59 oil contracts for a total of 308.4 million barrels they
signed with foreign companies under the present leg of partial oil
exports.
	   Last month Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amir Mohammed Rashid said his
country had to lower the quality of its crude oil exports in order
to boost sales and revenue.
	   He said Iraqi crude now had a lower API gravity and higher
sulfur content.
	   The officials admitted the industry was facing difficultes but
said they hoped to overcome most of them when oil spare parts start
arriving in Iraq.
	   Under U.N. decisions, Iraq is allowed to buy dlrs 300 million of
equipment to repair the industry.
	   In the current six-month phase Iraq can export dlrs 5.2 of oil.
But the government says low oil prices and production bottlenecks
will not let Iraq generate more than dlrs 3.5 million during the
present leg expected to expire November 25.
	   The previous limit on oil exports was dlrs 2 billion. The oil
deal skirts U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading
Kuwait in 1990 to help the government buy food, medicine and other
needs for the 22 million Iraqis.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States and Japan
announced proposals Monday night to pump an additional dlrs 10
billion into troubled Asian economies to help lift the region out

Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Details of the measures were announced Monday by U.S. Vice

	   According to Gore, the new dlrs 5 billion in U.S. support
includes dlrs 1 billion each in loans to Indonesia, Thailand and
South Korea, the three countries hardest hit by the Asia crisis.
The remaining dlrs 2 billion will provide loan guarantees through
the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support private
business deals.
	   ``We want to do all we can to encourage trade and investment
here, so American businesses can be an active partner in your
growth and recovery,'' Gore told a meeting of business leaders.
	   Gore repeated U.S. insistence that Asia will not be able to
recover unless Japan does more to revive it own economy and deal
with its troubled banking sector.
	   Because of legal restraints, the United States is not providing
any direct financial support to the dlrs 5 billion joint
initiative. The exact amounts that Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Bank will put up for this have yet to be determined.
	   The package of new proposals follows an offer last month by
Japan to provide dlrs 30 billion in credit to ailing Asian
economies.
	   Gore's speech also made a direct reference to the troubles that
have erupted in Malaysia since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
fired and jailed his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.

Girl gets millions after cosmetic surgery results in brain damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A girl who suffered severe brain damage after
routine surgery to remove a strawberry birthmark on her forehead
received a 3.9 million pound (dlr 6.5 million) settlement Monday
from her anesthetist.
	   Helen Edwards was left blind and unable to crawl, eat or talk
after the 1986 cosmetic surgery at Hope Nursing Home in
Cambridgeshire, central England, which took place when she was 5.
	   After years of help from her parents and volunteers in their
Suffolk village of Elmset, Helen, now 17, can see again and has
recovered some movement, her lawyers said.
	   The anesthetist, Dr. Thomas Ogg, admitted liability in 1994, but
the girl's family still had to fight for the amount of money needed
to provide for her round-the-clock care.
	   Helen's father, Roger Edwards, said the High Court settlement
``will seem like a lot of money to most people, but Helen must pay
others to facilitate her every activity, 24 hours a day.''
	   ``The settlement is welcome for the security it brings to
Helen's future, but the fact is that we would rather have our
daughter back as she was, rather than all the money in the world,''
he said.
	   The court approved a payment of 150,000 pounds (dlrs 250,000) to
Helen's parents, noting they both had given up their careers to
devote their time to their daughter.

 &UR; Japan and US announce plans to fight Asian financial crisis
 &UR; Eds: Combine urgent series.
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States and Japan
announced proposals Monday night to pump an additional dlrs 10
billion into troubled Asian economies to help lift the region out
of its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The package of new proposals would include dlrs 5 billion in new
support offered by the United States, and the creation of a new
dlrs 5 billion joint initiative supported by the United States,
Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Details of the measures were announced Monday by U.S. Vice
President Al Gore, who was attending an economic summit in place of
President Bill Clinton, and by a Japanese official in Tokyo.
	   According to Gore, the new dlrs 5 billion in U.S. support
includes dlrs 1 billion each in loans to Indonesia, Thailand and
South Korea, the three countries hardest hit by the Asia crisis.
The remaining dlrs 2 billion will provide loan guarantees through
the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support private
business deals.
	   ``We want to do all we can to encourage trade and investment
here, so American businesses can be an active partner in your
growth and recovery,'' Gore told a meeting of business leaders.
	   Gore repeated U.S. insistence that Asia will not be able to
recover unless Japan does more to revive it own economy and deal
with its troubled banking sector.
	   Because of legal restraints, the United States is not providing
any direct financial support to the dlrs 5 billion joint
initiative. The exact amounts that Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Bank will put up for this have yet to be determined.
	   The package of new proposals follows an offer last month by
Japan to provide dlrs 30 billion in credit to ailing Asian
economies.
	   Gore's speech also made a direct reference to the troubles that
have erupted in Malaysia since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
fired and jailed his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Gore said that there were growing calls for democracy among many
nations.
	   ``We hear them today, _ right here right now_ among the brave
people of Asia,'' he said.

Reports: Netanyahu threatens to suspend troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, UPDATES with Netanyahu refusing comment. quote
from Cabinet minister. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to suspend an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
scheduled for this week, unless the Palestinians drop plans to
declare statehood in May, Israeli radio reports said.
	   Netanyahu refused to speak to reporters after appearing before
parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee.
	   The office of Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said
the radio reports were correct, but Bar-Illan himself was not
immediately available for comment.
	   Israeli Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav said that if Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat ``does not retract those declarations he has
made ... there is no point in continuing to give him strategic
territory.'
	   It was not clear whether Katsav, who abstained when the Cabinet
ratified the peace accord last week, expressed his personal view.
Israel army radio said Netanyahu phoned Katsav and told him that he
was in favor of suspending the troop pullback.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu of trying
to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop
trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour said.
	   The dispute was the latest to hold up the agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Israel's parliament was to begin its two-day debate of the
agreement on Monday afternoon with a major policy speech by
Netanyahu. A vote was expected Tuesday, with at least 90 of 120
legislators likely to support the agreement.
	   Under a timetable worked out Sunday night, Israel was to
withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank and release 250
Palestinian security prisoners by Friday.
	   However, Israel radio and Israel army radio said Netanyahu
decided Monday that he would not go ahead with the withdrawal
unless Arafat retracts his statements regarding independence.
	   May marks the end of the five-year period of Palestinian
autonomy. By this time, Israel and the Palestinians are to have
worked out a permanent peace agreement. However, at this stage it
appears unlikely the deadline can be met since complex issues, such
as final borders and the future of Jerusalem, are on the agenda.
	   In recent days, Arafat said repeatedly that he would declare
independence in May, regardless of whether a peace accord is in
place by then and despite Israel's warnings that it might annex
parts of the West Bank in response.
	   Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, suggested that
Arafat's renewed talk about independence was little more than an
attempt to make sure Israel is not dragging out the negotiations.
``The only thing President Arafat wants is to end final status
talks on May 4,'' Erekat said.
	   Asfour said he was surprised by the change of direction, noting
that the Israeli government informed the Palestinians as late as
Sunday evening that the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled.
	   Israel was also angered by an Arafat speech Sunday to loyalists
from his Fatah movement in which he hinted that the Palestinians
were keeping open the option of armed struggle and that ``our rifle
is ready.''
	   Arafat softened his statement Monday, saying that the
Palestinians had made peace their strategic choice and that they
remained committed to the Wye agreement. The clarification was
issued by Arafat adviser Nabil Amr.
	   Still, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Monday that
Arafat was close to provoking Israel into walking away from the
agreement.
	   `If the Palestinians keep the agreement, they will receive what
was promised,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders.
	   ``If they don't keep it, they won't receive anything, and I
think that this week, they brought the situation in which they will
not receive very much closer,'' Sharon said.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
Sunday to Jewish settlers to grab West Bank hilltops now before the
two sides reach a permanent territorial agreement over the area
where the Palestinians want to build their future state.
	   Arafat said Sharon's remarks constituted a violation of the
peace accord. Asfour accused Sharon of incitement and demanded an
apology from Netanyahu.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there, with the stated aim of
seizing as much land as they can before the troop withdrawal.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Thirteen people were injured during mass
Monday when a gas canister attached to a sandwich vending cart
exploded in a churchyard in southern Egypt, setting ablaze the

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Habibie speech, TRIMS. Many Indonesians use only
one name &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ After police questioned 11 prominent
opposition figures, President B.J. Habibie warned Monday that
agitators had manipulated student activists involved in deadly
clashes with security forces.
	   The opposition leaders, including two retired military generals,
were interrogated following mob riots and clashes between students
and police and soldiers last week. At least 16 people, including
eight students, were killed.
	   The violence was the worst in Jakarta since May, when much
heavier rioting swept the city and helped unseat authoritarian
President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   In a nationally televised address, Habibie said the government
would bring to justice whomever was responsible for last Friday's
killings of student protesters, including members of the security
forces. But he directed the blame at unidentified groups he said
were intent on fomenting anarchy.
	   ``The students' movement, a bearer of moral messages, has been
spoiled by irresponsible groups that want to make use of the
students for their own objective of attacking the government,''
Habibie said.
	   ``The Nov. 13 incident constitutes a fresh example for all of us
of how dangerous and costly anarchic actions can be,'' he added.
	   There were at least half a dozen small anti-government protests
in Jakarta Monday, all of them peaceful. Many shops reopened and
rush-hour traffic choked the Indonesian capital's main boulevard.
	   Habibie, Suharto's successor and one-time protege, has pledged
to move Indonesia toward democracy but protesters suspect he is
intent on preserving the privileges of the political elite. The
killings of the students, shot by riot officers with plastic
bullets, have fueled their anger.
	   During his speech, Habibie stood at a podium at the presidential
palace, flanked by military chief Gen. Wiranto and Feisal Tanjung,
political affairs minister and former head of the armed forces.
	   The president, who relies heavily on the support of the
politically powerful military, has ignored calls to fire Wiranto
because of the student killings.
	   Most of the opposition activists undergoing police questioning
signed a petition last week calling for Habibie's replacement with
a transitional government led by a presidium of community leaders,
and for general elections to be held immediately.
	   Those already questioned include former political prisoner Sri
Bintang Pamungkas, Lt. Gen. Ali Sadikan, a former Cabinet minister
and Jakarta governor, and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide to
opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Early Monday, officers detained Haryono, an intellectual who is
active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association, and
Permadi Satrio Wiwoho, an outspoken fortune teller.
	   National police chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi said the 11 activists
had been questioned, not detained, and that more activists would be
called in for interrogation.
	   Echoing Habibie's remarks, Education Minister Yuwono Sudarsono
said that ``radical groups'' had made sure young students were at
the front of the protests, knowing that deaths or injuries would
stir public anger.
	   He said the groups had occupied offices in buildings near
protest areas from which they coordinated the demonstrations.
	   Human rights workers accused the government of trying to turn
the activists into scapegoats as condemnation mounted over the
student deaths.
	   In his speech, Habibie said the government assembly that sparked
the student protests last week had ``succeeded in producing decrees
that reflect the aspirations and hopes of the people.''
	   The nation's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly, agreed to hold parliamentary elections in May or June and
choose a president in late 1999.
	   However, it did not heed a student demand that it ban the
military from politics. The assembly is filled with holdovers from
the Suharto era.
	   In another protest Monday, thousands of anti-government student
protesters peacefully occupied the local parliament building in the
eastern city of Palu, the official Antara news agency reported.
Protests were held in several other cities.

Yeltsin meets with Primakov, envoy to Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin visited his recently
released envoy to Chechnya at a Moscow hospital Monday and
conferred with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was heading to
an economic summit in Malaysia.
	   Yeltsin stopped by the Kremlin hospital to see Valentin Vlasov,
his envoy to the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Vlasov, taken
hostage six months ago by Chechen gunmen, was released last week
and is now recuperating after the ordeal.
	   Russian television showed a smiling Yeltsin embracing the
haggard-looking Vlasov and presenting him with a bouquet of red
roses.
	   During his visit to the hospital, Yeltsin didn't undergo any
medical checks, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Also Monday, Yeltsin met Primakov at the Gorky-9 presidential
residence near Moscow. The two discussed Primakov's preparations
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, Interfax said.
	   They also touched on other issues, including the Iraqi crisis,
Yakushkin said.
	   Over the weekend, Yeltsin sent a letter to Syrian President
Hafez Assad, reiterating Russia's adherence to political settlement
of the crisis, the presidential press service reported Monday.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who is traveling in the Middle
East, delivered the letter to the Syrian leader.
	   Yeltsin returned to work last week after returning from vacation
in the southern Russian resort town of Sochi. He has been sidelined
for a month by a respiratory infection, exhaustion, and unstable
blood pressure.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious illness and says he will serve
out his term, which ends in mid-2000. But he has mostly stayed home
from his office recently, rekindling concern about his ability to
govern.
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin is to host to German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in the Kremlin. Schroeder is in Moscow on a two-day
visit.

Planes carrying Russians from Baghdad arrive in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with deputy foreign minister's comments in grafs 1,
5-8. Trims, minor edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two planes carrying Russian women and children
evacuated from Baghdad arrived at an airport outside Moscow on
Monday, and a Foreign Ministry official called on both sides in the
Iraqi conflict ``to show restraint.''
	   More than 100 people, most of them relatives of Russians working
in the Iraqi capital, were taken overland to Kermanshah, Iran on
Sunday. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry sent two planes
to retrieve them, as well as one Ukrainian citizen, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The decision to evacuate the Russians was made ``in a rather
tense psychological situation,'' before the West, led by the United
States, backed down from its threat to carry out attacks on Iraq,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Sunday.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk said Monday that while
there was at present no threat of air strikes, tension remained
high, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``Much will depend on Iraq's goodwill. Whoever maintains contact
with Baghdad will try to persuade it to show wisdom,'' he was
quoted as saying.
	   Posuvalyuk said the weapons inspectors should return to work in
Iraq. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has reversed his decision to halt
the United Nations' monitoring of weapons sites.
	   ``We expect both sides to show restraint and work in a
level-headed way ... rather than to head for conflicts,'' Interfax
quoted him as saying.

Turkey to replace capital punishment with life in prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Justice minister submits draft bill to the
premier, Turks stage protest in front of Italian embassy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's justice minister submitted a
draft bill to the premier on Monday to abolish the death penalty
and gain the extradition of the leader of a Kurdish rebel group who
is considered the country's most wanted criminal.
	   ``If it is enacted by the Parliament, the death penalty will be
lifted,'' Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu told reporters after
meeting with Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   The draft bill, which will replace the death penalty with a
sentence of life in prison, was rushed out in a bid for the
extradition from Italy of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of a
14-year-old Kurdish guerrilla war for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome upon his arrival from Russia last
week.
	   It was unclear if the move to abolish the death penalty would
convince Italy.
	   Turkey has not carried out any executions since 1984 despite
issuing death sentences, but Italy has consistently opposed
extradition to any country if there is even the possibility of
capital punishment.
	   Meanwhile a group of Turks laid a black wreath at the gate of
the Italian embassy here on Monday to protest the beating of
Turkish journalists in Rome by supporters of Ocalan. Italian police
allegedly looked on without moving in during the clash Saturday.
	   The proposal to abolish the death penalty will be debated in the
Cabinet either Tuesday or Wednesday, Denizkurdu said.

	   ROME (AP) _ About 2,000 Kurds gathered outside a military
hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed
held, keeping up a hunger strike Monday to protest his detention.
	   Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome
to show their support for Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was
arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had
been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout
in Syria.
	   He has now appealed to Italy for asylum.
	   Italian news reports said Monday that Ocalan had written to
Premier Massimo D'Alema asking why he hadn't been granted asylum
yet. In excerpts published by the daily La Stampa, Ocalan said he
had been approached by ``some friends in Italy's Parliament'' and
``authoritive persons in your government,'' leading him to believe
Italy would grant him asylum.

Americans to aid backward eastern Hungary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEBRECEN, Hungary (AP) _ Economically blighted eastern Hungary
received welcome news Monday from U.S. Ambassador Peter Tufo, who
announced the opening of a new office designed to draw investment
to the region.
	   The United States-Eastern Hungary Partnership will work to
identify investment opportunities for foreigners, look for
potential economic partnerships, and expand existing businesses,
Tufo said.
	   The office, which will be up and running early next year, will
be the only one of its kind in Europe. It will replace the U.S.
Agency for International Development, which is pulling out of the
country because ``Hungary succeeded,'' Tufo said.
	   USAID set up shop in Hungary in 1991, working to help develop
the country's entrepreneurial spirit after decades of communist
rule.
	   Today, Hungary is a front-runner to join NATO and the European
Union.
	   Although Hungary is considered an economic success, disparities
exist from region to region.
	   ``The EU is not too happy about candidate countries with
regional disparities that are too great, so we are very much
interested in having this region catch up with the rest of the
country. We want to learn to fish, and not have others supply us
with fish,'' Debrecen Mayor Lajos Kosa said.
	   Eastern Hungary was especially hard hit by the collapse of
communism and of huge state-run enterprises, mainly heavy industry.
	   The region is attractive, Tufo said, because of its high
literacy rate, availability of skilled workers, good local
leadership and presence of U.S. businesses such as General
Electric.
	   USAID has spent dlrs 250 million in the region, financing shoe
manufacturing, poultry and meat processing projects, and computer
training for students.
	   The agency has had 262 projects in the country. Nearly half have
been in the nine counties of eastern Hungary.

Russia prepares launch of first international station component
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After months of delays, the first component of a
multibillion dollar international space station was placed on a
launch pad in central Kazakstan on Monday in preparation for
liftoff later this week.
	   The Zarya cargo module has been loaded with equipment,
disinfected, tested for air-tightness and filled with 4.5 metric
tons (5 tons) of fuel, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   It is the first piece of the ambitious International Space
Station, which has suffered periodic delays because Russia's cash
shortages have frequently prevented it from meeting production
deadlines.
	   The Zarya will be put into orbit about 160 kilometers (100
miles) above Earth by a Russian Proton booster rocket. From there,
Zarya will be propelled to a higher orbit by its own engines, which
are to be controlled from the ground, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The final orbit will pass 500 kilometers (310 miles) above Earth
at its highest point, and 350 kilometers (217 miles) above Earth at
the lowest, the report said.
	   During the next three days, engineers at the Baikonur
cosmodrome, which Russia rents from the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan, will connect all the necessary cables between Zarya and
Progress.
	   An international commission of experts on Thursday will ensure
the module is ready for launching, set for 9:40 a.m. Moscow time
(6:40 GMT) on Friday.
	   NASA is paying the Russian Space Agency up to dlrs 60 million to
make sure the launch date is met. Astronauts and cosmonauts cannot
live on the space station until the service module and its
life-support systems are in orbit.
	   The Zarya, with a design based on modules of older Soviet space
stations, cost dlrs 200 million, ITAR-Tass has said. The module can
stay in flight for 430 days without refueling, it said.
	   NASA is scheduled to launch a module of its own to link up with
the Zarya in December. The first crews are not expected on the
space station until the second half of 1999 or early 2000.

Russian border guards in Tajikistan thwart drug-smuggling attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards in Tajikistan startled two
drug smugglers who were trying to cross into the country from
Afghanistan on Monday, causing them to flee and leave behind three
sacks holding 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of drugs.
	   The incident occurred at the border section along the Pyandzh
River early Monday morning, the Interfax news agency reported. The
drugs dropped by the smugglers included 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of
heroin, the report said.
	   Russian border guards are stationed in the former Soviet
republic to guard against an influx of drugs and weapons and a
possible spillover of violence from Afghanistan.
	   Since the start of the year, the border guards have blocked 117
attempted border crossings, and detained 218 suspected
infiltrators, Interfax reported.
	   Thirty-four of these incidents resulted in exchanges of fire,
and four Russian border guards have been killed.
	   The border guards have seized a ton of drugs from various
smugglers, including 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of heroin, this
year, Interfax reported.

EU tightens rules on government subsidies to industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union nations agreed Monday to
tighten controls on the dlrs 45 billion a year they spend on state
aid to industry and make it easier for EU regulators to reclaim
unauthorized subsidies.
	   New regulations approved by industry ministers from the 15 EU
nations will give the EU's executive Commission more power to
demand immediate repayment of illegal aid and increase its scope to
monitor companies' compliance with conditions for receiving
subsidies.
	   Under EU law, governments must seek clearance from the
Commission, before paying state aids to industry. The Commission
can impose conditions on the subsidies, or veto payments judged to
violate rules governing fair competition within the 15-nation bloc.
	   The EU's top state-aid watchdog, Competition Commissioner Karel
Van Miert, welcomed the decision to reinforce his powers. ``From
now on, the Commission will be better equipped in its combat
against illegal subsidies and everything will be more open,'' he
said in a statement.
	   The Commission estimates EU governments paid 38 billion European
currency units (dlrs 45 billion) a year to manufacturing industry
from 1994 to 1996.
	   Britain's representative at Monday's meeting said the new rules
would help make European companies more competitive.
	   ``High volumes of aid to industry across the EU are a big brake
on our competitiveness,'' said Lord Simon, British Minister for
European trade. ``The era of huge rescue packages for failing firms
must come to an end.''
	   The new rules are expected to come into force in the first half
of 1999.

Reports: Netanyahu threatens to suspend troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Jewish settlers seizing a hill in the
West Bank, Netanyahu speaking to Arafat, U.S. comment, context
graf &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday withdraw from its promise to
begin a West Bank troop pullback later this week, with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying he and his Cabinet would first
have to decide whether the Palestinians violated the peace accord.
	   Netanyahu is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat who has renewed a pledge to declare independence in
May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to defend Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu called Arafat on Monday to seek clarifications, but
was not satisfied with Arafat's responses, Israel radio said.
	   Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call, but refused to
discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu of trying
to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop
trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour said.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Michael Stoltz said the Cabinet would meet
on Thursday to decide whether Arafat's statements were a breach of
the agreement and whether to go ahead with a first troop withdrawal
from 2 percent of the West Bank that was to be completed by Friday.
	   Netanyahu did not refer directly to a possible suspension of a
withdrawal. ``If they fulfill their part, we will fulfill our part.
At this moment, there are of course clear demands that we will
make, and they will have to fulfill them,'' he said.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday, a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon encouraged settlers to seize as much land as they can before
the troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   As part of the deal, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain
from provocative language,'' said Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   On Monday afternnon, Israel's parliament was to begin its
two-day debate of the agreement on Monday afternoon with a major
policy speech by Netanyahu. A vote was expected Tuesday, with at
least 90 of 120 legislators likely to support the agreement.
	   Under a time table worked out Sunday night, Israel was to
withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank and release 250
Palestinian security prisoners by Friday.
	   Sharon said Monday that Arafat was close to provoking Israel
into walking away from the agreement.
	   ``If the Palestinians keep the agreement, they will receive what
was promised,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders.
	   ``If they don't keep it, they won't receive anything, and I
think that this week, they brought the situation in which they will
not receive very much closer,'' Sharon said.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
to Jewish settlers to grab West Bank hilltops now before the two
sides reach a permanent territorial agreement over the area where
the Palestinians want to build their future state.
	   Arafat said Sharon's remarks constituted a violation of the
peace accord. Asfour accused Sharon of incitement and demanded an
apology from Netanyahu.
	   Sharon stood by his statement. ``If we are talking about seizing
the hills, there are ... hills that dominate the existing
settlements, state land, and this is aimed not at increasing
tension but on decreasing tension in the future,'' Sharon said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there.

Man sentenced for heroin-smuggling after truck wedges in tunnel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A drug smuggler arrested after his heroin-packed
truck proved too tall to clear a London tunnel was sentenced Monday
to 18 years in prison.
	   Hamid Shamsollahi's miscalculation in February left customs
agents with a cache of heroin worth more than 7 million pounds
(dlrs 11.7 million) and London motorists with one of the city's
biggest traffic jams in years.
	   Shamsollahi, an Amsterdam-based businessman, had been traveling
in another vehicle but doubled back to see what happened to the
truck after it got wedged in the Blackwall Tunnel, which runs under
the Thames River, prosecutors said.
	   Judge David Elfer imposed a 14-year sentence on the Turkish
truck driver, Mustafa Karinca, and a nine-year term on Korkut Eris,
another Turk who had been traveling with the Iranian-born
Shamsollahi.
	   Elfer said Shamsollahi was clearly a ``senior member'' of the
Turkish-Dutch gang behind the smuggling operation.
	   The false fuel tank installed to conceal the heroin was so
artfully constructed that it fooled customs agents when the truck
entered England, prosecutor David Green said.
	   But for the crucial error in judgment about the tunnel's height,
``their journey would not have been so rudely interrupted,'' he
said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore on
Monday indirectly supported a burgeoning reform movement in
Malaysia which has called for greater political freedoms and an end
to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Gore, in a speech to leaders of some of the world's largest
corporations, said that robust global markets depend on freedom and
democracy.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore,
who stepped in for President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Clinton canceled his visit to Malaysia to remain in Washington
and deal with the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   The ouster of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
his subsequent arrest and beating while in police custody outraged
world leaders. Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption
and sexual misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up
to undermine his challenge to Mahathir.
	   A series of violent demonstrations have rocked the normally
placid capital for the first time in three decades.
	   ``From Thailand to South Korea, Eastern Europe to Mexico,
democracies have done better in coping with economic crises than
nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore said.
	   ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue
to hear calls for democracy and reform in many languages. People's
power, doi moi, reformasi. We hear them today _ right here, right
now _ among the brave people of Malaysia.''
	   ``Reformasi,'' or reform in the Malay language, has become the
battle cry of the anti-government movement here. It was the same
chant used during the massive riots and student demonstrations in
neighboring Indonesia, a movement that led to the end of President
Suharto's 32-year rule.
	   On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
privately with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to express U.S. concern
over her husband's case.
	   For the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human
rights concerns have been widely discussed by the leaders, whose
goal is to promote free trade in the region.
	   During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's treatment and
trial. And New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
planned to do that on Tuesday.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Mahathir because of the Anwar affair.
	   At the end of his speech, however, Gore returned to the head
table and shook hands with the Malaysian prime minister.

Germany backs British plea for better cooperation in European arms
</HEADLINE>
making &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Germany urged its European Union partners Monday to
cooperate better in arms-making to help craft a stronger European
defense capability within the NATO alliance.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping's plea for a
``shakeup'' in Europe's top-heavy arms sector came as EU foreign
and defense ministers began two days of security talks.
	   Britain was expected to explain its new thinking on how Europe
can take a more independent defense stance. Until now, it worried a
go-it-alone Europe would erode Washington's long commitment to
European security through NATO.
	   But Prime Minister Tony Blair changed course last month,
endorsing the idea of making the Western European Union, the EU's
embryonic defense group, more effective.
	   Ahead of Monday's WEU session, he said the Europeans can make a
start of that by sharing more of the NATO defense burden and end
duplication in arms production.
	   There at least four tank-building programs in Europe, compared
to one in the United States, officials said. For infantry combat
vehicles, Europeans have 16 different programs, against three in
the United States. And while less than half a dozen U.S. companies
make helicopters and military planes, in Europe there are 10.
	   ``We need to reconstruct our forces together and make sure that
spending on defense in all nations matches the need,'' Blair wrote
last Friday in an opinion piece in the New York Times.
	   At his first WEU meeting, Scharping urged better efforts to
create ``a competitive, consolidated European armaments industry
... Part and parcel of that is a shakeup of European armaments
industries.''
	   The EU governments are debating the formation of a European
armaments agency by 2001. France, Germany, Italy and Britain _
countries that account for 80 percent of the European arms industry
_ have taken the lead by pledging to join forces in making arms
systems to end costly duplication.
	   That duplication has long been a nightmare at NATO where
military planners have had to contend with a hodge-podge of norms,
standards and ammunitions needs.
	   If the EU nations can make something of the WEU, they may at
last be able to project influence and security eastward, reducing
their reliance on the United States.
	   Waffling by EU governments has put Washington in the driver's
seat of peace efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo.
	   The WEU is made up of all 15 EU nations, except Austria,
Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a meeting that lasted twice as
long as scheduled, Vice President Al Gore and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Monday discussed Tibet and Taiwan, two impediments
to U.S.-Sino relations.
	   Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, is ``aiming at
splitting the motherland,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Zhu Bangzao after the meeting.
	   There was no comment from the U.S. delegation after the two-hour
meeting. Gore arrived Sunday to replace President Bill Clinton at
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Clinton canceled his
visit because of the Iraq crisis.
	   Last week, China protested Clinton's meeting with the Dalai Lama
and a U.S. Cabinet official's visit to Taiwan, claiming the United
States was interfering in China's domestic affairs.
	   The United States was violating commitments to recognize
Beijing's rule over Tibet and should refrain from political ties
with Taiwan, Zhu said.
	   Jiang told Gore he wanted Washington to ``to honor the
commitment to the one-country policy.''
	   According to him, Gore said U.S. policies on Tibet and China had
not changed.
	   The Chinese leader ``spent quite some time to expand on our
position and policies on Taiwan and Tibet in a clear manner.''
	   For the first decades of the Cold War, Washington was an ally of
Taiwan, an island China considers a rebel province. The United
States also provided funding for separatist guerrillas inside
Tibet, the Himalayan region Beijing has ruled, often harshly, for
48 years. The Dalai Lama has been living in exile in India since
1959.
	   China has tried to woo and pressure foreign governments to keep
Taiwan diplomatically isolated, and also wants to undermine the
Dalai Lama's credibility and popularity abroad.
	   The Dalai Lama and his ``clique are trying to mold the public
opinion to cheat the international community,'' Zhu said.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri met
Monday with President Mohammad Khatami during a daylong visit aimed
at expanding ties between Lebanon and Iran, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi received Hariri at Tehran's
Mehrabad Airport, the agency said.
	   Hariri then met with Khatami, who expressed his support for
Lebanon in its conflict with Israel, the agency said.
	   During his one-day visit, Hariri is also expected to hold talks
with Habibi and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who heads an
influential advisory council.
	   Hariri told reporters at the airport that during his visit he
will be looking into ways of expanding ties with Iran and
discussing regional developments with Iranian officials.
	   Hariri said that ties between Lebanon and Iran were growing and
that the two countries consult each other regularly, the agency
said.
	   Hariri, a Sunni Muslim backed by Syria and Saudi Arabia, had
been at odds with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
The Shiite Muslim guerrilla group has been leading the campaign to
drive Israeli forces from an enclave they occupy in southern
Lebanon.
	   Hariri's government has been concerned as well about Shiite
Iran's influence over Lebanese Shiites, who make up more than
one-third of Lebanon's 3.2 million people.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A miner was killed by falling rocks at a
mine in eastern Ukraine, bringing the number of Ukrainian miners
killed on the job this year to more than 330, officials said
Monday.
	   The accident occurred Sunday at the Kalinina mine in the Donetsk
region, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   No further details were provided.
	   A total of 1,402 workers have died in job-related accidents in
Ukraine in 1998, according to the State Committee for Labor Safety.
	   Of these, the largely government-owned coal industry has
accounted for 333 deaths, up from 290 for all of last year.
	   Despite frequent miner strikes, the cash-strapped government has
failed to modernize the deteriorating coal mines and improve safety
conditions.

More than 8,000 confirmed for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand expects 39 countries, regions
or organizations to send teams to the Asian Games, but is still
waiting for confirmation from Tajikistan, Mongolia and a
Palestinian team, the games' organizers said Monday.
	   Only Afghanistan is certain not to participate, said a press
release from the organizing committee of the Dec. 6-20 games in
Bangkok.
	   The lists submitted by participants so far show 8,804 athletes
and officials planning to come to the games, the statement said,
adding that the eventual number is expected to be 10,000.
	   It said the Olympic Council of Asia, the region's governing
sports body, had been in close contact with Tajikistan, Mongolia
and the Palestinians.
	   ``We will wait for their final reply until Nov. 20,'' it quoted
Warawut Sumon, head of Thailand's technical committee, as saying.
``At the same time, we are taking into consideration that some
teams may not make it to the regional games.''
	   Last week, Afghanistan said it would not send a team to the
games because it could not afford the expense. It added that its
sports minister and a second representative might show up to carry
the flag as a ceremonial gesture.
	   The organizers also said Monday that the Olympic Council of Asia
and the International Olympic Committee are both withholding
recognition of Afghanistan's national organizing committee for the
games because two separate parties claim to represent it.
	   All programs, participation and budgetary allocations for
Afghanistan's committee have been frozen, it quoted Abdul Muttaleb
Ahmad, OCA director general, as saying.
	   Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, meanwhile, received Thai
athletes and organizers Monday at his palace, and wished them good
luck and success.
	   ``Even though the country has faced financial trouble, Thailand
has shown the watching world that the crisis cannot be an obstacle
if there is sincerity and harmony among Thais to make this major
event happen,'' he added.

Swiss bank report on Holocaust assets delayed six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A massive search of Swiss banks for missing assets
of Holocaust victims is taking longer than expected, with the final
report delayed six months, a panel member said Monday.
	   Curt Gasteyger, a Geneva professor who is on the commission
headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,
confirmed that the panel hopes to finish its audit by the end of
March and write the final report by July.
	   Gasteyger said, however, that it had been clear for some time
that the commission would be unable to meet the original deadline
of December 31.
	   He claimed relations between the banks and the commission had
improved despite a report in the Geneva daily Le Temps that
tensions had increased.
	   The newspaper said banks were concerned about the mounting cost
of the investigation _ said by the paper to be close to a billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 730 million) by the end of the investigation _
and the prospect of the investigation being extended.
	   In a letter to the Swiss Bankers Association, reproduced in Le
Temps, Volcker says the report will not be ready until the middle
of 1999, adding that this is not a firm date.
	   The committee is investigating 63 Swiss banks believed to have
retained money in accounts belonging to Jewish victims of the
Nazis.
	   The two largest Swiss commercial banks have already agreed to
pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs for
lost assets.

DaimlerChrysler kicks off Day 1 early in Frankfurt

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With bells, parties and a blizzard of
publicity, the newly merged DaimlerChrysler comes into being
Tuesday when its stock begins trading on 19 financial markets
around the world.
	   A cocktail reception, live broadcasts to 250 locations in 62
countries, an array of promotional materials and a new advertising
campaign aimed at investors are part of the push for a high profile
``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic car company.
	   The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, and
Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, will attend a reception at Frankfurt's
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New
York for the stock's debut on Wall Street.
	   Schrempp and Eaton will ring the traditional bell at the New
York Stock Exchange together, in a symbol of their cooperation.
	   The stock will have started trading six hours earlier in
Frankfurt, however.
	   The ambitious, transnational merger will test the ability of the
original two companies to blend their different cultures.
	   To help, the new company's 431,000 employees will get a
quarterly journal on how it's going; managers will get an extra
page with more details.
	   The last significant hurdle to the setting up of DaimlerChrysler
was completed a week ago, when Daimler announced 98 percent of its
shareholders had swapped shares for the new company.
	   Due to corporate differences, Chrysler shareholders did not need
to swap, but voted on the merger.
	   Mostly owned by institutional investors, the hearty response
from Daimler shareholders was expected, but four individual
shareholders lodged legal challenges to the deal with a German
court, alleging they weren't properly informed.
	   Daimler says the challenges won't affect the new company, and
the protesting shareholder's shares will anyway be merged at a
later, undecided date _ though for less money.
	   DaimlerChrysler will become the third largest car company in the
world with annual sales estimated at 260 billion marks (dlrs 162.5
billion.)
	   Schrempp, 54, and Eaton, 58, will jointly lead the new company
for three years.
	   After that, Schrempp is set to run it alone.

EU recommends financial assistance for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Monday
earmarked 60 million European currency units (dlrs 70 million) in
financial assistance for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   In a statement, the European Union's executive body said the
grants and loans should promote peace and help Bosnia's transition
towards a market economy, particularly in promoting the development
of the private sector.
	   The money must first be approved by the 15 EU governments.
	   Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EU commissioner for economic affairs,
said it was time ``to go beyond the objective of reconstruction and
focus increased attention on the structural reforms which will make
it possible to foster growth.''
	   The assistance would be conditional on Bosnia-Herzegovina
beginning implementation of economic reforms agreed with the IMF
and World Bank.
	   The EU is Bosnia's largest aid donor. Under current programs, it
will have granted 2 billion Ecu (dollars 1.16 billion) worth of
humanitarian and reconstruction aid by 2000.

Hong Kong and Singapore discuss SIMEX move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Singapore and Hong Kong officials
would ensure that stock and futures speculators could not take
advantage of regulatory loopholes when Singapore starts trading
Hong Kong-linked futures contracts, the Hong Kong chief executive
said Monday.
	   Tung Chee-hwa told reporters that he discussed the contentious
issue with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at a meeting on
the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   He said the two leaders agreed that they would ``work more
closely in getting our regulation authorities to communicate with
each other'' so that ``speculators would not take advantage of what
is called regulatory arbitrage,'' or differences in trading
regulations.
	   The two cities have been feuding over the Hong Kong stock
exchange's attempts to block its Singaporean counterpart's attempt
to trade a Hong Kong-linked futures contract.
	   The Singapore International Monetary Exchange, known as SIMEX,
plans to start trading a contract linked to the Morgan Stanley
Capital International Hong Kong Index, which mirrors the benchmark
Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong.
	   But the Hong Kong exchange has opposed the plan because of
concerns over Singapore's lax regulations on the product. Trading
is scheduled to begin on Nov. 23.
	   Hong Kong authorities blame speculators who take advantage of
regulatory loopholes for causing havoc in its financial markets.
	   In September, they introduced a series of controls to make
speculative trading more costly, after spending U.S. dlrs 15.1
billion in an unprecedented stock and futures buying spree to drive
them off.
	   Hong Kong officials worry that SIMEX's move would make it more
difficult for Hong Kong to monitor speculative trading.
	   Nonetheless, Tung said he welcomed Singapore's competition in
financial services, which is intensifying as the city-state tries
to overtake Hong Kong's lead.
	   ``I think competition is very good for us. We would try to be
better. We will try to be more efficient. It's a challenge for use
we'll have to overcome,'' he said.

Britain ends use of animals in all cosmetic tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Companies in Britain will stop using animals to
test cosmetic products, the first European Union to impose a ban,
the government said Monday.
	   The agreement was welcomed by animals rights activists, and Paul
McCartney said it would have made his late wife, Linda, who was a
leading campaigner, very happy.
	   However, the ban will have scant effect on the number of animals
involved in experiments because almost all are used in testing and
developing drugs, or research into animal biology.
	   Last year, experiments were carried out involving 2.6 million
animals, of which only 1,266 were used for testing cosmetics, the
Home Office said.
	   Last November, British cosmetic companies agreed voluntarily
with the government to stop testing finished cosmetic products on
animals.
	   The new agreement extends the ban to testing ingredients used in
cosmetics and the companies will voluntarily give up their testing
licenses, the Home Office said.
	   ``This is great news for our civilization and for the animals,''
said former Beatle McCartney, whose wife died of breast cancer in
April.
	   ``On behalf of my family _ and I know Linda would want to be
included _ we are very happy to see this happening and we hope that
other countries will not follow this lead,'' he added.
	   Mrs. McCartney opposed all animal testing, although her husband
has acknowledged that drugs tested on animals were probably used
during her cancer treatment.
	   Animal rights campaigners have protested for years, sometimes
violently, over the cruelty to animals caused by the testing of
lipsticks and other beauty aids.
	   ``We deal with irrelevancies _ skin and hair care is not a
matter of life and death and that is what we are opposed to,'' said
Anita Roddick who founded a chain store, Body Shop, which sold only
products not tested on animals.
	   Lawmaker Roger Gale, chairman of an all-party parliamentary
committee on animal welfare, said Britain should press for a
Europe-wide ban.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Floods in western Ukraine have claimed 14
lives and sent more than 1,000 people to hospitals, officials said
Monday.
	   Water has receded from most of the 118 towns and villages that
were flooded over the past two weeks in the Zakarpattia region, but
17 remained inundated Monday, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   About 21,200 people were evacuated from the area, though 12,500
of them have since returned to their homes, it said.
	   More than 9,000 emergency workers will remain in the region to
repair hundreds of buildings, bridges, dams, roads and railways
damaged by flooding, the ministry said.
	   Doctors have hospitalized 1,360 local residents, mostly with
respiratory infections, after examining more than 300,000 people
who were affected by the disaster.
	   Doctors had warned of widespread illness because much of the
region's drinking water was polluted by the flooding.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the relief effort. International organizations
including the Red Cross and United Nations and countries such as
China, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Slovakia have
sent aid, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Neighboring Russia promised to send aid in the next two days,
the Russian embassy in Kiev said.
	   No official estimates of the flood damage have been provided.

English golf prodigy Justin Rose chases his European tour card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four months ago, Justin Rose made a serious run at
the British Open. That was the easy part.
	   Now comes the real work for the 18-year-old Englishman.
	   Since turning professional following his stunning fourth-place
finish at Royal Birkdale _ just two strokes behind winner Mark
O'Meara _ Rose has been painfully reminded that he's still, after
all, a teen-ager.
	   He's played eight tournaments since then _ and missed every cut.
	   Without enough earnings (in his case, not a cent) to guarantee a
place on next year's PGA European Tour, Rose has to win his card at
qualifying school beginning Wednesday in southern Spain.
	   Of the 180 players entered, only 35 will get their card. Nobody
will be under more pressure than Rose, who produced a stunning
birdie on his final shot as an amateur, holing a 45-yard (meter)
pitch on the 72nd hole of the British Open.
	   The British tabloid press immediately likened him to Tiger Woods
and proclaimed he had more potential than Seve Ballesteros'
prodigy, 18-year-old Sergio (El Nino) Garcia, often considered
Europe's best young player.
	   ``I was floating in cloud-cuckooland,'' Rose said. ``I don't
regret anything, not even missing the cuts. I am disappointed but I
feel stronger for it.
	   ``Now I feel I am no longer in a tumble dryer going round and
round and then being hung out to dry. Now I am ready for the
school.''
	   Adding to the pressure is his first major endorsement signed
earlier this month with ball manufacturers Maxfli. The
performance-related deal could be worth as much as dlrs 1 million
over three years.
	   There is criticism that Rose, who turned 18 two weeks after the
British Open, should have remained an amateur a bit longer. Woods,
4 1/2 years his senior, said at the time ``it would be very
difficult for me to turn pro at that age.''
	   Rose's father, Ken, and manager Mike Todd downplay that notion
but admit he was probably too laid back in the eight tournaments.
	   ``The Justin Rose since the Open is not the Justin Rose with the
killer instinct,'' said his father, suggesting he needed to be more
``hard-nosed.''
	   ``By his own admission he wasn't as prepared as he could have
been,'' Todd said. ``He didn't drive the ball very well in those
tournaments and it affected the rest of his game.''
	   Qualifying school is a grueling six rounds at San Roque and
neighboring Real Club de Golf, both of which are next door to
Valderrama, site of the 1997 Ryder Cup. One British newspaper
dubbed the six days the ``Pain in Spain.''
	   In just four months, Rose has grown more than an inch to
6-foot-2 (1.88 meters). He's beginning to shave regularly and still
wears a broad smile as he learns the cruel, professional game.
	   ``Where I went wrong was in failing to spot one very obvious
difference,'' he said. ``When I was an amateur, I used to play golf
all day and every day. That game was my hobby. When I turned
professional, the game became my work.''
	   Rose, born in South Africa, moved with his family to England
when he was five. At 14, he was a scratch player and last year was
the youngest ever to play in the Walker Cup. His fourth in the
British Open was the best finish by an amateur in 45 years.
	   ``That kind of portfolio drew us to him right away,'' Todd said.
``His youth, his way with people and the media makes him an
attractive package.''
	   If Rose fails to win his card, he may wind up playing on
Europe's secondary Challenge Tour, although Todd said he'd probably
be invited to larger tournaments ``because of his age and his
ability to put people through the gates with a big appeal to young
kids.''
	   Rose will be up against some well-known names in Spain,
including former Ryder Cup players Steven Richardson and Paul Way.
	   The best-known name might be 47-year-old American Mac O'Grady,
who earned over dlrs 1 million in the United States before dropping
off the tour at the start of this decade.
	   ``It's a big week,'' Rose said. ``Everybody thinks you have to
play safe golf. It is not safe golf. You make your swing and stay
with it. You can't worry about the consequences.''
	   Spoken like a true 18-year-old.

Yeltsin meets with Primakov, envoy to Chechnya

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin visited his recently
released envoy to Chechnya at a Moscow hospital Monday and
conferred with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was heading to
an economic summit in Malaysia.
	   Yeltsin stopped by the Kremlin hospital to see Valentin Vlasov,
his envoy to the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Vlasov, taken
hostage six months ago by Chechen gunmen, was released last week
and is now recuperating after the ordeal.
	   Russian television showed a smiling Yeltsin embracing the
haggard-looking Vlasov and presenting him with a bouquet of red
roses.
	   During his visit to the hospital, Yeltsin didn't undergo any
medical checks, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Also Monday, Yeltsin met Primakov at the Gorky-9 presidential
residence near Moscow. The two discussed Primakov's preparations
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, Interfax said.
	   They also touched on other issues, including the Iraqi crisis,
Yakushkin said.
	   Over the weekend, Yeltsin sent a letter to Syrian President
Hafez Assad, reiterating Russia's adherence to political settlement
of the crisis, the presidential press service reported Monday.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who is traveling in the Middle
East, delivered the letter to the Syrian leader.
	   Sergeyev also told reporters in Cairo on Monday that Yeltsin
would travel to Egypt in March, Interfax reported.

Report: Congo conflict has driven at least 55,000 from homes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Fighting in eastern Congo has driven at
least 55,000 people from their homes in eastern Congo since
hostilities erupted between rebel and government forces on Aug. 2,
the U.N. refugee agency said Monday.
	   In a breakdown, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
more than 14,000 Congolese from the Lake Tangyanika towns of Uvira,
Baraka and Fizi had crossed the lake to Tanzania since the start of
the conflict, and more than 100 refugees were still crossing daily.
	   Another 6,500 Congolese crossed the border from south Kivu to
Burundi, and 500 crossed into Rwanda, the agency said.
	   Reports from humanitarian workers indicated that over 40,000
more people had fled their homes but remained in the same regions,
the U.N. agency said.
	   It said between 20,000 and 25,000 people may have been displaced
in the area around the rebel stronghold of Goma at the northern end
of Lake Kivu; another 12,000 were displaced around Uvira, and
14,000 people had fled their homes south of Uvira.
	   Meanwhile, in northeastern Congo, near the border with Sudan, a
UNHCR camp housing Sudanese refugees was attacked in October, and
17,000 refugees were chased back into Sudan, UNHCR said.
	   The U.N. organization said a similar raid Nov. 6 left two
refugees dead in the Central African Republic at a camp for
Sudanese refugees 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the border with
Sudan and just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Congolese border.
	   The refugee agency also expressed concern that Rwandan Hutu men
who are camped among bonafide refugees in the Republic of Congo and
the Central African Republic are trying to cross into
Congo-Kinshasa to join the fighting there on the side of President
Laurent Kabila.
	   The agency said that since early November between 3,000 and
5,000 Rwandan Hutu men have crossed the Congo Rivere from
Congo-Brazzaville, while Rwandan Hutus in the CAR had threatened
UNHCR staff with violence if they were not allowed to leave.
	   The U.N. agency said its personnel are not in a position to halt
these departures and called on states to take necessary measures to
stop refugees from taking up arms.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In its first case to deal with
atrocities against Serbs during Bosnia's civil war, a U.N. war
crimes tribunal on Monday convicted three prison officials and
guards, but acquitted a top military commander who oversaw the
facility.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Cmndr. Zejnil Delalic,
of the Bosnian Muslim Army, of responsibility for war crimes
committed at a government-run prison camp under his overall
command.
	   Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal
Delalic's acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of
the appeal.
	   ``Let me thank you for a just and fair judgment,'' Delalic told
the court. ``The judgment has even increased my trust in this
institution.''
	   The tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11
war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he
oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic,
wearing dark sunglasses and a cross, smiled as he heard his
sentence of seven years in prison.
	   Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia said he
was considering appealing Mucic's ``inadequate'' sentence.
	   Mucic's conviction was the first by an international court on
the basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of
their subordinates.
	   ``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those
under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without
taking any disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus
Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria.
	   Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused
on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed
for the vast majority of war crimes committed during the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict.
	   During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122
witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed
against Serbs in the area.
	   Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by
guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts,
according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced
to commit sexual acts with members of their own family.
	   The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts
that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner was
beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a
witness claimed.
	   Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic, for
humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some
prisoners and releasing others.
	   Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as deputy warden of the camp,
was found guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as
torturing other inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years by
Karibi-Whyte, who denounced rape as ``a despicable act which
strikes at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity.''
	   Delic's defense attorney said he would likely appeal.
	   Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three
prisoners and torturing at least three others and was sentenced to
15 years. His attorneys also are likely to appeal the conviction.
	   All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment, the
maximum punishment at the tribunal, which has no death penalty.
	   A charge against Delic and Mucic of plundering property was
dismissed by the three-judge panel.
	   Mucic also was cleared of responsibility for four murders and
three cases of mistreatment or torture of prisoners. Delic was
cleared of two murders, and of command responsibility for other
killings at Celebici. He was also acquitted of three cases of
torture.
	   Landzo was cleared of one murder charge and one torture count.
	   The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has
convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb
Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing
and torturing Muslims in 1992.
	   Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the
tribunal two more convictions without conduction trials.

Jewish settlers seize hill in the West Bank

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers set up two trailers on a remote
West Bank hilltop Monday, a day after Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
urged settlers to grab land ahead of an Israeli troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the group was encouragd by
Sharon's statements which the Palestinians denounced as a violation
of the new land-for-security agreement.
	   ``We understood that the attitude of the Israeli government is
that he who holds the land determines policy and we are acting
accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.
	   As housing minister in the early 1990s, Sharon was responsible
for a massive settlement construction drive in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
	   Sharon said Monday that Israel would expand existing settlements
and defended his remarks that settlers should seize land near their
communities ahead of the impending troop pullback.
	   ``If we are talking about seizing the hills, there are ... hills
that dominate the existing settlements, state land, and this is
aimed not at increasing tension but on decreasing tension in the
future,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders.
	   In a related development, three ultra-nationalist rabbis issued
a formal religious ruling that Israel's government is violating
Jewish law by handing territory to the Palestinians.
	   The three signatories were Dov Lior of the Jewish settlement of
Kiryat Arba, Yitzhak Ginsburg of the Josep's Tomb seminary in the
West Bank town of Nablus and Yaakov Yosef, the son of Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, the spirtual leader of the religious Shas Party.
	   Many of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank are religious, and
the three rabbis have an influence on at least some of the
settlers.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January. The ruling by Lior, Ginsburg
and Yosef ruled that the accord is invalid under Jewish law.
	   ``Any agreement made by representatives of the Jewish people,
which is against Jewish law - is invalid and there is no obligation
to implement it,'' the ruling said.
	   Several years ago, the same rabbis called on Israeli soldiers to
disobey orders to evacuate Jewish settlements, but Lior said that
this time he and his colleagues were not calling for disobedience.
	   ``We were asked for our opinion. We were not interfering in
politics,'' Lior told The Associated Press.
	   Lior said those opposed to the withdrawal ``should try to
persuade the government that it is wrong, but apart from that they
should sit and do nothing.''

Japan and US announce plans to fight Asian financial crisis

joint Cling-Obuchi statement, no pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States and Japan
announced proposals Monday night to pump an additional dlrs 10
billion into troubled Asian economies to help lift the region out
of its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said
in a joint statement that the new effort would reward the economic
reforms Asian nations have instituted to deal with the crisis.
	   ``The major challenge they face today is restarting growth as
quickly as possible,'' the two leaders said in a statement issued
here as well as the capitals of both nations.
	   The package of proposals would include dlrs 5 billion in new
support offered by the United States, and the creation of a new
dlrs 5 billion joint initiative supported by the United States,
Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who was attending an economic
summit in place of Clinton, told a business audience Monday that
the new effort would help to achieve the goal of instituting a
sustainable economic recovery in nations plunged into recession by
the 17-month long financial crisis.
	   ``Just as our nations built an economic miracle for this region,
now we must build an economic recovery,'' Gore said. ``I assure you
that the United States is determined to remain a strong partner _
both for the sake of jobs and growth in our own country, and for
the sake of freedom and prosperity around the world.''
	   According to Gore, the new dlrs 5 billion in U.S. support
includes dlrs 1 billion each in loans to Indonesia, Thailand and
South Korea, the three countries hardest hit by the Asia crisis.
The remaining dlrs 2 billion will provide loan guarantees through
the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support private
business deals.
	   ``We want to do all we can to encourage trade and investment
here, so American businesses can be an active partner in your
growth and recovery,'' Gore told the meeting of business leaders
held on the eve of the start of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   Gore repeated U.S. insistence that Asia will not be able to
recover unless Japan does more to revive it own economy and deal
with its troubled banking sector.
	   Because of legal restraints, the United States is not providing
any direct financial support to the dlrs 5 billion joint
initiative. The exact amounts that Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Bank will put up for this have yet to be determined.
	   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said that Thailand and Indonesia were likely to be the
first countries to qualify for the new dlrs 5 billion fund, which
Clinton and Obuchi said would be called the Asia Growth and
Recovery Initiative.
	   The package of new proposals follows an offer last month by
Japan to provide dlrs 30 billion in credit to ailing Asian
economies.
	   Gore's speech also made a direct reference to the troubles that
have erupted in Malaysia since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
fired and jailed his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Gore said that there were growing calls for democracy among many
nations.
	   ``We hear them today, _ right here, right now _ among the brave
people of Malaysia,'' he said.

Netanyahu withdraws from promise to pull back troops

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday withdrew from its promise to
begin a West Bank troop pullback later this week, with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying he and his Cabinet would first
have to decide whether the Palestinians violated the peace accord.
	   Netanyahu is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat who has renewed a pledge to declare independence in
May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to defend Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu called Arafat on Monday to seek clarifications, but
was not satisfied with Arafat's responses, Israel radio said.
	   Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call, but refused to
discuss it.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu of trying
to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop
trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour said.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Michael Stoltz said the Cabinet would meet
on Thursday to decide whether Arafat's statements were a breach of
the agreement and whether to go ahead with a first troop withdrawal
from 2 percent of the West Bank that was to be completed by Friday.
	   Netanyahu did not refer directly to a possible suspension of a
withdrawal. ``If they fulfill their part, we will fulfill our part.
At this moment, there are of course clear demands that we will
make, and they will have to fulfill them,'' he said.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday, a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon encouraged settlers to seize as much land as they can before
the troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   As part of the deal, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain
from provocative language,'' said Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   On Monday afternnon, Israel's parliament was to begin its
two-day debate of the agreement on Monday afternoon with a major
policy speech by Netanyahu. A vote was expected Tuesday, with at
least 90 of 120 legislators likely to support the agreement.
	   Under a timetable worked out Sunday night, Israel was to
withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank and release 250
Palestinian security prisoners by Friday.
	   Sharon said Monday that Arafat was close to provoking Israel
into walking away from the agreement.
	   ``If the Palestinians keep the agreement, they will receive what
was promised,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders.
	   ``If they don't keep it, they won't receive anything, and I
think that this week, they brought the situation in which they will
not receive very much closer,'' Sharon said.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, responded angrily to Sharon's calls
to Jewish settlers to grab West Bank hilltops now before the two
sides reach a permanent territorial agreement over the area where
the Palestinians want to build their future state.
	   Arafat said Sharon's remarks constituted a violation of the
peace accord. Asfour accused Sharon of incitement and demanded an
apology from Netanyahu.
	   Sharon stood by his statement. ``If we are talking about seizing
the hills, there are ... hills that dominate the existing
settlements, state land, and this is aimed not at increasing
tension but on decreasing tension in the future,'' Sharon said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers have taken over several West
Bank hills and set up mobile homes there.

Bomb explodes at bus terminal, 25 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A powerful bomb exploded Monday at a
crowded bus terminal in northern India, wounding 25 people and
blasting a crater in the ground, a domestic news agency reported.
	   At least five of the wounded _ four women and a man _ were in
serious condition in a local hospital from the explosion in Kaithal
in the state of Haryana, Press Trust of India said. The town is 300
kilometers (190 miles) northwest of India's capital, New Delhi.
	   Windows of buses parked nearby were shattered and some shops
were damaged, PTI said, quoting eyewitnesses. Forensic experts had
been summoned from a state laboratory for investigation, the news
agency said.
	   The motive for the explosion was not immediately clear. India is
battling insurgents on several fronts, but it was not immediately
established as an act of terrorism. The neighboring state of Punjab
was wracked by a separatist rebellion by Sikh militants for nearly
a decade but attacks are now rare in that region.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Fighting in eastern Congo has driven at
least 55,000 people from their homes in eastern Congo since
hostilities erupted between rebel and government forces on Aug. 2,
the U.N. refugee agency said Monday.
	   In a breakdown, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
more than 14,000 Congolese from the Lake Tangyanika towns of Uvira,
Baraka and Fizi had crossed the lake to Tanzania since the start of
the conflict, and more than 100 refugees were still crossing daily.
	   Another 6,500 Congolese crossed the border from south Kivu to
Burundi, and 500 crossed into Rwanda, the agency said.
	   Reports from humanitarian workers indicated that over 45,000
more people had fled their homes but remained in the same regions,
the U.N. agency said.
	   It said between 20,000 and 25,000 people may have been displaced
in the area around the rebel stronghold of Goma at the northern end
of Lake Kivu; another 12,000 were displaced around Uvira, and
14,000 people had fled their homes south of Uvira.
	   Meanwhile, in northeastern Congo, near the border with Sudan, a
UNHCR camp housing Sudanese refugees was attacked in October, and
17,000 refugees were chased back into Sudan, UNHCR said.
	   The U.N. organization said a similar raid Nov. 6 left two
refugees dead in the Central African Republic at a camp for
Sudanese refugees 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the border with
Sudan and just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Congolese border.
	   The refugee agency also expressed concern that Rwandan Hutu men
who are camped among bonafide refugees in the Republic of Congo and
the Central African Republic are trying to cross into
Congo-Kinshasa to join the fighting there on the side of President
Laurent Kabila.
	   The agency said that since early November between 3,000 and
5,000 Rwandan Hutu men have crossed the Congo River from
Congo-Brazzaville, while Rwandan Hutus in the CAR had threatened
UNHCR staff with violence if they were not allowed to leave.
	   The U.N. agency said its personnel are not in a position to halt
these departures and called on states to take necessary measures to
stop refugees from taking up arms.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Setting aside a dispute that
prevented a landmark free-trade agreement, Japan and the United
States joined hands Monday and offered plans to pump an additional
dlrs 10 billion into Asia's troubled economies.
	   ``This much is clear _ just as the global crisis started here in
Asia, the global economic recovery can and must start in Asia as
well,'' U.S. President Gore said in a speech announcing the rescue
packages to Asian leaders and business executives.
	   Gore also used his speech to indirectly praise an
anti-government reform movement that exploded in Malaysia several
months ago when its prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, fired his
protege, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, then jailed him and
placed him on trial.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore.
	   Often, he said, people suffering through economic crises call
out for more democracy in their countries.
	   ``We hear them today _ right here, right now _ among the brave
people of Malaysia,'' Gore said.
	   The comments seemed certain to anger Mahathir, who sat in the
audience at the Putra World Trade Center, and who will host the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that Gore and 19 other
leaders attend in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Gore, a last-minute stand-in for U.S. President Bill Clinton at
the APEC summit, seemed determined in his speech to reassure Asia,
where the global economic crisis began 17 months ago, that the
world's largest economy stands ready to try to help its allies out
of a serious economic difficulties.
	   He also used it to praise the free-market economic approach
endorsed by the International Monetary Fund and laid out in the new
initiatives that the United States were putting forward.
	   Mahathir imposed capital controls to protect his economy from
wild gyrations in currency and stock markets across Asia, and has
criticized its IMF bailout programs.
	   Clinton canceled his trip to the summit at the last minute on
Saturday because of the showdown with Baghdad, during which he
nearly launched a military attack on Iraq to punish it for once
again expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The package of proposals would include dlrs 5 billion in support
offered by the United States, and the creation of a dlrs 5 billion
joint initiative supported by the United States, Japan, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Gore said the dlrs 5 billion in U.S. support includes dlrs 1
billion each in loans to Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, the
three countries hardest hit by the Asia crisis.
	   The remaining dlrs 2 billion will provide loan guarantees
through the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support
private business deals.
	   The dlrs 5 billion joint initiative was announced by officials
in Tokyo on Monday. Because of legal restraints, the United States
is not providing any direct financial support. The exact amounts
that Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Bank will put up were to
be announced later by Japanese and U.S. officials in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Like other APEC members, Gore spent most of Monday holding
bilateral meetings with other leaders. His included Chinese
president Jiang Zemin and Thailand's leader, Chuan Leekpai.
	   On Sunday, the APEC Cabinet ministers failed to achieve a
landmark agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in
global trade. The fight now goes to the 124-nation World Trade
Organization, where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff
Japanese resistance to cutting tariffs in two sectors it considers
politically sensitive _ wood and fish products.
	   The United States, which had pushed the hardest to force Japan
to agree to slash tariffs in all nine sectors of the proposed
agreement, reluctantly accepted the outcome as the best Washington
could get at the moment, thanks to Japan.
	   Seeking to put the best face on the failure to achieve a
breakthrough, U.S. officials insisted that it was at least a
partial victory that the whole effort did not collapse.
	   At the WTO, APEC members hope to attract other countries outside
the region to the effort to slash tariffs in products ranging from
chemicals to medical equipment.
	   Japan claimed a victory in the trade negotiations, saying it
staved off pressure from the United States and other nations.

Human rights panel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Sidestepping charges of
anti-black bias against two prominent newspapers, the Human Rights
Commission said Monday it will instead launch an investigation of
``racism in the media in general.''
	   The announcement raised concern by free speech watchdogs and
newspapers that the right of expression could be trampled in the
commission's zeal to correct the wrongs of South Africa's racist
past.
	   In a larger sense, the probe is another example of this
country's efforts to wrestle with the legacy of decades of white
minority rule after the fall of apartheid.
	   The chairman of the commission, N. Barney Pityana, acknowledged
that the panel had a delicate job in steering between the rights of
equality and of free expression.
	   But, he told reporters, ``South Africa has no reason to place
freedom of expression on a pedestal above other rights.'' Given how
pervasive racism is in the country, it's likely the media also
suffers from it, he said.
	   The goal of the probe was to stimulate debate on racism, open
the public's eyes about it, ``sharpen'' the media's responsiveness
and help the media ``reflect the true nature'' of South African
society, Pityana said.
	   The chairman said the scope of the investigation would be
established by January. He said it was uncertain whether
broadcasters, including the state television and radio company, or
magazines would be included. Nor would he define what ``racism'' in
the media might be.
	   The commission would invoke its subpoena powers if media did not
cooperate. That concerned some.
	   ``It's very worrying if they are going to become very
heavy-handed, and it could have a chilling effect on the media,''
said Laura Pollecutt, executive director of the Freedom of
Expression Institute.
	   The probe stems from a complaint lodged with the commission by
the black lawyers and accountants associations against two weekly
newspapers, the muckraking Mail and Guardian and the Sunday Times,
which has the nation's highest newspaper circulation.
	   The Mail and Guardian, an opponent of apartheid, was criticized
for disproportionately targeting blacks in its investigative
pieces, an accusation the paper rejects.
	   The Sunday Times allegedly ignored or trivialized black victims
of violence. The complaint also took a white columnist to task for
saying African-American White House staffers who visited South
Africa with President Clinton realized they ``would probably be
living in shacks with no running water if their ancestors hadn't
been abducted by slave traders.''
	   Times editor Mike Robertson said the complaint was based on
``errors and distortion.'' In one example, the black deaths
allegedly given short shrift had happened a week before, he said.
	   ``I'm really disturbed by the Human Rights Commission. I think
they found the media guilty of racism in advance,'' he said. ``Who
is the (commission) to say to any newspaper or television station,
`You shouldn't report on that,' '' he said.
	   Pityana said he did not take up the individual complaints
because it would be ``difficult to justify'' such an investigation
``when the whole of South African society'' is grappling with
racism. He also said it would put the commission ``in a very
difficult situation regarding freedom of expression.''
	   Since the days of apartheid, media ownership is no longer
exclusively white, but few blacks occupy senior editing jobs.
	   Last month's Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, a major
survey of rights abuses under apartheid, found the English language
media had ``often adopted a policy of appeasement toward the
state'' and that the Afrikaans-language media ``with rare
exceptions chose to provide direct support for apartheid and the
activities of the security forces.''

Father fatally stabs teen daughter in front of friends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A man jumped from his car and
stabbed to death his 13-year-old daughter in front of her friends,
a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The slaying occurred Sunday afternoon as the girl was out for a
walk with her two friends in an Amsterdam suburb. Her father drove
up, stepped out of his car and stabbed her several times with a
knife, the daily De Telegraaf reported.
	   The 38-year-old father fled from the scene, but was later
arrested. The girl died in the hospital from her wounds.
	   Their names were not released in line with Dutch police
practice.
	   De Telegraaf said the victim was removed from her home more than
a year ago and was taken to a shelter in Amsterdam. The family has
been experiencing problems for a long time, but the nature of their
difficulties was not disclosed.

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) - Although he opted not to bowl in
Griqualand West's second innings West Indian paceman Courtney Walsh
Monday spent enough time on the field as a batsman to allay any
fears that he might have a serious injury.
	   Walsh, who twisted his ankle while bowling on Saturday, was at
the wicket for just under an hour and displayed no signs of
discomfort while scoring an unbeaten 15 in the visitors' first
innings 466.
	   He and fellow paceman Mervyn Dillon, who slapped 44 runs off 65
deliveries, also put on exactly 50 for the final wicket to give
their side a 195-run first innings advantage.
	   Griquas, who were dismissed for 271 in their first innings, had
scored 27 for the loss of one wicket at tea on the third day.
	   While Dillon's knock helped lift the visitors innings most of
the hard work had already been done by the likes of Carl Hooper and
wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs.
	   Hooper, who resumed on 64 in the morning went on to his 100
(10x4 1x6) in 243 minutes, but was out 15 balls later when he skied
a delivery from Swanepoel to Botha on the mid-off boundary.
	   A powerful gusting wind blew the ball all over the place and in
the end Botha did well to hang on to a difficult swirling catch.
	   Deon Kruis had earlier found himself in a similar situation in
dismissing Franklyn Rose off his own bowling with the ball
seemingly shifting all the way from mid-on to the bowler's left.
	   Jacobs, who teamed up with Hooper to put on 79 for the seventh
wicket, was trapped leg-before by Pat Symcox after rattling up an
aggressive 40 (5x4s 1x6) off 58 deliveries.

Japanese Cabinet approves record stimulus plan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister on Monday unveiled the
government's biggest effort so far to spend the country out of
economic distress, but markets and commentators found little to
cheer.
	   Unimpressed by the figures _ 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion)
in new public spending and tax cuts _ critics focused on what Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi did not offer: a cut in the sales tax.
	   The package surpasses the record 17 trillion yen (dlrs 139
billion) the government released in April and brings the total
amount Tokyo has spent on stimulus since 1992 to 100 trillion yen
(dlrs 820 billion).
	   The problem, however, has been consumer confidence.
	   News of growing unemployment, bankruptcies and stingy lending by
hard-pressed banks has prompted ordinary Japanese to cut spending
and put tax cuts into savings, leaving merchants from car dealers
to department stores with unsold goods.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the sales tax to 5
percent from 3 percent was widely blamed for choking off a growth
spurt and tipping the economy back into recession.
	   Obuchi said the tax revenue was needed because of Japan's
mounting budget deficit.
	   ``Judging from the current fiscal situation, it's difficult to
comply with that,'' he said of demands for a lower sales tax.
	   The package is designed to stop Japan's economy from contracting
for a third consecutive year _ a pledge Obuchi made after taking
office in July.
	   ``With this plan, our country can free itself from its current
severe situation,'' Obuchi said before leaving for Malaysia for a
summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The package also contains 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8 billion) in aid
for Asian countries. Japan has been under intense international
pressure to do more to help the region fight economic woes.
	   ``We should not jump to the conclusion that this would pave way
for economic recovery,'' the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai said
of the latest plan. ``At the most, the measures are likely work
only briefly in a limited region.''
	   The nation's largest circulation newspaper, the Yomiuri, said,
``After wiping off the thick makeup of money, only an unimpressive
base appears underneath.''
	   Obuchi said package's tax cuts, worth about 6 trillion yen (dlrs
49 billion), will bring Japanese income and corporate tax rates in
line with those in major Western economies.
	   Some business leaders welcomed the income tax cuts, though they
called for early implementation. Others said enticing consumer
spending would be tough.
	   Fears over the economy have frozen consumer spending, Kazuo
Kamiya, director of the Japan Chamber of Commerce, a major business
group, said a nationally televised interview on Japan's
semi-government NHK. ``The package won't be fast relief.''
	   To encourage consumers to spend more, the package will
distribute 700 billion yen (dlrs 5.7 billion) in shopping vouchers.
The plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special
parliamentary session.
	   Obuchi said the package also would include more than 17.9
trillion yen (dlrs 147 billion) in spending, most of it on public
works and steps to help smaller companies ride out a severe credit
crunch as Japan's banks dispose of their massive bad loans.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average climbed 1.12 percent Monday, but traders attributed the
rise to hopes the government still might do more.
	   ``Everybody is still hopeful that there will be more out, and
part of it will be a sales tax cut,'' said Louis Tseng, head of
derivatives trading at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   ``I'm not sure if they've put in place the mechanism'' for
economic recovery, said Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson (Asia).
	   He predicted the economy could expand by 1 percent next year
with the package, compared to Obuchi's 2.3 percent target.

Russian banks face doomsday as debt moratorium expires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with effect on Russian bank customers in 4th graf, IMF
lukewarm on aid prospects, government banning some companies from
exporting oil, renationalization bill in last 4 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing widespread bankruptcy, Russia's banks
prepared themselves Monday for a stream of lawsuits from Western
partners after a three-month moratorium on Russia's foreign debt
repayments expired.
	   Analysts say the debts coming due, estimated at more than dlrs 6
billion, may deal a fatal blow to half of the country's 1,500
commercial banks.
	   Some western creditors have already moved to freeze Russian bank
assets abroad. A tidal wave of lawsuits by Western creditors is
expected within days, now that even the most powerful Russian banks
are facing severe cash shortages.
	   The development could be grim news for individual Russian bank
customers, most of whose accounts have been frozen since August.
The lawsuits are likely to bankrupt the weaker banks, or may force
them to use their scant funds to pay off Western creditors before
paying out individual Russian accounts.
	   On Aug. 17, the government defaulted on its domestic debt and
simultaneously devalued the ruble, inflicting multibillion dollar
losses to investors. On the same day, it announced a 90-day
moratorium on commercial debt payments in an effort to keep Russian
banks from collapsing.
	   The moratorium only postponed the showdown, since the Russian
government failed to persuade foreign investors to drop their
claims against Russian banks.
	   Russian media have reported that a number of western banks have
already hired the international corporate investigative firm Kroll
Associates to locate foreign assets belonging to Russian banks.
	   Two of Russia's western creditors, Deutsche Bank and Lehman
Brothers, have already filed suit against Russian banks.
	   Foreign investors made the massive loans, called forward
contracts, to protect the value of their Russian treasury
investments against a plunge in the ruble. Many leading Russian
banks took forward contracts that exceeded their total assets many
times over.
	   The outcome of the legal battles is uncertain because many
courts consider forward contracts a form of gambling. They may
decide depositors and other creditors should have a higher priority
when bank assets are distributed.
	   The Russian Central Bank has moved to bail out some of the
largest Russian banks, but made it clear that it wouldn't try to
save all of them.
	   Assets of the 30 largest Russian banks totaled 547 billion
rubles before the latest crisis hit in mid-August, about dlrs 33
billion at the current exchange rate.
	   The Russian currency has resumed its downhill plunge in recent
days, and officials said it may drop to 20 rubles per U.S. dollar
this fall, further eroding the dollar value of the bank holdings.
The exchange rate is currently 16.8 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The government itself is suffering from a severe cash shortage
and courting the International Monetary Fund and other lenders for
aid.
	   The IMF has urged the government to approve a sound anti-crisis
plan as a condition for further loans, and criticized the Cabinet's
blueprint as too vague and overloaded with state controls over the
economy.
	   Martin Gilman, the head of the IMF's Moscow office, said the
Fund's team is coming to Moscow on Wednesday to continue talks.
Gilman said it was very difficult to talk of ``concrete results''
because of the ``great uncertainty'' in Russia's current situation,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   In other economic developments Monday:
	   _ The government said it would bar five or six major Russian oil
companies from exporting oil if they fail to supply domestic
consumers.
	   _ Lawmakers drafted a nationalization bill under which the
government may take control over companies privatized at prices
below market value, as well as those considered vital for
protecting national interests, Interfax said.

Pacific Rim summit shines spotlight on dissident's wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. government sent her a fax
marked ``URGENT,'' and the world's news media are clamoring for
exclusive interviews.
	   Azizah Ismail, the 46-year-old wife of Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister, said the timing of the Pacific Rim summit in the
Malaysian capital is like ``divine intervention.''
	   That intervention included a secret lunch on Sunday with
Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. That was followed by
a half-hour talk with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Azizah's husband, Anwar Ibrahim, once eloquently outlined
Malaysia's political and financial stances in his dual role as
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   Now that he's been jailed while standing trial, Azizah must be
several things at once: temporarily single parent to the couple's
six children, champion of Anwar's cause and de-facto leader of the
reform movement he started.
	   Seated at her dining room table Monday, Azizah spoke to The
Associated Press about the global spotlight this week's Pacific Rim
summit has focused on her husband's plight.
	   ``Call it divine intervention,'' said Azizah, half-jokingly,
dressed in a cream-colored Muslim head scarf.
	   The government recessed Anwar's trial on abuse of power and
sexual misconduct charges, to prevent it from upstaging the summit
of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). But
Azizah's determined presentation of his case has gathered worldwide
attention anyway.
	   Television crews assigned to the summit are setting up makeshift
studios, one after another, in Azizah's living room.
	   Foreign governments, brushing aside protocol, are sending
high-ranking leaders to Azizah to hear about her husband's case.
	   Those meetings started Saturday, when Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy hosted her at a lunch in a Kuala Lumpur hotel.
	   ``All I want to do is make contact. I just want to highlight my
husband's conflict,'' said Azizah, conceding that lately she hasn't
had to exert too much effort to get her message across.
	   ``It's as if Secretary Albright came all the way to see me from
the United States,'' said Azizah. Mrs. Albright stayed in Kuala
Lumpur only 24 hours before returning to Washington, but insisted
on seeing Azizah before leaving.
	   ``I got a fax saying `URGENT.' They told me to come at 7
o'clock,'' said Azizah. The invitation arrived on the family fax in
their home in one of Kuala Lumpur's upscale neighborhoods.
	   Azizah described the evening meeting, which took place in
Albright's hotel, as ``very nice, very cordial, very warm.''
	   During the talk, Albright said Anwar had been a ``respected
leader.''
	   Today, he's languishing in prison during a trial expected to
last until next year. He has denied the charges against him, saying
they were politically motivated.
	   At a low point for Malaysia's image abroad, Anwar showed up at
one court hearing with a black eye he said was inflicted by police.
	   Azizah recalled that Mrs. Albright was ``very concerned about
how Anwar is treated and especially his black eye,'' which the
Cabinet secretary called ``appalling.''
	   World leaders have voiced outrage over Malaysia's treatment of
Anwar, who was sacked as the country's No. 2 leader on Sept. 2.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard met with his Malaysian
counterpart, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, on Monday to urge a
fair trial for Anwar.
	   Risking bilateral tension, Howard told Mahathir that he had his
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met secretly with Anwar's wife
for an hour on Sunday.
	   Azizah said Downer ``asked me all sorts of things about Anwar,
how are his spirits, how is his health.''
	   Explaining it to her children, ranging in age from 6 to 19, was
the most difficult part of Anwar's absence, Azizah said.
	   ``I cannot fulfill their requests that their father come home,''
she said. ``But I have to bring them up to be strong individuals to
fight for what is right.''

Wimbledon reports record profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thanks to record crowds and the success of
Britain's Tim Henman, this year's Wimbledon tennis championships
produced a record profit of 33 million pounds (dlrs 52.8 million).
	   The Lawn Tennis Association announced Monday that the Wimbledon
surplus rose by 6.7 percent over last year, due to improved TV and
merchandising income and record 13-day crowds of 424,998 _ up
20,000 on the previous mark.
	   The LTA said Wimbledon ``held off the challenge'' of soccer's
World Cup, which was taking place in France at the same time in
June and July.
	   The LTA reported increased sales of merchandise at the
tournament featuring both Henman, who reached the semifinals, and
fellow Brit Greg Rusedski, who withrew with an ankle injury during
his first-round match.
	   The LTA said the semifinal match between Henman and eventual
champion Pete Sampras attracted 12 million television viewers in
Britain, making it one of the top televised sporting events of the
year.
	   It's been a bumper year for British tennis, with Henman and
Rusedski both breaking into the top 10, Rusedski winnning an elite
``Super 9'' tournament in Paris, Henman defeating Andre Agassi in
the final of the Swiss Open, and Britain returning to the World
Group of the Davis Cup for the first time since 1992.

Indian youth: Involve us in fighting AIDS
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANESAR, India (AP) _ Hard as it is to talk about sex with young
people, involving them in AIDS education is crucial to preventing
the spread of the sexually transmitted disease, Indian community
workers, health experts and youth said Monday.
	   ``Young people have an enormous curiosity about sex. So let's
build an information system around them,'' said L.N. Balaji, chief
of planning of UNICEF, India, which is organizing a four-day
workshop on the role of youth in fighting AIDS epidemic and HIV,
the virus that causes it.
	   People in their teens and 20s who act as health activists in
their own communities in 17 countries are attending. They'll return
home with new ideas about education and counteracting
discrimination against those who have AIDS.
	   About 1.7 million people in Africa and 700,000 others in Asia
and the Pacific are infected with HIV every year, according to U.N.
statistics. India accounts for the most cases in the world, at 4
million.
	   A half-million of India's victims are young people. Their number
will rise if young people do not have access to information, skills
and services to fight the problem, Balaji said at a news conference
in Manesar, a town near New Delhi.
	   Many participants in the UNICEF conference said youth in their
countries are unable to discuss sex with their elders because of
societal taboos. They usually end up getting bad information from
peers or reading pornographic literature or experimenting with
unsafe sex.
	   But Edna Mulenga, one of the youthful conference delegates, said
authorities in Lusaka, Zambia were able to quickly attract youth to
counseling centers and health clinics. Mulenga's Family Health
Trust volunteers are constantly being sought to talk to youth.
	   In India, school principals balked at the idea of health experts
talking to students about drugs, sex or even problems of youth.
	   ``Talking about sex was considered outrageous,'' said Gunjan
Shah, one of the 4,000 students and teachers trained by Sevadham
Trust, a voluntary organization in Pune that is helping spread the
message of AIDS.
	   Sevadham volunteers slowly persuaded authorities to talk to
teachers. ``Soon, they were saying 'This is exactly what we want.'
From then, there was no problem.''
	   Today, nearly all public and private schools in Pune and many
others in Bombay have asked Sevadham to conduct training programs
for their staff.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities negotiated with an
imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release
of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into
extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said.
	   The Italian, Mauro Calascibetta, 34, was taken hostage Sunday by
a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for
the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's
most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome.
	   Calascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his
detention in August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police
Monday. He is wanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection
with an attempted killing.

New U.S. ambassador arrives in Luanda, urges peace in Angola, Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The new U.S. Ambassador arrived Monday and
told reporters he aimed to push for the conclusion of Angola's
ailing peace process and a cease-fire in neighboring Congo, where
Angola has deployed troops.
	   ``I will work to widen and deepen the relations between our two
peoples and governments and intensify talks on national and
regional matters,'' Joseph Sullivan said in a brief statement at
Luanda airport.
	   He said that at the top of his agenda was the full
implementation of Angola's 1994 peace accord, which ended a
two-decade civil war, and bringing peace to Congo.
	   ``This is a difficult moment for Angola and Africa. The conflict
in neighboring Congo is a serious threat to stability in the entire
region,'' Sullivan said.
	   The peace pact between the government and rebel group UNITA has
still not been fully implemented because UNITA has refused to hand
over its central highland strongholds and the government has
threatened to take them by force.
	   Angola and three other countries have provided troops to help
Congo President Laurent Kabila quell a rebellion backed by Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   Sullivan replaced Donald Steinberg who left the country last
week.

Sosa auctions bats, uniforms for disaster aid for Dominican
</HEADLINE>
Republic &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Home run slugger Sammy Sosa auctioned bats and
uniforms Monday and raised more than 4.5 million yen (dlrs 37,000)
to help his homeland, the Dominican Republic, recover from the
devastation of Hurricane Georges.
	   He also met with Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura to
ask for more aid, said a ministry official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Komura, who received the bat with which Sosa hit his third and
final home-run in an eight-game tour of Japan by a team of Major
League stars, pledged continued assistance.
	   The foreign minister also accepted an autographed ball from
Sosa, who broke Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs
this year, but trailed the 70 home runs of Mark McGwire.
	   Sosa has acted as an unofficial ambassador for his homeland
since the September storm killed at least 283 people there and left
more than 100,000 others homeless.
	   Japan has already sent a medical team and aid materials to the
stricken nation.
	   At a charity auction at the Foreign Correspondents Club of
Japan, the highest price _ 1.6 million yen (dlrs 13,200) _ went for
the Chicago Cubs uniform _ later autographed _ that Sosa wore on
Nov. 6 when he hit his first home run in Japan.
	   The buyer, construction company chairman Yasusaburo Udagawa,
also paid 1.3 million yen (dlrs 10,700) for the bat used to hit
that homer.
	   ``We're having a good time here, but people back home, they
don't have anything. It's 12 o'clock at night and they don't have
anything on the table,'' Sosa told some 200 guests at the auction.

U.S. vice president lauds Malaysian protesters as `brave'

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES other heads of state at the dinner, planned
demonstration called off &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore on
Monday indirectly supported a burgeoning reform movement in
Malaysia which has called for greater political freedoms and an end
to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Gore, in a dinner speech to leaders of some of the world's
largest corporations, said that robust global markets depend on
freedom and democracy.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore,
who stepped in for President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Clinton canceled his visit to Malaysia to remain in Washington
and deal with the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   The ouster of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
his subsequent arrest and beating while in police custody outraged
world leaders. Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption
and sexual misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up
to undermine his challenge to Mahathir.
	   A series of violent demonstrations have rocked the normally
placid capital for the first time in three decades.
	   ``From Thailand to South Korea, Eastern Europe to Mexico,
democracies have done better in coping with economic crises than
nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore said.
	   ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue
to hear calls for democracy and reform in many languages. People's
power, doi moi, reformasi. We hear them today _ right here, right
now _ among the brave people of Malaysia.''
	   ``Reformasi,'' or reform in the Malay language, has become the
battle cry of the anti-government movement here. It was the same
chant used during the massive riots and student demonstrations in
neighboring Indonesia, a movement that led to the end of President
Suharto's 32-year rule.
	   An anti-government demonstration planned outside the Putra World
Trade Center where Gore delivered his speech never came off.
Organizers said they were deterred by the water cannons and large
police presence outside the massive hall.
	   On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
privately with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to express U.S. concern
over her husband's case.
	   For the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human
rights concerns have been widely discussed by the leaders, whose
goal is to promote free trade in the region.
	   During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's treatment and
trial. And New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
planned to do that on Tuesday.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Mahathir because of the Anwar affair.
	   At the end of his speech, however, Gore returned to the head
table and shook hands with the Malaysian prime minister.
	   Other guests included Peru President Alberto Fujimori,
Philippines President Joseph Estrada, New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley and Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.

	   Netanyahu said he would convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to
review the suspension of the withdrawal. On Sunday night, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators had agreed that Israel would withdraw
from 2 percent of the West Bank by Friday.
	   The land-for-security agreement is assured the support of some
90 of 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech was mainly aimed at
hard-liners who have threatened to topple his coalition.
	   Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who would not
put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the Palestinians
to violate the accord.
	   ``Unlike others, we do not believe in illusions, a new Middle
East,'' Netanyahu said. ``The Palestinians will test us every day
and we will stand firm.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu of trying
to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop
trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour said
before the suspension of the withdrawal was announced officially.
	   Before his speech, Netanyahu called Arafat to seek
clarifications, but was not satisfied with Arafat's responses,
Israel radio said. Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call,
but refused to discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday, a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon encouraged settlers to seize as much land as they can before
the troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain
from provocative language,'' said Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Hong Kong Futures Exchange to extend trading hours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong Futures Exchange was granted
permission Monday to extend its trading hours to meet competition
from the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or SIMEX.
	   The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission said the local
futures exchange can open trading 15 minutes earlier and extend the
end of trading by 15 minutes to match the trading hours of SIMEX.
	   The new trading hours will start Friday, three days before SIMEX
launches a futures contract on Hong Kong blue-chip stocks. On
Friday, the trading day will begin at 9:45 a.m. (0145 GMT) and end
at 4:15 p.m. (0815 GMT).
	   Bill Grossman, acting chief executive of the Hong Kong Futures
Exchange, said in a statement that the new hours will ``allow us to
compete on equal terms'' with SIMEX.
	   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange had opposed SIMEX's plans to start
trading a contract linked to the Morgan Stanley Capital
International Hong Kong Index, which mirrors the Hong Kong
blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   The exchange worries about losing business and the possibility
that Hong Kong shares could be manipulated by overseas traders that
it cannot regulate.

	   Netanyahu said he would convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to
review the suspension. On Sunday night, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had agreed that Israel would withdraw from 2 percent of
the West Bank by Friday.
	   The land-for-security agreement is assured the support of some
90 of 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech was mainly aimed at
hard-liners who have threatened to topple his coalition.
	   Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who would not
put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the Palestinians
to violate the accord.
	   ``Unlike others, we do not believe in illusions, a new Middle
East,'' Netanyahu said. ``The Palestinians will test us every day
and we will stand firm.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu of trying
to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu to stop
trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour said
before the suspension of the withdrawal was announced officially.
	   Before his speech, Netanyahu called Arafat to seek
clarifications, but was not satisfied with Arafat's responses,
Israel radio said. Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call,
but refused to discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday, a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon encouraged settlers to seize as much land as they can before
the troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain
from provocative language,'' said Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Too close to call as Sampras bids for record-6th straight No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Down to the wire.
	   That's how it shapes up for Pete Sampras as he bids to finish
the year as No. 1 in the ATP Tour rankings for an unprecedented
sixth straight time.
	   It all comes down to next week's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany. Sampras is the top seed, with Chile's Marcelo
Rios _ his only rival for the No. 1 ranking _ seeded No. 2.
	   Sampras retained the No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings released
Monday. He has 3,703 points, while Rios has 3,670.
	   After Sampras lost in the first round last week in Stockholm,
Rios could have retaken the No. 1 spot he held earlier this year by
winning the tournament in Santiago, Chile. But Rios lost in the
quarterfinals.
	   If Sampras wins the round-robin tournament in Hanover, he
finishes No. 1. The same for Rios. Anything short of that and the
chase for No. 1 enters a labyrinth of possibilities.
	   ``It's a very close race, we can say that,'' said ATP Tour
spokesman Nicola Arzani. ``We can say Sampras has the upper hand,
but Rios still has a chance.''
	   In a nutshell: for Rios to finish No. 1 he has to win at least
two matches in Hanover _ and win one more match than Sampras.
	   If Rios fails to win at least two matches, Sampras will finish
as the season's No. 1 no matter what he does in the Hanover
tournament.
	   This is the first time since 1995 that the ATP Tour World
Championship has had a bearing on the No. 1 season-ending rankings.
In '95, Sampras and Thomas Muster both had a chance to finish No.
1, but Muster eliminated himself by losing his three matches.
	   In addition to Sampras and Rios, the eight-man field for the
tournament includes: Andre Agassi, Carlos Moya, Alex Corretja,
Karol Kucera, Tim Henman and Yegeny Kafelnikov.
	   The draw is next Monday, with Sampras and Rios seeded atop the
two round-robin groups. Under the tournament format, the top two
players after the three round-robin matches advance to the
semifinals.

Southeast Asian nations discuss role in financial reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations should
play a more prominent role in efforts to reshape the international
financial system to avoid future economic crises, a regional
official said Monday.
	   Rodolfo Severino, secretary-general of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, said ASEAN members have begun discussing
the role the regional organization should take.
	   ``ASEAN should take a position,'' Severino said.
	   Severino is in Malaysia attending meetings of the larger
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which includes countries
on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. All of ASEAN's nine members
belong to APEC except for Myanmar and Laos.
	   A possible ASEAN position paper discussed this week by ASEAN
officials described international financial markets as ``deeply
flawed'' and blamed them in part for the region's crisis.
	   It urged APEC to take a ``leading and active role in reshaping
the international financial architecture'' and said the
organization should reduce its current focus on free trade.
	   ``The current (over) emphasis of APEC on economic liberalization
detracts from more fundamental and crucial issues which the APEC
economies face today,'' the document said.
	   Severino said the document received a mixed reaction from ASEAN
officials, with some backing it and others saying some language was
too strong.
	   The document also suggests a comprehensive approach toward debt
rescheduling for countries overwhelmed by debts because of Asia's
currency crisis, and urges European countries to cut interest rates
to stimulate their economies.
	   ASEAN leaders were scheduled to meet during the APEC summit on
Tuesday.

Justice at last in case involving atrocities against Serbs

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Appalled by what they called
``singular brutality'' and ``calculating cruelty,'' U.N. judges
Monday handed down the first international convictions for
atrocities committed against Bosnian Serbs.
	   A three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
convicted a Bosnian Croat and two Muslims for murdering, torturing
and raping Serb prisoners in 1992.
	   But they also acquitted Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military
commander accused of having overall control of the Celebici camp in
central Bosnia, saying there was not enough evidence to link him to
the atrocities.
	   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal. ``The evidence
... was sufficient to convict the accused,'' said Deputy Prosecutor
Graham Blewitt.
	   The 20-month trial was the tribunal's first to concentrate on
atrocities against Serbs _ who are blamed for the majority of war
crimes carried out during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict.
	   Celebici inmates were murdered, tortured and raped by camp
staff, witnesses said in emotional testimony.
	   ``We have been appalled by the details of your criminal
actions,'' Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria told
the camp's deputy commander, Hazim Delic, a Muslim sentenced to 20
years in prison for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners.
	   ``You displayed a singular brutality in causing the deaths of
two men ... and a calculating cruelty in the torture and
mistreatment of many others,'' Karibi-Whyte said.
	   Chewing gum given to him by a U.N. guard, Delic showed no
emotion when he heard the verdicts.
	   In their 483-page ruling, the judges said Delic _ the first
defendant the tribunal has convicted of rape _ appeared ``to take a
sadistic pleasure in causing the detainees pain.''
	   The camp's warden, Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for
overseeing guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo convicted Nazi and Japanese
superiors for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his
neck, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years imprisonment.
Blewitt said he was considering appealing the ``inadequate''
sentence.
	   A camp guard, Esad Landzo, was ordered jailed for 15 years for
murdering three inmates and torturing others.
	   Prosecutors said Landzo and Delic beat to death one man and
nailed a Muslim political party's badge to his head, and that
Landzo also beat a 60-year-old man to death with a wooden plank.
	   Although they were convicted, Mucic, Delic and Landzo also were
acquitted of 34 charges, including several counts of murder and
torture. All four had faced up to life imprisonment.
	   ``The trial of these accused demonstrates the even-handed
approach of the prosecutor,'' Blewitt said.
	   Before Monday, the court had convicted a Bosnian Serb and a
Bosnian Croat who admitted taking part in a Bosnian Serb army
massacre of Muslims. Another Bosnian Serb has admitted murdering 12
Muslims.
	   Serbs account for most of the 56 publicly indicted suspects, and
they have accused the tribunal of being biased against them.
	   ``This is completely unbelievable, a gross injustice,'' Dragan
Cavic, deputy president of Bosnia's hard-line Serbian Democratic
Party, said Monday after the acquittal of Delalic, a Muslim.
	   Blewitt, however, said prosecutors were currently working on
more investigations involving Serbs as the victims of war crimes.

Iraq raises exports to 2 million barrels per day despite crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Despite tension over U.N. weapons
inspections, Iraq honored an earlier pledge to boost its exports up
to 2 million barrels per day since the beginning of November,
senior Oil Ministry officials said Monday.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said at times exports hit 2.2 million barrels when more than three
tankers were available for loading at export terminals.
	   They said they hoped to maintain this level of exports until the
end of the current phase of the oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations despite lack of spare parts and the dilapidated state of
facilities.
	   The Oil Ministry has contingency plans to minimize impact of
bombing on production, refining and export facilities. The
officials acknowledged that such measures were taken. They did not
specify what they were.
	   The crisis deepened when Iraq decided on October 31 to end all
forms of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission disarming it
under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms.
	   Baghdad on Saturday agreed to allow the inspectors to resume
their activities, averting air and missile strikes by the United
States and Britain to force full compliance.
	   The Oil Ministry officials said they were determined to honor
the 59 oil contracts for a total of 308.4 million barrels they
signed with foreign companies under the present leg of partial oil
exports.
	   Last month Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amir Mohammed Rashid said his
country had to lower the quality of its crude oil exports in order
to boost sales and revenue.
	   He said Iraqi crude now had a lower API gravity and higher
sulfur content.
	   The officials admitted the industry was facing difficulties but
said they hoped to overcome most of them when oil spare parts start
arriving in Iraq.
	   Under U.N. decisions, Iraq is allowed to buy dlrs 300 million of
equipment to repair the industry.
	   In the current six-month phase Iraq can export dlrs 5.2 of oil.
But the government says low oil prices and production bottlenecks
will not let Iraq generate more than dlrs 3.5 million during the
present leg expected to expire November 25.
	   The previous limit on oil exports was dlrs 2 billion. The oil
deal skirts U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading
Kuwait in 1990 to help the government buy food, medicine and other
needs for the 22 million Iraqis.

Qatar to set up elected parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar's ruler on Monday announced plans for
an elected parliament.
	   Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani said that an elected
legislature would be incorporated in the country's upcoming
constitution.
	   Sheik Hamad said Monday that he would set up a committee to
start working on the constitution. He gave no further details.
	   An elected parliament, which would give men and women the right
to vote and run for office, would be the only one of its kind in
the Gulf.
	   In the conservative oil-rich Gulf, only Kuwait has an elected
parliament, although women there are not eligible to vote or run
for office.
	   Sheik Hamad seized power from his conservative father in a
bloodless palace coup in 1995 and promised to liberalize the
country. He has since introduced a temporary constitution and
lifted press censorship, allowing newspapers to criticize ministers
and government policies.
	   He has also taken steps for the country's first-ever elections
for a municipal council to be held in February. The 29-member
council will have an advisory role and its resolutions will be
non-binding.
	   Qatar, a small Gulf emirate on the eastern side of the Arabian
Peninsula, has not allowed popular participation in decision-making
since its independence from Britain in 1971. Before coming under
British occupation, the country was a largely tribal and nomadic
society.
	   Qatar now has an advisory council which is appointed by the
emir, but the council lacks legislative powers.
	   Some 600,000 people live in Qatar _ about 450,000 of them
foreigners, mostly laborers from the Indian subcontinent.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A man jumped from his car and
stabbed to death his 13-year-old daughter in front of her friends,
a Dutch newspaper reported Monday.
	   The slaying occurred Sunday afternoon as the girl was out for a
walk with her two friends in an Amsterdam suburb. Her father drove
up, stepped out of his car and stabbed her several times with a
knife, the daily De Telegraaf reported.
	   The 38-year-old father fled from the scene, but was later
arrested. The girl died in the hospital from her wounds.
	   Their names were not released in line with Dutch police
practice.
	   De Telegraaf said the victim was removed from her home more than
a year ago and was taken to a shelter in Amsterdam. The family has
been experiencing problems for a long time, but the nature of their
difficulties was not disclosed.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A ministerial committee led by Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury decided Monday to offer for sale to
major investors more than 50 per cent of four trading companies,
the official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   It quoted Cabinet Affairs Minister Talaat Hamad as saying that
the stakes in the four companies _ Al-Nasr for Export and Import,
Misr for Export and Import, Al-Arabiya for Foreign Trade and Misr
for Automobile Trade _ were worth 600 million pounds (dlrs 176.47
million).
	   Egypt has been privatizing state-owned firms as part of a
far-reaching economic reform plan agreed with the international
Monetary Fund in 1991 to create a market economy. The sale of all
314 companies designated for privatization is expected to be
completed by 2000.

Britain ends use of animals in all cosmetic tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 8th graf, CORRECTS to read now sted not &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Companies in Britain will stop using animals to
test cosmetic products, the first European Union to impose a ban,
the government said Monday.
	   The agreement was welcomed by animals rights activists, and Paul
McCartney said it would have made his late wife, Linda, who was a
leading campaigner, very happy.
	   However, the ban will have scant effect on the number of animals
involved in experiments because almost all are used in testing and
developing drugs, or research into animal biology.
	   Last year, experiments were carried out involving 2.6 million
animals, of which only 1,266 were used for testing cosmetics, the
Home Office said.
	   Last November, British cosmetic companies agreed voluntarily
with the government to stop testing finished cosmetic products on
animals.
	   The new agreement extends the ban to testing ingredients used in
cosmetics and the companies will voluntarily give up their testing
licenses, the Home Office said.
	   ``This is great news for our civilization and for the animals,''
said former Beatle McCartney, whose wife died of breast cancer in
April.
	   ``On behalf of my family _ and I know Linda would want to be
included _ we are very happy to see this happening and we hope that
other countries will now follow this lead,'' he added.
	   Mrs. McCartney opposed all animal testing, although her husband
has acknowledged that drugs tested on animals were probably used
during her cancer treatment.
	   Animal rights campaigners have protested for years, sometimes
violently, over the cruelty to animals caused by the testing of
lipsticks and other beauty aids.
	   ``We deal with irrelevancies _ skin and hair care is not a
matter of life and death and that is what we are opposed to,'' said
Anita Roddick who founded a chain store, Body Shop, which sold only
products not tested on animals.
	   Lawmaker Roger Gale, chairman of an all-party parliamentary
committee on animal welfare, said Britain should press for a
Europe-wide ban.

Netanyahu suspends troop withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced
Monday that he is suspending an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank until the Palestinians drop plans to declare independence in
May.
	   Netanyahu made the announcement in a speech to parliament that
began a two-day debate on the agreement, under which Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   It was scheduled to start later this week.
	   The prime minister is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat who has renewed a pledge to declare statehood
in May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to defend Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstance ... until these things are corrected in public,''
Netanyahu told parliament. He was interrupted frequently by
heckling.
	   The Israeli prime minister said he would convene his Cabinet on
Wednesday to review the suspension of the withdrawal. On Sunday
night, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had agreed that Israel
would withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank by Friday.
	   The land-for-security agreement is assured the support of some
90 of 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech was mainly aimed at
hard-liners who have threatened to topple his coalition.
	   Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who would not
put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the Palestinians
to violate the accord.
	   ``Unlike others, we do not believe in illusions, a new Middle
East,'' the prime minister said. ``The Palestinians will test us
every day and we will stand firm.''
	   Earlier, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour accused Netanyahu
of trying to wriggle out of his commitments. ``I urge Mr. Netanyahu
to stop trying to evade the agreements by using excuses,'' Asfour
said before the suspension of the withdrawal was announced.
	   Before his speech, Netanyahu telephoned Arafat to seek
clarifications, but was not satisfied with the Palestinian leader's
responses, Israel radio said. Palestinian officials confirmed the
phone call, but refused to discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday, a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon encouraged settlers to seize as much land as possible before
the troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police ordered the settlers to leave.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. pressure, Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain
from provocative language,'' said Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Towering cypress hedges spark war with next door in England
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Suburbanites brandish axes and chainsaws. The
government is on the brink of joining battle. The national news
media are on the scene.
	   Towering green aliens are here and they are marching across
Britain, pitting neighbor against neighbor and killing off innocent
lawns wherever they cast their 30-foot (10-meter) shadows.
	   Cupressocyparis leylandii, the American leyland cypress tree _
which grows more than 3 feet (1 meter) per year _ can cause great
distress when planted between neighbors as a hedge. And hundreds of
these hedges are sprouting nationwide as homeowners discover the
almost instant privacy they provide.
	   ``It's our highest-selling conifer,'' says Simon Eade, manager
of the Alexandra Palace Garden Center in north London. ``It's
definitely not for the small garden.''
	   Simple privacy is not the only reason to plant a leylandii
hedge.
	   The petty-minded might be tempted to retaliate for past
grievances against the folks next door by allowing untrimmed
leylandii to shade the neighbors' patio and turn their cherished
lawn into a brown patch.
	   Rage sometimes takes root on the shady side of the shrubbery,
for which the British use the Latin name, pronounced in four
syllables _ lay-LAN-dee-eye.
	   At the nub of the leylandii problem is a conflict of national
characteristics _ the sunlight cravings of a cool, damp, northerly
nation; a pride and pleasure in gardening; and a profound desire
for privacy.
	   Add to this the conviction that a man's home is his castle, and
you have the makings of a neighborhood war.
	   Britain's undisputed chief leylandii warrior is Michael Jones,
who won a 6 1/2-year, 100,000 pound (dlrs 168,000) court fight
against his neighbor, whose 24-foot (7-meter) hedge left Jones
without enough sunshine for a decent herbaceous border.
	   To build a fence over 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) in a garden, a
homeowner has to apply for planning permission. But no such
permission is required for hedges or trees.
	   So Jones took matters into his own hands a couple of times,
lopping off 5 feet (1.5 meters), then 4 feet (1.2 meters) of the
offending shrubbery. His neighbor took him to court, alleging
damage and trespass _ and ended up with a hedge reduced to 12 feet
(3.6 meters) and a bill for all the court costs.
	   Jones' widely publicized ordeal and victory struck a chord with
other leylandii sufferers.
	   ``My life was transformed,'' said the 70-year-old resident of
Birmingham, in central England. ``My telephone was just
continuous.''
	   Some 2,000 people have joined Hedgeline, a support group he
established ``to provide fellowship in adversity,'' and to persuade
the government that leylandii legislation is needed.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper is waging a national campaign to bring
leylandii planting under legal controls, and the government has set
up a leylandii working group to determine what should be done.
	   Hedgeline's goal is to get hedges listed with other ``statutory
nuisances'' under environmental law, which would help local
governments take action on individual cases.
	   On its Web site, Hedgeline warns members that lopping off
neighbors' hedges is still illegal, despite Jones' victory, made
possible only because local regulations gave him leverage most
others don't have.
	   Instead, pending national legislation, the organization
recommends that sufferers ``appeal gently'' to their neighbors'
sense of fair play before resorting to the local government or
small claims court.
	   And speaking of gentle appeals, how are relations nowadays
between Jones and the guy at the back of his garden?
	   Another hedge has been planted behind the infamous one and Jones
judges it to be about 20 feet (6 meters) high.
	   ``We don't,'' he said, ``exchange Christmas cards.''

Berlin NFL Europe team gets a name: Thunder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The new franchise in the NFL Europe League finally
has a name: the Berlin Thunder.
	   Berlin was awarded a team in June, but the name wasn't announced
until Monday.
	   The name Thunder was chosen by fans in a newspaper poll, beating
out Stallions, 89ers, 99ers and Blitz.
	   General manager Michael Lang couldn't resist saying, ``We plan
to erupt like Thunder when we begin playing next spring.''
	   Berlin received a team after the England Monarchs, once the
flagship of the league, folded after last season.
	   Berlin is the third German team in the six-team league, joining
the Frankfurt Galaxy and Duesseldorf Rhein Fire. The other teams
are the Barcelona Dragons, Amsterdam Admirals and Scottish
Claymores.
	   The Thunder will play its first game at Frankfurt when the
season kicks off April 17. The first home game will be a week later
against the Scottish Claymores.

EU tightens rules on government subsidies to industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union nations agreed Monday to
tighten controls on the dlrs 45 billion a year they spend on state
aid to industry and make it easier for EU regulators to reclaim
unauthorized subsidies.
	   New regulations approved by industry ministers from the 15 EU
nations will give the EU's executive Commission more power to
demand immediate repayment of illegal aid and increase its scope to
monitor companies' compliance with conditions for receiving
subsidies.
	   Under EU law, governments must seek clearance from the
Commission, before paying state aids to industry. The Commission
can impose conditions on the subsidies, or veto payments judged to
violate rules governing fair competition within the 15-nation bloc.
	   The EU's top state-aid watchdog, Competition Commissioner Karel
Van Miert, welcomed the decision to reinforce his powers. ``From
now on, the Commission will be better equipped in its combat
against illegal subsidies and everything will be more open,'' he
said in a statement.
	   The Commission estimates EU governments paid 38 billion European
currency units (dlrs 45 billion) a year to manufacturing industry
from 1994 to 1996.
	   Britain's representative at Monday's meeting said the new rules
would help make European companies more competitive.
	   ``High volumes of aid to industry across the EU are a big brake
on our competitiveness,'' said Lord Simon, British Minister for
European trade. ``The era of huge rescue packages for failing firms
must come to an end.''
	   The new rules are expected to come into force in the first half
of 1999.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced

U.S. diplomat to press Milosevic over Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Walker-Milosevic meeting under way, reports of
shootouts in Kosovo; Walker to hold press conference in Pristina.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo after a reported intimidation attempt, an
American diplomat pressed the Yugoslav president Monday to honor a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Faced with NATO intervention, President Slobodan Milosevic on
Oct. 12 agreed to pull out his security forces, end a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow
a 2,000-man mission of international verifiers to observe his
compliance.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, met
Milosevic in Serbia's capital Belgrade. Walker was due to speak to
reporters on the talks later Monday when he returns to Kosovo.
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into sharp focus
Sunday after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun
rounds over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central
Kosovo.
	   A spokesman for the mission said a car from the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observers Mission was near Dulje in the province's
southwest when it encountered an army column coming the other way.
	   As the observers' car passed by, the army vehicle, equipped with
a heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead, observers' spokesman
Duncan Bullivant said.
	   The Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the bursts came
from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their engines slowed
down to pass the monitors.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said Sunday, saying random firing was not in the spirit
of the cease-fire agreement and that the monitors had security
guarantees from Milosevic.
	   Beside expressing concern about ``the deterioration of the
agreement,'' Walker also planned to suggest Milosevic withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said.
	   The meeting came as ethnic Albanians were downplaying hopes for
imminent progress toward a political settlement for the restive,
Albanian-majority province.
	   A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in Kosovo indicated the
Albanians were likely to reject the new initiative by Serbian
authorities for long-sought direct talks.
	   Fehmi Agani, a top aide to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, said, ``Conditions have not been made'' for a meeting
between the Serb and Albanian sides. Agani said indirect, talks
should continue instead.
	   President Milan Milutinovic had proposed over the weekend to
chair face-to-face talks with the ethnic Albanians in Pristina on
Wednesday, with international officials in attendance.
	   Meanwhile, scattered violence continued in Kosovo Monday.
	   Two ethnic Albanian women were wounded by Serb police on a road
about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Pristina, the Kosovo
Information Center, close to the province's Albanian leadership,
reported.
	   The two were shot when police opened fire at a car which refused
to halt for the police, said the center.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Lapastica police station was
attacked by Albanian ``extremists'' and that police returned fire.
The Serb report stated no injuries.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed and it was not
clear whether the shootings were related.
	   A shootout between Serb police and Albanian rebels also occurred
near Dulje Monday. No one was injured, Serb sources said.
	   Earlier in the morning, a Serb police station in the town of
Orahovac in central Kosovo was attacked, and a car in front of it
was riddled with bullets, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Germany will not give Russia any emergency
financial aid outside the money it's providing through
international lenders, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told Russian
leaders in Moscow on Monday.
	   ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for additional German aid,
Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5 tons (1.65 short tons) of
medicine aid with him, German officials said.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, met
with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday, and both
pledged to ensure that Russian-German relations would continue to
flourish. Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which helped secure significant
German investment and aid in Russia.
	   Primakov said the relationship with Germany was a ``priority''
for Russia.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said at the
start of the meeting. ``Naturally, we would like to learn more
about your experience.''
	   Primakov also said Russia was eager to attract foreign capital
and would guarantee investor security, Schroeder told reporters.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan presented this
weekend a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders to
resume aid. He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend that
the IMF release the money.
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have offered some aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder met other Russian politicians at the German
ambassador's residence later Monday, and is to confer with
President Boris Yeltsin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.
	   Schroeder said he was looking forward to meeting with Yeltsin,
but stressed that the relationship between Germany and Russia must
not rely too much on personal ties. Kohl was attacked last summer
by critics who saw Yeltsin as part of Russia's problems.
	   Schroeder praised Russia's influence with Iraq in helping to
avoid new crises in the Gulf. Schroeder was also expected to
discuss the situation in Kosovo and NATO expansion, the Russian
Foreign Ministry said.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed U.S. and NATO threats to use force
in Iraq and Kosovo, and protests NATO's intention to incorporate
former Soviet allies in Central and Eastern Europe.
	   During his visit, Schroeder will also meet with speakers of both
chambers of the Russian parliament, take a stroll on Moscow's Red
Square and take part in a meeting with Russian college students.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Setting aside a dispute that
prevented a landmark free-trade agreement, Japan and the United
States joined hands Monday and offered plans to pump an additional
dlrs 10 billion into Asia's troubled economies.
	   ``This much is clear _ just as the global crisis started here in
Asia, the global economic recovery can and must start in Asia as
well,'' U.S. President Gore said in a speech announcing the rescue
packages to Asian leaders and business executives.
	   Gore also used his speech to indirectly praise an
anti-government reform movement that exploded in Malaysia several
months ago when its prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, fired his
protege, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, then jailed him and
placed him on trial.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore.
	   Often, he said, people suffering through economic crises call
out for more democracy in their countries.
	   ``We hear them today _ right here, right now _ among the brave
people of Malaysia,'' Gore said.
	   The comments seemed certain to anger Mahathir, who sat in the
audience at the Putra World Trade Center, and who will host the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that Gore and 19 other
leaders attend in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   But Gore, who has refused to meet with Mahathir privately during
the his APEC summit visit, shook hands with the Malaysian leader
following the speech.
	   Other leaders in the audience included President Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, Philippines President Joseph Estrada, New Zealand
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai of
Vietnam.
	   Gore, a last-minute stand-in for U.S. President Bill Clinton at
the APEC summit, seemed determined in his speech to reassure Asia,
where the global economic crisis began 17 months ago, that the
world's largest economy stands ready to try to help its allies out
of a serious economic difficulties.
	   He also used it to praise the free-market economic approach
endorsed by the International Monetary Fund and laid out in the new
initiatives that the United States were putting forward.
	   Mahathir has imposed capital controls to protect his economy
from wild gyrations in currency and stock markets across Asia, and
has criticized its IMF bailout programs.
	   Clinton canceled his trip to the summit at the last minute on
Saturday because of the showdown with Baghdad, during which he
nearly launched a military attack on Iraq to punish it for once
again expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The package of proposals would include dlrs 5 billion in support
offered by the United States, and the creation of a dlrs 5 billion
joint initiative supported by the United States, Japan, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Gore said the dlrs 5 billion in U.S. support includes dlrs 1
billion each in loans to Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, the
three countries hardest hit by the Asia crisis.
	   The remaining dlrs 2 billion will provide loan guarantees
through the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support
private business deals.
	   The dlrs 5 billion joint initiative was announced Monday night
in a joint statement by Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi that was released in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Because of legal restraints, the United States is not providing
any direct financial support. The exact amounts that Japan, the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will put up were to be
announced later.
	   Like other APEC members, Gore spent most of Monday holding
bilateral meetings with other leaders. During one, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin criticized U.S. support for the Dalai Lama,
the exiled Tibetan leader, and for Taiwan, the island regarded by
Beijing as a renegade province.
	   Gore invited Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to visit the United
States next year.
	   On Sunday, the APEC Cabinet ministers failed to achieve a
landmark agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in
global trade. The fight now goes to the 124-nation World Trade
Organization, where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff
Japanese resistance to cutting tariffs in two sectors it considers
politically sensitive _ wood and fish products.
	   The United States, which had pushed the hardest to force Japan
to agree to slash tariffs in all nine sectors of the proposed
agreement, reluctantly accepted the outcome as the best Washington
could get at the moment, thanks to Japan.
	   Seeking to put the best face on the failure to achieve a
breakthrough, U.S. officials insisted that it was at least a
partial victory that the whole effort did not collapse.
	   At the WTO, APEC members hope to attract other countries outside
the region to the effort to slash tariffs in products ranging from
chemicals to medical equipment.
	   Japan claimed a victory in the trade negotiations, saying it
staved off pressure from the United States and other nations.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Witnesses said the 13 injured all suffered burns.
	   Sohag is 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of the capital, Cairo.
	   About 10 million of the Egypt's 60 million people are
Christians. The rest are Muslims.

Southeast Asian nations discuss role in financial reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations should
play a more prominent role in efforts to reshape the international
financial system to avoid future economic crises, a regional
official said Monday.
	   Rodolfo Severino, secretary-general of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, said ASEAN members have begun discussing
the role the regional organization should take.
	   ``ASEAN should take a position,'' Severino said.
	   Severino is in Malaysia attending meetings of the larger
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which includes countries
on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. All of ASEAN's nine members
belong to APEC except for Myanmar and Laos.
	   A possible ASEAN position paper discussed this week by ASEAN
officials described international financial markets as ``deeply
flawed'' and blamed them in part for the region's crisis.
	   It urged APEC to take a ``leading and active role in reshaping
the international financial architecture'' and said the
organization should reduce its current focus on free trade.
	   ``The current (over) emphasis of APEC on economic liberalization
detracts from more fundamental and crucial issues which the APEC
economies face today,'' the document said.
	   Severino said the document received a mixed reaction from ASEAN
officials, with some backing it and others saying some language was
too strong.
	   The document also suggests a comprehensive approach toward debt
rescheduling for countries overwhelmed by debts because of Asia's
currency crisis, and urges European countries to cut interest rates
to stimulate their economies.
	   ASEAN leaders were scheduled to meet during the APEC summit on
Tuesday.

Wife of Saddam's half-brother dies, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The wife of the half-brother of Saddam Hussein has
died in Switzerland, officials said Monday.
	   An official of the Iraqi embassy said he understood Ahlam
al-Tikriti died last week. She was 44.
	   A spokeswoman for a suburban hospital confirmed that she died,
but declined to give the cause or say when. Mrs. al-Tikriti had
reportedly been under treatment for breast cancer.
	   The death is expected to complicate the situation of her
husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, who last summer was ordered to return
to Baghdad in a sweeping change of diplomatic posts.
	   He reportedly has cited his wife's illness and treatment as
reasons for his staying on Geneva, but has denied having any desire
to join the Iraqi opposition.
	   Earlier this month Iraqi dissidents said a cousin of Saddam
failed to convince al-Tikriti to return home instead of going into
exile.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46,headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations in
Geneva for 10 years.
	   He was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled
to Baghdad over the summer.
	   Last month, Saddam's cousin, Gen. Mizahem Saab al-Hassan, met
with al-Tikriti in Geneva and conveyed a message that his decision
to go into exile is harming the Iraqi regime's image, said the
dissidents.
	   The Swiss government says al-Tikriti has until the end of
November to leave Geneva under Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats
to stay on in Switzerland for three months after the end of their
tenure.
	   Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti also is survived by six
children, ranging in age from 11 to 26.

Kurds continue hunger strike in support of detained leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS Germany studying extradition, demonstration in

 &UR; AP Photo Planned

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ About 2,000 Kurds gathered outside a military
hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed
held, keeping up a hunger strike Monday to protest his detention.
	   Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome
to show their support for Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was
arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had
been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout
in Syria.
	   He has now appealed to Italy for asylum.
	   Italian news reports said Monday that Ocalan had written to
Premier Massimo D'Alema asking why he hadn't been granted asylum
yet. In excerpts published by the daily La Stampa, Ocalan said he
had been approached by ``some friends in Italy's Parliament'' and
``authoritative persons in your government,'' leading him to
believe Italy would grant him asylum.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and the country's
most-wanted criminal. The Turkish government is pressuring Italy to
extradite Ocalan, who leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party,
PKK.
	   The party has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey since 1984 and the conflict has killed nearly 37,000 people.
	   Ocalan also faces an outstanding, 1990 warrant in Germany for
terrorist attacks. In Bonn, Justice Ministry spokesman Bernhard
Boehm said Germany was studying whether to seek his extradition.
	   Kurds in Germany, Austria and Romania also launched protests and
hunger strikes over the weekend to show their solidarity with the
rebel leader. A Kurdish spokesman in Bonn said nationwide protests
were planned for Tuesday in Germany.
	   In Copenhagen, about 200 Kurds chanting ``Long Live Kurdistan''
and ``Free Our Leader Ocalan'' marched through the streets bearing
Kurdish flags and photos of the rebel leader.
	   The Red Cross and local volunteers have been distributing
blankets and medicines to the Kurds camped out in front of Rome's
Celio hospital. Prefabricated toilets are also being installed.
	   The Kurds have reportedly said they will call off the hunger
strike Tuesday when Italian authorities plan to interrogate Ocalan
to evaluate his asylum request.
	   Ocalan risks the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has
heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there
have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has
consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a
possibility of capital punishment.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 100 Kurdish residents of Moscow were on
the third day of a hunger strike Monday in support of a Kurdish
rebel leader who was arrested last week in Rome, a news agency
said.
	   The hunger-strikers are protesting what they call an
international conspiracy against Abdullah Ocalan, who leads the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, the Interfax news agency said.
	   In the Armenian capital Yerevan, about 50 Kurd leaders also have
been on hunger strike since Saturday. On Monday, some 700 Kurds
marched through Yerevan to the United Nations representative office
to demand freedom for Ocalan.
	   ``You will not succeed in putting out our Sun,'' read one
poster.
	   The PKK has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, where
it has been outlawed. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the
14-year-old conflict.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday in Rome on a Turkish warrant after
stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he had fled after being
forced out of Syria. Russia denied him asylum; Italy has still not
decided whether to grant him refuge.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings. The charges can bring the death
penalty.
	   Thousands of Kurds demonstrated in support of Ocalan in Rome and
in towns across Germany over the weekend.

International envoy blasts Bosnian Muslims over stalled agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A senior international envoy said Monday
Bosnian Muslim leaders' refusal to sign an agreement on special
ties with neighboring Croatia is ``irresponsible and a disservice''
to the people who elected them.
	   The comments, by Jacques Klein, a deputy to Bosnia's high
representative, Carlos Westendorp followed last-minute cancellation
of a trip to Zagreb by Bosnian Muslim government figures to sign
the accord.
	   It was the second time the signing had been postponed _ Bosnian
Muslim leaders also failed to appear last week, citing technical
reasons.
	   ``This situation calls into question the desire of (Bosnian)
Federation government officials to negotiate in good faith, their
capability to engage in coherent international negotiations and
their concern for their citizens,'' Klein told reporters.
	   Ejup Ganic, the president of the Muslim-Croat Federation, who
was supposed to appear in Zagreb for the signing, said the delay
was meant to give parliament in Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation
time to discuss the agreement. He told reporters that a delay of
``a day or two, more or less, should not be critical.''
	   World powers involved in the Balkan peace process since the
Dayton peace accords ended fighting in 1995 are keen to see the
agreement signed as a step towards lasting peace in the region.
	   Relations between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have been uneasy
since they fought each other in 1993-94. Croatia aided the Bosnian
Croats throughout the Bosnian war and Croatia is suspected by
Muslims in Bosnia of seeking to annex Croat-held regions in Bosnia
proper.
	   Western officials believe the agreement would define relations,
specifying in a transparent way, military and economic cooperation
_ issues which are reportedly the source of continued disputes.
	   Croatia remains a major financial backer of Bosnian Croats, and
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is considered their chief
decision-maker.
	   The ``special relationship'' agreement would supposedly end such
uncontrolled aid, and define forms in which Croatia can help its
proxies without violating the integrity of the Bosnian Federation
of Croats and Muslims, which shares the country with a Serb
substate.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Appalled by what they called
``singular brutality'' and ``calculating cruelty,'' U.N. judges
Monday handed down the first international convictions for
atrocities committed against Bosnian Serbs.
	   A three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
convicted a Bosnian Croat and two Muslims for murdering, torturing
and raping Serb prisoners in 1992.
	   But they also acquitted Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military
commander accused of having overall control of the Celebici camp in
central Bosnia, saying there was not enough evidence to link him to
the atrocities.
	   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal. ``The evidence
... was sufficient to convict the accused,'' said Deputy Prosecutor
Graham Blewitt.
	   The 20-month trial was the tribunal's first to concentrate on
atrocities against Serbs _ who are blamed for the majority of war
crimes carried out during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict.
	   Celebici inmates were murdered, tortured and raped by camp
staff, witnesses said in emotional testimony.
	   ``We have been appalled by the details of your criminal
actions,'' Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria told
the camp's deputy commander, Hazim Delic, a Muslim sentenced to 20
years in prison for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners.
	   ``You displayed a singular brutality in causing the deaths of
two men ... and a calculating cruelty in the torture and
mistreatment of many others,'' Karibi-Whyte said.
	   Chewing gum given to him by a U.N. guard, Delic showed no
emotion when he heard the verdicts.
	   In their 483-page ruling, the judges said Delic _ the first
defendant the tribunal has convicted of rape _ appeared ``to take a
sadistic pleasure in causing the detainees pain.''
	   The camp's warden, Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for
overseeing guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo convicted Nazi and Japanese
superiors for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross, smiled as he heard
his sentence of seven years imprisonment. Blewitt said he was
considering appealing the ``inadequate'' sentence.
	   A camp guard, Esad Landzo, was ordered jailed for 15 years for
murdering three inmates and torturing others.
	   Prosecutors said Landzo and Delic beat to death one man and
nailed a Muslim political party's badge to his head, and that
Landzo also beat a 60-year-old man to death with a wooden plank.
	   Although they were convicted, Mucic, Delic and Landzo also were
acquitted of 34 charges, including several counts of murder and
torture. All four had faced up to life imprisonment.
	   ``The trial of these accused demonstrates the evenhanded
approach of the prosecutor,'' Blewitt said.
	   Before Monday, the court had convicted a Bosnian Serb and a
Bosnian Croat who admitted taking part in a Bosnian Serb army
massacre of Muslims. Another Bosnian Serb has admitted murdering 12
Muslims.
	   Serbs account for most of the 56 publicly indicted suspects, and
they have accused the tribunal of being biased against them.
	   ``This is completely unbelievable, a gross injustice,'' Dragan
Cavic, deputy president of Bosnia's hard-line Serbian Democratic
Party, said Monday after the acquittal of Delalic, a Muslim.
	   Blewitt, however, said prosecutors were currently working on
more investigations involving Serbs as the victims of war crimes.

Fund launched to send Jewish youth to Israel for free trip

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hoping to strengthen ties between world Jewish
communities and the Jewish state, a group of philanthropists have
unveiled an ambitious and big-ticket project to bring Jewish teens
on an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel.
	   Private donors, charitable organizations and the Israeli
government are pushing to raise dlrs 300 million over the next five
years to kick off the ``Birthright Israel'' project by 2000.
	   The money will be used to pay for air fare and ten days of
educational programs in Israel for every Jewish youth in the world
between the ages of 15 and 26, organizers said.
	   Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company who helped
launch the project, said Birthright Israel was his way of helping
young Jews reconnect with their Jewish heritage
	   ``This is where it all started,'' Bronfman told The Associated
Press. ``It gives them a chance to look at Israel today, modern
Israel and gives them past, present, and hope for the future.''
	   Bronfman is in Israel for the General Assembly, the annual
meeting of North American Jewish leaders, who are convening in
Israel for the first time.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Kenneth Noye, wanted for questioning over a
so-called 'road rage' killing in London, told a Spanish judge
Monday he will fight Britain's efforts to extradite him.
	   Noye's move triggers legal proceedings that could last up to
five months until Spain decides whether to extradite him.
	   Noye, 51, who was arrested in southern Spain in August after
spending two years on the run, appeared at the National Court
before Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon for a 10-minute preliminary
hearing.
	   He wore a dark blue track suit, black sports shoes and was
handcuffed as he was led into the courtroom to face the same judge
who is seeking Augusto Pinochet's extradition from Britain.
	   Noye is wanted for questioning in the May 1996 stabbing death of
21-year-old Stephen Cameron after they got into an argument on an
entry road to the M25, a busy highway that encircles London.
	   He is being held in a prison outside Madrid.
	   Noye refused to comment to reporters on leaving the court but
his British attorney, Henry Milner, said Noye told the judge he
would fight extradition.
	   The suspect had been quoted over the weekend in a British
newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, as saying he was so sure he could
prove his innocence that he was considering agreeing to be
extradited.
	   Now that he has contested Britain's extradition request, the
next step is for a Spanish prosecutor to prepare a report for the
court.
	   Then Noye will appear at a formal extradition hearing before a
three-judge panel which will decide whether to send him to Britain.
	   That hearing will be held some time over the next five months,
according to Jose Ramon Garcia, a Spanish attorney who represented
the British Embassy at Monday's hearing.
	   Noye was sentenced in 1986 to 14 years in prison in Britain for
his role in a dlrs 38.7 million gold robbery. He was released
several years ago.
	   Britain's tabloid press routinely refers to him as one of the
country's most wanted men.
	   In 1985 he was acquitted of killing an undercover policeman,
John Fordham, who was on the grounds of a mansion Noye owned in
West Kingsdown, southeast of London. Fordham was part of a team
investigating the gold robbery. Noye said he killed him in
self-defense.
	   After Noye fled Britain in November 1996 in the wake of the M25
killing, a prosecutor told England's High Court that Noye played a
leading role in a scheme to defraud banks of millions of pounds
(dollars) from automated teller machines.

Thousands demonstrate against closure of factories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six days after the Seita tobacco company announced
the closure of two factories in the year 2000, thousands of
employees marched in the streets Monday to protest the feared loss
of hundreds of jobs.
	   At least 1,000 people demonstrated in Tonneins, the southwestern
town where one of the factories is located, and 2,000 people in
Morlaix in Brittany.
	   Workers at Seita plants in the cities of Lille and Strasbourg
also demonstrated, French radio reported, in solidarity with their
co-workers in the two affected towns.
	   ``Seita can and must live in Tonneins!'' read one banner. Seita
is the major employer in Tonneins.
	   Employees also set up a blockade on the highway, slowing down
traffic so they could hand out flyers to drivers.
	   Union leaders say 333 jobs in Tonneins will be cut due to the
closures.
	   Seita manager Xavier Bibard said the reason for the planned
closures was a 10 percent drop each year in demand for cigarettes
made with dark tobacco, because of competition from American makers
of blond tobacco cigarettes.
	   The company says that of those losing their jobs, 50 percent
will get early retirement, and efforts will be made to find the
others jobs within the company.

Catholics present calendar of millennium events in the Holy Land
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writethru &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Expressing hopes for peace, the Assembly of
Catholic Bishops in the Holy Land on Monday unveiled a calendar of
millennium celebrations that includes events aimed at bringing
together Muslims, Jews and Christians.
	   ``It will be an occasion to join all together, really to praise
God on this opportunity,'' said Bishop Kamal-Hanna Bathish, the
chief organizer of the celebrations commemorating the 2000th
anniversary of Jesus' birth.
	   The Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah, said that for
the time being, the pope has not made plans to visit Jerusalem
during the millennium. Such a visit would require ``better times,''
Sabbah said. ``The situation of conflict of the land is one main
reason which we or Rome cannot now decide on a date,'' he said.
	   Pope John Paul II has expressed a keen desire to visit Jerusalem
as part of the millennium celebrations, but has not announced
concrete plans to do so. The pope has declared the Holy Land and
Rome as the two focal points of the millennium celebrations.
	   The Vatican does not recognize Israel's claim to the entire city
of Jerusalem, including traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. It has
asked that sites holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims be protected
by an international statute.
	   The millennium celebrations in the Holy Land will begin on
Christmas Eve 1999 and run though Epiphany in January 2001.
	   The events follow the church's liturgical year, with special
celebrations marking feast days and seasons.
	   Among the events are prayer vigils on the last day of the
millennium, Dec. 31, 1999; pilgrimages to Christian sites; and a
day for weddings and renewal of vow at Cana, where Jesus performed
his first miracle at a wedding feast by turning water into wine.
	   Some of the year's events aim to create a dialogue between
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, said Father Robert J. Fortin.
Among these events are a meeting of the religions in Jerusalem and
an event for youth in Haifa.
	   Israel is expecting up to 4.5 million tourists, about twice the
usual number, during the millennium celebrations. Fortin, however,
said estimates were probably too high and that the number of
pilgrims would be limited by space in hotels.

WFP staffer shot to death in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The World Food Program said Monday that one of its
staffers in Angola was shot to death over the weekend by
unidentified assailants.
	   It identified him as Elias Sayala, 38, and said he was shot
Saturday while working at a WFP warehouse in Kuito, the capital of
the province of Bie.
	   ``This is a senseless crime and the WFP will use all the
resources at our disposal to aid the police in identifying those
responsible,'' WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini said in a
statement.
	   The WFP said Sayala, a native of Angola, had worked for the
program for two years. He is survived by a wife and four children,
it said.
	   Sayala was the eight WFP staffer killed this year, the
Rome-based U.N. agency said. It added that a special task force has
been created to give security training to its 4,000 staffers, 80
percent of whom work in the field.
	   The WFP statement said about 25,000 people are getting food aid
in Kuito, which was very badly damaged in fighting during the last
round of the Angolan civil war in 1992.
	   Sayala was shot to death at about 11:30 p.m.. No food was
stolen, it added, and no one else was injured, the agency said.

Suspect in dramatic German kidnap case escapes from prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Europe-wide alert issued, reward offered &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ German police were searching Monday for
a dangerous escaped prisoner who had been awaiting trial in the
dramatic kidnapping of a young man left to die in a pit in the
woods.
	   Sergei Serov, 38, used bed sheets to climb down from the roof of
the jail in Potsdam, just south of Berlin, late Saturday, police
said. Jail officials didn't realize he was missing until midday
Sunday, although a surveillance camera on a neighboring building
had captured the escape on videotape.
	   Police across Europe were notified to be on the lookout for
Serov, who is considered to be potentially violent and very
dangerous, police spokesman Geert Piorkowski said. Officials said
he probably would be heading east.
	   Serov and fellow Russian Vyacheslav Orlov, 28, were to go on
trial early next year on charges of kidnapping leading to death.
Authorities said the two had made partial confessions in the case
of Matthias Hintze, a 20-year-old kidnapped Sept. 14, 1997 and
buried in a pit, where he slowly suffocated.
	   His body was found Oct. 8, 1997, a day after the two Russians
were arrested while trying to pick up the 1 million mark (dlrs
625,000) ransom.
	   Last week, Berlin prosecutors also filed kidnapping charges
against the two in the case of a Berlin-based Russian computer
dealer, Alexander Galius, who disappeared in June 1997. One million
marks was demanded in that case as well.
	   Galius was never found and police suspect he died in an
underground shaft like Hintze.
	   Galius' son offered a 300,000 mark (dlrs 182,000) reward for
information leading to Serov's capture.

Ukraine eliminates first strategic bomber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Senator Richard Lugar watched
Ukrainian defense officials slice up a strategic bomber Monday, the
first of several dozen Ukraine is to destroy under a nuclear
disarmament program he spearheaded.
	   The elimination team at the Pryluky air base in northeast
Ukraine first removed all classified material from the Tu-160 plane
and then cut off its tail, said Defense Ministry spokesman Dmytro
Shkurko.
	   It was not clear how much of the plane remained intact, but
American and Ukrainian defense officials had planned that engines,
high-quality pieces of steel and other parts of the bombers could
be used for civilian purposes.
	   Ukraine inherited the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal with
the 1991 Soviet collapse, including 19 Tu-160s and 25 Tu-95 MC
bombers. The long-range planes, designed to carry guided missiles
with nuclear warheads, are based at two airfields in Kiev and
Chernihiv regions.
	   The United States has contributed more than dlrs 500 million to
help Ukraine dismantle the bombers and other nuclear weapons
infrastructure under the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program
initiated by Lugar and then-Senator Sam Nunn in 1991.
	   Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, was accompanied Monday by
Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican Senator
Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
	   Shkurko could not say whether the plane underwent a typical
destruction procedure, under which the aircraft's fuselage is cut
through in several different places and its wings cut off.
	   Ukraine has unsuccessfully tried to sell the warplanes to Russia
for years, and finally decided last April to destroy them.
	   The Nunn-Lugar program provides for American technical
assistance to the former Soviet Union to eliminate weapons of mass
destruction and account for weapons material.
	   Ukraine has surrendered all its nuclear warheads to Russia and
pledged to remain nuclear-free. It has destroyed all 130 of its
SS-19 nuclear missile silos, and plans to finish dismantling the
SS-19 missiles by next January.
	   The country also destroyed the first of 46 SS-24 missile silos
this summer, and is preparing to take apart the missiles
themselves, according to the U.S. Embassy in Kiev.
	   The elimination of all strategic bombers and ballistic missiles
is scheduled to be finished by December 2001. That will complete
Ukraine's obligations under the Nunn-Lugar program.

International envoy blasts Bosnian Muslims over stalled agreement

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A senior international envoy said Monday
Bosnian Muslim leaders' refusal to sign an agreement on special
ties with neighboring Croatia is ``irresponsible and a disservice''
to the people who elected them.
	   The comments, by Jacques Klein, a deputy to Bosnia's high
representative, Carlos Westendorp followed last-minute cancellation
of a trip to Zagreb by Bosnian Muslim government figures to sign
the accord.
	   It was the second time the signing had been postponed _ Bosnian
Muslim leaders also failed to appear last week, citing technical
reasons.
	   ``This situation calls into question the desire of (Bosnian)
Federation government officials to negotiate in good faith, their
capability to engage in coherent international negotiations and
their concern for their citizens,'' Klein told reporters.
	   Ejup Ganic, the president of the Muslim-Croat Federation, who
was supposed to appear in Zagreb for the signing, said the delay
was meant to give parliament in Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation
time to discuss the agreement. He told reporters that a delay of
``a day or two, more or less, should not be critical.''
	   World powers involved in the Balkan peace process since the
Dayton peace accords ended fighting in 1995 are keen to see the
agreement signed as a step towards lasting peace in the region.
	   Relations between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have been uneasy
since they fought each other in 1993-94. Croatia aided the Bosnian
Croats throughout the Bosnian war and Croatia is suspected by
Muslims in Bosnia of seeking to annex Croat-held regions in Bosnia
proper.
	   Western officials believe the agreement would define relations,
specifying in a transparent way, military and economic cooperation
_ issues which are reportedly the source of continued disputes.
	   Croatia remains a major financial backer of Bosnian Croats, and
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is considered their chief
decision-maker.
	   The ``special relationship'' agreement would supposedly end such
uncontrolled aid, and define forms in which Croatia can help its
proxies without violating the integrity of the Bosnian Federation
of Croats and Muslims, which shares the country with a Serb
substate.

Pope meets with divided Austrian bishops

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II met Monday with leading
members of Austria's bishops conference, which has been rocked by a
sex scandal and demands for reform by Austrian Catholics.
	   The delegation of 11 bishops was led by Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna who was named to head the
bishops conference four months ago.
	   The prelates came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops
have with the Vatican. John Paul was expected to deliver a formal
address to them later in the week.
	   But tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during a June
trip to Austria, when Schoenborn acknowledged the conflicts within
the church ``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope
and the bishops.''
	   In particular, the traditional Catholic bastion was rocked by
accusations that a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, sexually abused
young boys.
	   Reports in the Austrian press last week suggested the bishops
were unhappy with the Vatican's handling of the case. Groer was
forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church duties some time
after the case became public.
	   Among those meeting with the pope Monday were Bishop Kurt Krenn,
a conservative who angered many by his staunch support for Groer.

Justice at last in case involving atrocities against Serbs

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Appalled by what they called
``singular brutality'' and ``calculating cruelty,'' U.N. judges
Monday handed down the first international convictions for
atrocities committed against Bosnian Serbs.
	   A three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
convicted a Bosnian Croat and two Muslims in the murder, torture
and rape of Serb prisoners at the Celebici camp in central Bosnia
in 1992. It was the first conviction of sexual assualt as a war
crime.
	   The camp's warden, Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for
overseeing guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo convicted Nazi and Japanese
superiors for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his
neck, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years imprisonment.
	   Prosecutors failed to make the same command responsibility
argument stick to Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander
accused of having overall control of the camp. The judges acquitted
him, saying there was not enough evidence to link him to the
atrocities.
	   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal. ``The evidence
... was sufficient to convict the accused,'' said Deputy Prosecutor
Graham Blewitt. He said he also might appeal Mucic's sentence,
calling it ``inadequate.''
	   The 20-month trial was the tribunal's first to concentrate on
atrocities against Serbs _ who are blamed for the majority of war
crimes carried out during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict.
	   Inmates at Celebici were murdered, tortured and raped by camp
staff, witnesses said in emotional testimony.
	   ``We have been appalled by the details of your criminal
actions,'' Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria told
the camp's deputy commander, Hazim Delic, a Muslim sentenced to 20
years in prison for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners.
	   ``You displayed a singular brutality in causing the deaths of
two men ... and a calculating cruelty in the torture and
mistreatment of many others,'' Karibi-Whyte said.
	   Chewing gum given to him by a U.N. guard, Delic showed no
emotion when he heard the verdicts.
	   In their 483-page ruling, the judges said Delic _ the first
defendant the tribunal has convicted of rape _ appeared ``to take a
sadistic pleasure in causing the detainees pain.''
	   A camp guard, Esad Landzo, was ordered jailed for 15 years for
murdering three inmates and torturing others.
	   Prosecutors said Landzo and Delic beat to death one man and
nailed a Muslim political party's badge to his head, and that
Landzo also beat a 60-year-old man to death with a wooden plank.
	   Although they were convicted, Mucic, Delic and Landzo also were
acquitted of 34 charges, including several counts of murder and
torture. All four had faced up to life imprisonment.
	   ``The trial of these accused demonstrates the even-handed
approach of the prosecutor,'' Blewitt said.
	   Before Monday, the court had convicted a Bosnian Serb and a
Bosnian Croat who admitted taking part in a Bosnian Serb army
massacre of Muslims. Another Bosnian Serb has admitted murdering 12
Muslims.
	   Serbs account for most of the 56 publicly indicted suspects, and
they have accused the tribunal of being biased against them.
	   ``This is completely unbelievable, a gross injustice,'' Dragan
Cavic, deputy president of Bosnia's hard-line Serbian Democratic
Party, said Monday after the acquittal of Delalic, a Muslim.
	   Blewitt, however, said prosecutors were currently working on
more investigations involving Serbs as the victims of war crimes.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo after a reported intimidation attempt, a U.S.
diplomat pressed the Yugoslav president Monday to honor a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Faced with NATO intervention, President Slobodan Milosevic on
Oct. 12 agreed to pull out his security forces, end a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and admit
2,000 international verifiers.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, met
Milosevic in Serbia's capital Belgrade. Walker was to speak to
reporters later Monday when he returns to Kosovo.
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into focus Sunday
after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun rounds
over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central Kosovo.
	   The Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the bursts came
from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their engines slowed
down to pass the monitors.
	   The meeting came as ethnic Albanians were downplaying hopes for
imminent progress in a political settlement for the restive,
Albanian-majority province.
	   A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in Kosovo indicated they were
likely to reject Serbia's new initiative for direct talks.
	   Fehmi Agani, a top aide to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, said, ``Conditions have not been made'' for a meeting
between the Serb and Albanian sides. Agani said indirect talks
should continue instead.
	   Meanwhile, scattered violence continued Monday in Kosovo.
	   Two ethnic Albanian women were wounded by Serb police on a road
about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Pristina, according to the
Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's Albanian
leadership. It said the two were shot when police opened fire at a
car which refused to halt.
	   A shootout between Serb police and Albanian rebels also occurred
near Dulje Monday. No one was injured, Serb sources said.
	   Earlier in the morning, a Serb police station in the town of
Orahovac in central Kosovo was attacked, and a car in front of it
was riddled with bullets, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a wide-ranging, two-hour
meeting, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and President Jiang Zemin of
China talked Monday about Taiwan and Tibet but made no progress on
those or other sources of Sino-U.S. conflict.
	   Both sides described the meeting as friendly, and officials said
comments by both men consisted largely of reiterating their
governments' positions. A U.S. official said Gore issued an
invitation for Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to visit the United
States, and Jiang accepted.
	   ``It was a conversation between people who know each other
well,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Gore, who arrived Sunday in Malaysia, is filling in for
President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit. Clinton canceled his visit because of the Iraq crisis.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao, briefing
reporters on the meeting, repeated Beijing's contention that the
Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader, is ``aiming at splitting the
motherland.''
	   Last week, China protested Clinton's meeting with the Dalai Lama
and a visit by a U.S. Cabinet official to Taiwan, claiming the
United States was interfering in domestic Chinese affairs.
	   Zhu accused the United States of violating its commitment to
recognize Beijing's rule over Tibet, and said Washington should
refrain from political ties with Taiwan.
	   Jiang told Gore he wanted Washington to ``honor the commitment
to the one-country policy,'' Zhu said.
	   According to him, Gore said U.S. policies on Tibet and China had
not changed.
	   For the first decades of the Cold War, Washington was an ally of
Taiwan, an island China considers a rebel province. The United
States also provided funding for separatist guerrillas in Tibet,
the Himalayan region that Beijing has ruled, often harshly, for 48
years. The Dalai Lama has been living in exile in India since 1959.
	   China has tried to woo and pressure foreign governments to keep
Taiwan diplomatically isolated, and also wants to undermine the
Dalai Lama's credibility and popularity abroad.
	   The Dalai Lama and his followers ``are trying to mold the public
opinion to cheat the international community,'' Zhu said.

Britain extradites murder suspect to Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A Yugoslav man suspected of being a
member of his country's former secret police is to be extradited
imminently after serving a jail term for trying to murder a
Croatian emigre, the government said Monday.
	   Vinklo Sindicic is to stand trial in Croatia for the murder of a
Croat dissident, Franjo Busic, in France in 1976.
	   A Scottish Office spokesman said extradition papers had been
signed and Sindicic would probably leave Britain later Monday.
Details of the journey were not disclosed for security reasons, he
said.
	   A Scottish court jailed Sindicic for 15 years in 1989 for trying
to murder Nikola Stedul with a silenced pistol outside Stedul's
home. Stedul was wounded but survived.
	   Stedul, now 60, left Yugoslavia as a young man to avoid military
service and settled in Scotland in 1975. At the time of the attack
he was president of the Croatian Movement for Statehood, which
sought to remove Croatia from the then Yugoslav republic.
	   Croatia applied for Sindicic's extradition in 1993.
	   At his Scottish trial Sindicic denied being a member of the
secret police and pleaded innocent.

Trial opens for alleged leaders of widespread prostitution ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six alleged leaders of an international
prostitution ring went on trial Monday, shedding light on a network
police say provided young women to clients willing to pay up to
20,000 francs (dlrs 3,600) a night.
	   Investigators say the ring's leaders recruited young women with
the promise of modeling careers, and then abused them sexually and
circulated photos to potential clients.
	   The investigation created a stir in March, when actor Robert De
Niro was hauled in for a day of questioning by a French judge as a
witness in the prostitution ring. De Niro denied paying any woman
for sex, and angrily accused the judge of leading of leading a
``witch hunt.''
	   De Niro initially vowed never to return to France because of the
case, but later changed his mind.
	   The case involves close to 90 young women, including 14 minors,
and a network that allegedly spread from Paris to the Riviera, but
also to Morocco, the United States, Portugal, Switzerland and
Britain. A dozen of the women filed complaints that led to the
arrests.
	   Prostitution is legal in France, but procuring prostitutes is
not.
	   Clients of the ring are said to have included movie producers,
sports stars and Middle Eastern businessmen.
	   The six alleged leaders of the network charged with ``aggravated
procuring'' include a former Swedish model, Annika Brumark, 50;
photographer Jean-Pierre Bourgeois, 51; and Jean-Claude Tunon, 73,
founder of a school for hostesses. They face a maximum sentence of
10 years in prison and fines of 10 million francs (dlrs 1.8
million) each.
	   The trial is expected to last until next Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore
infuriated Malaysia on Monday when he expressed support for the
country's burgeoning reform movement that calls for greater
political freedoms and an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year rule.
	   Gore, in a dinner speech to leaders of some of the world's
largest corporations, said that robust global markets depended on
freedom and democracy.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore, in
the speech on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   Gore's comments angered the APEC host, with Malaysian trade
minister Rafidah Aziz calling them ``disgusting.''
	   ``That is a direct interference in the domestic affairs of the
country,'' she said. ``I hope that I would never hear such a
disgusting speech again.''
	   She said Gore's speech ``perhaps reflects the narrow-mindedness
of some people who do not understand what things are all about
around here.''
	   Gore was standing in for Clinton, who canceled his visit to
remain in Washington and deal with the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   The ouster of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
his subsequent arrest and beating while in police custody outraged
world leaders. Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption
and sexual misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up
to undermine his challenge to Mahathir.
	   A series of violent demonstrations have rocked the normally
placid capital for the first time in three decades.
	   ``From Thailand to South Korea, Eastern Europe to Mexico,
democracies have done better in coping with economic crises than
nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore said.
	   ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue
to hear calls for democracy and reform in many languages. People's
power, doi moi, reformasi. We hear them today _ right here, right
now _ among the brave people of Malaysia.''
	   ``Reformasi,'' or reform in the Malay language, has become the
battle cry of the anti-government movement here. It was the same
chant used during the massive riots and student demonstrations in
neighboring Indonesia, a movement that led to the end of President
Suharto's 32-year rule.
	   An anti-government demonstration planned outside the Putra World
Trade Center where Gore delivered his speech never came off.
Organizers said they were deterred by the water cannons and large
police presence outside the massive hall.
	   Rafidah, who on Sunday had a sharp verbal tussle with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright over the Anwar affair, called
Gore's manners atrocious.
	   ``We always expect lecture from people ... we are so used to it.
But never in such a disgusting manner,'' she said. ``I mean,
somebody should have told him about his manners.''
	   When asked whether Mahathir was disturbed, Rafidah said: ``Our
prime minister perhaps is not as uncouth as I am, but I am sure he
feels bad.''
	   On Sunday, Albright met privately with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, to express U.S. concern over her husband's case.
	   For the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human
rights concerns have been widely discussed by the leaders, whose
goal is to promote free trade in the region.
	   During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's treatment and
trial. And New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
planned to do that on Tuesday.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Mahathir because of the Anwar affair.
	   At the end of his speech, however, Gore returned to the head
table and shook hands with the Malaysian prime minister.
	   Other guests included Peru President Alberto Fujimori,
Philippines President Joseph Estrada, New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley and Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Thousands of Greek Cypriot high school
students left classes Monday to stage demonstrations against the
Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.
	   The protests were held with the opening of schools on Monday to
mark Sunday's 15th anniversary of the proclamation of a breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north.
	   In Nicosia, more than 4,000 students gathered at the U.N.
checkpoint linking the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors of the
divided city. They joined fellow students and refugees from the
north who had staged an all-night vigil there.
	   The demonstrators carried placards calling for the reunification
of the island and the return of refugees.
	   In a message to the demonstrators, President Glafcos Clerides,
the Greek Cypriot leader, said: ``We dream of a united,
demilitarized and secure Cyprus as a member of the European Union
where human rights are guaranteed for all citizens.''
	   Cyprus is among the six prospective new members with which the
EU started entry negotiations last week.
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash told celebrating crowds in
the north on Sunday that he will keep his breakaway state ``alive
against the odds.''
	   ``The clock will not be turned back,'' he said.
	   Cyprus has been split since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece. The breakaway state proclaimed on
Nov. 15 1983 is only recognized by Turkey which maintains 35,000
troops there.

German finance chief tones down call for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news conference. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Faced with a cautious approach from France,
Germany's finance minister backed off his calls for a cut in German
interest rates Monday, saying he had been misunderstood.
	   The climbdown by Oskar Lafontaine, who has clamored for weeks
for lower rates to spur the economy, marked the meeting of the two
countries' finance ministers and central bank chiefs.
	   With the center-left now in power in both countries, Lafontaine
and French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said they
broadly agreed on European economic policy, including the need for
a coordinated fight against the continent's high unemployment.
	   It was the first meeting of finance leaders of the two key
European partners since Germany's newly elected Social Democrats
took office last month. The focus was on preparations for Europe's
single currency, the euro, due to debut Jan. 1.
	   But Lafontaine failed to win explicit French backing for his pet
plans: interest rate cuts and global cooperation to regulate
exchange rate swings between major currencies.
	   Lafontaine also pledged that Germany's new government would
fulfill the so-called stability pact, which commits European
countries to fiscal rigor after the euro kicks in, despite some
calls for loosening government purse strings now to help fight
unemployment.
	   Strauss-Kahn said France would also keep to the pact, declaring
that government spending needed to be stabilized.
	   Lafontaine's pressure for lower rates has been criticized by
conservatives as an old-style left recipe for boosting the economy
at the risk of inflation.
	   ``There was a misinterpretation by some who said that the
interest rate discussion was aimed at national central banks or the
Bundesbank,'' Germany's staunchly independent central bank,
Lafontaine now told a news conference.
	   He said he had not meant to question the Bundesbank's authority,
but was seeking a ``fair dialogue'' with central banks over the
best way to combine job creation with keeping a lid on inflation.
	   Flanking Lafontaine, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer
insisted that European countries had ``fundamental problems'' _ a
codeword for overregulation and high labor costs _ that helped
create unemployment.
	   Lafontaine also toned down his proposal for exchange rate bands
to rein in global financial markets, saying it wouldn't work if the
world's major economies _ the United States, Japan, Europe _ were
out of sync.
	   ``My proposal for fixed trading bands is not a short-term
goal,'' Lafontaine said, adding ``the idea is not to impose a
system that is not backed up the real economic situation.''
	   ``We're working on it,'' Strauss-Kahn said. ``We will need a
little time.''
	   Both sides agreed to press ahead with a common European tax
policy. They set the goal of completing it during the first half of
next year, when Germany holds the rotating presidency of the
European Union.

Inter American Development Bank chief expresses confidence in
</HEADLINE>
Brazil &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) _ The president of the
Inter-American Development Bank expressed confidence Monday in
Brazil's tough measures to surmount the economic crisis that
spurred an international bailout.
	   Interviewed before addressing a convention of international
newspaper publishers, Enrique Iglesias said the Brazilian
government had come up with a solid program of stringent measures
to counteract the crisis.
	   ``They made a very credible program both internally and
externally, but they will manage it and the international support
will give it even more credibility,'' said the president of the
Washington-based lending bank.
	   Iglesias was speaking in this Atlantic resort at the invitation
of the Inter American Press Association, an organization grouping
hundreds of newspaper editors from throughout the Western
hemisphere.
	   Organized by the International Monetary Fund, the rescue package
announced earlier this year makes dlrs 41.5 billion available to
Brazil over the next three years. About dlrs 37 billion will be on
tap if needed in the next 12 months.
	   The assistance was offered after Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso announced a series of measures Oct. 28 to curb
government spending and raise taxes. The United States will
contribute dlrs 5 billion.
	   Cardoso's government is seeking support in the Brazilian
parliament for crisis measures. The government measures, which must
be approved by Congress, would save dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and
dlrs dlrs 80 billion by 2002.
	   Iglesias was confident the Brazilian parliament would give
strong support: ``So far they gave a very good message with a
recently adopted statement of the social security reforms.''
	   ``So I think the Brazilians understand, and the politicians,
that they have to do this this in order to preserve their excellent
experience with the plan Real,'' he added, a reference to a plan to
keep Brazil's currency stable.
	   The IMF unveiled the aid package for Brazil by tying the release
of the funds to a government commitment to open the economy,
maintain ``firm monetary discipline'' and retain its current
exchange rate regime.
	   Some Brazilian economists had worried that the new program,
which requires the government to follow through on pledges of tough
budget-cutting, will cause the economy to weaken further and send
unemployment soaring.
	   But Iglesias discounted such scenarios: ``I don't believe in the
kind of recession that one would imagine.''
	   He said Brazil has a very resilient economy, and ``if the trend
in the international economy continues as we are seeing now, I
think we can go smoothly through to a better level.''
	   A giant among Latin American nations, Brazil accounts for 40
percent of Latin American economic output. It was the latest
country to be stricken by the global contagion that began in Asia
in 1997.
	   Brazil nearly doubled its key lending rate in September to halt
the flight of foreign investors after Russia devalued its currency
in August and its economy was caught up in the financial turmoil.

Nationalist students in western Ukraine disrupt court proceedings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thousands of nationalist students rallied
Monday in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, disrupting court
hearings for three fellow nationalists accused of attacking leftist
demonstrators.
	   The three have been charged with minor hooliganism over a clash
during a Revolution Day rally in Lviv on Nov. 7, 1997. A half-dozen
people received head injuries in the brawl, which began when
nationalists attacked a column of Communist and other leftist
demonstrators marking the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik
takeover.
	   On Monday, nationalist students crowded next to a district court
building in Lviv, blocking traffic and shouting. Judge Petro Kablak
then postponed the hearings until Tuesday because the victims
failed to appear.
	   Lviv Socialist leader Yevhen Talipov, one of those injured in
1997, said he simply could not approach the courtroom because the
protesters were blocking the way.
	   Leaflets plastered over the city before the rally called on the
students to ``crush the red cockroaches'' and praised the
nationalists for ``kicking the teeth'' of the Communists and their
allies last year.
	   The students also marched and demonstrated in other locations in
town, demanding to meet with city authorities. Their demands
included payment of delayed government student stipends and free
transportation for students, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Police estimated the number of demonstrators at about 2,000,
Interfax reported. No violence was reported.
	   Nationalist and anti-Communist feelings are strong in Lviv,
located in a part of western Ukraine that was not annexed by the
Soviet Union until World War II.
	   During Revolution Day demonstrations in Lviv this year, several
hundred nationalists attacked about 500 elderly leftists with clubs
and stones. The brief fight, quickly stopped by police, left about
five people injured.

Pope meets with divided Austrian bishops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II met Monday with leading
members of Austria's bishops conference, which has been rocked by a
sex scandal and demands for reform by Austrian Catholics.
	   The delegation of 11 bishops was led by Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna who was named to head the
bishops conference four months ago.
	   The prelates came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops
have with the Vatican. John Paul was expected to deliver a formal
address to them later in the week.
	   But tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during a June
trip to Austria, when Schoenborn acknowledged the conflicts within
the church ``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope
and the bishops.''
	   In particular, the traditional Catholic bastion was rocked by
accusations that a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, sexually abused
young boys.
	   Reports in the Austrian press last week suggested the bishops
were unhappy with the Vatican's handling of the case. Groer was
forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church duties some time
after the case became public.
	   Among those meeting with the pope Monday were Bishop Kurt Krenn,
a conservative who angered many by his staunch support for Groer.

DaimlerChrysler kicks off Day 1 early in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of merger; minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With bells, parties and a blizzard of
publicity, the newly merged DaimlerChrysler comes into being
Tuesday when its stock begins trading on 19 financial markets
around the world.
	   A cocktail reception, live broadcasts to 250 locations in 62
countries, an array of promotional materials and a new advertising
campaign aimed at investors are part of the push for a high profile
``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic car company.
	   The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, and
Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, will attend a reception at Frankfurt's
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New
York for the stock's debut on Wall Street.
	   Schrempp and Eaton will ring a bell at the New York Stock
Exchange together, in a symbol of their cooperation. The stock will
have started trading six hours earlier in Frankfurt.
	   DaimlerChrysler will become the world's third largest car
company, with annual sales estimated at 260 billion marks (dlrs
162.5 billion.) Schrempp, 54, and Eaton, 58, will jointly lead the
new company for three years. After that, Schrempp is set to run it
alone.
	   The merger's goal was to gain a strong market share in Europe
and North America, and to venture into markets in Asia and Latin
American. The new DaimlerChrysler also hopes to advance its
non-automotive industries _ financial information technology,
telecommunications and aerospace, according to promotional
materials for the debut.
	   More immediately, the ambitious merger will test the ability of
the original two companies to blend their different cultures. To
help, DaimlerChrysler's 431,000 employees will get a quarterly
journal on how it's going; managers will get an extra page with
more details.
	   The last significant hurdle before setting up DaimlerChrysler
was completed a week ago, when Daimler announced 98 percent of its
shareholders had swapped shares for the new company. Due to
corporate differences, Chrysler shareholders did not need to swap,
but voted on the merger.
	   Four Daimler shareholders filed lawsuits with a German court
trying to stop the merger, claiming they weren't properly informed
about it. Daimler says the challenges won't affect the new company.
The protesting shareholder's shares will be merged at a later,
undecided date _ though for less money that those who swapped
voluntarily.

Netanyahu suspends troop withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced
Monday that he is suspending an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank until the Palestinians drop plans to declare independence in
May.
	   Netanyahu made the announcement in a speech to parliament that
began a two-day debate on the agreement, under which Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   It was scheduled to start later this week.
	   The prime minister is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who has renewed a pledge to declare statehood
in May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to defend Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,''
Netanyahu told parliament. He was interrupted frequently by
heckling.
	   Netanyahu said he would convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to
review the suspension of the withdrawal. On Sunday night, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators had agreed that Israel would withdraw
from 2 percent of the West Bank by Friday.
	   The land-for-security agreement is assured the support of about
90 of parliament's 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech was
mainly aimed at hard-liners who have threatened to topple his
coalition.
	   Netanyahu on Monday portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who
would not put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the
Palestinians to violate the accord.
	   ``In the past year and a half, we haven't moved an inch,''
Netanyahu said. ``Unlike others, we do not believe in illusions, a
new Middle East. The Palestinians will test us every day and we
will stand firm.''
	   Before his speech, Netanyahu telephoned Arafat to seek
clarifications, but was not satisfied with the Palestinian leader's
responses, Israel radio said. Palestinian officials confirmed the
phone call, but refused to discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   The latest agreement does not specifically refer to a possible
declaration of statehood, but urges both sides to refrain from
unilateral actions.
	   However, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton reached a verbal understanding during
last month's Mideast summit that if little progress was made in
final-status talks by May, the United States would not oppose a
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 30 Jewish settlers set up two mobile homes
on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of Kedumim
today, a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon encouraged
settlers to seize as much land as possible before the troop
pullback.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced
Monday that he is suspending an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank _ scheduled for later this week - until the Palestinians drop
plans to declare independence in May.
	   The Palestinians accused Netanyahu of using excuses to get out
of his commitments.
	   Netanyahu made the announcement in a speech to parliament that
kicked off a two-day debate on the agreement under which Israel is
to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   The prime minister is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat who has renewed a pledge to declare statehood
in May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,''
Netanyahu told legislators in a speech frequently interrupted by
heckling.
	   Netanyahu said he would convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to
review the suspension of the withdrawal. On Sunday night, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators had agreed that Israel would withdraw
from 2 percent of the West Bank by the weekend. Under the original
time table, the Israeli withdrawal was to have begun Monday.
	   The land-for-security agreement is assured the support of some
90 of 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech was mainly aimed at
hard-liners who have threatened to topple his coalition.
	   Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who would not
put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the Palestinians
to violate the accord.
	   ``In the past year and a half, we haven't moved an inch,''
Netanyahu told the Knesset.
	   ``Unlike others, we do not believe in illusions, a new Middle
East,'' Netanyahu said. ``The Palestinians will test us every day
and we will stand firm.''
	   Later, he spoke more vehemently.
	   ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence with
rifles? If we do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division of
Jerusalem, they will use those rifles against us?'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two. ``There cannot be such dictates.''
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said Netanyahu was ``trying to avoid
and escape implementation.'' Tibi also accused Israel of violating
the accord with inflammatory statements, referring to Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's call to Jewish settlers to seize
land in the West Bank before a troop withdrawal.
	   Before his speech, Netanyahu called Arafat to seek
clarifications, but was not satisfied with Arafat's responses,
Israel radio said. Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call,
but refused to discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain

Wife of Saddam's half-brother dies, officials say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with London announcement. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The wife of the half-brother of Saddam Hussein has
died in Switzerland, officials said Monday.
	   An official of the Iraqi embassy said he understood Ahlam
al-Tikriti died last week. She was 44. A death notice signed by her
husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, appeared in the London-based Arabic
newspaper based Arabic Al-Quds Al-Arabi. It was dated Sunday and
appeared in Monday editions.
	   A spokeswoman for a suburban hospital confirmed that she died,
but declined to give the cause or say when. Mrs. al-Tikriti had
reportedly been under treatment for breast cancer.
	   The death is expected to complicate the situation of her
husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, who last summer was ordered to return
to Baghdad in a sweeping change of diplomatic posts.
	   He reportedly has cited his wife's illness and treatment as
reasons for his staying on Geneva, but has denied having any desire
to join the Iraqi opposition.
	   Earlier this month Iraqi dissidents said a cousin of Saddam
failed to convince al-Tikriti to return home instead of going into
exile.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46,headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations in
Geneva for 10 years.
	   He was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled
to Baghdad over the summer.
	   Last month, Saddam's cousin, Gen. Mizahem Saab al-Hassan, met
with al-Tikriti in Geneva and conveyed a message that his decision
to go into exile is harming the Iraqi regime's image, said the
dissidents.
	   The Swiss government says al-Tikriti has until the end of
November to leave Geneva under Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats
to stay on in Switzerland for three months after the end of their
tenure.
	   Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti also is survived by six
children, ranging in age from 11 to 26.

Sheinbein's father: We didn't know he was wanted by police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The father of a teen-age murder suspect
said Monday that he didn't know there was a warrant for his son's
arrest when he helped the minor flee to Israel two days after the
killing.
	   ``We just thought police wanted to talk to him,'' said Sol
Sheinbein, who is also wanted in Montgomery County, Maryland on
charges of interfering in a police investigation.
	   A patent lawyer from Silver Springs, Maryland, Sheinbein said he
thought the trip to Israel would be short and therapeutic for his
18-year-old son Samuel.
	   ``I wanted to calm him and after a few days, I sent my second
son, his brother, to bring him back to America,'' the senior
Sheinbein said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV Monday.
Sheinbein said he had consulted a family lawyer before his son
boarded the plane.
	   Samuel Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days
after the mutilated and burned body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was
discovered in the garage of an empty home. Shortly after arriving,
he was picked up by police and hospitalized briefly because of a
drug overdose.
	   To prevent extradition back to the U.S., the younger Sheinbein
claimed Israeli citizenship through his father, who was born in
pre-state Israel. Under Israeli law, citizens cannot normally be
extradited for trial abroad but a Jerusalem court ruled that
Sheinbein should be returned to the United States.
	   At his son's extradition appeal to Israel's Supreme Court
Sunday, Sol Sheinbein told reporters he wanted Samuel tried in
Israel because he believed his life would be in danger if he served
time in a U.S. prison.
	   ``In the United States, his situation will be very difficult,
and it is possible that he could be killed in prison there. I am
very concerned for him,'' Sol Sheinbein said.
	   Monday, Sheinbein said he didn't expect his son to go unpunished
for crimes he may have committed but would do everything to keep
him from being extradited.
	   ``This last year has been hell for us. Every day I wake up and
wish it was just a bad dream,'' Sheinbein said. He said that he and
his wife Victoria, who have attended several court sessions, are in
regular contact with their son, who remains in Israeli custody.

Nedved drops out of Czech lineup due to knee injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech team will be missing its
top star, Lazio Roma midfielder Pavel Nedved, in Wednesday's
friendly against England at Wembley.
	   According to team spokesman Jaroslav Kolar, Neved tore his knee
ligament in an Italian first division match and is forced to rest
for at least a week.
	   He will be replaced by Miroslav Baranek of Sparta Prague.
	   Coach Josef Chovanec intends to field at least eight players who
took the Czech team to the European championship finals two years
ago, losing to Germany in overtime at Wembley.
	   They include midfielders Karel Poborsky of Benfica Lisbon, Radek
Bejbl of Atletico Madrid and striker Vladimir Smicer of Racing
Lens.
	   ``Some players don't get to play at Wembley ever, and for me
this will be the second time in two years,'' said Patrik Berger,
who scored the Czechs' only goal in the Euro '96 final and now
plays for FC Liverpool.
	   The Czech team currently leads the qualifying Group 9,
challenging Scotland for a berth in the 2000 European
championships.
	   ``Wednesday's friendly will be good practice before the
qualifier against Scotland in the spring,'' Chovanec said.
	   Roster: Pavel Kouba, Vladimir Maier, Martin Kotulek, Lubos
Kozel, Jiri Novotny, Tomas Repka, Radek Bejbl, Patrik Berger, Radek
Latal, Jiri Nemec, Karel Poborsky, Radek Sloncik, Miroslav Baranek,
Roman Vonasek, Pavel Kuka, Vratislav Lokvenc, Vladimir Smicer.

Trial of former Cabinet minister begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The trial of a former Turkish Cabinet
member on charges of aiding and abetting mobsters opened Friday.
	   Former minister Eyup Asik resigned in September when televisions
aired his taped conversations with Turkey's leading mafia bosses,
Alaattin Cakici. He faces up to a year in prison if convicted.
	   Asik is a member of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' center-right
Motherland Party. Three no-confidence motions are pending against
Yilmaz' government in connection with the spreading scandal
surrounding links between the mafia and the state, and Yilmaz
himself is accused of having ties with organized crime.

Pope meets with divided Austrian bishops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cylce designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II met Monday with leading
members of Austria's bishops conference, which has been rocked by a
sex scandal and demands for reform by Austrian Catholics.
	   The delegation of 11 bishops was led by Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna who was named to head the
bishops conference four months ago.
	   The prelates came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops
have with the Vatican. John Paul was expected to deliver a formal
address to them later in the week.
	   But tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during a June
trip to Austria, when Schoenborn acknowledged the conflicts within
the church ``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope
and the bishops.''
	   In particular, the traditional Catholic bastion was rocked by
accusations that a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, sexually abused
young boys.
	   Reports in the Austrian press last week suggested the bishops
were unhappy with the Vatican's handling of the case. Groer was
forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church duties some time
after the case became public.
	   Among those meeting with the pope Monday were Bishop Kurt Krenn,
a conservative who angered many by his staunch support for Groer.

French Pernod-Ricard considers revising deal on brandy distillery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The Pernod-Ricard group of France is
considering reneging on a deal to buy a century-old Armenian brandy
distillery because of economic troubles in Russia, the distillery's
chief export market, Armenia's prime minister said Monday.
	   Russia is the main export market for the Yerevan Cognac
Distillery, and its economic downturn has crippled sales in recent
months.
	   In May, Pernod-Ricard agreed to pay dlrs 30 million for the
government-controlled Yerevan Cognac Distillery and to invest
another dlrs 5 million in developing vineyards in this former
Soviet republic.
	   In line with the agreement it signed with the Armenian
government, Pernod immediately paid dlrs 2 million and was to put
the rest in a bank account by Dec. 10.
	   The French company recently approached the government to discuss
revising, and perhaps abandoning, the deal because of the economic
crisis in Russia, the distillery's largest export market, Armenian
Prime Minister Armen Darbinian told a news conference.
	   Russia's economic downturn has badly affected sales in recent
months, he said. He refused to give figures or elaborate on the
talks.
	   The distillery was established in 1897. Distillery officials say
that Josef Stalin presented Winston Churchill with a bottle of its
10-year-old, 100-proof brandy during a 1943 Tehran conference and
that it remained the favorite of the British wartime leader until
his death.
	   Since Soviet times, Armenian brandy has been called cognac,
drawing angry protests from France, which insists its producers
have exclusive use of the term.
	   The sale in May drew street rallies and parliament battles, as
many people protested the deal saying the distillery was worth much
more.

Thousands demonstrate against closure of factories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on Morlaix plant, other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six days after the Seita tobacco company announced
the closure of two factories in the year 2000, thousands of
employees marched in the streets Monday to protest the loss of
hundreds of jobs.
	   At least 1,000 people demonstrated in Tonneins, the southwestern
town where one of the factories is located, and 2,000 people in
Morlaix in Brittany.
	   Workers at Seita plants in the cities of Lille and Strasbourg
also demonstrated, French radio reported, in solidarity with their
co-workers in the two affected towns.
	   ``Seita can and must live in Tonneins!'' read one banner. Seita
is the major employer in Tonneins.
	   Employees also set up a blockade on the highway, slowing down
traffic so they could hand out flyers to drivers.
	   Union leaders say 333 jobs in Tonneins, where the dark, pungent
type of cigarettes are made, will be lost due to the closure.
	   Seita manager Xavier Bibard said the reason for the planned
closure in Tonneins was a 10 percent drop each year in demand for
dark cigarettes, because of competition from American makers of
blond tobacco cigarettes.
	   Operations will be transferred to Lille, in the north.
	   The company says that of those losing their jobs, 50 percent
will get early retirement, and efforts will be made to find the
others jobs within the company.
	   In Morlaix, where 172 workers will be affected, the factory to
be closed specializes in cigars. The company has said that to
compensate, 87 new jobs will be created in Strasbourg, in eastern
France.

U.S. diplomat to press Milosevic over Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic's statement after the talks, ethnic
Albanians rejecting negotiations.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo after a reported intimidation attempt, an
American diplomat pressed the Yugoslav president Monday to honor a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Faced with NATO intervention, President Slobodan Milosevic on
Oct. 12 agreed to pull out his security forces, end a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow
a 2,000-strong mission of international verifiers to observe his
compliance.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, met
Milosevic in Serbia's capital Belgrade. Walker was due to speak to
reporters on the talks later Monday when he returns to Kosovo.
	   ``Yugoslavia sticks to the agreement,'' Milosevic said in a
statement after the talks, and suggested that any post-agreement
violence was the fault of radical Albanians. ``The international
community should exert firm and unambiguous pressure ... to stop
terrorist provocations of bandit groups intended to jeopardize the
peace process in Kosovo.''
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into sharp focus
Sunday after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun
rounds over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central
Kosovo.
	   A spokesman for the mission said a car from the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observers Mission was near Dulje in the province's
southwest when it encountered an army column coming the other way.
	   As the observers' car passed by, the army vehicle, equipped with
a heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead, observers' spokesman
Duncan Bullivant said.
	   The Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the bursts came
from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their engines slowed
down to pass the monitors.
	   ``This type of behavior and activity is totally unacceptable,''
Bullivant said Sunday, saying random firing was not in the spirit
of the cease-fire agreement and that the monitors had security
guarantees from Milosevic.
	   Beside expressing concern about ``the deterioration of the
agreement,'' Walker also planned to suggest Milosevic withdraw more
Serbian police from Kosovo, his adviser Mike Philips said.
	   The meeting came as ethnic Albanian officials in Kosovo rejected
the new initiative by Serbian authorities for long-sought direct
talks.
	   Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, denounced the latest Serbian initiative for the talks as a
``propaganda'' move, and said any such negotiations must be held
under U.S. and European mediation.
	   President Milan Milutinovic had proposed over the weekend to
chair face-to-face talks with the ethnic Albanians in Pristina on
Wednesday, with international officials in attendance as guests but
not as active mediators.
	   Mustafa argued Kosovo ``cannot be treated as Serbia's internal
matter'' _ as Serbian officials are trying to do by excluding
foreign mediators _ since the majority ethnic Albanians are
demanding outright secession.
	   Scattered violence continued in Kosovo Monday.
	   Two ethnic Albanian women were wounded by Serb police on a road
about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Pristina, the Kosovo
Information Center, close to the province's Albanian leadership,
reported.
	   The two were shot when police opened fire at a car that refused
to halt for police, said the center.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Lapastica police station was
attacked by Albanian ``extremists'' and that police returned fire.
The Serb report stated no injuries.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed and it was not
clear whether the shootings were related.
	   A shootout between Serb police and Albanian rebels also occurred
near Dulje Monday. No one was injured, Serb sources said.
	   Earlier in the morning, a Serb police station in the town of
Orahovac in central Kosovo was attacked, and a car in front of it
was riddled with bullets, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the
Chechen capital Grozny on Monday to protest a court conviction
against a prominent opposition leader.
	   Chechnya's Supreme Sharia Court sentenced former rebel leader
Salman Raduyev on Nov. 4 to a four-year prison term for attempting
to overthrow the government.
	   The protesters, mostly pensioners, gathered in front of Grozny's
main court building and demanded that Raduyev's case be reviewed,
Russian media reported.
	   Raduyev and his forces captured the main television center in
Grozny on May 21, killing the national security chief. That was
apparently the basis for the charge against him.
	   More than 200 Chechen policemen joined in the search for Raduyev
on Monday, but failed to capture him, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Yet Raduyev held a news conference Monday broadcast on Russian
television in which he reiterated that he will not turn himself in
and insisted he was always reachable at his office.
	   Chechnya has suffered a wave of violence, theft, and kidnappings
for ransom since its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. No
country has recognized its claims of sovereignty.
	   Also Monday, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov told the regional
prosecutor general's office to open a case against the organizers
of the Chechen People's Congress, which called for the president's
removal. The congress is led by rebel leaders Raduyev, Shamil
Basayev and Khunkar Israpilov.
	   Maskhadov said the congress ``may destabilize the situation in
Chechnya and split society,'' according to the Interfax news
agency, but added that ``attempts of destructive forces to shake
the state power loose are doomed to failure.''

DaimlerChrysler kicks off Day 1 early in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Eaton &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With bells, parties and a blizzard of
publicity, the newly merged DaimlerChrysler comes into being
Tuesday when its stock begins trading on 19 financial markets
around the world.
	   A cocktail reception, live broadcasts to 250 locations in 62
countries, an array of promotional materials and a new advertising
campaign aimed at investors are part of the push for a high profile
``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic car company.
	   The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, and
Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, attended a reception at Frankfurt's
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New
York for the stock's debut on Wall Street.
	   ``Today is just the beginning,'' Eaton said. ``I think that when
you get this many excellent people _ the creative talents that we
have here _ you can continue to expect excellent things from this
company for decades to come.
	   DaimlerChrysler starts out with a strong share of European and
North American markets, and Schrempp and Eaton emphasized their
goal of entering new markets, in Asia and Latin America.
	   Together, the two men will ring a bell at the New York Stock
Exchange Monday morning, in a symbol of their cooperation. The
stock will have debuted six hours earlier, however, on the
Frankfurt stock exchange at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT).
	   Eaton dismissed rumors of job cuts, saying ``exactly the
opposite'' was true. ``We expect to expand our presence in areas
where we not currently represented,'' he said. ``And I can assure
you that that will lead actually to jobs growth.''
	   The new DaimlerChrysler will become the world's third largest
car company, after General Motors and Ford, with annual sales
estimated at 260 billion marks (dlrs 162.5 billion.) Schrempp, 54,
and Eaton, 58, will jointly lead the new company for three years.
After that, Schrempp is set to run it alone.
	   In addition to moving into new markets, DaimlerChrysler also
hopes to advance its non-automotive industries _ financial
information technology, telecommunications and aerospace, according
to promotional materials for the debut.
	   More immediately, the ambitious merger will test the ability of
the original two companies to blend their different cultures. To
help, DaimlerChrysler's 431,000 employees will get a quarterly
journal on how it's going; managers will get an extra page with
more details.
	   The last significant hurdle before setting up DaimlerChrysler
was completed a week ago, when Daimler announced 98 percent of its
shareholders had swapped shares for the new company. Due to
corporate differences, Chrysler shareholders did not need to swap,
but voted on the merger.
	   Four Daimler shareholders filed lawsuits with a German court
trying to stop the merger, claiming they weren't properly informed
about it. Daimler says the challenges won't affect the new company.
The protesting shareholder's shares will be merged at a later,
undecided date _ though for less money that those who swapped
voluntarily.

Jewish settlers seize hill in the West Bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers set up two trailers on a remote
West Bank hilltop Monday, a day after Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
urged settlers to grab land ahead of an Israeli troop pullback.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the group was encouragd by
Sharon's statements which the Palestinians denounced as a violation
of the new land-for-security agreement.
	   ``We understood that the attitude of the Israeli government is
that he who holds the land determines policy and we are acting
accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.
	   As housing minister in the early 1990s, Sharon was responsible
for a massive settlement construction drive in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
	   Sharon said Monday that Israel would expand existing settlements
and defended his remarks that settlers should seize land near their
communities ahead of the impending troop pullback.
	   ``If we are talking about seizing the hills, there are ... hills
that dominate the existing settlements, state land, and this is
aimed not at increasing tension but on decreasing tension in the
future,'' Sharon told U.S. Jewish leaders.
	   In a related development, three ultra-nationalist rabbis issued
a formal religious ruling that Israel's government is violating
Jewish law by handing territory to the Palestinians.
	   The three signatories were Dov Lior of the Jewish settlement of
Kiryat Arba, Yitzhak Ginsburg of the Joseph's Tomb seminary in the
West Bank town of Nablus and Yaakov Yosef, the son of Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, the spirtual leader of the religious Shas Party.
	   Many of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank are religious, and
the three rabbis have an influence on at least some of the
settlers.
	   Under the peace agreement, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January. The ruling by Lior, Ginsburg
and Yosef ruled that the accord is invalid under Jewish law.
	   ``Any agreement made by representatives of the Jewish people,
which is against Jewish law - is invalid and there is no obligation
to implement it,'' the ruling said.
	   Several years ago, the same rabbis called on Israeli soldiers to
disobey orders to evacuate Jewish settlements, but Lior said that
this time he and his colleagues were not calling for disobedience.
	   ``We were asked for our opinion. We were not interfering in
politics,'' Lior told The Associated Press.
	   Lior said those opposed to the withdrawal ``should try to
persuade the government that it is wrong, but apart from that they
should sit and do nothing.''

Pre-election violence claims five lives in central Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Pre-election violence
claimed five lives in the Central African Republic over the
weekend, raising concerns that upcoming voting could trigger more
clashes.
	   In a speech broadcast on Monday, President Ange-Felix Patasse
called the rise in violence alarming and appealed for calm in the
eastern part of the country.
	   The first of two rounds of legislative elections is scheduled
for Nov. 22.
	   Armed political supporters have attacked opposition groups in
the eastern towns of Rafai and Bangassou in recent days,
state-radio reported.
	   Troops from the capital Bangui have been sent to the area to try
and quell the clashes.
	   Patasse said the violence threatened national unity and he
warned it could escalate.
	   Much of the election-related fighting stems from long-standing
ethnic rivalries in the Central African Republic. Members of the
ethnic Yakoma group have been battling people from the Nzakara
group for years.
	   The five people killed recently were all from the Yokoma tribe.
	   Violent crime is already rampant in the Central African
Republic, where armed bandits rob motorists and rival groups fight
for influence over local towns.
	   For years, French troops helped maintained a semblance of
stability in the Central African Republic until they pulled out
earlier this year. A United Nations peacekeeping force replaced the
French.

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A Croat man suspected of working for
the former Yugoslav secret police is to be extradited imminently
after serving a jail term for trying to murder a Croatian emigre,
the government said Monday.
	   Vinko Sindicic is to stand trial in Croatia for the murder of a
Croat dissident, Franjo Busic, in France in 1976.
	   A Scottish Office spokesman said extradition papers had been
signed and Sindicic would probably leave Britain later Monday. ``He
was taken from his prison cell this morning and he is in the
process of extradition,'' said the spokesman, speaking with
customary anonymity.
	   Details of the journey were not disclosed for security reasons,
he said.
	   A Scottish court jailed Sindicic for 15 years in 1989 for trying
to murder Nikola Stedul with a silenced pistol outside Stedul's
home. Stedul was wounded but survived.
	   Stedul, now 60, left Yugoslavia as a young man to avoid military
service and settled in Scotland in 1975. At the time of the attack
he was president of the Croatian Movement for Statehood, which
sought to remove Croatia from the then Yugoslav republic.
	   Croatia applied for Sindicic's extradition in 1993.
	   At his Scottish trial Sindicic denied being a member of the
secret police and pleaded innocent.

Manchester United picks Antwerp as feeder club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ In another sign of the widening gulf
between rich and poor in European soccer, English giant Manchester
United has reached a deal to use Belgian side Royal Antwerp as a
feeder club for young talent.
	   Under the arrangement, United will cull young players from
around the world, send them to Antwerp for a few years of grooming
and bring them to Manchester once they are ready for the Premier
League.
	   Antwerp was a prime target for Manchester United because Belgian
labor laws and work permits are far more flexible than in England.
Once the players are established in the European Union, it is
easier for them to transfer to Manchester United.
	   European soccer's governing body UEFA and the Belgian federation
all expressed concerns Monday about such deals effectively turn
smaller leagues and clubs into pawns for the bigger ones.
	   ``We have to face reality,'' Royal Antwerp secretary Paul
Bistiaux said. ``The smaller clubs have to align themselves with
the big ones to survive. It's either sink or swim.''
	   Antwerp, Belgium's oldest club and a European Cup Winners Cup
finalist at Wembley only five years ago, was demoted to the Belgian
second division this year. It is now resigned to being at the
disposal of Manchester United.
	   ``Manchester United was looking for a pied-a-terre on the
continent,'' Bistiaux said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``It's clear Manchester United is the strongest party in
this. They'll be calling the shots.''
	   Fritz Ahlsrom, a spokesman for UEFA, expressed reserations about
the deal.
	   ``In principle, we don't like it,'' he said. ``There might be
more disadvantages than advantages to this.''
	   ``What happens if Royal Antwerp creates talent, develops it into
key players, and then is forced to let them go to sit on the bench
in Manchester?'' Ahlstrom asked. ``We don't like the key players in
some leagues to be on the bench in others.''
	   For Belgian Federation President Michel D'Hooghe, the issue is
about the increasingly lopsided financial situation in European
soccer, creating a two-tier system where the poor are at the beck
and call of the wealthy clubs.
	   ``Healthy clubs would not want to do so,'' he said. ``The big
leagues are not charity institutions. Most of the time the clubs
targeted are in a tough financial and sporting position.''
	   Royal Antwerp is not the only club being approached. Germinal
Ekeren, a small first-division club, is in talks with Ajax
Amsterdam for a possible cooperation pact.
	   For FIFA too, such deals raise the specter of common ownership
conflicts of interest.
	   ``We have to wait and see what such cooperation entails,'' FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   UEFA is also concerned about what would happen if Antwerp rises
to the top of Belgian soccer again and is drawn against Manchester
in European competition.
	   No worry for the time being though, Bistiaux said.
	   `It is theoretically possible, but it will take a while,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore
infuriated the Malaysian government Monday when he expressed
support for the country's burgeoning reform movement that calls for
greater political freedoms and an end to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Gore, in a dinner speech to leaders of the world's largest
corporations, praised the ``brave people of Malaysia'' and said
that robust global markets depended on freedom and democracy.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore, in
the speech on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   Gore's comments were made in front of Mahathir and several other
Asian leaders. They enraged Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz,
chairwoman of the APEC trade negotiations.
	   ``That is a direct interference in the domestic affairs of the
country,'' Rafidah angrily told reporters. ``For heaven's sake, try
to understand what's really going on in the country before you open
your mouth and put your big foot into it.''
	   She said Gore's speech reflected ``the narrow-mindedness of some
people who do not understand what things are all about around
here.''
	   Gore was standing in for Clinton, who canceled his visit to
remain in Washington and deal with the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   The ouster of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
his subsequent arrest and beating while in police custody outraged
world leaders. Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption
and sexual misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up
to undermine his challenge to Mahathir.
	   A series of violent demonstrations have rocked the normally
placid capital for the first time in three decades.
	   ``From Thailand to South Korea, Eastern Europe to Mexico,
democracies have done better in coping with economic crises than
nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore said.
	   ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue
to hear calls for democracy and reform in many languages. People's
power, doi moi, reformasi. We hear them today _ right here, right
now _ among the brave people of Malaysia.''
	   ``Reformasi,'' or reform in the Malay language, has become the
battle cry of the anti-government movement here. It was the same
chant used during the massive riots and student demonstrations in
neighboring Indonesia, a movement that led to the end of President
Suharto's 32-year rule.
	   An anti-government demonstration planned outside the Putra World
Trade Center where Gore delivered his speech never came off.
Organizers said they were deterred by the water cannons and large
police presence outside the massive hall.
	   Rafidah, who on Sunday had a sharp verbal tussle with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright over the Anwar affair, called
Gore's manners atrocious.
	   ``We always expect lectures from people ... we are so used to
it. But never in such a disgusting manner,'' she said. ``I mean,
somebody should have told him that that's totally bad manners.''
	   When asked whether Mahathir was disturbed, Rafidah said: ``Our
prime minister perhaps is not as uncouth as I am, but I am sure he
feels bad.''
	   On Sunday, Albright met privately with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, to express U.S. concern over her husband's case.
	   For the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human
rights concerns have been widely discussed by the leaders, whose
goal is to promote free trade in the region.
	   During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's treatment and
trial. And New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she
planned to do that on Tuesday.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet privately with Mahathir because of the Anwar affair.
	   At the end of his speech, however, Gore returned to the head
table and shook hands with the Malaysian prime minister.
	   Other guests included Peru President Alberto Fujimori,
Philippines President Joseph Estrada, New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley and Vietnam Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.

Opposition says no to prime minister's offer to end strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh's main opposition leader
Monday rejected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's offer of an end to
frequent political strikes in the country and announced a new
campaign against the government.
	   Hasina on Sunday urged the country's political parties to bring
an end to strikes that have hobbled the economy.
	   At a public rally Monday, Khaleda Zia, leader of the main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, threataned to enforce a
``continuous'' strike if the government did not end what she
described as ``repressive policies'' toward opponents.
	   Seven people were injured and more than 500 injured during last
week's 60-hour strike, the longest shutdown since Sheikh Hasina's
government came to power two years ago.
	   Business leaders claimed the strike cost the impoverished
country dlrs 200 million in lost revenue.
	   But Zia said her campaign was justified.
	   ``Our movement is to protect the country and the people,'' she
said, calling a new hunger strike against the government on Nov.
23.

Kuwaitis disappointed U.S. didn't strike, Arabs raise questions

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ As another Iraq crisis winds down, Kuwaitis were
disappointed Monday that U.S. missiles did not finally finish off
Saddam Hussein. But for other Arabs, it was back to normal: Israel,
not Iraq, is the enemy.
	   ``Undoubtedly there is disappointment. We know that Saddam will
be whipping more crises,'' said independent Kuwaiti lawmaker
Mussalam al-Barrak.
	   ``We have the right to know if America wants Saddam Hussein to
stay, or if it is serious about toppling him and saving Iraq,''
wrote columnist Faisal al-Kanaii in Monday's al-Siyassah daily.
	   Bitter sentiments against the Iraqi leader are to be expected in
the small wealthy emirate south of Iraq. Saddam sent his army into
Kuwait in August 1990 and it did not leave until driven out by a
U.S.-led force seven months later.
	   But elsewhere in the Arab world, commentators looked at the
latest run-in between Saddam and the United Nations differently and
arrived at a familiar charge: that Washington's foreign policy is
plagued by double standards.
	   ``The admiration of the U.S. stand (on Iraq) ... would subside
when the admirers know of Washington's leniency in dealing with the
Israeli sustained failure to abide by international law,'' said the
Egyptian Gazette in an editorial.
	   Noting Israel's failure to implement U.N. Security Council
resolutions pertaining to the 50-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict,
the English-language daily said: ``It seems that international law
and threats of using force are only tailored for Iraqis.''
	   In Lebanon, the Daily Star concluded that Saddam, not U.S.
President Bill Clinton, emerged the winner from the stand-off
created by the Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt the work of U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   Saddam backed down Saturday, avoiding what looked like certain
military retaliation by the United States and Britain over Iraq's
refusal to allow continued U.N. arms inspections.
	   ``The `Beast of Baghdad' is ahead on points, President Clinton
is fast catching up and, as usual, losing at every turn are the
people of Iraq,'' the Star wrote.
	   Jordan's Arabic daily Ad-Destour was more blunt in its criticism
of the United States. ``Any honest person examining Washington's
double standards would only express ... condemnation and seething
anger for the absence of justice and balanced policy.''
	   Beyond Arab commentators, the ``one voice'' from the world that
Clinton described Sunday _ as telling Saddam to back down _ was
gone by Monday elsewhere, too.
	   In France, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said only the U.N.
Security Council has the right to authorize military action against
Iraq. And Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, in Egypt for a
visit, said Moscow opposed any military strikes against Baghdad.
	   But at least one person expressed relief at the easing of the
latest Saddam-Clinton tussle.
	   ``I am glad it was resolved in a peaceful manner,'' U.S. Army
Specialist Troy Kreitz told The Associated Press at Kuwait's Camp
Doha, where the United States has kept weapons since the 1991 Gulf
War.

Netanyahu says he is suspending West Bank troop pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS context graf on peace accord and Palestinian statehood &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced
Monday that he is suspending an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank _ scheduled for later this week - until the Palestinians drop
plans to declare independence in May.
	   The Palestinians accused Netanyahu of using excuses to get out
of his commitments.
	   Netanyahu made the announcement in a speech to parliament that
kicked off a two-day debate on the agreement under which Israel is
to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   The prime minister is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat who has renewed a pledge to declare statehood
in May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,''
Netanyahu told legislators in a speech frequently interrupted by
heckling.
	   Netanyahu said he would convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to
review the suspension of the withdrawal. On Sunday night, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators had agreed that Israel would withdraw
from 2 percent of the West Bank by the weekend. Under the original
time table, the Israeli withdrawal was to have begun Monday.
	   The land-for-security agreement is assured the support of some
90 of 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech was mainly aimed at
hard-liners who have threatened to topple his coalition.
	   Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who would not
put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the Palestinians
to violate the accord.
	   ``In the past year and a half, we haven't moved an inch,''
Netanyahu told the Knesset.
	   ``Unlike others, we do not believe in illusions, a new Middle
East,'' Netanyahu said. ``The Palestinians will test us every day
and we will stand firm.''
	   Later, he spoke more vehemently.
	   ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence with
rifles? If we do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division of
Jerusalem, they will use those rifles against us?'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two. ``There cannot be such dictates.''
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said Netanyahu was ``trying to avoid
and escape implementation.'' Tibi also accused Israel of violating
the accord with inflammatory statements, referring to Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's call to Jewish settlers to seize
land in the West Bank before a troop withdrawal.
	   Before his speech, Netanyahu called Arafat to seek
clarifications, but was not satisfied with Arafat's responses,
Israel radio said. Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call,
but refused to discuss its contents.
	   However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two senior
aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel
into not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   The latest agreement does not specifically refer to a possible
declaration of statehood, but urges both sides to refrain from
unilateral actions.
	   However, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that Arafat and
President Clinton reached a verbal understanding during last
month's Mideast summit that if little progress was made in
final-status talks by May, the United States would not oppose a
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile
homes on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim on Monday.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the
Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines policy
and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.
	   Both sides have been trading inflammatory remarks in recent days
that have raised questions about whether the land-for-security
agreement will be carried out on time.
	   Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would
collapse. Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but
with some U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead.
	   U.S. officials said it was time for Israelis and Palestinians to
cooperate. ``We have repeatedly called on both sides to refrain
from provocative language,'' said Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Manchester United picks Antwerp as feeder club

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ In another sign of the widening gulf
between rich and poor in European soccer, English giant Manchester
United has reached a deal to use Belgian side Royal Antwerp as a
feeder club for young talent.
	   Under the arrangement, United will cull young players from
around the world, send them to Antwerp for a few years of grooming
and bring them to Manchester once they are ready for the Premier
League.
	   Antwerp was a prime target for Manchester United because Belgian
labor laws and work permits are far more flexible than in England.
Once the players are established in the European Union, it is
easier for them to transfer to Manchester United.
	   European soccer's governing body UEFA and the Belgian federation
all expressed concerns Monday about such deals effectively turn
smaller leagues and clubs into pawns for the bigger ones.
	   ``We have to face reality,'' Royal Antwerp secretary Paul
Bistiaux said. ``The smaller clubs have to align themselves with
the big ones to survive. It's either sink or swim.''
	   Antwerp, Belgium's oldest club and a European Cup Winners Cup
finalist at Wembley only five years ago, was demoted to the Belgian
second division this year. It is now resigned to being at the
disposal of Manchester United.
	   ``Manchester United was looking for a pied-a-terre on the
continent,'' Bistiaux said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``It's clear Manchester United is the strongest party in
this. They'll be calling the shots.''
	   Fritz Ahlstrom, a spokesman for UEFA, expressed reservations
about the deal.

Gore speech before APEC summit enrages Malaysian government

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore
promised stricken Asian economies dlrs 10 billion in aid Monday,
but enraged the Malaysian government by praising the country's
dissidents in a speech before Asian leaders and businessmen.
	   ``It's the most disgusting speech I've ever heard in my life,''
Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters, calling it an
``unabashed intervention into local affairs.''
	   Gore's comments _ to an audience that included Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad _ added to mounting criticism of Mahathir, who had
hoped to keep his country's political unrest off the stage of an
international economic meeting.
	   Also in the audience were leaders of the Philippines, Vietnam,
New Zealand and others participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. The 21 APEC members will hold a summit meeting
hosted by Mahathir on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``History has taught us that freedom _ economic, political and
religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction of the human
potential than any other way of organizing society,'' said Gore.
	   Often, he said, people suffering through economic crises call
out for more democracy in their countries.
	   ``We hear them today _ right here, right now _ among the brave
people of Malaysia,'' Gore said.
	   The comment came in a speech largely devoted to praising Asia's
efforts to overcome its crisis, and to announce that Japan and the
United States would help pump an additional dlrs 10 billion into
the region's troubled economies.
	   ``This much is clear _ just as the global crisis started here in
Asia, the global economic recovery can and must start in Asia as
well,'' Gore said in the speech.
	   Ever since APEC officials began meeting in Kuala Lumpur last
week, some have chosen to focus on the controversy surrounding
Mahahtir's standoff with Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, Mahathir's deputy
prime minister, was fired, then jailed after launching an
anti-government reform movement.
	   Pro-Anwar protesters have repeatedly taken to the streets of
Kuala Lumpur since September, staging the kind of violent protests
that had long been rare in Malaysia. Two such protests also have
been held so far during the APEC meetings.
	   Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
hold bilateral talks with Mahathir.
	   Other officials from the U.S., Australian, Canadian and
Philippine delegations have met privately with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, to support her and question the way Anwar has been treated
since he was allegedly beaten in jail and placed on trial for
corruption and sex charges that he vehemently denies.
	   Gore, a last-minute stand-in for U.S. President Bill Clinton at
the APEC summit, seemed determined in his speech to reassure Asia,
where the global economic crisis began 17 months ago, that the
world's largest economy stands ready to try to help its allies out
of a serious economic difficulties.
	   He also used it to praise the free-market economic approach
endorsed by the International Monetary Fund and laid out in the new
initiatives that the United States were putting forward.
	   Mahathir has imposed capital controls to protect his economy
from wild gyrations in currency and stock markets across Asia, and
has criticized its IMF bailout programs.
	   Clinton canceled his trip to the summit at the last minute on
Saturday because of the showdown with Baghdad, during which he
nearly launched a military attack on Iraq to punish it for once
again expelling U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The financial aid packages announced by Gore include dlrs 5
billion in support offered by the United States, and the creation
of a dlrs 5 billion joint initiative supported by the United
States, Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Gore said the dlrs 5 billion in U.S. help includes dlrs 1
billion each in loans to Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, the
three countries hardest hit by the Asia crisis.
	   The remaining dlrs 2 billion will provide loan guarantees
through the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support
private business deals.
	   The dlrs 5 billion joint initiative was announced Monday night
in a statement by Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
that was released in Kuala Lumpur. Because of legal restraints, the
United States is not providing any direct financial support. The
exact amounts that Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank will be announced later.
	   Like other APEC members, Gore spent most of Monday holding
bilateral meetings with other leaders. During one, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin criticized U.S. support for the Dalai Lama,
the exiled Tibetan leader, and for Taiwan, the island regarded by
Beijing as a renegade province.
	   Gore invited Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to visit the United
States next year.
	   On Sunday, the APEC Cabinet ministers failed to achieve a
landmark agreement to reduce tariffs covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in
global trade. The fight now goes to the 124-nation World Trade
Organization, where the hope is to eventually overcome stiff
Japanese resistance to cutting tariffs in two sectors it considers
politically sensitive _ wood and fish products.
	   The United States, which had pushed the hardest to force Japan
to agree to slash tariffs in all nine sectors of the proposed
agreement, reluctantly accepted the outcome as the best Washington
could get at the moment, thanks to Japan.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

U.S., Britain have trapped Iraq; now hope to topple Saddam, says
</HEADLINE>
Blair &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The United States and Britain have trapped Saddam
Hussein and are now considering how to help topple the Iraqi
president, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday.
	   ``We are looking with the Americans now at ways in which we can
bolster the opposition and improve the possibility of removing
Saddam Hussein altogether,'' Blair told Parliament.
	   He addressed lawmakers after a hectic weekend in which the
United States and Britain called off a joint bombardment of Iraq at
the last minute after Iraq promised to allow U.N. personnel to
resume unconditionally inspections of suspected sites of weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``The United States and the United Kingdom with far greater
international support than ever before now have Saddam Hussein
trapped,'' Blair told the House of Commons.
	   ``If he again obstructs the work of the inspectors, then we
strike. No warnings. No wrangling. No negotiations. No last-minute
letters. The next withdrawal of cooperation and he will be hit,''
the prime minister said.
	   Blair's remarks reflected increasingly forthright
acknowledgments in London and Washington that a prime aim is to
oust Saddam.
	   The current confrontation marks the second time since February
that Saddam has defied U.N. weapons inspectors, partly to try to
get an end to sanctions imposed after he invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Blair dismissed analysts who have said Saddam needed an air
strike to bolster his position domestically. He also rejected
criticisms that the hawkish stance of London and Washington is not
shared by other members of the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``When he finally saw, correctly, that we were ready to use
force, and on a substantial scale, he crumbled,'' Blair said. ``He
has now exposed the fact that his fear is greater than his courage.
Let us learn the lessons of that.''
	   Blair said Saddam is guilty not merely of technical breaches of
the U.N. inspections regime, but ``a pattern of behavior which
continues to pose huge actual risk for Iraq's neighbors, the Middle
East and the entire international community.''
	   Despite successes by U.N. inspectors in uncovering and
destroying chemical and other weapons of mass destruction, Saddam
retained a huge arsenal, Blair said, adding, ``We do not know how
much.''

U.S Commerce Secretary opens water distillation plant in Gaza

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley on Monday inaugurated a dlrs 6 million water distillation
plant in the new Gaza Strip industrial park and pronounced the
product ``laziz,'' Arabic for delicious.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat joined Daley in a tour of the
water treatment facility that was funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development and built by a U.S. contractor.
Sub-contracts were given to Palestinian firms.
	   The opening of the Gaza industrial park at the Karni crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip is to open soon as part of last
month's Wye peace agreement negotiated by Israel and the
Palestinians. The project will create about 20,000 jobs for
Palestinians from the poverty-stricken Gaza Strip.
	   ``I believe very strongly that if peace is to be lasting, it
must be built on economic stability and jobs,'' Daley said.
	   Arafat thanked Daley for ``his help in our economy and in our
production and in our trade.''
	   Palestinian Industry Minister Saadi Krounz said the Palestinian
Authority was very committed real partnership between the private
investment sector and the public sector. Krounz said there are
plans to open two more distillation sites in the West Bank.
	   Daley told the industrial park will generate interest around the
world. ``I know what they will see, new partners, new businesses
and new jobs in a new Middle East,'' Daley said.
	   Later Monday, Daley also planned to inaugurate a U.S. trade
office in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
	   Daley has been promoting regional economic cooperation during
this visit to the Middle East. He has said that only 7 percent of
Middle East trade is with other Middle Eastern countries.
	   ``That concept of positive regional cooperation and the impact
it can have on the people in the region has got to be at the
forefront,'' Daley told reporters at a news conference.
	   He contrasted Middle Eastern trade with that of Europe, where
two-thirds of its trade is with other European nations, and the
United States whose largest trade partners are Canada and Mexico.

Philippines president meets wife of jailed Malaysian politician;

ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout with Estrada meeting Anwar's wife &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Philippines President Joseph
Estrada on Monday became the first leader to defy the Malaysian
government by meeting with the wife of jailed politician Anwar
Ibrahim during a meeting of Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Shortly after midnight Monday, Estrada met privately with Azizah
Ismail in his hotel room, said Estrada's press secretary, Rod
Reyes.
	   Reyes said he could not elaborate on the meeting, except to say
it had been requested by Azizah. When asked whether it would hurt
relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors, he said, ``We
don't think that it will.''
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific Rim countries and Hong Kong are in
Malaysia for an annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   The case of Anwar -- ousted as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, then jailed and beaten by police -- has dominated the
summit sidelines.
	   U.S. President Al Gore infuriated the Malaysian government
Monday night in a speech that indirectly expressed support for
Anwar's backers. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with
Azizah on Sunday night. On Saturday, two Canadian Cabinet members
also met with Azizah.
	   Estrada was the first foreign leader to publicly criticize the
jailing of Anwar, whom he considers a friend. He even considered
boycotting the APEC summit, but later changed his mind.
	   He met with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad earlier in
the day. They did not discuss the Anwar case, according to
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon.
	   While officials from some other countries attending this week's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have discussed Anwar's
case, the Philippines did not find it necessary.
	   ``Anwar is not an official issue between the two countries,''
Siazon said.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his ouster set off
massive anti-government protests. He has pleaded innocent to 10
charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Siazon said the Philippines believes the trial is going well.
	   ``There is transparency,'' he said. ``So far so good.''
	   Several Philippine congressmen, concerned about Anwar's human
rights and prison conditions, attended the first week of the trial
along with dozens of other foreign observers.
	   In their meeting, Estrada and Mahathir also agreed on the need
for better surveillance of international capital flows, especially
of short-term capital and hedge funds, Siazon said.
	   The two leaders also discussed the political situation in
Indonesia, and ``both hope that the political transformation
process can proceed smoothly,'' Siazon said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new government said Monday it
still intends to return to Berlin next year as scheduled despite
new reports of building delays and cost overruns.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who unseated Helmut Kohl in
September elections, has said he wants to work more and more from
the prewar capital beginning next spring _ even before parliament's
scheduled arrival in the fall.
	   But the newsweekly Der Spiegel this week said the new
government's official in charge of the 20 billion mark (dlrs 12
billion) move, Franz Muentefering, had compiled a report warning
that most construction was behind schedule.
	   Schroeder's Cabinet will discuss on Wednesday whether
Muentefering's report means new delays, but it sees no reason yet
to change its plans, government spokeswoman Charima Reinhardt said.
	   Der Spiegel said plans to hold the first session of parliament
in the revamped Berlin Reichstag building next April are in
jeopardy because of slow construction.
	   New delays are also in store for the chancellor's offices near
the Reichstag. Originally set to be completed in December 1999, the
building won't be finished before October 2000, the magazine said.
	   Muentefering's spokesman, Michael Donnermeyer, said the Spiegel
report was ``largely accurate.''
	   Until his gleaming new chancellery is ready, Schroeder plans to
set up his office in a building once used by communist East German
rulers.

Shares rise on rumors of Hoechst merger with Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Shares of Germany's Hoechst AG and
France's Rhone-Poulenc rose Monday on reports that the chemical and
pharmaceutical giants were close to merging. Neither company would
comment on the rumors.
	   Hoechst was up 5.6 percent in Frankfurt, closing at 79.10 marks
(dlrs 49). Rhone Poulenc shares rose 3.4 percent to close at 264.8
francs (dlrs 47.30) in Paris.
	   Industry sources and analysts said a full-blown merger would be
difficult and suggested the two companies might be considering
merging only their agricultural products divisions.
	   A full merger wouldn't give the new company exposure to the
still-expanding U.S. drugs market, where sales growth of about 10
percent a year is more than double the European rate.
	   Although the global farm chemical markets is only about
one-tenth the size of the drug market, linking their farm chemical
operations would put Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc among the leaders of
that industry, with annual sales of about dlrs 5 billion.
	   ``If it were a pharma-driven merger, then you've got two
businesses which have a large proportion of their sales in their
domestic markets'' _ France and Germany, said Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson analyst Peter Mackay. ``They both have weaknesses in that
they need a greater exposure to the U.S. market.''
	   A farm chemicals tie-up, said Mackay, ``would seem more
logical.''
	   Salomon Smith Barney analyst Peter Blair said this route would
save money and produce a good product mix.
	   ``With most of these (farm chemical) businesses you've got
overlapping marketing and sales teams through the world,'' said
Blair. ``By merging two substantial businesses there are costs to
be taken out.

Study: New AIDS treatment flushes virus from a few patients
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Federal researchers say they have managed to flush
the AIDS virus out from one of its most stubborn hiding places and
erase it to undetectable levels in a handful of patients.
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci and other researchers at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases cautioned that their
method of rinsing the virus from resting immune cells is highly
experimental and unconfirmed.
	   However, the technique appears to have removed HIV from the
blood of three of the 26 patients in the study. In one of the
three, there was no trace of the virus in the lymph nodes, either.
	   Fauci said it would take years of follow-up studies to determine
if the treatment works. The process still could be derailed by
toxic side effects, or the ability of the virus to develop a
resistance to the therapy.
	   Still, researchers said, it is a promising step in the battle
against AIDS.
	   Now that powerful drug combinations work effectively in many
patients to reduce the virus to extremely low levels, the next _
and perhaps _ final step is to find ways in which the remaining
copies of the virus can be flushed from its deepest haunts so
antiviral drugs can erase those traces, too.
	   Data on the patients was discussed Sunday in Denver at the
annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
	   ``It's conceivable that we'll take these people off their drugs
and the disease will come roaring back from a reservoir we didn't
find,'' Fauci said in the Monday edition of USA Today.
	   Another hurdle is whether new cells can be infected by the virus
as it is flushed out _ in effect, whether the aggressive treatment
might inadvertently continue the disease cycle.
	   ``We would like to get to the point of sterilizing immunity,''
said Dr. Roger Pomerantz of Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia, who did not work on the study. ``But different
patients may react differently.
	   ``In some, you might eradicate the virus and in others, the
virus may be activated and infect new cells,'' Pomerantz said.
``You might not be able to withdraw therapy.''
	   Fauci and his team originally announced their experimental
treatment last February.
	   The treatment targets CD4T cells, which function as the immune
system's memory and are found throughout the body. They appear to
hang onto the blueprint of bacteria and viruses for as long as 10
years so the body will recognize the infection and mount a defense
if it appears again.
	   In the case of AIDS, the genetic coding of the virus takes up
long-term residence in the genes of the CD4T cells. This protects
the virus from drugs when it circulates in the bloodstream.
	   When the body's immune system is activated to fight an infection
_ or when drug therapy slips _ these cells turn on and produce HIV
again.
	   In the study, 26 men were given a combination of three anti-HIV
drugs in an AIDS ``cocktail treatment.' Fourteen also were given
the powerful immune system stimulator Interleukin-2.
	   IL-2 is the synthetic version of a substance naturally produced
by the immune system. It alerts several types of disease-fighting
cells to begin reproducing and fighting an invading infection.
	   Researchers believed that the IL-2 would activate dormant,
infected CD4T cells. This would expose these reservoirs and the
drug cocktail would eradicate it.
	   After the treatment, researchers said they could not grow live
HIV from more than 300 million immune cells extracted from three
men in the study.
	   Later this year, the researchers said they would take the three
men off of the drug cocktail therapy to see if their viral loads
increase again.
	   The other 23 men in the study remained HIV-positive, researchers
said. Fauci said repeated treatments with IL-2 might be necessary.
	   In other studies announced at the meeting, virologists said
HIV-infected immune cells were hiding in semen. They may lurk in
even more inaccessible sites in the body, including the brain and
the retina.

Philippines president meets wife of jailed Malaysian
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Azizah &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Philippines President Joseph
Estrada on Monday became the first leader to defy the Malaysian
government by meeting with the wife of jailed politician Anwar
Ibrahim during a meeting of Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Shortly after midnight Monday, Estrada met privately with Azizah
Ismail in his hotel room, said Estrada's press secretary, Rod
Reyes.
	   Reyes said he could not elaborate on the meeting, except to say
it had been requested by Azizah. When asked whether it would hurt
relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors, he said, ``We
don't think that it will.''
	   Azizah, speaking later to reporters at her house, said Estrada
was ``very supportive and very nice.''
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific Rim countries and Hong Kong are in
Malaysia for an annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   The case of Anwar -- ousted as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, then jailed and beaten by police -- has dominated the
summit sidelines.
	   U.S. President Al Gore infuriated the Malaysian government
Monday night in a speech that indirectly expressed support for
Anwar's backers. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with
Azizah on Sunday night. On Saturday, two Canadian Cabinet members
also met with Azizah.
	   Estrada was the first foreign leader to publicly criticize the
jailing of Anwar, whom he considers a friend. He even considered
boycotting the APEC summit, but later changed his mind.
	   He met with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad earlier in
the day. They did not discuss the Anwar case, according to
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon.
	   While officials from some other countries attending this week's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have discussed Anwar's
case, the Philippines did not find it necessary.
	   ``Anwar is not an official issue between the two countries,''
Siazon said.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his ouster set off
massive anti-government protests. He has pleaded innocent to 10
charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Siazon said the Philippines believes the trial is going well.
	   ``There is transparency,'' he said. ``So far so good.''
	   Several Philippine congressmen, concerned about Anwar's human
rights and prison conditions, attended the first week of the trial
along with dozens of other foreign observers.
	   In their meeting, Estrada and Mahathir also agreed on the need
for better surveillance of international capital flows, especially
of short-term capital and hedge funds, Siazon said.
	   The two leaders also discussed the political situation in
Indonesia, and ``both hope that the political transformation
process can proceed smoothly,'' Siazon said.

Belarus National Bank liberalizes currency market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Belarusian central bank eased rigid
currency controls in this former Soviet republic Monday, allowing
commercial banks to trade in foreign currency within a broader
band.
	   The move reflected a growing pressure on the national currency,
the Belarusian ruble, which has steadily lost value in recent
months as the government has liberally printed new cash.
	   The new rules set by the National Bank allow commercial banks to
set their exchange rates at a level that doesn't exceed the
official rate by 50 percent. Previously banks had to strictly
adhere to the official rate.
	   Belarus uses five different exchange rates for conversions
between its ruble and the U.S. dollar. World Bank officials have
said the lack of a single, objective rate has prevented the
accumulation of hard-currency reserves and inaccurately reflected
the country's health in trade and production.
	   The main official bank rate was 66 rubles to the U.S. dollar on
Monday. It immediately fell to 99 to the dollar _ the maximum
allowed under the new rules _ in street trading Monday.
	   The new rules are a ``next step toward liberalization of the
currency market and the introduction of a single exchange rate,''
said Anatoly Drozdov, the National Bank spokesman.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, as President Alexander Lukashenko, an admirer of
Soviet policies, has preferred to keep most enterprises in
government hands.
	   The country was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a
dramatic slump in its currency prompting the government to order
strict price controls. That led to a boom in exports _ and to
frequent shortages of staple goods, including meat and dairy
products, within Belarus.
	   A World Bank delegation on a trip to Belarus earlier this month
criticized the country for its failure to abide by an agreement to
introduce a single exchange rate.
	   The World Bank also urged Belarus to limit money-printing, stop
providing money to bail out unprofitable factories, speed up
privatization and liberalize the economy to attract investors.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Soccer star Ronaldo appeared at the United Nations
Monday to back a campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the
dangers of the AIDS virus among young people.
	   ``It's all about staying in the game for longer,'' the Brazil
and Inter Milan striker, who joined the U.N. campaign in May, told
a news conference. ``Kids have the right to make the most of their
lives.''
	   He said he had signed up ``because I know that soccer can help
kids.''
	   ``If things go wrong on the field you can say to yourself that
you will try hard to do better next time,'' Ronaldo said. ``With
HIV, there is no second chance.''
	   ``Ronaldo is a key player on this team as on his own team,''
said Peter Piot, head of the U.N. agency dealing with HIV/AIDS.
	   Some 7,000 people aged between 10 and 24 are infected with HIV
worldwide every day, Piot said.
	   Ronaldo earlier launched an institute aimed at offering children
from Brazilian slums a way off the streets through training in
football and other sports.
	   The Instituto R9 will be part of a privately funded foundation
being set up in a southern suburb of Rio de Janeiro, intended to
receive some 3,000 children and teen-agers.
	   The sports and leisure complex should open by the end of next
year.
	   The striker was upbeat about a knee injury that kept him out of
league action last weekend. ``Hopefully I'll be able to play again
very soon,'' he said.
	   Suffering from World Cup stress and troubled by tendinitis in
both knees, Ronaldo has been often sidelined this season.
	   But ``my health is fine,'' he said. ``I'm getting much better.''

Congolese rebels vow to keep military pressure on Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With South Africa-Congo, Congo-Refugees

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Monday said they
captured Moba on Lake Tanganyika, the southern-most town now under
their control, and vowed to keep pressure on President Laurent
Kabila as long as he refuses to negotiate peace.
	   In South Africa, Congolese Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto
Lolakombe again refused to directly negotiate with the rebels,
demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for
the insurgents.
	   ``We are in favor of negotiations, but we are not stopping the
war,'' Arthur Ngoma, a rebel leader, said from the eastern rebel
stronghold at Goma. ``We are maintaining military pressure on
Kabila.''
	   Ngoma said his troops early Monday took Moba, 480 kilometers
(300 miles) south of Goma, in copper-rich Katanga Province, but had
no details.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report. If true,
the seizure of the port could further undermine efforts by the
government and allies from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to launch a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in the east of the
country.
	   Since they took up arms Aug. 2, the rebels have advanced to more
than a third of Congo. Ngoma said his forces, backed up by troops
and arms from Rwanda and Uganda, were advancing on the diamond city
of Mbuji-Mayi in Eastern Kasai, Katanga's regional capital of
Lubumbashi and Equatoria Province in northern Congo.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
Monday convicted two Muslims and a Bosnian Croat in its first case
to deal with atrocities committed against Bosnian Serbs.
	   Judges said they were appalled by what they called ``singular
brutality'' and ``calculating cruelty,'' of staff at a central
Bosnian prison camp where guards beat to death and tortured Serb
inmates.
	   A three-judge panel at the U.N. court convicted the Celebici
camp's Bosnian Croat warden and two Muslim guards in the murder,
torture and rape of Serb prisoners in 1992.
	   The verdicts, which included the court's first conviction of
sexual assualt as a war crime, came at a time when Serb authorities
are accusing the tribunal of being anti-Serb and are refusing to
allow its investigators probe alleged atrocities in the Southhern
Yugoslav Province of Kosovo.
	   Camp warden, Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty of 11 war crimes
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for overseeing guards
who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo convicted Nazi and Japanese
superiors for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his
neck, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years imprisonment.
	   Prosecutors failed to make the same command responsibility
argument stick to Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander
accused of having overall control of the camp. The judges acquitted
him, saying there was not enough evidence to link him to the
atrocities.
	   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal. ``The evidence
... was sufficient to convict the accused,'' said Deputy Prosecutor
Graham Blewitt. He said he also might appeal Mucic's sentence,
calling it ``inadequate.''
	   The 20-month trial was the tribunal's first to concentrate on
atrocities against Serbs _ who are blamed for the majority of war
crimes carried out during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict.
	   Inmates at Celebici were murdered, tortured and raped by camp
staff, witnesses said in emotional testimony.
	   ``We have been appalled by the details of your criminal
actions,'' Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria told
the camp's deputy commander, Hazim Delic, a Muslim sentenced to 20
years in prison for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners.
	   ``You displayed a singular brutality in causing the deaths of
two men ... and a calculating cruelty in the torture and
mistreatment of many others,'' Karibi-Whyte said.
	   Chewing gum given to him by a U.N. guard, Delic showed no
emotion when he heard the verdicts.
	   In their 483-page ruling, the judges said Delic _ the first
defendant the tribunal has convicted of rape _ appeared ``to take a
sadistic pleasure in causing the detainees pain.''
	   A camp guard, Esad Landzo, was ordered jailed for 15 years for
murdering three inmates and torturing others.
	   Prosecutors said Landzo and Delic beat to death one man and
nailed a Muslim political party's badge to his head, and that
Landzo also beat a 60-year-old man to death with a wooden plank.
	   Although they were convicted, Mucic, Delic and Landzo also were
acquitted of 34 charges, including several counts of murder and
torture. All four had faced up to life imprisonment.
	   Mucic Delic and Landzo will likely serve their sentences in
prison in either Italy, Norway or Finland, countries which have
agreed to house war criminals convicted by the tribunal.
	   ``The trial of these accused demonstrates the even-handed
approach of the prosecutor,'' Blewitt said.
	   Before Monday, the court had convicted a Bosnian Serb and a
Bosnian Croat who admitted taking part in a Bosnian Serb army
massacre of Muslims. Another Bosnian Serb has admitted murdering 12
Muslims.
	   Serbs account for most of the 56 publicly indicted suspects, and
they have accused the tribunal of being biased against them.
	   ``This is completely unbelievable, a gross injustice,'' Dragan
Cavic, deputy president of Bosnia's hard-line Serbian Democratic
Party, said Monday after the acquittal of Delalic, a Muslim.
	   Blewitt, however, said prosecutors were currently working on
more investigations involving Serbs as the victims of war crimes.

Police: Attack on Philips president's wife was ``deliberate pay
</HEADLINE>
back''

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Justice authorities Monday
described a brutal attack on the wife of Royal Philips Electronics'
president as a ``deliberate pay back.''
	   Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, the wife of Philips chief Cor
Boonstra, was found Friday severely injured, handcuffed and dumped
next to a road in the coastal town of Hoek van Holland, about 70
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Amsterdam.
	   She remained in critical condition Monday.
	   ``I can't say why, but there are indications that this was a
deliberate pay back,'' said Carola de Kimpe of the Rotterdam Public
Prosecutor's office.
	   De Kimpe added that police have no suspects in the case.
	   It was not clear whether the attack was directed at
Boonstra-Raatjes personally, or at Philips. Boonstra-Raatjes has
not yet been able to answer police questions.
	   De Kimpe declined to comment on her condition, but Dutch media
said she suffered from serious head injuries and a broken arm.
	   Investigators have not ruled out a possible reprisal by an
ex-worker of Philips, but that was just one of several
possibilities, the Dutch press agency GPD reported.
	   De Kimpe said there was no demand for a ransom.
	   On Monday, police also found Boonstra-Raatjes' blue BMW parked
at a train station in a nearby town.
	   The Boonstras have been separated for a year, and
Boonstra-Raatjes has continued to live in their house in Belgium.
	   Spokesman Ben Geerts of Philips, which is Europe's largest
consumer electronics group, declined to comment on the attack.

	   ON BOARD USS EISENHOWER (AP) _ The F-14s and F-18s aboard this
aircraft carrier are silent. The mass of ordnance they had packed
in preparation for bombing Iraq _ some decorated with cheeky
messages to Saddam Hussein _ remains undelivered.
	   But commanders of the aircraft carrier Eisenhower's battle group
said at least one message has been sent to Saddam loud and clear:
the U.S. military is ready to execute crippling strikes on Iraq at
a moment's notice.
	   The Eisenhower's battle group is ``a force that is ready to
respond to a crisis,'' said Rear Adm. Scott Fry, the battle group
commander. ``We are ready to execute whatever ... the national
command authority may have for us.''
	   He said the ships were deployed ``as evidence of the commitment
on the part of our country to the peace and stability in the
region.''
	   The Eisenhower and 14 other ships, some ready to fire cruise
missiles, were only hours from launching the all-night bombing
raids Saturday when President Bill Clinton ordered a 24-hour wait.
	   On Sunday came the order to stand down altogether after Clinton
accepted Iraq's pledge to allow the resumption of disarmament work
by the United Nations.
	   But Clinton asked the Navy to remain in the Gulf to ensure that
Iraq cooperates with U.N. weapons inspectors, who are responsible
for destroying Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Clinton said the strikes would have considerably reduced that
capability.
	   Television crews were flown to the aircraft carrier Saturday,
but the film and news gathered on the ship was embargoed until
Monday.
	   Capt. Carlton Jewett, head of the aircraft operations aboard the
aircraft carrier, said Saturday the operation was called off as
``we were actually walking over to the aircraft and starting
engines.''
	   Asked how the crew felt on being told about the freeze on the
operation, he said: ``You ramp up your emotions, get high, and you
are ready go out and do your business. Then when you find out
things are put on hold, you have mixed emotions.
	   ``It is good in the sense that we don't have to go out right
now. Now the challenge is to maintain a level of readiness, a level
of mental toughness,'' he said.
	   On Saturday, journalists saw missiles and 1,000 pound bombs
being loaded on fighter jets. One bomb being raised to the belly of
a strike aircraft carried a message scrawled in chalk: ``To Saddam:
we come in love.''
	   ``Have a nice day'' was scribbled on other bombs _ and a few had
less polite messages.
	   Amid the lightheartedness was the seriousness of the military
tasks of the crewmen. Some serviced plane engines, others wiped
clean the cockpit glass and hundreds slow marched down the flight
deck with eyes lowered to spot and remove debris.
	   Fry, Jewett and other officers or sailors did not give
interviews on Sunday for reaction to the easing of the tensions in
the Gulf.
	   Before the stand down order, Fry said the strike jets ``will
conduct strikes all night from the aircraft carrier.'' He refused
to say what the targets were and how many days would the strikes
last.
	   Fry said the ship carries 10 F-14A Tomcat and 36 F/A-18C Hornet
aircraft, which carry a range of missiles and bombs. He refused to
say how many would have participated.

European allies agree to arms agency to boost defense stance in

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Europeans agreeing to arms group; ADDS comments;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ NATO's European allies agreed Monday to create an
arms agency to end duplication in their weapons manufacture, part
of efforts to raise their defense profile after Britain eased its
objections.
	   European governments have always been protective of their arms
sectors. Reflecting that, the agency that may recommend unpopular
cutbacks will not exist until at least 2001 and its tasks must
still be defined.
	   At an EU foreign and defense ministers meeting, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cooke formally said Britain no longer objects to
Europe taking a more independent defense stance within NATO.
	   Until now, it worried a go-it-alone Europe would erode
Washington's commitment to European security through NATO.
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said Britain's change
of heart provided new motivation to make something of the Western
European Union, the EU's embryonic defense group.
	   ``If the Europeans do not overcome their weaknesses, they cannot
complain the United States'' takes the lead in European security
issues in the Balkans, he said.
	   French European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici, whose country
is most keen to reduce U.S. influence in Europe, also welcomed the
new British attitude, officials said.
	   Britain and Germany said Europe must bear more of the NATO
defense burden. ``We want to develop the European security and
defense identity in consultation with our North American allies,''
said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
	   Cook said defense spending by Europeans equaled two-thirds of
that of the United States but they shoulder far fewer NATO defense
tasks.
	   There are at least four tank-building programs in Europe,
compared to one in the United States, officials said. For infantry
combat vehicles, Europeans have 16 different programs, against
three in the United States. And while less than half a dozen U.S.
companies make helicopters and military planes, in Europe there are
10.
	   ``We need to reconstruct our forces together and make sure that
spending on defense in all nations matches the need,'' British
Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote last Friday in the New York Times.
He said he also wants to see progress in efforts to combine forces
from different European countries able to act without the United
States, if need be.
	   France, Germany, Italy and Britain _ which account for 80
percent of the European arms industry _ have already taken the lead
by pledging to cooperate in arms making. Their efforts may well be
turned into a full-fledged European arms agency, officials said.
	   Arms duplication has long been a nightmare at NATO where
military planners have had to contend with a hodge-podge of norms,
standards and ammunition needs.
	   If the EU nations can make a bigger stance in defense, they may
at last be able to project political influence eastward. Their
waffling in recent years has left the United States in charge of
peace efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo.
	   The WEU is made up of all 15 EU nations, except Austria,
Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland.

Train workers continue strike; Air France braces for walkout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the eve of a two-day strike by Air France, rail
services were also expected to be reduced after train workers in
Marseille voted Monday to extend their walkout.
	   Regional traffic around Marseille, in southern France, was
expected to be ``very disrupted'' on Tuesday, the national rail
company, the SNCF, said.
	   The striking train workers want the SNCF to hire 30 extra train
conductors by the end of the year. A majority of train conductors
in Marseille support the walkout.
	   Tuesday will be the 10th day of the strike.
	   Talks between workers and management have been tense. Union
representatives said Monday that talks are continuing, but that no
agreement is in sight.
	   Meanwhile, train workers in Nice and Miramas, also in southern
France, said they would stage a 24-hour strike Tuesday.
	   Train conductors in nearby Avignon, however, decided Monday to
resume service after walking out Sunday.
	   Air France was also bracing for a strike Tuesday and Wednesday,
which the airline said would ground a large percentage of national
and international flights. Flight attendants called the strike to
protest what they see as inequities in salaries.

Dion Dublin looks set to start in England vs. Czechs

 &UR; Eds: Updates with Dublin quote in 4th graf

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dion Dublin, who has scored five goals in two
games since moving from Coventry to Aston Villa, is expected to
spearhead an aging England attack in Wednesday's friendly against
the Czech Republic at Wembley.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle looks set to give the 29-year-old
Dublin a starting place up front with 35-year-old Ian Wright _ a
strike force with a combined age of 64.
	   Another old-timer expected to play Wednesday is 30-year-old
forward Paul Merson.
	   ``I think the coach is picking on form,'' Dublin said Monday.
``I've been doing well and scoring goals, Wrighty and Merse have
been playing well as well. So if we all get a game, regardless of
the combined age being 94, then if we can do the job on the pitch,
why not pick us?''

Planes carrying Russians from Baghdad arrive in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense minister's comments in new 5th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two planes carrying Russian women and children
evacuated from Baghdad arrived at an airport outside Moscow on
Monday, and a Foreign Ministry official called on both sides in the
Iraqi conflict ``to show restraint.''
	   More than 100 people, most of them relatives of Russians working
in the Iraqi capital, were taken overland to Kermanshah, Iran on
Sunday. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry sent two planes
to retrieve them, as well as one Ukrainian citizen, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The decision to evacuate the Russians was made ``in a rather
tense psychological situation,'' before the West, led by the United
States, backed down from its threat to carry out attacks on Iraq,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said.
	   Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, on a visit to Egypt, said
Monday, ``It cannot be tolerated that anyone should be reaching for
their weapons at the slightest provocation. It is a dangerous
tendency,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk said Monday that while
there was at present no threat of air strikes, tension remained
high, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``Much will depend on Iraq's goodwill. Whoever maintains contact
with Baghdad will try to persuade it to show wisdom,'' he was
quoted as saying.
	   Posuvalyuk said the weapons inspectors should return to work in
Iraq. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has reversed his decision to halt
the United Nations' monitoring of weapons sites.
	   ``We expect both sides to show restraint and work in a
level-headed way ... rather than to head for conflicts,'' Interfax
quoted him as saying.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
convicted two Muslims and a Bosnian Croat on Monday in its first
case dealing with atrocities committed against Bosnian Serbs. It
was also the court's first conviction for sexual assault as a war
crime.
	   Judges said they were appalled by what they called ``singular
brutality'' and ``calculating cruelty,'' of staff at a central
Bosnian prison camp where guards beat to death and tortured Serb
inmates.
	   A three-judge panel at the U.N. court convicted the Celebici
camp's Bosnian Croat warden and two Muslim guards in the murder,
torture and rape of Serb prisoners in 1992.
	   The verdicts, which included the court's first conviction for
sexual assault as a war crime, come amid accusations that the
tribunal is anti-Serb. Serb authorities are refusing to let its
investigators probe alleged atrocities in the Southern Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
	   Camp warden Zdravko Mucic was found guilty of 11 war crimes and
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for overseeing guards who
murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross, smiled as he heard
his seven-year sentence.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo convicted Nazi and Japanese
superiors for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   Prosecutors failed to make the same argument stick for Zejnil
Delalic, a Muslim military commander accused controlling the camp.
The judges acquitted him, saying there was not enough evidence to
link him to the atrocities.
	   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal. ``The evidence
... was sufficient to convict the accused,'' said Deputy Prosecutor
Graham Blewitt. He said he also might appeal Mucic's sentence,
calling it ``inadequate.''
	   The 20-month trial was the tribunal's first to concentrate on
atrocities against Serbs _ who are blamed for the majority of war
crimes carried out during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict.
	   Inmates at Celebici were murdered, tortured and raped by camp
staff, witnesses said in emotional testimony.
	   ``We have been appalled by the details of your criminal
actions,'' Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria told
the camp's deputy commander, Hazim Delic, a Muslim sentenced to 20
years in prison for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners.
	   ``You displayed a singular brutality in causing the deaths of
two men ... and a calculating cruelty in the torture and
mistreatment of many others,'' Karibi-Whyte said.
	   Chewing gum given to him by a U.N. guard, Delic showed no
emotion when he heard the verdicts.
	   In their 483-page ruling, the judges said Delic _ the first
defendant the tribunal has convicted of rape _ appeared ``to take a
sadistic pleasure in causing the detainees pain.''
	   A camp guard, Esad Landzo, was ordered jailed for 15 years for
murdering three inmates and torturing others.
	   Prosecutors said Landzo and Delic beat to death one man and
nailed a Muslim political party's badge to his head, and that
Landzo also beat a 60-year-old man to death with a wooden plank.
	   Although they were convicted, Mucic, Delic and Landzo also were
acquitted of 34 charges, including several counts of murder and
torture. All four had faced up to life imprisonment.
	   Mucic Delic and Landzo will likely serve their sentences in
prison in either Italy, Norway or Finland, countries which have
agreed to house war criminals convicted by the tribunal.
	   Before Monday, the court had convicted a Bosnian Serb and a
Bosnian Croat who admitted participating in a Bosnian Serb army
massacre of Muslims. Another Bosnian Serb has admitted murdering 12
Muslims.
	   Serbs account for most of the 56 publicly indicted suspects, and
they have accused the tribunal of being bias.
	   ``This is completely unbelievable, a gross injustice,'' Dragan
Cavic, deputy president of Bosnia's hard-line Serbian Democratic
Party, said Monday after Delalic's acquittal.
	   Blewitt, however, said prosecutors were currently investigating
more cases of Serb victims of war crimes.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With bells, parties and a blizzard of
publicity, the newly merged DaimlerChrysler comes into being
Tuesday when its stock begins trading on 19 financial markets
around the world.
	   A cocktail reception, live broadcasts to 250 locations in 62
countries, an array of promotional materials and a new advertising
campaign aimed at investors are part of the push for a high profile
``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic car company.
	   The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, and
Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, attended a reception at Frankfurt's
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New
York for the stock's debut on Wall Street.
	   ``Today is just the beginning,'' Eaton said. ``I think that when
you get this many excellent people _ the creative talents that we
have here _ you can continue to expect excellent things from this
company for decades to come.
	   DaimlerChrysler starts out with a strong share of European and
North American markets, and Schrempp and Eaton emphasized their
goal of entering new markets, in Asia and Latin America.
	   Together, the two men will ring a bell at the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday morning, in a symbol of their cooperation. The
stock will have started trading hours earlier, however, starting in
Tokyo.
	   It begins trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange at 9 a.m.
(0800 GMT) Tuesday.
	   Eaton dismissed rumors of job cuts, saying ``exactly the
opposite'' was true. ``We expect to expand our presence in areas
where we not currently represented,'' he said. ``And I can assure
you that that will lead actually to jobs growth.''
	   The new DaimlerChrysler will become the world's fifth largest
car company in terms of vehicle sales. Schrempp, 54, and Eaton, 58,
will jointly lead the new company for three years. After that,
Schrempp is set to run it alone.
	   In addition to moving into new markets, DaimlerChrysler also
hopes to advance its non-automotive industries _ financial
information technology, telecommunications and aerospace, according
to promotional materials for the debut.
	   More immediately, the ambitious merger will test the ability of
the original two companies to blend their different cultures. To
help, DaimlerChrysler's 428,000 employees will get a quarterly
journal on how it's going; managers will get an extra page with
more details.
	   The last significant hurdle before setting up DaimlerChrysler
was completed a week ago, when Daimler announced 98 percent of its
shareholders had swapped shares for the new company. Due to
corporate differences, Chrysler shareholders did not need to swap,
but voted on the merger.
	   Four Daimler shareholders filed lawsuits with a German court
trying to stop the merger, claiming they weren't properly informed
about it. Daimler says the challenges won't affect the new company.
The protesting shareholder's shares will be merged at a later,
undecided date _ though for less money that those who swapped
voluntarily.

Congolese rebels vow to keep military pressure on Kabila

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Monday said they
captured Moba on Lake Tanganyika, the southern-most town now under
their control, and vowed to keep pressure on President Laurent
Kabila as long as he refuses to negotiate peace.
	   In South Africa, Congolese Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto
Lolakombe again refused to directly negotiate with the rebels,
demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for
the insurgents.
	   ``We are in favor of negotiations, but we are not stopping the
war,'' Arthur Ngoma, a rebel leader, said from the eastern rebel
stronghold at Goma. ``We are maintaining military pressure on
Kabila.''
	   Ngoma said his troops early Monday took Moba, 480 kilometers
(300 miles) south of Goma, in copper-rich Katanga Province, but had
no details.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report. If true,
the seizure of the port could further undermine efforts by the
government and allies from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to launch a
counteroffensive against rebel positions in the east of the
country.
	   Since they took up arms Aug. 2, the rebels have advanced to more
than a third of Congo. Ngoma said his forces, backed up by troops
and arms from Rwanda and Uganda, were advancing on the diamond city
of Mbuji-Mayi in Eastern Kasai, Katanga's regional capital of
Lubumbashi and Equatoria Province in northern Congo.

Election winners claim five more seats in repeat balloting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The conservative coalition that won in
Macedonia's parliamentary elections last month claimed Monday to
have clinched five more seats in this weekend's repeat balloting _
enough to give it the outright majority.
	   Basing it's claim on unofficial results released Monday, the
center-right coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Alternative
said it now had a total of 63 in the 120-seat assembly.
	   Balloting was repeated Sunday in seven constituencies where
minor irregularities occurred in the previous two rounds.
	   The coalition had secured 58 seats in those two rounds and was
already assured of leading Macedonia's next government.
	   The incumbent ruling party of ex-Communists claimed two more
seats according to Monday's unofficial results of the repeat
ballot, putting them at 27 seats. A coalition of ethnic Albanian
parties remained at 23 seats, and another six seats went to three
smaller parties.
	   Under the country's constitution, Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov has 10 days to name the premier from the ranks of the
largest party in parliament.
	   He will likely propose Ljupco Georgijevski, the leader of the
winning center-right coalition. Georgijevski is expected to include
some ethnic Albanians in any future Cabinet in hopes of lessening
ethnic tensions.
	   Ethnic Albanians form nearly a quarter of Macedonia's 2.2
million population. With secessionist Kosovo Albanians in
neighboring Serbia fighting for independence, there is concern the
conflict could fuel separatist sentiment among Albanians in
Macedonia, too.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia which, together with Montenegro,
makes up Yugoslavia.
	   On Sunday, Yugoslav authorities warned Macedonia not to allow
deployment of NATO troops on its territory that could be used to
intervene in Kosovo.
	   Part of the NATO monitoring mission for Kosovo _ aircraft for
surveillance and accompanying personnel _ is being formed in
Macedonia, and there are plans to station a rapid reaction force
here as backup security for ground monitors in Kosovo.
	   Both the outgoing and incoming governments place importance on
having good relations with NATO and Yugoslavia _ a delicate
balancing act considering Western condemnation of Serbia's harsh
crackdown on its ethnic Albanian separatists.

Lamar Alexander meets Russian presidential hopefuls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lamar Alexander, a likely Republican presidential
hopeful in the U.S. election in 2000, met with Russia's likely
presidential candidates this week in an effort to raise his foreign
policy profile.
	   Alexander has been U.S. Secretary of Education, Tennessee
governor and University of Tennessee president. But his resume is
light on foreign affairs.
	   During Alexander's three-day stay in the Russian capital, he has
met with prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky; Alexander
Lebed, former general and governor of a vast Siberian region;
former deputy premier Boris Nemtsov, and former Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   The four Russian politicians are expected to run in the nation's
2000 presidential election, when President Boris Yeltsin's second,
and final, term expires _ though none has formally announced his
candidacy.
	   ``Being in Moscow is like being in Iowa, which is the first
(Republican) caucus in the U.S. presidential contest,'' Alexander
told reporters Monday.
	   ``Almost everybody I've met in Moscow is running for president
and talking about raising money.''
	   Alexander refused to say who of the Russians specifically
mentioned an intention to run.
	   Peter Hannaford, a Washington, D.C.-based GOP consultant who is
helping Alexander in a likely presidential bid, said the tour of
Russia and Europe was intended to raise his profile in foreign
affairs.
	   Alexander planned to travel to Germany, England and France after
he leaves Moscow on Tuesday.

Russia's Gazprom to send two satellites into orbit next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will launch two satellites early next year
for the gas monopoly Gazprom to use in prospecting and monitoring
gas pipelines, a news report said Monday.
	   The Yamal-100 satellites are undergoing final tests and will be
sent to the Baikonur launching pad in Kazakstan in December,
Nikolai Sevostyanov, director of the Gazprom subsidiary Gazkom, was
quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as saying. They will be
launched in early 1999.
	   The satellites' broadcasting system will help Gazprom prospect
for new gas fields, develop fields and monitor existing pipelines,
Sevostyanov said.
	   The report gave no estimate of the cost of the project.

U.S. diplomat to press Milosevic over Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Milosevic's statement after the talks,
ethnic Albanians rejecting negotiations. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned over the safety of peace
verifiers in Kosovo after a reported intimidation attempt, an
American diplomat pressed the Yugoslav president Monday to honor a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province.
	   Faced with NATO intervention, President Slobodan Milosevic on
Oct. 12 agreed to pull out his security forces, end a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow
2,000 international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   William Walker, the head of the verification mission, met
Milosevic in Serbia's capital, Belgrade. Walker was due to speak to
reporters on the talks later Monday when he returns to the southern
province in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   ``Yugoslavia sticks to the agreement,'' Milosevic said in a
statement after the talks, and suggested that any post-agreement
violence was the fault of ethnic Albanian militants. ``The
international community should exert firm and unambiguous pressure
... to stop terrorist provocations of bandit groups intended to
jeopardize the peace process in Kosovo.''
	   The meeting came as ethnic Albanian officials in Kosovo rejected
a new Serb initiative for long-sought direct talks.
	   Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, denounced the latest Serbian initiative for the talks as a
``propaganda'' move, and said any such negotiations must be held
under U.S. and European mediation.
	   Scattered violence continued Monday in Kosovo.
	   Two ethnic Albanian women were wounded by Serb police on a road
about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Pristina, the Kosovo
Information Center, close to the province's Albanian leadership,
reported.
	   The two were shot when police opened fire at a car that refused
to halt for police, said the center.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Lapastica police station was
attacked by ethnic Albanian ``extremists'' and that police returned
fire. The Serb report stated no injuries.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed and it was not
clear whether the shootings were related.
	   Serb police and ethnic Albanian rebels also exchanged gunfire
Monday near Dulje. No one was injured, Serb sources said.
	   Earlier in the morning, a Serb police station in the town of
Orahovac in central Kosovo was attacked, and a car in front of it
was riddled with bullets, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.

Man convicted of IRA bomb attack was falsely accused, say his

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The man convicted of one of the Irish Republican
Army's most notorious bombings was falsely accused at his trial of
building the device that killed four British soldiers, his lawyers
said at the start of his appeal Monday.
	   Danny McNamee, who was convicted of making a car bomb that
detonated in London's Hyde Park in 1982, was freed earlier this
month as part of Northern Ireland's peace accord. He had served 12
years of a 25-year sentence.
	   The explosion killed four members of the British army's Blues
and Royal ceremonial cavalry, along with seven of their horses, and
wounded 17 bystanders.
	   Although described in his 1987 trial as the IRA's top explosives
engineer, McNamee had always protested he did not make the bomb.
	   ''We say it was known to be a false picture by the prosecuting
authorities at the time,'' Michael Mansfield, McNamee's lawyer,
told three Appeal Court judges Monday as McNamee, 38, listened
intently.
	   The hearing, which continues on Tuesday, is expected to last two
weeks.
	   Two hours after the Hyde Park explosion, a second bomb in nearby
Regents Park claimed the lives of six musicians from the Royal
Green Jackets regiment. McNamee was not charged with that bombing.
	   McNamee lost a 1991 appeal against his conviction and sentence.
But his case was referred back to the Appeal Court by the Criminal
Cases Review Commission, a state body that reviews disputed
judgments.
	   Mansfield said the prosecution's case that McNamee was the
''master builder'' of the Hyde Park bomb was ''deeply flawed from
the beginning.''
	   The jury had not heard evidence that convicted IRA bomb-maker
Desmond Ellis was a ''significant source'' of fingerprints found on
devices used in the case against McNamee, Mansfield said.
	   The prosecution built much of its case on the fact that
McNamee's fingerprints were found on two pieces of tape found in
arms caches in 1983 and 1984 and on a battery used in a power unit
detonated by police bomb experts in 1983.
	   But Mansfield said McNamee made these fingerprints during
routine activities in the electronics factory where he worked.

Leftist rebels free German held hostage five months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A German rancher held hostage five
months by leftist rebels was freed last weekend after humanitarian
pleas by an Ecuadorian bishop of German descent, authorities
confirmed Monday.
	   Rene Peter Moeller was released Saturday by rebels of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest
guerrilla group, in Carmen de Bolivar, a town 340 miles (550
kilometers) north of Bogota in Bolivar state.
	   Authorities said Moeller, a rancher married to a Colombian
woman, was in poor health, but gave no further details on his
condition.
	   Helping to obtain his release was German-born Bishop Emilio
Stehle, a spokesman for the government's anti-kidnapping office
told The Associated Press. Based in Ecuador, Stehle has played a
prominent role in peace discussions between the civilian leaders
and Colombia's other leading rebel group, the National Liberation
Army.
	   Neither the anti-kidnapping office or the German embassy in
Bogota would confirm press reports that the FARC rebels were paid a
dlrs 316,000 ransom for Moeller's release.
	   The world leader in kidnappings, Colombia had 1,122 abductions
through October this year, according to government figures.
	   Most of the crimes are carried out by the two rebel groups, who
frequently nab their victims at roadblocks on rural highways.
Foreigners are often the targets, since they tend to fetch the
highest ransoms.

Scientists launch airborne mission to study Leonid meteor shower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   From ancient Chinese emperors to crooner Perry Como, stargazers
have dreamed of the day they could catch a ``falling star.''
	   Physicist Steve Butow isn't just dreaming. He is dispatching a
pair of aircraft filled with scientific instruments to examine the
Leonid meteor storm as it pelts Earth's atmosphere with fiery
debris.
	   The celestial fireworks are expected to peak Tuesday and
Wednesday, as Earth passes through the long tail of Comet
Temple-Tuttle.
	   This close encounter is the chance of Butow's lifetime, but it
poses a threat as well. Incoming particles could damage some of the
500 satellites orbiting 22,000 miles (35,500 kms) above Earth or
generate electromagnetic pulses that knock out the satellites'
computer brains.
	   Such satellites supply the world with everything from weather
data and TV signals to military intelligence.
	   ``There has not been a meteor storm since the onset of the space
age,'' said Peter Brown, an astrophysicist who will help monitor
the shower. ``All the data we collect will be used to protect
satellites.''
	   The show is nicknamed the Leonids because ancient observers
thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo. It occurs
every November, usually with little fanfare.
	   But every 33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar
system and sheds swarms of particles as it nears the Sun. Earth
plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its own path
around the Sun, and the planet's strong gravitational force grabs
the particles.
	   The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowing
contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids, sizzling through the sky.
The word meteor _ coined by the ancient Greeks _ describes the
flash of light in the heavens.
	   Astronomers predict that the Leonids will peak after midnight
over Asia and the western Pacific. In the United States, the shower
will peak after midday when viewing is poor.
	   To guarantee an unobstructed view, Butow and his scientific
partners plan to fly high above the clouds, industrial haze and the
glare of city lights. ``We want to remove weather as a factor,'' he
said. ``The sky should be nice and black up there.''
	   One aircraft, an L-188C Electra operated by the National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, has been
island-hopping across the Pacific to Okinawa, Japan. The
four-engine turboprop was to arrive Sunday at U.S. military base.
The second aircraft, an Air Force KC-135, was to join it there.
	   NASA and other agencies are funding the dlrs 870,000 mission.
Scientists hope to identify the most energetic of the iron-rich
meteoroids and how their composition contributes to their
brightness.
	   ``We know very little about iron in the atmosphere, and even
less about the contribution from meteors,'' said NCAR project
manager Bruce Morley. ``Observing just one meteor accurately from
the sky would make a big difference in our understanding.''
	   That understanding would extend far beyond milder meteor
showers, about once a month, or more intense meteor storms, which
are rare.
	   It also might help to explain the origins of life on Earth. The
planet was formed more than 4 billion years ago from a swirling
disc of gases and debris that contained organic materials.
	   Similar materials still hitch rides to Earth aboard debris that
crosses Earth's path, by some estimates as much as 100 tons per
day. Meteoroids contain iron, nickel and silica.
	   ``After billions of years, it would add up,'' Butow said.
	   Other researchers say that better meteor research can be
conducted from the ground, at a fraction of the cost of keeping
aircraft aloft.
	   Canadian astrophysicists led by Brown will manage another set of
Leonid observations from Mongolia's Gobi Desert, Australia's north
coast and other dry, remote locations.
	   Brown, of Western Ontario University, said airborne vibrations
cause big problems when you're trying to measure a meteorite's
angle to an accuracy within hundredths of a degree.
	   ``Jiggling around on an airplane really complicates the
analysis,'' he said. ``The interpretation of airborne data will be
a lot more controversial.''
	   The previous Leonids display in early 1966 peaked at 150,000
meteors each hour. This year's celestial fireworks are expected to
be less intense.
	   Most particles are smaller than peas. But they zing into the
atmosphere at 160,000 mph (257,500 kph). At that speed, even a
grain of salt carries the wallop of a .22-caliber bullet. And the
friction of the atmosphere heats them to 3,600 degrees (1,982 C).
	   The NASA group will study the particles with the latest laser
instruments and high-definition television cameras.
	   NCAR's Electra will cruise back and forth along a north-south
route at 25,000 feet (7,600 meters). The faster Air Force plane
will circle the Electra in a racetrack pattern at 35,000 feet
(10,600 meters).
	   Using two aircraft should yield stereoscopic observations of the
storm with a variety of instruments.
	   The Electra carries a dual-beam lidar, or laser-based radar. Its
near-ultraviolet beams will excite iron molecules as they vaporize
from the meteoroids, and their fluorescence will be measured.
	   ``In 1966, most people didn't see the meteor storm because of
bad weather,'' Butow said. ``There were instruments set up all over
the world, but very little data were collected.''
	   In contrast, the focus of the ground-based study is to improve
meteor storm forecasts by studying the paths that meteoroids trace,
and how the particles behave in a stream through space.

Russia prepares launch of first international station component
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in first 2 grafs that Zarya will form energy core of
station, that launch has been delayed a year, sted months; ADDS
background in 8th graf; CORRECTS in last graf that first crew
expected no sooner than 2000. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a year's delay, the first component of a
multibillion dollar international space station was placed on a
launch pad in central Kazakstan on Monday in preparation for
liftoff later this week.
	   The Zarya cargo module has been loaded with equipment,
disinfected, tested for air-tightness and filled with 4.5 metric
tons (5 tons) of fuel, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The
Zarya is the heart of the project, and will propel the station and
pump energy to components added later.
	   It is the first piece of the ambitious International Space
Station, which has suffered periodic delays because Russia's cash
shortages have frequently prevented it from meeting production
deadlines.
	   The Zarya will be put into orbit about 160 kilometers (100
miles) above Earth by a Russian Proton booster rocket. From there,
Zarya will be propelled to a higher orbit by its own engines, which
are to be controlled from the ground, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The final orbit will pass 500 kilometers (310 miles) above Earth
at its highest point, and 350 kilometers (217 miles) above Earth at
the lowest, the report said.
	   During the next three days, engineers at the Baikonur
cosmodrome, which Russia rents from the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan, will connect all the necessary cables between Zarya and
the Proton booster.
	   An international commission of experts on Thursday will ensure
the module is ready for launching, set for 9:40 a.m. Moscow time
(6:40 GMT) on Friday.
	   The space station will not be inhabitable until a service module
where the astronauts will live and life-support systems are
launched and attached to the Zarya. NASA has provided dlrs 60
million to ensure the service module is launched next summer.
	   The Zarya, with a design based on modules of older Soviet space
stations, cost dlrs 200 million, ITAR-Tass has said. The module can
stay in flight for 430 days without refueling, it said.
	   NASA is scheduled to launch a module of its own to link up with
the Zarya in December. The first crews are not expected on the
space station until January 2000 at the earliest.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vowing not to bow to pressure from Turkey, Italy's
premier said Monday it is up to the courts to decide on the
extradition of a top Kurdish rebel leader jailed in Rome.
	   ``Italy won't give in to threats, pressure or conditions of any
sort,'' said Premier Massimo D'Alema. ``Italy is a democratic
country that cannot be blackmailed by anyone.''
	   Rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is considered a terrorist by Turkey
and its most wanted fugitive and Ankara has been blunt in demanding
his return.
	   ``We strongly demand the extradition of a person who has killed
tens of thousands of people,'' Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said in a separate news conference in Rome. ``A terrorist should be
treated like a terrorist.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, which has been
fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has claimed an estimated 37,000 lives. He was arrested
last week at Rome's international airport when he arrived on a
flight from Moscow.
	   It appears unlikely that a court could rule in favor of his
extradition because Turkey is trying him in absentia for capital
crimes. In a landmark ruling two years ago, the Constitutional
Court said ``under no hypothesis and for no type of crime'' can
Italy extradite someone to a country where they could be executed.
	   Hoping to find a safe haven, Ocalan has asked the Italian
government for political asylum.
	   D'Alema on Monday ruled out a third option: deportation to a
third country. He said Ocalan would either be granted asylum or
extradited.
	   ``It would be easier to grant asylum to one who speaks out
against violence and terrorism,'' the premier said.
	   The Kurdish cause has support in leftist circles in Italy and
Ocalan has said he was encouraged by ``friends'' in parliament to
seek asylum.
	   As if in answer to D'Alema, Ocalan issued a statement Monday
saying he was ``ready to do my part to stop terrorism.'' He said he
had come to Italy ``to open this avenue, to build the conditions
for a political solution'' to the Kurdish conflict.
	   Kurds throughout Europe are demonstrating to show their
solidarity with Ocalan and thousands have come to Rome in his
support. About 2,000 are on hunger strike outside the military
hospital in Rome where he is believed to be held.
	   Cem met Monday with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who
later stressed Italy's concern for one of its citizens taken
hostage in a Turkish prison by inmates demanding Ocalan's
extradition. D'Alema also stressed Italy's concern.
	   Cem told reporters that the Turkish government had nothing to do
with the kidnapping.
	   ``It's a worry for us too,'' he said. ``It was the wrong thing
to do, but it wasn't a government initiative.''
	   In Turkey, the country's top business leaders threatened Monday
to boycott Italian goods unless Ocalan is extradited. The Turkish
defense minister over the weekend suggested Italian firms would be
barred from defense contracts.
	   In a sign of Ankara's eagerness to get Ocalan back, the justice
minister on Monday submitted a draft bill abolishing the death
penalty in Turkey. Turkey hasn't executed anyone since 1984.

Wife of Saddam's half-brother dies, officials say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of notice, background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The wife of the half-brother of Saddam Hussein has
died in Switzerland, officials said Monday.
	   An official of the Iraqi embassy said he understood Ahlam
al-Tikriti died last week. She was 44. A death notice signed by her
husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, dated Sunday, appeared in Monday
editions of the London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi.
	   A spokeswoman for a suburban hospital confirmed that she died,
but declined to give the cause or say when. Mrs. al-Tikriti had
reportedly been under treatment for breast cancer.
	   The death is expected to complicate the situation of her
husband, Barzan al-Tikriti, who last summer was ordered to return
to Baghdad in a sweeping change of diplomatic posts.
	   He reportedly has cited his wife's illness and treatment as
reasons for his staying in Geneva, but has denied having any desire
to join the Iraqi opposition.
	   Earlier this month Iraqi dissidents said a cousin of Saddam
failed to convince al-Tikriti to return home instead of going into
exile.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46,headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations in
Geneva for 10 years.
	   He was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled
to Baghdad over the summer.
	   Last month, Saddam's cousin, Gen. Mizahem Saab al-Hassan, met
with al-Tikriti in Geneva and conveyed a message that his decision
to go into exile is harming the Iraqi regime's image, said the
dissidents.
	   Mrs. al-Tikriti was also the half-sister of Saddam's first wife,
Sajida, who is the mother of Odai and Qusai, Saddam's two powerful
sons.
	   Odai divorced al-Tikriti's daughter Saja in 1995 after she
started complaining of mistreatment and beating sparking a sharp
division in the family.
	   The family rapture was further deepened when Odai shot and
wounded al-Tikriti's brother Watban after a feud over the divorce
and family business.
	   In his death notice al-Tikriti did not say when his wife will be
buried but sources in Baghdad said the Iraqi government was not
notified about any plans to send the coffin to Iraq.
	   The announcement that he will receive condolences in Geneva is
an indicator that al-Tikriti does not plan to fly home for a
funeral.
	   The address given is that of the Iraqi ambassador's residence,
although diplomatic sources say he has already moved out.
	   The Swiss government says al-Tikriti has until the end of
November to leave Geneva under Swiss laws allowing U.N. diplomats
to stay on for three months after the end of their tenure.
	   Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti is survived by six
children, ranging in age from 11 to 26.

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Germany will not give Russia any emergency
financial aid outside the money it's providing through
international lenders, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told Russian
leaders in Moscow on Monday.
	   ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for additional German aid,
Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5 tons (1.65 short tons) of
medicine aid with him, German officials said.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, met
with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday, and both
pledged to ensure that Russian-German relations would continue to
flourish. Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which helped secure significant
German investment and aid in Russia.
	   Primakov said the relationship with Germany was a ``priority''
for Russia.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said at the
start of the meeting. ``Naturally, we would like to learn more
about your experience.''
	   Primakov also said Russia was eager to attract foreign capital
and would guarantee investor security, Schroeder told reporters.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan presented this
weekend a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders to
resume aid. He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend that
the IMF release the money.
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have offered aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder met other Russian politicians at the German
ambassador's residence later Monday, and is to confer with
President Boris Yeltsin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.
	   Schroeder said he was looking forward to meeting with Yeltsin,
but stressed that the relationship between Germany and Russia must
not rely too much on personal ties. Kohl has been attacked by
critics who saw Yeltsin as part of Russia's problems.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who also met with Schroeder
on Monday, shrugged off the influx of German money that made
Germany Russia's most important trading partner outside the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``The relations between former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin were a mere camaraderie. Now I am
counting on good business contacts and mutual understanding,''
Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Schroeder praised Russia's influence with Iraq in helping to
avoid new crises in the Gulf. Schroeder also discussed the
situation in Kosovo and NATO expansion, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed U.S. and NATO threats to use force
in Iraq and Kosovo, and protests NATO's intention to incorporate
former Soviet allies in Central and Eastern Europe.
	   During his visit, Schroeder will also meet with speakers of both
chambers of the Russian parliament, take a stroll on Moscow's Red
Square and take part in a meeting with Russian college students.

Netanyahu suspends West Bank pullback over Arafat statements

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In yet another blow to the Mideast peace
accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended a West Bank
troop pullback Monday and demanded that Yasser Arafat retract
threats to use force to bring about a Palestinian state.
	   Palestinian officials countered that Israel was making just as
many inflammatory remarks and accused Netanyahu of inventing
excuses to avoid carrying out the agreement.
	   The escalating tensions came on the same day Israel was to begin
pulling its troops out of West Bank areas and crippled U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross' efforts to get the crisis-plagued Wye River accord off
the ground.
	   Netanyahu said the suspension was a result of remarks made by
Arafat Sunday to supporters in which the Palestinian leader said
that he would declare a Palestinian state in May and that ``our
rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,'' a
defiant Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament convened to debate
the new peace accord. A vote in favor of the deal is expected
Tuesday.
	   Since the two leaders signed the agreement at the White House
Oct. 23rd, there has been no end to public finger-pointing, fiery
rhetoric and delays.
	   ``If we were to suspend our actions in response to statements we
hear from the other side, then the agreement would have never been
launched off the ground,'' said Palestinian minister Nabil Shaath.
	   Pointing to a call Sunday by Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon for Jewish settlers to seize as much occupied West Bank land
as they could before the sides come to a final settlement, Shaath
said, ``we constantly hear outrageous statements from Mr. Netanyahu
and members of his Cabinet and we did not stop the implementation
of the Wye memorandum.''
	   Netanyahu did not say when the troop redeployment would begin.
In comments directed towards his hard-line critics, Netanyahu said
that he had not budged from one inch of land when he thought Arafat
was not fulfilling commitments. His Cabinet was to convene
Wednesday to discuss Palestinian obligations under the accord
including a halt to incitement.
	   Towing a hard-line after a stormy Knesset session, the Israeli
premier said he would not accept Arafat's threats.
	   ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence with
rifles? If we do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division of
Jerusalem, they will use those rifles against us?'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two. ``There cannot be such dictates.''
	   Trying to diffuse the storm, U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker said
the U.S. had expected a bumpy road in the accord.
	   ``There's a lot of emotion involved. It's not easy...but the
intention, I believe, is basically sound.'' Ross was to meet later
with Arafat in the West Bank city of Jericho and some negotiating
committees were still scheduled to meet Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and has said he would
annex large chunks of the West Bank if Arafat made good on threats
to unilaterally declare independence next May.
	   The latest agreement does not specifically refer to a possible
declaration of statehood, but urges both sides to refrain from
unilateral actions.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton had reached a verbal understanding during
last month's Mideast summit that if little progress was made in
final-status talks by May, the United States would not oppose a
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   Meanwhile, some 30 Jewish settlers set up two mobile homes on a
remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of Kedumim on
Monday.
	   Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct
response to Sharon's comments. ``We understood that the attitude of
the Israeli government is that he who holds the land determines
policy and we are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio.
	   Israel radio said police later ordered the settlers to leave.

Britain to collaborate with other donors to reduce poverty in
</HEADLINE>
Nepal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ After three decades of economic
assistance, Britain acknowledged Monday it had failed to accomplish
what it set out to do in this impoverished Himalayan kingdom.
	   ``We need a new partnership between government, donors and civil
society if we are to bring about real changes,'' visiting British
Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short, told
reporters in the Nepalese capital.
	   Short said the British government would open an office in Nepal
early next year so that ``we can do our job better and work
collaboratively with other donor agencies to systematically reduce
poverty in Nepal.''
	   Britain is one of Nepal's major donor countries. It provides
Katmandu 17 million pounds (dlrs 28.7 million) each year to
implement poverty eradication projects in the country.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Reacting to apparent intimidation by
Yugoslav forces, the head of monitors checking compliance with U.N.
demands in Kosovo said Monday he expressed his concern to President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   William Walker, the American who leads what eventually will be
2,000 unarmed civilian observers that will spread out throughout
the southern province of Serbia, met Milosevic and other officials
for 90 minutes.
	   He also told the Yugoslav president that the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe overseeing the Kosovo
Verification Mission, can't ``tolerate any intimidation from either
side of our verifiers.''
	   Walker said he was sent to see Milosevic by the president of the
OSCE ``to express our concern with the perception that security in
Kosovo has deteriorated. I was asking the president to do
everything he could to curtail that tit-for-tat violence.''
	   He seemed to back down from statements Sunday that a Yugoslav
army convoy fired weapons over the vehicle of a verifier team. He
said that went beyond what he actually knew.
	   ``Our people heard noises and thought they saw flashes from
muzzles,'' he said. The Yugoslavs claim the noises the verifiers
heard were three vehicle backfires.
	   ``I did not say we have accepted that story,'' Walker told
reporters, adding circumstances of the incident were being looked
into. He said what the team does know for sure is that the turret
of a Yugoslav army vehicle turned and pointed at the verifiers.
	   ``That in itself is unacceptable,'' Walker said. ``We do want
not weapons pointed at our vehicles and our verifiers.''
	   Asked if the Serbs are in compliance with the agreement signed
with American negotiator Richard Holbrooke, Walker said: ``We have
a difference of opinion on the question of full compliance,''
adding that there may be a ``difference of interpretation.''
	   Faced with NATO intervention, Milosevic on Oct. 12 agreed to
reduce his security forces of in Kosovo _ part of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic _ end a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a mission of
international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   ``Yugoslavia sticks to the agreement,'' Milosevic said in a
statement after the talks, and suggested that any post-agreement
violence was the fault of radical Albanians. ``The international
community should exert firm and unambiguous pressure ... to stop
terrorist provocations of bandit groups intended to jeopardize the
peace process in Kosovo.''
	   The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into sharp focus
Sunday with the monitors initially complaining that a Yugoslav army
vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun rounds over a car containing
U.S. diplomatic observers in central Kosovo.
	   Walker's meeting with Milosevic came as ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo rejected the new initiative by Serbian
authorities for long-sought direct talks.
	   Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, denounced the latest Serbian initiative for the talks as a
``propaganda'' move, and said any such negotiations must be held
under U.S. and European mediation.
	   President Milan Milutinovic had proposed over the weekend to
chair face-to-face talks with the ethnic Albanians in Pristina on
Wednesday, with international officials in attendance as guests but
not as active mediators.
	   Mustafa argued Kosovo ``cannot be treated as Serbia's internal
matter'' _ as Serbian officials are trying to do by excluding
foreign mediators _ since the majority ethnic Albanians are
demanding outright secession.
	   Three violent incidents were reported in Kosovo Monday, and the
Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic Albanian
leadership, reported two ethnic Albanian women wounded in one of
them. The center said the two were wounded by Serb police on a road
about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Pristina.
	   Serb sources reported bouts of shooting by Albanian radicals,
but no casualties.

Police: Attack on Philips president's wife was payback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Justice authorities Monday
described a brutal attack on the wife of Royal Philips Electronics'
president as a ``deliberate payback.''
	   Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, the wife of Philips chief Cor
Boonstra, was found Friday severely injured, handcuffed and dumped
next to a road in the coastal town of Hoek van Holland, about 70
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Amsterdam.
	   ``I can't say why, but there are indications that this was a
deliberate payback,'' said Carola de Kimpe of the Rotterdam Public
Prosecutor's office.
	   She remained in critical condition Monday. De Kimpe declined to
comment on her condition, but Dutch media said she suffered from
serious head injuries and a broken arm.
	   De Kimpe added that police have no suspects in the case and
there was no demand for a ransom.
	   It was not clear whether the attack was directed at
Boonstra-Raatjes personally, or at Philips.
	   Spokesman Ben Geerts of Philips, which is Europe's largest
consumer electronics group, declined to comment on the attack.

Guerrillas kill three Israelis in bomb blast

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three Israelis killed, four wounded &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb in southern Lebanon Monday, killing three Israeli
soldiers and wounding four, security officials said.
	   The bomb was set off by remote control as an Israeli infantry
patrol passed between the villages of Houla and Markaba.
	   The area is three kilometers (1.8 miles) west of the Lebanese
border with Israel, and some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of
Marjayoun, the main town in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the deaths and
said that two of the soldiers were seriously wounded. The Israeli
military said the soldiers were on their way to a weapons-firing
drill.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the midday blast. Six hours earlier, Israeli
warplanes raided suspected guerrilla bases in the south in the
eighth attack in as many days, the Lebanese security officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied
zone, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area in Sojod, which was
also attacked on Saturday.
	   The jets returned 15 minutes later and fired two more missiles
at Jabal al-Rafih, also in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raids on
the mountainous area, 10 kilometers (six miles) northwest of
Marjayoun.
	   Monday's air strike came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas fired
rockets and mortars at Israeli positions in southern Lebanon along
the border with the Jewish state as well as outposts of the South
Lebanon Army militia, which is armed and financed by Israel.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that the attacks were in response
to the continuing Israeli air raids on South Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes have raided suspected Hezbollah bases mainly
in Iqlim al-Tuffah daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted
in casualties.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 allied militiamen from the occupied zone
that Israel carved out in in 1985 to protect against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

Election observers laud polls in Burkina Faso
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A panel of independent monitors
on Monday said presidential elections in Burkina Faso over the
weekend were free from tampering or other irregularities.
	   ``The conditions for the elections were good,'' French election
observer Alain Terrenoire told reporters in the capital Burkina
Faso. ``There was calm and patience on the part of voters.''
	   Terrenoire and eight other observers from European Union member
states visited 50 polling stations during the voting, he said.
	   Results from the weekend election have not yet been tallied, but
are expected to be announced sometime this week.
	   With most genuine opposition candidates boycotting the vote,
incumbent President Blaise Compaore is expected to win by a large
margin.
	   A second local group of election monitors, the National
Independent Observers Group, also said the voting was open and
fair, but noted a few abnormalities.
	   ``The process was relatively satisfactory,'' said the group's
spokesman, Eduard Ouadreago. ``In some outlying areas we saw
unacceptable practices.''
	   In some cases, he said, voters were allowed to cast their
ballots despite having no identification.
	   Both monitoring groups said voter turnout appeared to be much
higher than in the previous presidential seven years ago, when only
about 26 percent of the eligible electorate participated.
	   Figures for the total number of votes cast has not yet been
released.
	   Opposition parties had hoped to derail the vote by calling for a
boycott of the polls.
	   Critics maintain that Compaore manipulated the election in his
favor. His only contenders were seen as his supporters and not
genuine candidates.
	   Compaore took power in a military coup in 1987 and later
transformed his leadership into a civilian administration through
the 1991 elections.

Convicted spy appeals to stop release of Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Attorneys for Jonathan Pollard, an American
convicted of spying for Israel, appealed to the Israeli Supreme
Court Monday to prevent Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners
until his release is assured.
	   Pollard was arrested by the FBI outside the Israeli embassy in
Washington in 1985. He was convicted of turning over secret
documents to Israel while serving as a naval intelligence officer.
He is serving a life sentence in a North Carolina prison.
	   His case was highlighted recently when Israel tried to pin its
agreement to a U.S.-brokered peace accord with the Palestinians, on
Pollard's release. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would review
Pollard's case.
	   Pollard's wife Esther, who filed the appeal Monday, said under
the peace deal, Israel was to get Pollard, who has been granted
Israeli citizenship, in exchange for its release of 750 Palestinian
prisoners and the dropping of an extradition demand against the
chief of the Palestinian police.
	   ``Clinton made his promise to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu and Netanyahu made his promise to us,'' she told The
Associated Press. She complained that the U.S. did not keep its
part of the bargain while Israel is expected to release Palestinian
prisoners.
	   A hearing on the appeal is set for Tuesday.

Protesters hurl eggs, tomatoes during uprising ceremony

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Self-proclaimed anarchists pelted Greece's
premier and education minister with eggs and tomatoes Monday during
a ceremony to mark a 1973 student uprising against military rulers.
	   An office belonging to former Public Order Minister Sifis
Valirakis was later firebombed in central Athens. Four people
working inside the second floor apartment were not injured.
	   Premier Costas Simitis and Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis
hastily left the ceremony after placing wreaths outside the Athens
Polytechnic, where as many as 37 students died in clashes with
soldiers and police on Nov. 17, 1973.
	   Police said the attack against Valirakis' office was carried out
using three camping gas canisters soaked in gasoline. Although such
attacks have become commonplace in the capital, they usually
intensify during the anniversary of the polytechnic uprising.
	   A range of self-proclaimed leftist and anarchists groups have
carried out nearly 200 arson attacks against cars and offices this
year. Most have been aimed at diplomats, government officials and
offices, foreigners and journalists.
	   The polytechnic student rebellion was credited with helping
topple the 1967-74 military junta.
	   Arsenis reportedly received the worst of the bombardment by a
small group of demonstrators who claim to oppose all forms of
authority. Simitis' security guards shielded him with umbrellas.
	   Riots, including attacks on businesses and police, have often
followed the marches and memorials on the anniversary. Greece's
most deadly terrorist group, November 17, takes it name from the
day of the crackdown on the student revolt.

U.N. weapons inspectors and other U.N. staff returning to Iraq

workers, comments from deputy U.S. ambassador, British prime
minister, and spokesman for the secretary-general; edits to trim &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors have been ordered
back to Iraq after the U.N. Security Council told Baghdad to keep
its pledge to cooperate fully with the search for weapons of mass
destruction.
	   After a simmering three-month showdown over inspections that
nearly resulted in U.S. airstrikes, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan warned Iraq on Sunday that in a future crisis, military force
might be the only way out.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, stressing this point, told
the House of Commons in London on Monday that if Iraq does not
comply, ``there will be no warning whatsoever.''
	   At the United Nations, Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh
said the United States hopes Iraq has ``turned over a new leaf''
and will be waiting to see if it keeps its promise to cooperate
with the inspectors.
	   ``We'll only know that by facts on the ground in the coming
days,'' he said.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, was expected to resume work on Wednesday.
	   He said 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Agency would return to Iraq on Tuesday from Bahrain, and six
other UNSCOM members would follow on Wednesday.
	   Thirty U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated last week because of
the threat of U.S. military action flew back to Baghdad on Monday
from Amman, Jordan, Eckhard said.
	   A second group of 100 humanitarian staff were scheduled to
arrive in Baghdad late Monday night, and the remaining staff in
Amman were expected to follow on Wednesday, he said.
	   Independent inspection agents who monitor the flow of relief aid
into Iraq on behalf of the United Nations also returned to three of
four border points Monday, Eckhard said. The agents were withdrawn
Friday because of the threat of airstrikes.
	   More than 130 trucks carrying wheat and other supplies were
stalled at the Turkish and Syrian borders over the weekend because
there were no inspection agents to certify their cargoes. Suppliers
can't be paid until they produce an inspection certificate.
	   But U.N. spokesman John Mills said the brief interruption would
not affect the flow of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people. The
United Nations allows Iraq to export limited quantities of oil to
pay for food, medical supplies and reparations from the 1991 Gulf
war.
	   With the weapons inspectors due back shortly, the key question
is whether Iraq will keep its pledge.
	   ``I cannot give you any guarantee that this agreement would
work,'' Annan said Sunday. ``I sincerely hope that there will not
be a next time because ... I'm not sure that if there is a next
time we would even have time for further diplomatic initiatives and
appeals,''
	   ``For the crisis to be put permanently behind us, Iraq must move
swiftly to ensure complete and unconditional compliance,'' he said.
	   At the end of its meeting Sunday, the Security Council issued a
statement noting Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with the
inspectors ``on an immediate, unconditional and unrestricted
basis.''
	   Annan thanked U.S. President Bill Clinton ``for the courageous
and difficult decision'' he took to accept Baghdad's promise that
it would allow unfettered inspections.
	   Burleigh told reporters Monday that the United States wants the
weapons inspectors to exercise ``the full extent of their mandate''
and seek whatever documents and access to sites they feel
necessary.
	   Burleigh said the United States views Iraq as a test case for
controlling the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons which it views as ``the threat of the future.''
	   ``And so from our point of view, it is extremely important that
this is successful,'' he said.
	   Once Annan has confirmed that Iraq is fully cooperating with
UNSCOM and the IAEA, council members reaffirmed their readiness to
proceed with a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   When asked Monday when the review would begin, Eckhard said:
``First let's see the inspectors get back to work, and then we'll
see how long it takes.''
	   Iraq halted U.N. inspections Oct. 31, saying it would only
resume cooperation if the council moved to lift sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   U.N. resolutions that ended the Gulf War, which was sparked by
Iraq's invasion, say sanctions can only be lifted after inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its banned weapons.

U.S. criticized for not allowing inspections of its chemical
</HEADLINE>
industry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The United States came under fire
Monday for not opening up its chemical industry _ the world's
largest _ to inspections by international weapons experts.
	   At a gathering of signature nations to the international
Chemical Weapons Convention, convention director Jose Mauricio
Bustani urged the United States ``to take whatever action is
necessary to achieve this goal soon.''
	   The global convention, which took effect in April 1997,
prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of chemical
weapons.
	   Under the treaty, chemical weapon production facilities, as well
as storage and destruction sites are all subject to inspections.
But industries producing so-called dual use chemicals, which can be
used for civil and military ends, must also open their doors to
inspectors.
	   While the United States has allowed inspections of government
facilities, checks of industry sites have been impossible due to
legislative difficulties, said Donato Kiniger-Passigli, the
spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, which oversees the treaty.
	   A U.S. official at the conference said the relevant legislation
has been enacted, clearing the way for eventual inspections.
Ambassador Ralph Earle II, the U.S. representative to the
conference, stressed that it will take some time before the
legislation will be up and running.
	   But he assured conference participants that the United States
``is continuing to seek various ways to accelerate this process.''
	   Kiniger-Passigli said now that the legislative hurdle is out of
the way, U.S. companies, like those in other signature states, will
need to declare their production of ``dual chemicals,'' which may
have potential warfare applications.
	   Once those declarations are filed, the Hague-based OPCW will
decide which companies to inspect.

Former defense minister urges Russia to scrap nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former Russian defense minister urged lawmakers
Monday to abandon the stalled START II treaty, which sharply
reduces Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals, calling it a
``treacherous'' document.
	   Igor Rodionov warned that Russia's economic troubles were
already eroding the military's strength, and reducing nuclear
weapons would leave Russia with few defenses left. Rodionov was
fired as defense minister last year for failing to radically trim
Russia's armed forces
	   Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, is revising
a bill that could pave the way for ratification of START II. The
treaty, signed by both countries in 1993 and ratified by the U.S.
Senate in 1996, would cut Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals in half
to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Rodionov, speaking to lawmakers in the Duma on Monday, said
Russia ``should not cater to NATO and the United States'' in
considering ratification.
	   ``It is a treacherous treaty that is strategically disarming
us,'' he said.
	   He called the situation in the Russian military ``catastrophic''
and blamed its problems on President Boris Yeltsin. Servicemen go
months without pay, training is minimal, and morale has plummeted
in recent years.
	   Yeltsin has long urged the ratification of START II, but the
Duma, dominated by Communists and nationalists, has repeatedly
delayed action.
	   Some Russian officials have indicated that the government hopes
ratification of the START II will improve Russia's prospects of
receiving international aid.

Belarus National Bank liberalizes currency market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-6 with black market rate and CORRECTS
official rates to 66,000 and 99,000 rubles to the dollar, sted 66
and 99. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Belarusian central bank eased rigid
currency controls in this former Soviet republic Monday, allowing
commercial banks to trade in foreign currency within a broader
band.
	   The move reflected a growing pressure on the national currency,
the Belarusian ruble, which has steadily lost value in recent
months as the government has liberally printed new cash.
	   The new rules set by the National Bank allow commercial banks to
set their exchange rates up to 50 percent higher or lower than the
official rate. Previously banks had to strictly adhere to the
official rate.
	   Belarus uses five different exchange rates for conversions
between its ruble and the U.S. dollar. World Bank officials have
said the lack of a single, objective rate has prevented the
accumulation of hard-currency reserves and inaccurately reflected
the country's health in trade and production.
	   The main official bank rate was 66,000 rubles to the U.S. dollar
on Monday. It immediately fell to 99,000 to the dollar _ the
maximum allowed under the new rules _ in street trading Monday.
	   This was still far below the black market rate, widely
considered the most accurate indicator of the worth of the
Belarusian currency, which hovered around 175,000 rubles to the
dollar Monday.
	   The new rules are a ``next step toward liberalization of the
currency market and the introduction of a single exchange rate,''
said Anatoly Drozdov, the National Bank spokesman.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, as President Alexander Lukashenko, an admirer of
Soviet policies, has preferred to keep most enterprises in
government hands.
	   The country was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a
dramatic slump in its currency prompting the government to order
strict price controls. That led to a boom in exports and to
frequent shortages of staple goods, including meat and dairy
products, within Belarus.
	   A World Bank delegation on a trip to Belarus earlier this month
criticized the country for its failure to abide by an agreement to
introduce a single exchange rate.
	   The World Bank also urged Belarus to limit money printing, stop
providing money to bail out unprofitable factories, speed up
privatization and liberalize the economy to attract investors.

DaimlerChrysler kicks off Day 1 early in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Schrempp quote &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With bells, parties and a blizzard of
publicity, the newly merged DaimlerChrysler comes into being
Tuesday when its stock begins trading on 19 financial markets
around the world.
	   A cocktail reception, live broadcasts to 250 locations in 62
countries, an array of promotional materials and a new advertising
campaign aimed at investors are part of the push for a high profile
``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic car company.
	   The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, and
Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, attended a reception at Frankfurt's
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New
York for the stock's debut on Wall Street.
	   ``Today is just the beginning,'' Eaton said. ``I think that when
you get this many excellent people _ the creative talents that we
have here _ you can continue to expect excellent things from this
company for decades to come.''
	   DaimlerChrysler starts out with a strong share of European and
North American markets, and Schrempp and Eaton emphasized their
goal of entering new markets, in Asia and Latin America.
	   Together, the two men will ring a bell at the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday morning, in a symbol of their cooperation. The
stock will have started trading hours earlier, however, starting in
Tokyo.
	   It begins trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange at 9 a.m.
(0800 GMT) Tuesday.
	   Eaton dismissed rumors of job cuts, saying ``exactly the
opposite'' was true. ``We expect to expand our presence in areas
where we not currently represented,'' he said. ``And I can assure
you that that will lead actually to jobs growth.''
	   The new DaimlerChrysler will become the world's fifth largest
car company in terms of vehicle sales. Schrempp, 54, and Eaton, 58,
will jointly lead the new company for three years. After that,
Schrempp is set to run it alone.
	   In addition to moving into new markets, DaimlerChrysler also
hopes to advance its non-automotive industries _ financial
information technology, telecommunications and aerospace, according
to promotional materials for the debut.
	   More immediately, the ambitious merger will test the ability of
the original two companies to blend their different cultures. To
help, DaimlerChrysler's 421,000 employees will get a quarterly
journal on how it's going; managers will get an extra page with
more details.
	   ``This merger is the result of hard work over the past half
year,'' Schremp said Monday night. ``Some of the decisions we had
to make were painful and not always popular.''

It's unanimous: Clemens wins record 5th Cy Young
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roger Clemens won his record fifth Cy Young
Award on Monday in a unanimous vote, receiving the American
League's pitching honor for the second straight year.
	   Clemens also was a unanimous selection in 1986 and won the award
in 1987 and 1991. The only other AL pitchers to get all first-place
votes were Ron Guidry in 1978 and Denny McLain in 1968.
	   The 36-year-old right-hander, who won his first three Cy Youngs
with Boston, went 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA for the Toronto Blue Jays,
striking out 271 in 234 2-3 innings. He went unbeaten in his final
22 starts, winning 15 decisions.
	   Clemens, who gets a dlrs 250,000 bonus for winning the award,
received all 28 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers'
Association of America.
	   Boston's Pedro Martinez was second with 20 seconds and five
thirds for 65 points, followed by David Wells of the New York
Yankees, who got four seconds and 19 thirds for 31 points. Yankees
teammate David Cone was fourth with four seconds and four thirds
for 16 points.
	   Clemens tied for the AL lead in wins and was tops in ERA and
strikeouts. In 1997, he joined Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Steve
Carlton as the only four-time Cy Young winners.
	   When Clemens won the award last year, he joked his mission was
complete.
	   ``I got one for Koby and Kory. I got one for Kasy, and I needed
one for Kody,'' said Clemens, reeling off the names of his
children. All are named with the later K, the slang term for a
strikeout.
	   On May 29, a repeat season seemed impossible. He was just 5-6,
but then went on a tear.
	   Clemens, who almost singlehandedly kept the Blue Jays in the
hunt for a playoff berth, has become frustrated as Toronto
executives waited for a budget from the team's owner, the Belgian
company Interbrew.
	   ``I'd like for someone to let me know which way the team is
going,'' Clemens said in a statement posted on his Web site last
week.
	   If not, he might push for a trade. He was interested in going to
the New York Yankees last summer, and the Red Sox might be
interested in getting him back. Boston general manager Dan Duquette
is still criticized for letting Clemens leave after the 1996
season.
	   The National League Cy Young Award will be announced Tuesday.

Judicial chief can skip traditional garb, House of Lords decides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mind if I slip into something more comfortable?
	   Most peers don't, it seems. Members of the House of Lords voted
by 145 to 115 on Monday in favor of allowing the Lord Chancellor,
head of Britain's judiciary, to attend debates wearing a normal
suit, instead of the traditional 17th century costume of tights,
breeches, wig and buckled shoes.
	   The Labor government's modernization drive sparked clashes with
traditionalists in Parliament's unelected upper chamber, who wanted
the Lord Chancellor, lawyer Lord Irvine, to continue donning the
costume his predecessors wore for the past three centuries.
	   Modernizers say Irvine should be allowed to be comfortable, and
last week he told a committee of lawmakers that he would rather
wear a normal suit and tie than sit for up to 14 hours at a time in
traditional gear.
	   ``The wig weighs an absolute ton. It is very uncomfortable,''
Irvine complained.
	   Irvine, a mentor of Prime Minister Tony Blair, will still wear
the 17th century apparel for ceremonies.
	   During a lively and sometimes emotional debate Monday,
traditionalists fought a strong campaign.
	   Doing away with the traditional attire ``is another example of
the government salami-slicing away at tradition,'' said Earl
Ferrers, an opposition Conservative Party peer.
	   He added that the ancient garb ``is a reminder to all of us, and
members of the general public, of the stature, dignity and indeed
the awe in which the office of Lord Chancellor is held.''
	   But Labor's Lord Strabolgi said peers should ``move with the
times in this more informal age.''
	   After the Labor Party wrested power from the Conservatives in
May 1997, Blair said he would keep his election pledge to modernize
Britain. Other reforms planned for the House of Lords include the
abolition of the voting rights of Britain's 759 hereditary peers.

Netanyahu suspends West Bank pullback over Arafat statements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat comments &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos GAZ101, JRL102, 111-112
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In yet another blow to the Mideast peace
accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended a West Bank
troop pullback Monday and demanded that Yasser Arafat retract
threats to use force to bring about a Palestinian state.
	   Palestinian officials countered that Israel was making just as
many inflammatory remarks and accused Netanyahu of inventing
excuses to avoid carrying out the agreement.
	   The escalating tensions came on the same day Israel was to begin
pulling its troops out of West Bank areas and crippled U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross' efforts to get the crisis-plagued Wye River accord off
the ground.
	   Netanyahu said the suspension was a result of remarks made by
Arafat Sunday to supporters in which the Palestinian leader said
that he would declare a Palestinian state in May and that ``our
rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,'' a
defiant Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament convened to debate
the new peace accord. A vote in favor of the deal is expected
Tuesday.
	   In response, Arafat called in reporters from The Associated
Press and Israel TV and said he was committed to the peace process
with Israel.
	   ``I would like to reiterate here that we are fully committed to
implementing precisely and accurately what was signed in the Wye
River memorandum. As far as we're concerned, our position remains
that peace is a strategic option and we will not shift course,''
Arafat said.
	   He did not relate directly to his statements from Sunday but
said ``Surely we will face difficulties when we negotiate ... the
issue of Jerusalem. As they say in English, where there's a will,
there's a way.'' Arafat spoke moments before he met with Ross.
	   Since the two leaders signed the agreement at the White House
Oct. 23rd, there has been no end to public finger-pointing, fiery
rhetoric and delays.
	   ``If we were to suspend our actions in response to statements we
hear from the other side, then the agreement would have never been
launched off the ground,'' said Palestinian minister Nabil Shaath.
	   Pointing to a call Sunday by Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon for Jewish settlers to seize as much occupied West Bank land
as they could before the sides come to a final settlement, Shaath
said, ``we constantly hear outrageous statements from Mr. Netanyahu
and members of his Cabinet and we did not stop the implementation
of the Wye memorandum.''
	   Netanyahu did not say when the troop redeployment would begin.
In comments directed towards his hard-line critics, Netanyahu said
that he had not budged from one inch of land when he thought Arafat
was not fulfilling commitments. His Cabinet was to convene
Wednesday to discuss Palestinian obligations under the accord
including a halt to incitement.
	   Towing a hard-line after a stormy Knesset session, the Israeli
premier said he would not accept Arafat's threats.
	   ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence with
rifles? If we do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division of
Jerusalem, they will use those rifles against us?'' he told Israel
TV's Channel Two. ``There cannot be such dictates.''
	   Trying to diffuse the storm, U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker said
the U.S. had expected a bumpy road in the accord.
	   ``There's a lot of emotion involved. It's not easy...but the
intention, I believe, is basically sound.'' Ross was meeting with
Arafat in the West Bank city of Jericho and some negotiating
committees were still scheduled to meet Tuesday.

Uzbekistan moves troops from position in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Uzbekistan moved its peacekeeping troops off a key
post in Tajikistan on Monday, a news report said.
	   Officials refused to say why the troops were moved.
	   The decision came a week after Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
and other Tajik officials accused Uzbekistan of harboring and
aiding rebels who launched several days of fighting in northern
Tajikistan last week. The Uzbek government denied the claims.
	   Uzbekistan, Russia and other former Soviet republics keep troops
in Tajikistan to guard against an influx of drugs and weapons, and
a possible spillover of violence from Afghanistan.
	   Uzbekistan and Tajikistan had generally enjoyed good relations
until last week's rebellion.
	   Uzbekistan's peacekeeping battalion was moved Monday from its
position at the junction of the Afghan, Uzbek and Tajik borders in
southwestern Tajikistan, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The report did not say where the troops were moved.
	   Uzbek officials did not provide any reason for the relocation,
and it was unclear whether the move was connected to last week's
dispute.
	   Meanwhile, a mission of the International Committee of Red Cross
announced Monday that it was resuming work in Tajikistan, suspended
after four United Nations observers were killed this summer.
	   Red Cross representatives said they have received safety
guarantees from Tajik authorities and opposition field commanders,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The alleged leaders of an international
prostitution ring went on trial Monday, but little light was shed
on the network after two of six accused had their hearings
postponed.
	   Annika Brumark, 50, a former Swedish model, was excused because
her attorney had been in a car accident. Another alleged
ringleader, Jean-Claude Tunon, 73, founder of a school for
hostesses, could not attend because he has been hospitalized for
heart trouble.
	   The two will won't be tried until May.
	   Despite the absence of Brumark and Tunon, Judge Thierry
Devernoix de Bonnefon de Lavialle proceeded, questioning
photographer Jean-Pierre Bourgeois, 51, who allegedly put rich
clients in touch with young women.
	   Investigators say the ring's leaders recruited young women with
the promise of modeling careers, and then abused them sexually and
circulated photos to potential clients. The network, police say,
provided young women to clients willing to pay up to 20,000 francs
(dlrs 3,600) a night.
	   The case involves close to 90 young women, including 14 minors,
and a network that allegedly spread from Paris to the Riviera, but
also to Morocco, the United States, Portugal, Switzerland and
Britain. A dozen of the women filed complaints that led to the
arrests.
	   Only four of the women, however, appeared in court Monday.
	   The investigation created a stir in March, when actor Robert De
Niro was hauled in for a day of questioning by a French judge as a
witness in the prostitution ring. De Niro denied paying any woman
for sex, and angrily accused the judge of leading a ``witch hunt.''
	   De Niro initially vowed never to return to France because of the
case, but later changed his mind.
	   Prostitution is legal in France, but procuring prostitutes is
not.
	   Clients of the ring are said to have included movie producers,
sports stars and Middle Eastern businessmen.
	   The alleged leaders of the network face a maximum sentence of 10
years in prison and fines of 10 million francs (dlrs 1.8 million)
each.
	   The trial is expected to last until next Wednesday.

	   SOTO CANO AIR BASE, Honduras _ French President Jacques Chirac
and U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton brought messages of
support Monday and more pledges of money for Central American
nations blasted by Hurricane Mitch.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, Chirac said he was moved
by Hurricane Mitch, which killed at least 10,000 people and left
homeless hundreds of thousands of others. He called television
images of the devastation ``impressive.''
	   He joined President Carlos Flores Facusse in a minivan for a
quick tour of flood-damaged areas in the city. The first visit to
Honduras by a French head of state was scheduled to last less than
three hours.
	   Mrs. Clinton upon arriving in Honduras called Mitch ``the worst
natural disaster in this hemisphere that we have record of.''
	   More deaths could from disease in the storm's aftermath, she
warned, ``so we're not by any means through.''
	   On Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 45
million more aid for the region, bringing the total U.S. commitment
so far to more than dlrs 126 million.
	   ``I will be announcing even more resources, more helicopters,
more troops, more fuel, more medical supplies, more engineering and
road building units,'' Mrs. Clinton said, standing atop a makeshift
podium based on boxes of bottled water brought in as aid.
	   Under a hot, muggy sky, Mrs. Clinton shook hands and posed for
pictures with U.S. servicemen at this base 30 miles (50 kilometers)
northwest of Tegucigalpa after calling their aid efforts ``heroic
and important and significant.''
	   She also praised the ``the great spirit'' of the Honduran
people, ``who are willing to literally pull up their sleeves and
dig themselves out.''
	   Earlier in Guatemala, Chirac said that France would forgive the
debts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to help
those countries recover from Mitch. The total for the four
countries was dlrs 134 million.
	   Chirac also suggested creation of a Central American
reconstruction fund, to be overseen by the World Bank. Chirac
arrived Saturday in Guatemala for a previously scheduled trip. He
extended his trip to visit Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   In Guatemala, Chirac promised that France would help the country
recover from its 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   ``France can help you consolidate peace and democracy,'' he told
the Guatemala's congress on Monday morning, speaking of economic
and educational aid.
	   Spain's Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon, meanwhile, flew to
Guatemala from El Salvador. He said his country had pledged dlrs
113 million in credit or donations to the affected nations.
	   On Monday, the prince visited the site of a toppled bridge on
the Lempa River, about 40 miles (70 kilometers) east of San
Salvador and visited a school sheltering 211 refugees.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister on Monday unveiled the
government's biggest effort so far to spend the country out of
economic distress, but markets and commentators found little to
cheer.
	   Unimpressed by the figures _ 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion)
in new public spending and tax cuts _ critics focused on what Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi did not offer: a cut in the sales tax.
	   The package surpasses the record 17 trillion yen (dlrs 139
billion) the government released in April and brings the total
amount Tokyo has spent on stimulus since 1992 to 100 trillion yen
(dlrs 820 billion).
	   The problem, however, has been consumer confidence.
	   News of growing unemployment, bankruptcies and stingy lending by
hard-pressed banks has prompted ordinary Japanese to cut spending
and put tax cuts into savings, leaving merchants from car dealers
to department stores with unsold goods.
	   The government's decision last year to raise the sales tax to 5
percent from 3 percent was widely blamed for choking off a growth
spurt and tipping the economy back into recession.
	   Obuchi said the tax revenue was needed because of Japan's
mounting budget deficit.
	   ``Judging from the current fiscal situation, it's difficult to
comply with that,'' he said of demands for a lower sales tax.
	   The package is designed to stop Japan's economy from contracting
for a third consecutive year _ a pledge Obuchi made after taking
office in July.
	   ``With this plan, our country can free itself from its current
severe situation,'' Obuchi said before leaving for Malaysia for a
summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   In Washington, the White House hailed the plan.
	   ``The Obuchi administration recognizes that it must take
significant stimulus measures to lead Japan out of its worst
post-war recession. Swift action is urgently needed,'' spokesman
Joe Lockhart told reporters.

Lazio coach cancels trip to Sweden after team lost Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson canceled a
trip to Sweden Monday due to the wrath of Lazio's fans in Italy's
top soccer league.
	   Angry fans of the Roman club threw bottles at the team's bus
after Lazio lost 2-0 Sunday away to Venezia, placed last in the
18-team Serie A.
	   ``The situation in Italy is such that I can't be gone from Rome
for two days, right after our loss to the poorest placed team,''
Eriksson said in a statement quoted by the national news agency TT.
	   Eriksson had been invited as one of several award presenters at
a TV-gala Monday to honor various Swedish League players. The
Swedish League ended Nov. 8.
	   ``It is the second time we have lost against a lowly-placed
side. Another thing that makes the situation serious is that the
team is listed on the stock exchange, and the share price fell.''
	   Eriksson, who formerly coached Sampdoria of Genoa, said he did
not fear that his job was in danger.

Wife of Saddam's half-brother dies, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The wife of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
half-brother has died in Switzerland, officials said Monday.
	   The cause of death was not clear, but the woman, Ahlam
al-Tikriti, had reportedly been under treatment for breast cancer.
She was 44.
	   A death notice for her appeared in the Monday edition of the
London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi. It was signed by
her husband, Barzan al-Tikriti.
	   An Iraqi Embassy official said he was told she died last week. A
hospital spokeswoman confirmed that Mrs. al-Tikriti had died, but
declined to give the cause or say when.
	   The death is expected to complicate the situation of her
husband, who earlier this year was ordered to return to Baghdad in
a shakeup of diplomatic posts.
	   He reportedly has cited his wife's illness as his reason for
staying in Geneva, against Saddam's orders.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations in
Geneva for 10 years.
	   He was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled
to Baghdad.
	   Mrs. al-Tikriti was also the half-sister of Saddam's first wife,
Sajida, who is the mother of Saddam's two grown sons, Odai and
Qusai.
	   Mrs. al-Tikriti's daughter, Saja, was divorced from Odai in 1995
after complaining she was beaten.
	   The divorce sparked a sharp division in the family, which
worsened when Odai shot and wounded Mrs. al-Tikriti's brother
Watban.
	   The Swiss government says Barzan al-Tikriti has until the end of
the month to leave Geneva under Swiss laws that allow U.N.
diplomats to stay on for three months after the end of their
tenure.
	   Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti is survived by six
children, ages 11 to 26.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
Monday convicted two Muslims and a Bosnian Croat in its first case
to deal with atrocities committed against Bosnian Serbs.
	   Judges said they were appalled by what they called ``singular
brutality'' and ``calculating cruelty,'' of staff at a central
Bosnian prison camp where guards beat to death and tortured Serb
inmates.
	   A three-judge panel at the U.N. court convicted the Celebici
camp's Bosnian Croat warden and two Muslim guards in the murder,
torture and rape of Serb prisoners in 1992.
	   The verdicts, which included the court's first conviction of
sexual assualt as a war crime, came at a time when Serb authorities
are accusing the tribunal of being anti-Serb and are refusing to
allow its investigators probe alleged atrocities in the Southern
Yugoslav Province of Kosovo.
	   Camp warden, Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty of 11 war crimes
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for overseeing guards
who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six.
	   His conviction was the first by an international court on the
basis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II
tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo convicted Nazi and Japanese
superiors for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his
neck, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years imprisonment.
	   Prosecutors failed to make the same command responsibility
argument stick to Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander
accused of having overall control of the camp. The judges acquitted
him, saying there was not enough evidence to link him to the
atrocities.
	   Mirza Hajric, an advisor to the Muslim member of the Bosnian
joint presidency, told APTN the Hague's decision today proved that
even if there were atrocities committed by the Muslim dominated
Bosnian army, ``they were committed by individuals.''
	   ``All responsible will pay for their crimes,'' he said.
	   Prosecutors said, 9th graf previous.

Guerrillas kill three Israelis in bomb blast

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb Monday in southern Lebanon, killing three Israeli
soldiers and wounding four others, security officials said.
	   The bomb was set off by remote control as an Israeli infantry
patrol passed between the villages of Houla and Markaba.
	   The area is three kilometers (two miles) west of the Lebanese
border with Israel, and 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of
Marjayoun, the main town in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the deaths and
said that two of the soldiers were seriously wounded. The Israeli
military said the soldiers were on their way to a weapons-firing
drill.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the midday blast. Six hours earlier, Israeli
warplanes raided suspected guerrilla bases in the south in the
eighth attack in as many days, the Lebanese security officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles at the village of Sojod in
Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied
zone, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area in Sojod, which was
also attacked on Saturday.
	   The jets returned 15 minutes later and fired two more missiles
at Jabal al-Rafih, also in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raids on
the mountainous area, 10 kilometers (six miles) northwest of
Marjayoun.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 allied militiamen from the occupied zone
that Israel carved out in in 1985 to protect against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
	   Monday's airstrike came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas fired
rockets and mortars at Israeli positions in southern Lebanon along
the border with the Jewish state as well as outposts of the South
Lebanon Army militia, which is armed and financed by Israel.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that the attacks were in response
to the continuing Israeli air raids on South Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes have raided suspected Hezbollah bases mainly
in Iqlim al-Tuffah daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted
in casualties.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah
guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their
allied Lebanese militiamen.

Netanyahu suspends West Bank pullback over Arafat statements

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In yet another blow to the Mideast peace
accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended a West Bank
troop pullback Monday and demanded that Yasser Arafat retract
threats to use force to bring about a Palestinian state.
	   Palestinian officials countered that Israel was making just as
many inflammatory remarks and accused Netanyahu of inventing
excuses to avoid carrying out the agreement.
	   The escalating tensions came on the same day Israel was to begin
pulling its troops out of West Bank areas and crippled U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross' efforts to get the crisis-plagued Wye River accord off
the ground.
	   Netanyahu said the suspension was a result of remarks made by
Arafat Sunday to supporters in which the Palestinian leader said
that he would declare a Palestinian state in May and that ``our
rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,'' a
defiant Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament convened to debate
the new peace accord. A vote in favor of the deal is expected
Tuesday.
	   In response, Arafat called in reporters from The Associated
Press and Israel TV and said he was committed to the peace process
with Israel.
	   ``I would like to reiterate here that we are fully committed to
implementing precisely and accurately what was signed in the Wye
River memorandum. As far as we're concerned, our position remains
that peace is a strategic option and we will not shift course,''
Arafat said.
	   He did not relate directly to his statements from Sunday but
said ``Surely we will face difficulties when we negotiate ... the
issue of Jerusalem. As they say in English, where there's a will,
there's a way.'' Arafat spoke moments before he met with Ross.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said Arafat's
comments fell short of Israeli expectations.
	   ``Mr. Arafat did not provide a retraction of his statement
regarding the use of rifles, a statement which is unacceptable. The
government will have to decide whether to continue with the
implementation of the accord,'' he said.

U.S. criticized for not allowing inspections of its chemical
</HEADLINE>
industry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The United States came under fire
Monday for not opening up its chemical industry _ the world's
largest _ to inspections by international weapons experts.
	   At a gathering of signature nations to the international
Chemical Weapons Convention, convention director Jose Mauricio
Bustani urged the United States ``to take whatever action is
necessary to achieve this goal soon.''
	   The global convention, which took effect in April 1997,
prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of chemical
weapons.
	   Under the treaty, chemical weapon production facilities, as well
as storage and destruction sites are all subject to inspections.
But industries producing so-called dual use chemicals, which can be
used for civil and military ends, must also open their doors to
inspectors.
	   While the United States has allowed inspections of government
facilities, checks of industry sites have been impossible due to
legislative difficulties, said Donato Kiniger-Passigli, the
spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, which oversees the treaty.
	   A U.S. official at the conference said the relevant legislation
has been enacted, clearing the way for eventual inspections.
Ambassador Ralph Earle II, the U.S. representative to the
conference, stressed that it will take some time before the
legislation will be up and running.
	   But he assured conference participants that the United States
``is continuing to seek various ways to accelerate this process.''
	   Kiniger-Passigli said now that the legislative hurdle is out of
the way, U.S. companies, like those in other signature states, will
need to declare their production of ``dual chemicals,'' which may
have potential warfare applications.
	   Once those declarations are filed, the Hague-based OPCW will
decide which companies to inspect.

McEnroe downs Forget for finals win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ John McEnroe bagged his 12th vintage
title Monday, downing Frenchman Guy Forget 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) in the
dlrs 150,000 Delta Airlines ATP Senior Tour of Champions.
	   McEnroe played in fashion akin to his glory days, attacking the
net with vengeance and dishing out several aces. Had he had the
endurance of old, Forget might have been in for a thrashing.
	   ``I wanted to show these young guys who's the boss,'' McEnroe,
39, said after the match.
	   Forget, 33, the youngest competitor on the oldies tour, for the
most part was struggling to fine-tune his shots which often flew
erratically off course.
	   He led 1-0 in the opening game and then watched the rest of the
set speed steadily beyond his reach. In the second set, the
Frenchman, who had never bettered 4th on the world's ranking list,
came back. But McEnroe was too good.
	   To the delight of the crowd, the match was not without an
infamous ``Mac Attack'' _ where McEnroe challenges a line call and
argues with the umpire. The 77-time title holder did so midway
during the second set tie-break, when it appeared that Forget may
force an extra Champions Tie break.
	   In the consolation match, Henri Leconte of France collected a
walkover victory over former World No. 1, Mats Wilander, after the
Swede withdrew citing a fever.
	   McEnroe clinched the season's title in Zagreb, overtaking
tennis' most prolific tournament champion, compatriot Jimmy
Connors, who has not entered the last two events on the senior
circuit.

Italy's highest court starts deliberations on ex-Nazi's war
</HEADLINE>
conviction in wartime massacre &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's highest appeals court on Monday began
deliberating the case of former Nazi officer Erich Priebke for his
role in a World War II massacre of civilians in Rome.
	   A lower court, a military appeals court, in March upheld his
conviction and revised his sentence to life imprisonment. Priebke,
83, is serving his sentence under house arrest in Rome.
	   Priebke, a former SS captain, was found guilty of helping carry
out the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians at the Ardeatine Caves on
the outskirts of Rome during the German occupation of the capital.
	   The massacre was ordered in retaliation for a bomb attack by
Italian resistance fighters that killed 33 German soldiers.
	   Along with Priebke's appeal, the court is also considering the
conviction and life sentence of his codefendant, ex-SS Maj. Karl
Hass, 84.
	   Both men said in their trials that they were following orders
from Adolf Hitler and had no other choice.

Crowley assaulted en route to team hotel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England cricket officials said Monday
they will not take police action after middle order batsman John
Crawley was assaulted Sunday night while returning to the team
hotel.
	   England team manager Graham Gooch said Crawley was attacked by
an unknown man late Sunday night on a city street in the north
Queensland city.
	   Crawley had spent the night socializing with teammates and
members of the Queensland team, who the tourists played in a
four-day fixture which ended Monday with a one-wicket win by
England.
	   Gooch, who described the attack as unprovoked, said Crawley
suffered general bruising to his face, cuts and bruises above both
eyes and a cut above the top lip as a result of the assault.
	   The England team manager said Crawley was verbally abused and
then punched in the face by the assailant, causing the cricketer to
fall to the ground.
	   He said the incident happened as Crawley was returning alone by
foot to the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Cairns' city center.
	   ``John was naturally upset by the matter but other than cuts and
bruises to his face he is fine and fully fit,'' Gooch said.
	   ``We considered informing the police but John was keen to put
the matter behind him.''
	   Crawley did not attend the final day's play against Queensland,
spending the day at the team hotel resting.
	   Gooch said the facial injuries were unlikely to prevent Crawley
from playing in the first test against Australia starting in
Brisbane on Friday. (djp)

Kuwaitis disappointed U.S. didn't strike, Arabs raise questions

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ As another Iraq crisis wound down, Kuwaitis were
disappointed Monday that U.S. missiles didn't finally finish off
Saddam Hussein. But for other Arabs, it was back to normal: Israel,
not Iraq, is the enemy.
	   ``Undoubtedly there is disappointment. We know that Saddam will
be whipping up more crises,'' Kuwaiti lawmaker Mussalam al-Barrak
said.
	   ``We have the right to know if America wants Saddam Hussein to
stay, or if it is serious about toppling him and saving Iraq,''
wrote columnist Faisal al-Kanaii in the daily al-Siyassah
newspaper.
	   Bitterness toward the Iraqi leader is to be expected in the
small wealthy emirate south of Iraq. Saddam's army invaded Kuwait
in August 1990 and occupied the country until a U.S.-led force
drove it out seven months later.
	   But elsewhere in the Arab world, commentators looked at the
latest run-in between Saddam and the United Nations differently and
arrived at a familiar charge: Washington's foreign policy is
plagued by double standards.
	   ``The admiration of the U.S. stand (on Iraq) ... would subside
when the admirers know of Washington's leniency in dealing with the
Israeli sustained failure to abide by international law,'' the
Egyptian Gazette said in an editorial.
	   ``It seems that international law and threats of using force are
only tailored for Iraqis,'' the English-language daily said, noting
Israel's failure to implement U.N. Security Council resolutions
pertaining to the 50-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.
	   In Lebanon, the Daily Star concluded that Saddam, not President
Clinton, emerged the winner from the standoff created by the Iraq's
Oct. 31 decision to halt the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Saddam relented Saturday, avoiding what looked like certain
military retaliation by the United States and Britain over Iraq's
refusal to allow continued U.N. arms inspections.
	   ``The `Beast of Baghdad' is ahead on points, President Clinton
is fast catching up and, as usual, losing at every turn are the
people of Iraq,'' the Star wrote.
	   Jordan's Arabic daily Ad-Destour was more blunt in its criticism
of the United States. ``Any honest person examining Washington's
double standards would only express ... condemnation and seething
anger for the absence of justice and balanced policy.''
	   Beyond Arab commentators, the unified international ``voice''
calling on Saddam to back down and invoked by Clinton in public
comments Sunday was gone elsewhere, too.
	   In France, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said only the U.N.
Security Council has the right to authorize military action against
Iraq. And Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, in Egypt for a
visit, said Moscow opposed any military strikes against Baghdad.
	   But at least one person expressed relief at the easing of the
latest Saddam-Clinton tussle.
	   ``I am glad it was resolved in a peaceful manner,'' U.S. Army
Specialist Troy Kreitz told The Associated Press at Kuwait's Camp
Doha, where the United States has kept weapons since the 1991 Gulf
War.

Indian, Pakistani anti-nuclear activists awarded tolerance prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Indian and Pakistani anti-nuclear activists on
Monday received the UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion
of Tolerance and Non-Violence.
	   India's Narayan Dasai, 74, won the award for campaigning against
nuclear weapons and for his work in promoting education and youth
training camps with his Shanti Sena (Peace Bridge) corps of
volunteers dedicated to non-violence.
	   The Pakistani group Joint Action Committee for Peoples Rights
won the prize for its campaigns for women's rights, religious
tolerance and against nuclear weapons. The committee is an informal
coalition of 30 non-governmental organizations and individuals,
founded in 1990.
	   Madanjeet Singh congratulated the winners for their ``tireless
efforts to eradicate illiteracy, gender bias, and for promoting
religious and ethnic tolerance towards an everlasting friendship
between peoples of India and Pakistan.''
	   Given every two years, the award is funded by Singh, imprisoned
during Mohandas Gandhi's non-violent movement, and a former Indian
ambassador. He is now special adviser to Federico Mayor,
director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural organization.
	   This year's jury also included former U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Ghali, Indian politician Inder Kumar Gujral and French
Rabbi Rene-Samuel Sirat.

Russia drafting law banning 'political extremism'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the wake of a firestorm over a Communist
lawmaker's anti-Semitic remarks, Russian officials are drafting a
law that would ban parties that demonstrate ``political
extremism,'' the justice minister said Monday.
	   Pavel Krasheninnikov also renewed his push for parliament to
pass a draft law banning Nazi symbols, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. That measure was presented to the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, in August.
	   Krasheninnikov said the Justice Ministry was preparing
legislation that would ban parties whose members demonstrate
``political extremism,'' ITAR-Tass said. It did not say how the
term would be defined, nor did it specifically mention
anti-Semitism.
	   Albert Makashov, a retired general and Communist lawmaker,
blamed Russia's problems on ``zhidy,'' or yids, a slur against
Jews, at a rally last month and called for a quota of Jews in
government.
	   His comments provoked outrage among many officials, but the
Communist-dominated Duma refused to censure him, prompting calls
for a ban on the Communist Party.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, also a Communist, insisted
Monday that Russia ``has more than enough'' laws to prevent ethnic
and racial conflicts and doesn't need any new ones, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Russia's Constitution forbids statements that ``incite ethnic
strife,'' but few people have been punished for making such
remarks.
	   Also Monday, ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky said
anti-Semitism is not a problem in Russia, the Interfax news agency
reported. Speaking to students at the Institute of People's
Friendship, he blamed the uproar over Makashov on efforts by the
West to test Russian presidental hopefuls on their attitudes toward
Jews.

U.S. diplomat presses Milosevic over Kosovo violence

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Reacting to apparent intimidation by
Yugoslav forces, the head of monitors checking compliance with U.N.
demands in Kosovo said Monday he expressed his concern to President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   William Walker, the American who leads what eventually will be
2,000 unarmed civilian observers that will spread out throughout
the southern province of Serbia, met Milosevic and other officials
for 90 minutes.
	   He also told the Yugoslav president that the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe overseeing the Kosovo
Verification Mission, can't ``tolerate any intimidation from either
side of our verifiers.''
	   Walker said he was sent to see Milosevic by the president of the
OSCE ``to express our concern with the perception that security in
Kosovo has deteriorated. I was asking the president to do
everything he could to curtail that tit-for-tat violence.''
	   He seemed to back down from statements Sunday that a Yugoslav
army convoy fired weapons over the vehicle of a verifier team. He
said that went beyond what he actually knew.
	   ``Our people heard noises and thought they saw flashes from
muzzles,'' he said. The Yugoslavs claim the noises the verifiers
heard were three vehicle backfires.
	   ``I did not say we have accepted that story,'' Walker told
reporters, adding circumstances of the incident were being looked
into. He said what the team does know for sure is that the turret
of a Yugoslav army vehicle turned and pointed at the verifiers.
	   ``That in itself is unacceptable,'' Walker said. ``We do want
not weapons pointed at our vehicles and our verifiers.''
	   Asked if the Serbs are in compliance with the agreement signed
with American negotiator Richard Holbrooke, Walker said: ``We have
a difference of opinion on the question of full compliance,''
adding that there may be a ``difference of interpretation.''
	   Faced with NATO intervention, Milosevic on Oct. 12 agreed to
reduce his security forces of in Kosovo _ part of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic _ end a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a mission of
international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   ``Yugoslavia sticks to the agreement,'' Milosevic said in a
statement after the talks, and suggested that any post-agreement
violence was the fault of radical Albanians. ``The international
community should exert firm and unambiguous pressure ... to stop
terrorist provocations of bandit groups intended to jeopardize the
peace process in Kosovo.''
	   Later Monday, the government released statistics claiming that
238 ``terrorist attacks'' occurred since the agreement, considered
a de-facto cease-fire. Most of them were against police with seven
policemen killed and 22 wounded, 12 heavily, said the information.

World Jewry struggles to define relationship with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It used to be simple. American Jews used to
feel close emotional ties to Israel. But today, the link is more
tenuous, threatened by the growing assimilation of U.S. Jews and
their more questioning attitude toward the Jewish state.
	   In a push to strengthen the bond during this period of changing
relations, Jewish philanthropists are trying to raise dlrs 300
million for ``Birthright Israel,'' a project to bring Jewish youths
from around the world to Israel for 10 days of educational
programs.
	   Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company who helped
launch the project, said Monday he hoped the plan would help
strengthen Jewish life in places such as America where an estimated
40 percent of Jews now marry non-Jews.
	   ``It gives them a real coming back to their roots,'' said
Bronfman, a strong supporter of Israel. ``This is where it all
started. It gives them a chance to look at Israel today, modern
Israel and gives them past, present, and hope for the future,''
Bronfman told The Associated Press.
	   The project is being kicked-off as part of the General Assembly,
an annual conference which opens Monday in Jerusalem. Attended by
some 3,000 North American Jewish community leaders, the GA is being
held in Israel for the first time as part of the country's 50th
anniversary celebrations.
	   Miami cardiologist Jerome Reich, 61, whose four sons have all
visited Israel, said such projects are crucial in sparking young
people's interest in their Jewish identity but do not embody the
entire Jewish experience.
	   A visit ``is an adrenalin shot but there must be follow-up,''
said Reich, a delegate at the GA.
	   Once Israel and American Jewry were closely bound by a shared
past. The wounds of the Holocaust, participation in the unfolding
drama of Israel as a fledgling nation battling for survival and
even the Yiddish language kept them united in spirit.
	   But, today the battles in a more secure Israel are less
glamorous, more complex, and harder to rally around. American Jews
generally practice the more liberal Reform and Conservative streams
of Judaism, do not speak Hebrew, and are less comfortable stating
opinions on a faltering peace process.
	   ``There is clear evidence of the distancing of American Jewry
from Israel,'' said Steven Cohen, a sociologist at Hebrew
University who studies American Jews.
	   Cohen said the trend among American Jews is to turn inward to
their families and local communities for identity rather than to
Israel, whose recent political policies confuse them both on the
issues of peace and religion.
	   ``Israel itself has presented far more ambiguous images and it
is difficult to maintain a one dimensional heroic romantic
idealized image of the Israeli,'' Cohen said.
	   Baruch Kostava, 47, a kibbutz member working as a representative
of the movement in New York City spoke of the difficulties of
finding common dialogue between the communities he works to unite.
	   ``One builds a state not just around glory and euphoria but the
every day,'' he said.
	   Gail Hyman, Vice President of Marketing and Public Affairs for
the United Jewish Appeal, the largest fund-raising arm of the
Diaspora Jewish community, likened the relationship of between the
communities to a maturing romance based more on a partnership
grappling with complex issues than fawning in adulation.
	   ``Maybe the first blush of romance is fading,'' Hyman said, ``We
can't live off the past.''

Netanyahu suspends West Bank pullback over Arafat statements

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In yet another blow to the Mideast peace
accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended a West Bank
troop pullback Monday and demanded that Yasser Arafat retract
threats to use force to bring about a Palestinian state.
	   Palestinian officials countered that Israel was making just as
many inflammatory remarks and accused Netanyahu of inventing
excuses to avoid carrying out the agreement.
	   The escalating tensions came on the day Israel had been
scheduled to begin pulling its troops out of West Bank areas and
crippled U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' efforts to get the Mideast peace
accord off the ground.
	   Netanyahu said the suspension was a result of Arafat's statement
Sunday promising to declare a Palestinian state in May and telling
supporters ``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,'' a
defiant Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament convened to debate
the peace accord. Despite the suspension of the troop withdrawal, a
parliament vote in favor of the deal is expected Tuesday.
	   Late Monday, Arafat called in reporters from The Associated
Press and Israel TV and said he was committed to the peace process.
	   ``I would like to reiterate here that we are fully committed to
implementing precisely and accurately what was signed in the Wye
River memorandum. As far as we're concerned, our position remains
that peace is a strategic option and we will not shift course,''
Arafat said.
	   He did not refer directly to his statements Sunday, but said
``Surely we will face difficulties when we negotiate ... the issue
of Jerusalem. As they say in English, where there's a will, there's
a way.'' Arafat spoke moments before a meeting with Ross.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said Arafat's
comments fell short of Israeli expectations.
	   ``Mr. Arafat did not provide a retraction of his statement
regarding the use of rifles, a statement which is unacceptable. The
government will have to decide whether to continue with the
implementation of the accord,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Since Netanyahu and Arafat signed the accord in Washington on
Oct. 23, there has been no end to public finger-pointing, fiery
rhetoric and delays.
	   ``If we were to suspend our actions in response to statements we
hear from the other side, then the agreement would have never been
launched,'' said Palestinian minister Nabil Shaath.
	   Noting that Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon called Sunday
for Jewish settlers to seize as much West Bank land as possible,
Shaath said, ``we constantly hear outrageous statements from Mr.
Netanyahu and members of his Cabinet and we did not stop the
implementation of the Wye memorandum.''
	   Netanyahu did not say when the troop redeployment would begin.
In comments directed toward hard-line critics, Netanyahu said that
he had not budged from one inch of land when he thought Arafat was
not fulfilling Palestinian commitments.
	   The prime minister said he would not accept Arafat's threats.
	   ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence with
rifles? If we do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division of
Jerusalem, they will use those rifles against us?'' Netanyahu told
Israel TV's Channel Two. ``There cannot be such dictates.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker said the United States had
expected a bumpy road. ``There's a lot of emotion involved. It's
not easy ... but the intention, I believe, is basically sound,''
Walker said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Arafat's remarks were ``wrong.'' But, referring to Israel's
obligation to begin the withdrawal, Rubin said the commitments the
two sides made were not limited by conditions.
	   Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and has said he would
annex large parts of the West Bank if Arafat made good on threats
to unilaterally declare independence next May.
	   The Wye agreement does not specifically refer to a declaration
of statehood, but urges both sides to refrain from unilateral
actions.
	   However, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Arafat and President
Clinton reached a verbal understanding during last month's summit
that if little progress was made in final-status talks by May, the
United States would not oppose a unilateral declaration of
statehood.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An Italian prisoner held hostage by
inmates in a Turkish prisoners trying to pressure Italy into
extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader was freed late Monday, the
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Turkish authorities negotiated for two days for the release of
Mauro Calascibetta, 34. He was taken hostage Sunday by a group of
fellow inmates at the Metris jail demanding the extradition of
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan was
arrested last week in Rome.
	   Officials said Calascibetta would be extradited to Switzerlan,
where is wanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with
an attempted killing.
	   Television reports said the Turkish inmates decided to release
him when they realized the incident was hampering Turkey's bid for
Ocalan's extradition.

Premier: Italy won't bow to pressure on rebel leader

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vowing not to bow to pressure from Turkey, Italy's
premier said Monday it is up to the courts to decide on the
extradition of a top Kurdish rebel leader imprisoned in Rome.
	   ``Italy won't give in to threats, pressure or conditions of any
sort,'' said Premier Massimo D'Alema. ``Italy is a democratic
country that cannot be blackmailed by anyone.''
	   Rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is Turkeys' most wanted fugitive
and Ankara has been blunt in demanding his return.
	   ``We strongly demand the extradition of a person who has killed
tens of thousands of people,'' Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said in a separate news conference in Rome. ``A terrorist should be
treated like a terrorist.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, which has been
fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has claimed an estimated 37,000 lives. He was arrested
last week at Rome's international airport when he arrived on a
flight from Moscow.
	   It appears unlikely that a court could rule in favor of his
extradition because Turkey is trying in absentia for capital
crimes. In a landmark ruling two years ago, the Constitutional
Court said ``under no hypothesis and for no type of crime'' can
Italy extradite someone to a country where they could be executed.
	   Hoping to find a safe haven, Ocalan has asked the Italian
government for political asylum.
	   D'Alema on Monday ruled out a third option: deportation to a
third country. He said Ocalan would either be granted asylum or
extradited.
	   ``It would be easier to grant asylum to that who speaks out
against violence and terrorism,'' the premier said.
	   The Kurdish cause has support in leftist circles in Italy and
Ocalan has said he was encouraged by ``friends'' in parliament to
seek asylum.
	   As if in answer to D'Alema, Ocalan issued a statement Monday
saying he was ``ready to do my part to stop terrorism.'' He said he
had come to Italy ``to open this avenue, to build the conditions
for a political solution'' to the Kurdish conflict.
	   Kurds throughout Europe are demonstrating to show their
solidarity with Ocalan and thousands have come to Rome in his
support. About 2,000 are on hunger strike outside the military
hospital in Rome where he is believed to be held.
	   Cem met Monday with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who
later stressed Italy's concern for one of its citizens taken
hostage in a Turkish prison by inmates demanding Ocalan's
extradition. D'Alema also stressed Italy's concern.
	   Cem told reporters that the Turkish government had nothing to do
with the kidnapping.
	   ``It's a worry for us too,'' he said. ``It was the wrong thing
to do, but it wasn't a government initiative.''
	   The inmate was freed later in the day.
	   In Turkey, the country's top business leaders threatened Monday
to boycott Italian good unless Ocalan is extradited. The Turkish
defense minister over the weekend suggested Italian firms would be
barred from defense contracts.
	   In a sign of Ankara's eagerness to get Ocalan back, the justice
minister on Monday submitted a draft bill abolishing the death
penalty in Turkey. Turkey hasn't executed anyone since 1984.

 &UR; U.S. diplomat presses Milosevic over Kosovo violence
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugo figures on increased guerrilla violence.
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Reacting to apparent intimidation by
Yugoslav forces, the head of monitors checking compliance with U.N.
demands in Kosovo said Monday he expressed his concern to President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   William Walker, the American who leads what eventually will be
2,000 unarmed civilian observers that will spread out throughout
the southern province of Serbia, met Milosevic and other officials
for 90 minutes.
	   He also told the Yugoslav president that the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe overseeing the Kosovo
Verification Mission, can't ``tolerate any intimidation from either
side of our verifiers.''
	   Walker said he was sent to see Milosevic by the president of the
OSCE ``to express our concern with the perception that security in
Kosovo has deteriorated. I was asking the president to do
everything he could to curtail that tit-for-tat violence.''
	   He seemed to back down from statements Sunday that a Yugoslav
army convoy fired weapons over the vehicle of a verifier team. He
said that went beyond what he actually knew.
	   ``Our people heard noises and thought they saw flashes from
muzzles,'' he said. The Yugoslavs claim the noises the verifiers
heard were three vehicle backfires.
	   ``I did not say we have accepted that story,'' Walker told
reporters, adding circumstances of the incident were being looked
into. He said what the team does know for sure is that the turret
of a Yugoslav army vehicle turned and pointed at the verifiers.
	   ``That in itself is unacceptable,'' Walker said. ``We do want
not weapons pointed at our vehicles and our verifiers.''
	   Asked if the Serbs are in compliance with the agreement signed
with American negotiator Richard Holbrooke, Walker said: ``We have
a difference of opinion on the question of full compliance,''
adding that there may be a ``difference of interpretation.''
	   Faced with NATO intervention, Milosevic on Oct. 12 agreed to
reduce his security forces of in Kosovo _ part of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic _ end a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a mission of
international verifiers to observe his compliance.
	   ``Yugoslavia sticks to the agreement,'' Milosevic said in a
statement after the talks, and suggested that any post-agreement
violence was the fault of radical Albanians. ``The international
community should exert firm and unambiguous pressure ... to stop
terrorist provocations of bandit groups intended to jeopardize the
peace process in Kosovo.''
	   Later Monday, the government released statistics claiming that
238 ``terrorist attacks'' occurred since the agreement, considered
a de-facto cease-fire. Most of them were against police with seven
policemen killed and 22 wounded, 12 heavily, said the information.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors are to return to
Baghdad on Tuesday in the first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate
fully in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
	   On Monday, the first U.N. relief workers pulled out in fear of a
U.S. military strike returned to Iraq. And diplomats revealed the
behind-the-scenes drama in Baghdad that led to Iraq's sudden
announcement Saturday it would reverse course and end its blockade
of arms inspectors.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview that Iraq was being watched closely
to measure its resolve in cooperating with the U.N. inspectors
searching for forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was to leave Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and
Security Council members on the situation in Iraq.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 30 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, flight to Habaniya military air base west of
Baghdad.
	   About 120 more U.N. humanitarian workers were due overnight on a
bus convoy through the Jordanian desert.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when President
Clinton announced at a White House news conference that the United
States had accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to
lift its three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   That opens the way for a Security Council review of Iraq's
elimination of its weapons that the Iraqi government wants to lead
quickly to the lifting of punishing trade sanctions _ a move both
the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until
UNSCOM and the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy
Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal weaponry.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross told The Associated Press in
Bahrain, where the weapons inspectors were evacuated last week,
that they expected ``full cooperation'' on their return.
	   ``They (the inspectors) will be the first to know if the
cooperation is full and unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said.
	   Western diplomats in Baghdad expressed relief that the impasse
over weapons inspections had been resolved without military action.
	   There was great concern _ especially in neighboring countries _
that a missile strike would prompt Iraqi leader Saddam Saddam to
ban UNSCOM forever, ending any hope of long-term monitoring to
prevent Iraq from rebuilding prohibited weapons. One diplomat
described UNSCOM as ``the only thing that will keep Iraq on a
leash.''
	   The diplomats and Iraqi officials _ who spoke on condition of
anonymity _ also described the series of secret meetings that
preceded Iraq's Saturday announcement.
	   Late Friday night, the ambassadors of France, Russia and China _
Iraq's defenders in the Security Council _ met with Foreign
Ministry officials to warn that the United States was serious about
a strike and urge Iraq to let the U.N. inspectors back. The Russian
ambassador carried a letter from President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Just hours later, at about 2 a.m. Saturday (2300 gmt Friday),
Iraq's ambassador in New York, Nizar Hamdoon, faxed a similar
appeal from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the Iraqi
leadership in Baghdad.
	   Iraq broke its silence 12-1/2 hours later, when Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz telephoned Shah to say that there would be a
``positive reply'' to Annan's letter.
	   But apparently the attack seemed close enough that Iraq wanted
to get word out publicly. So an Information Ministry official
issued a one-sentence statement at 3:30 p.m. (1330 gmt) Saturday to
the scores of Western reporters drawn to Baghdad by the crisis.
	   ``I have information that the leadership will respond positively
to Annan's letter,'' the official said.
	   By about 4:30 p.m., Iraq's formal response was read to Shah's
office for transmission by fax to Annan. A typed copy signed by
Aziz was delivered later.
	   The two-paged letter promised that Iraq would renew cooperation
with U.N. inspectors, but Washington viewed an attached annex as
containing unacceptable conditions.
	   Later that night, it took repeated phone calls to Baghdad to
produce U.N. ambassador Hamdoon's three separate ``clarifications''
that Iraq's decision was unconditional _ which finally satisfied
the Americans.

Brazil's auto industry bracing for tough times

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Already engulfed in one of its worst
crises, Brazil's auto industry is bracing for even tougher times
ahead as the effects of a fiscal austerity package take hold in
South America's largest economy.
	   The auto industry, an economic bellwether that accounts for 12
percent of the country's industrial gross domestic product, has
seen sales and production plummeting to their lowest levels in
years.
	   Figures compiled by the National Association of Vehicle
Manufacturers show that January-to-October sales plunged 28 percent
compared to the first 10 months of 1997. Output during the same
period dropped 23 percent.
	   And for industry leaders, there is no recovery in sight for the
near future.
	   Herbert Demel, president of the local subsidiary of Volkswagen _
Brazil largest car maker _ predicted that next year's sales will
total 1.5 million units, the same expected for 1998.
	   ``In what I consider a best-case scenario, the market will most
likely remain flat for at least the first six months of 1999,'' he
said. ``And there is a very real possibility that sales figures
could dip even lower.''
	   James Padilla, president of Ford Motor Company's South American
operations said in a recent seminar that the industry's 1999 output
would probably total 1.45 million units ``and in the short-term I
don't see any chances of this number changing.''
	   Since 1992, auto industry sales posted steady and significant
gains, going from 740,000 units to 1.64 million in 1997.
	   Original figures that placed 1998 sales at 1.8 million started
to be revised downward late last year when the shock waves of the
first Asian financial crisis reached Brazil.
	   In an effort to protect the economy from currency speculators,
the government nearly doubled interest rates to 43 percent a year
and decreed a hefty increase in an excise tax on industrial
production, including cars.
	   In a market where nearly 70 percent of auto sales are made on
credit, the measures had an immediate impact as sales plunged some
30 percent.
	   Sales picked up slightly in July and August when the excise tax
was lowered five percentage points and annual interest rates dipped
to about 22 percent. But then Russia's financial turmoil hit Brazil
in September.
	   The government responded by more than doubling interest rates to
49.75 percent to stanch an outflow of foreign capital. The
country's foreign reserves fell to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs
70 billion at the end of July. This was later followed by a mix of
new taxes and spending cuts to save dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and
dlrs 80 billion by 2002.
	   Inventories of unsold cars, which had been holding steady at an
already-high 100,000 units, started swelling again and today stand
at 200,000 vehicles parked in factory yards and in dealers.
	   Until better times come, the auto industry is busy adjusting its
production to demand, meaning output is being reduced and workers
are being let go or given paid leave.
	   The auto industry dismissed 1,300 workers between September and
October and is expected to fire another 2,500 workers by the end of
the year.

	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ With an unexpected break in the
weather, rescuers began the search on Monday for Michel Trudeau
near the mountain lake where he is believed to have drowned.
	   But there was no sign of the youngest son of former Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau, who was swept away by an avalanche Friday
in southeastern British Columbia and presumed drowned.
	   ``There's nothing visible from the surface. We're just going to
have to go to the last seen point and try it from there,'' said
Dave Poirier, head of a diving team that planned to attempt to
recover Trudeau's body later Monday.
	   Snowy, foggy weather prevented rescuers from making any attempts
on Sunday.
	   Even when the divers get to the lake, they will be battling
weather. The lake is quickly freezing over and once that happens,
Poirier said the search will be on hold until the ice is hardened.
That could take weeks.
	   Thanks to the clearer weather, helicopter crews prepared to
clear an avalanche hazard before divers headed in. The helicopters
must drop explosives on the avalanche-prone masses of snow above
the lake.
	   But even when they can begin their search, Kokanee Lake's high
altitude _ more than 1,900 meters (2,080 yards) _ and icy waters
will limit their efforts.
	   ``From what I understand of the bottom of the lake topography
there, we'll probably just be working along the shorelines,'' said
Dave Poirier, one of the five dive-team members.
	   Trudeau's body, weighed down by a water-logged pack, jacket and
ski boots may be further out in the lake, which is 1.2 kilometers
(nearly 1 mile) long, 400 meters (440 yards) wide and whose depths
reach 100 meters (about 100 yards).
	   Police have not identified the others in the group but published
reports say Trudeau, 23, and Andrew Bednarz, 23, were thrown into
the lake by the avalanche but Bednarz managed to pull himself out.
	   The others in the group, Jeff Butcher, 22, and Bradley Hamacher,
23, huddled with Bednarz to keep him warm.
	   ``They yelled at Mike `to swim, swim, swim' but basically just
watched him go under the water,'' said Paul Sinclair, another
member of the ski party who had been with them a day earlier.
	   ``There was just no way to rescue him in that cold water,'' he
told National Post.
	   Trudeau, a passionate skier and outdoorsman like his father,
also knew the risks in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.
	   Kokanee Lake, fed directly from the glacier, is the most popular
spot for back-country hikers and skiers, said Steve Kent, area
manager for the B.C. Parks Service.
	   But as the popularity of the park has grown so has the death
toll. The park has had 10 avalanche fatalities in the last decade,
including six people killed in one slide last January.
	   Police say Trudeau's group was knowledgeable about avalanche
hazards and survival techniques _ even carrying locator beepers in
case they were buried. They tested the snow before leaving their
cabin near the glacier.
	   A spokesman for Pierre Trudeau issued a statement from Montreal
saying Michel's parents were deeply saddened. He said they
appreciated the many expressions of sympathy they have received and
asked that the family be given privacy.
	   The former prime minister has two other sons, Sacha and Justin.

Pilot of crashed plane reportedly had alcohol in his blood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The pilot of a plane that crashed two
months ago while approaching to land in the north African Spanish
enclave of Melilla had alcohol in his blood, news reports said
Monday.
	   All 38 people aboard the British-built BAe 146, including pilot
Diego Clavero, died when the plane smashed into a Moroccan hillside
towards the end of a 45-minute morning flight from the Spanish
mainland port city of Malaga to Melilla.
	   A report presented to a Malaga judge investigating the crash
indicated that Clavero's blood registered an alcohol level of 0.41
grams per liter, National Spanish Television TVE reported.
	   Spanish aviation legislation prohibits pilots from drinking any
alcohol before flying, TVE said.
	   Rafael Clavero told TVE that his brother Diego never touched
alcohol, whether flying or not, and claimed that the test was not
reliable.
	   No initial theories were advanced to explain the Sept. 25 crash
because the plane, owned by the Spanish company Pauknair, was
apparently in good condition, the weather was clear, and the pilot
was experienced.
	   All the crash victims were Spanish except for one young Moroccan
passenger, Adhelazziz Bakkali, who relatives said was returning to
Morocco after spending a year living illegally in Malaga.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The alleged leaders of an international
prostitution ring went on trial Monday, but little light was shed
on the network after two of six accused had their hearings
postponed.
	   Annika Brumark, 50, a former Swedish model, was excused because
her attorney had been in a car accident. Another alleged
ringleader, Jean-Claude Tunon, 73, founder of a school for
hostesses, could not attend because he has been hospitalized for
heart trouble.
	   The two won't be tried until May.

U.S. Commerce Secretary opens water distillation plant in Gaza

 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley on Monday inaugurated a dlrs 6 million water distillation
plant in the new Gaza Strip industrial park and pronounced the
product ``laziz,'' Arabic for delicious.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat joined Daley in a tour of the
water treatment facility that was funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development and built by a U.S. contractor.
Sub-contracts were given to Palestinian firms.
	   The opening of the Gaza industrial park at the Karni crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip is to open soon as part of last
month's Wye peace agreement negotiated by Israel and the
Palestinians. The project will create about 20,000 jobs for
Palestinians from the poverty-stricken Gaza Strip.
	   ``I believe very strongly that if peace is to be lasting, it
must be built on economic stability and jobs,'' Daley said.
	   Arafat thanked Daley for ``his help in our economy and in our
production and in our trade.''
	   Palestinian Industry Minister Saadi Krounz said the Palestinian
Authority was very committed real partnership between the private
investment sector and the public sector. Krounz said there are
plans to open two more distillation sites in the West Bank.
	   Daley said the industrial park will generate interest around the
world. ``I know what they will see, new partners, new businesses
and new jobs in a new Middle East,'' Daley said.
	   Daley later inaugurate a U.S. trade office in the West Bank city
of Ramallah.
	   Speaking to Palestinian businessmen there, Daley said U.S.
businesses wanted to support the peace process. He said the Middle
East must form a regional economy if it is to be a player on the
world scene. ``We must get rid of trade barriers.''
	   Daley has been promoting regional economic cooperation during
this visit to the Middle East. He has said that only 7 percent of
Middle East trade is with other Middle Eastern countries.
	   ``That concept of positive regional cooperation and the impact
it can have on the people in the region has got to be at the
forefront,'' Daley told reporters at a news conference.
	   He contrasted Middle Eastern trade with that of Europe, where
two-thirds of its trade is with other European nations, and the
United States whose largest trade partners are Canada and Mexico.

Nedved drops out of Czech lineup due to knee injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech team will be missing its
top star, Lazio Roma midfielder Pavel Nedved, in Wednesday's
friendly against England at Wembley.
	   According to team spokesman Jaroslav Kolar, Neved tore his knee
ligament in an Italian first division match and is forced to rest
for at least a week.
	   He will be replaced by Miroslav Baranek of Sparta Prague.
	   Coach Josef Chovanec intends to field at least eight players who
took the Czech team to the European championship finals two years
ago, losing to Germany in overtime at Wembley.
	   They include midfielders Karel Poborsky of Benfica Lisbon, Radek
Bejbl of Atletico Madrid and striker Vladimir Smicer of Racing
Lens.
	   ``Some players don't get to play at Wembley ever, and for me
this will be the second time in two years,'' said Patrik Berger,
who scored the Czechs' only goal in the Euro '96 final and now
plays for FC Liverpool.
	   The Czech team currently leads the qualifying Group 9,
challenging Scotland for a berth in the 2000 European
championships.
	   ``Wednesday's friendly will be good practice before the
qualifier against Scotland in the spring,'' Chovanec said.
	   Roster: Pavel Kouba, Vladimir Maier, Martin Kotulek, Lubos
Kozel, Jiri Novotny, Tomas Repka, Radek Bejbl, Patrik Berger, Radek
Latal, Jiri Nemec, Karel Poborsky, Radek Sloncik, Miroslav Baranek,
Roman Vonasek, Pavel Kuka, Vratislav Lokvenc, Vladimir Smicer.

 &UR; Eds: AMs. INCORPORATES US-Lewinsky-Book. UPDATES with British
publisher confirms Morton deal, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky has signed a lucrative deal with
Princess Diana's biographer Andrew Morton to write a tell-all book
about her affair with President Clinton, her publishers said
Monday. The U.S. network ABC said it has secured exclusive rights
to her first television interview.
	   British publisher Michael O'Mara, who put the Morton deal
together, refused to confirm news reports that it runs to seven
figures, but the New York Post reported Monday that the North
American rights alone are worth that. The British news agency Press
Association said Morton and Ms. Lewinsky could earn more than 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) from publication in Britain.
	   ''It wasn't the money, she could have got much higher prices
elsewhere,'' O'Mara said.
	   ''She likes the idea of an author who is used to writing
sympathetic books about women who have relationships with powerful
men.''
	   The chairman of London-based Michael O'Mara Books said there is
a ``strong personal chemistry'' between the former White House
intern and Morton, whose book, ''Diana: Her True Story,'' blew the
lid on the princess' troubled marriage to Prince Charles.
	   ``We put the two of them together in a New York hotel room last
week, and she said yes immediately,'' said O'Mara.
	   The book, to be called ''Monica's Story,'' will be published
simultaneously in the United States by St. Martin's Press of New
York, said spokesman John Murphy. It is expected to be in stores by
the summer.
	   ABC said Barbara Walters will conduct the first exclusive
television interview with Ms. Lewinsky for the network's ''20/20''
program.
	   The broadcast date will depend on when Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers
get permission from independent counsel Kenneth Starr for her to
speak publicly about the Clinton affair, ABC said. Her immunity
agreement contains a no-talk provision, and she must secure a
release from Starr's office before talking to anyone in the media.
	   Her ABC appearance will be for free, since major U.S. networks
don't pay for interviews, but she would be allowed to sell foreign
rights to the broadcast. British TV's Channel 4 has said it is
negotiating with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   O'Mara said Morton already has conducted preliminary interviews
with his subject.
	   ''Monica is an intelligent, well-spoken, average American girl,
not the foolish bimbo that the press paints her as,'' he said.
''That is an image she very much wants to change.''

Manchester United picks Antwerp as feeder club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with similar moves planned in other European nations
and Australia, quotes from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson,
ADDS details
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ In another sign of the widening gulf
between rich and poor in European soccer, English giant Manchester
United has reached a deal to use Belgium's oldest team, Royal
Antwerp, as a feeder club for young talent and plans similar moves
in Ireland, Sweden and Australia.
	   Under the arrangement, United will cull young players from
around the world, especially Argentina, send them to Antwerp for a
few years of grooming and bring them to Manchester once they are
ready for the Premier League.
	   ``The young players of Manchester United will get more
experience at Antwerp,'' said Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson.
	   European soccer's governing body UEFA and the Belgian federation
all expressed concerns Monday about such deals effectively turn
smaller leagues and clubs into pawns for the bigger ones.
	   ``We have to face reality,'' Royal Antwerp secretary Paul
Bistiaux said. ``The smaller clubs have to align themselves with
the big ones to survive. It's either sink or swim.''
	   Antwerp, Belgium's oldest club and a European Cup Winners Cup
finalist at Wembley only five years ago, was demoted to the Belgian
second division this year. It is now resigned to being at the
disposal of Manchester United.
	   ``Manchester United was looking for a pied-a-terre on the
continent,'' Bistiaux said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``It's clear Manchester United is the strongest party in
this. They'll be calling the shots.''
	   Fritz Ahlstrom, a spokesman for UEFA, expressed reservations
about the deal.
	   ``In principle, we don't like it,'' he said. ``There might be
more disadvantages than advantages to this.''
	   ``What happens if Royal Antwerp creates talent, develops it into
key players, and then is forced to let them go to sit on the bench
in Manchester?'' Ahlstrom asked. ``We don't like the key players in
some leagues to be on the bench in others.''
	   For Belgian Federation President Michel D'Hooghe, the issue is
about the increasingly lopsided financial situation in European
soccer, creating a two-tier system where the poor are at the beck
and call of the wealthy clubs.
	   ``Healthy clubs would not want to do so,'' he said. ``The big
leagues are not charity institutions. Most of the time the clubs
targeted are in a tough financial and sporting position.''
	   For a giant like Manchester United, it is only the first step.
	   ``This is just part of the expansion plan,'' said Ferguson.
``There will be deals with clubs in Australia, Ireland and
Sweden.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Royal Antwerp is not the only Belgian club being approached by a
foreign suitor. Germinal Ekeren, a small first-division club, is in
talks with Ajax Amsterdam for a possible cooperation pact.
	   For FIFA too, such deals raise the specter of common ownership
conflicts of interest.
	   ``We have to wait and see what such cooperation entails,'' FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   UEFA is also concerned about what would happen if Antwerp rises
to the top of Belgian soccer again and is drawn against Manchester
in European competition.
	   No worry for the time being though, Bistiaux said.
	   `It is theoretically possible, but it will take a while,'' he
said.
	   Antwerp was a prime target for Manchester United because Belgian
labor laws and work permits are far more flexible than in England,
Bistiaux said. Once the players are established in the European
Union, it is easier for them to transfer to Manchester United.

Poland sees first Jewish book fair since Holocaust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The first Jewish book fair in Poland since
World War II opened Monday, offering 300 titles on religion, the
Holocaust, politics, psychology and the history of Jewish life in
Poland.
	   The four-day fair, sponsored by the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation,
saw a steady stream of visitors on its opening night.
	   ``It is one of the signs of normal Jewish community,'' said
Jonah Bookstein, the foundation's program director in Warsaw.
	   Eva Hoffman, one of a number of writers lecturing at the fair,
spoke about her book ``Stetl,'' which tells the story of a small
Polish town with a majority of Jews.
	   Poland has about 20,000 Jews today, compared to 3.5 million in
1939 when the Nazis invaded. Most died in the gas chambers or from
inhuman conditions at the death camps of Auschwitz, Treblinka,
Majdanek and many others.
	   Most of those who survived fled the anti-Semitic movements of
communist Poland in 1956 and 1968.

World Jewry struggles to define relationship with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two grafs of Netanyahu comments &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It used to be simple. American Jews used to
feel close emotional ties to Israel. But today, the link is more
tenuous, threatened by the growing assimilation of U.S. Jews and
their more questioning attitude toward the Jewish state.
	   In a push to strengthen the bond during this period of changing
relations, Jewish philanthropists are trying to raise dlrs 300
million for ``Birthright Israel,'' a project to bring Jewish youths
from around the world to Israel for 10 days of educational
programs.
	   Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company who helped
launch the project, said Monday he hoped the plan would help
strengthen Jewish life in places such as America where an estimated
40 percent of Jews now marry non-Jews.
	   ``It gives them a real coming back to their roots,'' said
Bronfman, a strong supporter of Israel. ``This is where it all
started. It gives them a chance to look at Israel today, modern
Israel and gives them past, present, and hope for the future,''
Bronfman told The Associated Press.
	   The project is being kicked-off as part of the General Assembly,
an annual conference which opens Monday in Jerusalem. Attended by
some 3,000 North American Jewish community leaders, the GA is being
held in Israel for the first time as part of the country's 50th
anniversary celebrations.
	   ``Intermarriage and assimilation threatens like a centrifugal
force to pull our people apart,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in a speech opening the convention.
	   Of the Birthright Israel program, Netanyahu said ``I know that
nothing, nothing makes such an indelible impression on
(youngsters). They either stay here or go back forever changed as
Jews and they will touch the hearts and minds of other Jews,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Miami cardiologist Jerome Reich, 61, whose four sons have all
visited Israel, said such projects are crucial in sparking young
people's interest in their Jewish identity but do not embody the
entire Jewish experience.
	   A visit ``is an adrenalin shot but there must be follow-up,''
said Reich, a delegate at the GA.
	   Once Israel and American Jewry were closely bound by a shared
past. The wounds of the Holocaust, participation in the unfolding
drama of Israel as a fledgling nation battling for survival and
even the Yiddish language kept them united in spirit.
	   But, today the battles in a more secure Israel are less
glamorous, more complex, and harder to rally around. American Jews
generally practice the more liberal Reform and Conservative streams
of Judaism, do not speak Hebrew, and are less comfortable stating
opinions on a faltering peace process.
	   ``There is clear evidence of the distancing of American Jewry
from Israel,'' said Steven Cohen, a sociologist at Hebrew
University who studies American Jews.
	   Cohen said the trend among American Jews is to turn inward to
their families and local communities for identity rather than to
Israel, whose recent political policies confuse them both on the
issues of peace and religion.
	   ``Israel itself has presented far more ambiguous images and it
is difficult to maintain a one dimensional heroic romantic
idealized image of the Israeli,'' Cohen said.
	   Baruch Kostava, 47, a kibbutz member working as a representative
of the movement in New York City spoke of the difficulties of
finding common dialogue between the communities he works to unite.
	   ``One builds a state not just around glory and euphoria but the
every day,'' he said.
	   Gail Hyman, Vice President of Marketing and Public Affairs for
the United Jewish Appeal, the largest fund-raising arm of the
Diaspora Jewish community, likened the relationship of between the
communities to a maturing romance based more on a partnership
grappling with complex issues than fawning in adulation.
	   ``Maybe the first blush of romance is fading,'' Hyman said, ``We
can't live off the past.''

McEnroe downs Forget for title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ John McEnroe earned his 12th seniors
title Monday, beating Frenchman Guy Forget 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) in the
ATP Senior Tour of Champions.
	   McEnroe played in similar fashion to his glory days, attacking
the net forcefully and firing several aces.
	   ``I wanted to show these young guys who's the boss,'' said
McEnroe, 39.
	   Forget, 33, the youngest competitor on the senior tour,
struggled. Often, his shots flew erratically off course.
	   He led 1-0 in the opening set, then lost the next six games. In
the second set, Forget played better, but McEnroe was too good.
	   To the delight of the crowd, the match was not without a ``Mac
Attack'' _ where McEnroe challenges a line call and argues with the
umpire. He did that midway during the second set tie-breaker.
	   In the consolation match, Henri Leconte of France got a walkover
victory over Mats Wilander, when the Swede withdrew because of a
fever.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sentences upheld &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's highest appeals court on Monday upheld the
life sentences of two ex-Nazis convicted of helping carry out a
World War II massacre of civilians in Rome.
	   A military court last year convicted Erich Priebke,
an-83-year-old former SS captain, and ex-SS Maj. Karl Haas for
their roles in the 1944 massacre of 335 people at the Ardeatine
Caves on the outskirts of Rome during the German occupation of the
capital. The massacre was retaliation for a bombing by Italian
resistance fighters that killed 33 German soldiers.
	   Both men said in their trial that they were following orders
from Adolf Hitler and had no other choice.

Crisis hits Russia's already lagging telephone industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has fewer than 20 telephone lines for every
100 people _ half that of leading industrialized nations _ and the
economic crisis has stalled efforts to expand services, Russia's
communications chief said Monday.
	   Foreign investment in the country's outdated, dilapidated
telephone networks has plunged to dlrs 400 million this year from
dlrs 820 million last year, Alexander Krupnov, chairman of the
State Communications Committee, was quoted by Russian news agencies
as saying.
	   He said many Russian communications companies had been brought
to the brink of bankruptcy by the country's latest economic
troubles.
	   While Russia's phone lines have not been upgraded in years and
have been slow to extend to the more distant reaches of the world's
largest country, mobile phone companies have enjoyed widespread
success. More than 1 million people in Russia now use cellular
phones or pagers, Krupnov said.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Soccer star Ronaldo appeared at the United Nations
on Monday to back a campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the
dangers of the AIDS virus among young people.
	   ``It's all about staying in the game for longer,'' the Brazil
and Inter Milan striker, who joined the U.N. campaign in May, told
a news conference. ``Kids have the right to make the most of their
lives.''
	   He said he had signed up ``because I know that soccer can help
kids.''
	   ``If things go wrong on the field you can say to yourself that
you will try hard to do better next time,'' Ronaldo said. ``With
HIV, there is no second chance.''
	   ``Ronaldo is a key player on this team as on his own team,''
said Peter Piot, head of the U.N. agency dealing with AIDS and HIV,
the virus that causes the disease.
	   Some 7,000 people between the ages of 10 and 24 are infected
with HIV worldwide every day, Piot said.
	   Ronaldo earlier launched an institute aimed at offering children
from Brazilian slums a way off the streets through training in
soccer and other sports.
	   The Instituto R9 will be part of a privately funded foundation
being set up in a southern suburb of Rio de Janeiro, intended to
receive some 3,000 children and teen-agers.
	   The sports and leisure complex should open by the end of next
year.
	   The striker was upbeat about a knee injury that kept him out of
league action last weekend. ``Hopefully I'll be able to play again
very soon,'' he said.
	   Suffering from World Cup stress and troubled by tendinitis in
both knees, Ronaldo has been often sidelined this season.
	   But ``my health is fine,'' he said. ``I'm getting much better.''

Illegal migrants nabbed as Kurds stream into Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back
at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an
immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian officials said Monday.
	   Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were
refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence
permits, the Austrians said.
	   On Monday alone, about 70 people were refused entry at the
Brenner Pass crossing point. They included Pakistanis, Indians,
Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as Kurds, the Austrians said.
	   The border crackdown appeared designed to prevent large numbers
of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking to Rome for
protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest.
	   Turkey has asked for Ocalan's extradition.
	   Austrian authorities said many of those turned back had come
from Germany. A Red Cross station was set up at the border to
assist those turned away to return to Germany if their residence
permits were in order.
	   Those without proper papers were detained by Austrian
immigration.

Don't write off Sunday's big losers just yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Here's a big game no one anticipated: Arizona
and Jake Plummer at New Orleans and Kerry Collins on Dec. 20, with
the winner getting the last wild-card slot in the NFC.
	   That's what makes the NFC in its down cycle so easy to predict.
	   The NFL passed the 10-game mark Sunday. That's usually the time
the contenders in each conference become pretty clear, or the
situation looks pretty muddled.
	   In the NFC, it's clear; in the AFC, it's muddled.
	   ``Our long-term goal is to play them again _ in the playoffs,''
Plummer said after the Cowboys barely held off a late charge by the
Cards. Plummer, who threw for 465 yards to lead the nearly
successful comeback from a 28-0 deficit, is right, and the
Cardinals could see the Cowboys again.
	   A look at the playoff picture, starting with the clearer (and
weaker) NFC:
 &UR; NFC &QC; 
	   Only five of the 15 teams are over .500 and only two more, the
Saints and Cardinals, have broken even.
	   Consider the plus-.500 teams that are in: Minnesota (9-1),
Atlanta (8-2), San Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas (7-3).
	   Leave the final wild card to the Saints and Cardinals and give
Tampa Bay (4-6), an outside chance in a conference where 8-8 might
make it. The Bucs' toughest remaining games, Green Bay and
Pittsburgh, are at home; an 0-5 road record means they can lose
anywhere outside of Tampa.
	   Detroit (3-7) has a track record of making late charges, but
there's no way the Lions win five or six more with a schedule that
includes games at Tampa, Jacksonville and San Francisco and home
games with Pittsburgh and Atlanta.
	   More important are the seedings.
	   Dallas has all but clinched the inept East, two games ahead of
the Cards with a tiebreaker because it's beaten Arizona twice. With
a less than awesome schedule, the Cowboys could get a first-round
bye, particularly if they can beat Minnesota at home on
Thanksgiving, Nov. 26.
	   The Vikings are off to their best start since 1975, when they
began 10-0. If they can beat Green Bay at home next week, they
should win the division.
	   But that's a big if.
	   The Packers feel a lot better about themselves after thrashing
the Giants 37-3 Sunday. Yes, the Giants have given up, but the
Packers finally looked like the Packers.
	   ``This was a big game for us, more so from a confidence
standpoint,'' said tight end Mark Chmura. ``If we execute like we
did today, we're going to beat most teams.''
	   Atlanta, in a curious twist, plays the rest of its game in domes
as it attempts to hold its one-game lead over San Francisco in the
West. Its toughest game appears to be its finale, at home against
Miami.
	   But are the Falcons really good enough to cruise into New
Orleans or Detroit and breeze out? In other words, look out for
premature celebration _ playoffs, yes; division title, not yet.
	   ``We've been in far worse shape before,'' 49ers quarterback
Steve Young said after losing the Falcons on Sunday. ``We've won
all kinds of ways. We'll just have to find another way to win it
this year.''
	   Yes, the 49ers are a flawed team. But they're a flawed team with
a dangerous attitude.
 &UR; AFC &QC; 
	   Eleven of the 15 teams have at least some hope of making the
playoffs and only two truly seem safe: Denver, of course, and
Jacksonville (8-2), which has a two-game lead over Pittsburgh and
Tennessee in the Central.
	   Miami (7-3) leads the Jets and Buffalo by a game, still must
play at New England, Atlanta, and Oakland and at home for the Jets,
Oakland and Denver. The Denver game, on Monday night Dec. 21, could
be riveting if the Broncos are still unbeaten and shooting to
become the first team to go without a loss since the 1972 Dolphins.
	   In fact, looking at schedules is tough because everyone plays
everyone else. The odd team out in the East is probably the
Patriots (5-5), who must win home games with Miami and Buffalo the
next to weeks to remain a legitimate contender.
	   All this, of course, makes the wild-card race a jumble.
	   The Raiders (7-3) have the edge. Although they have to go to
Denver next week, they seem to have enough winnable games left to
get to 10 and maybe 11.
	   One key game: The Jets and Oilers (both 6-4) at Tennessee next
week.
	   Tennessee's playing consistently well, the Jets are coming off a
disaster in Indianapolis, which means Bill Parcells will have them
roaring.
	   A guess would give the Broncos and Jaguars their divisions, with
four more playoff teams being Miami and Oakland, plus some
combination of two from among the Jets, Oilers, Bills and Steelers.

Wife of Saddam's half-brother dies, officials say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 11th graf that Watban is Barzan al-Tikriti's
brother STED Mrs. al-Tikriti's brother. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The wife of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
half-brother has died in Switzerland, officials said Monday.
	   The cause of death was not clear, but the woman, Ahlam
al-Tikriti, had reportedly been under treatment for breast cancer.
She was 44.
	   A death notice for her appeared in the Monday edition of the
London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi. It was signed by
her husband, Barzan al-Tikriti.
	   An Iraqi Embassy official said he was told she died last week. A
hospital spokeswoman confirmed that Mrs. al-Tikriti had died, but
declined to give the cause or say when.
	   The death is expected to complicate the situation of her
husband, who earlier this year was ordered to return to Baghdad in
a shakeup of diplomatic posts.
	   He reportedly has cited his wife's illness as his reason for
staying in Geneva, against Saddam's orders.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations in
Geneva for 10 years.
	   He was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats recalled
to Baghdad.
	   Mrs. al-Tikriti was also the half-sister of Saddam's first wife,
Sajida, who is the mother of Saddam's two grown sons, Odai and
Qusai.
	   Mrs. al-Tikriti's daughter, Saja, was divorced from Odai in 1995
after complaining she was beaten.
	   The divorce sparked a sharp division in the family, which
worsened when Odai shot and wounded Barzan al-Tikriti's brother
Watban.
	   The Swiss government says Barzan al-Tikriti has until the end of
the month to leave Geneva under Swiss laws that allow U.N.
diplomats to stay on for three months after the end of their
tenure.
	   Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti is survived by six
children, ages 11 to 26.

Phillips back as Mets GM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steve Phillips returned as general manager of
the New York Mets on Monday, eight days after he took a leave of
absence to deal with a threatened sexual harassment lawsuit from a
former employee.
	   Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday said last week the
Phillips situation would be resolved one way or another by spring
training. They chose to end it sooner rather than later.
	   ``I needed to take the time away to spend with my family,'' said
Phillips, who said he inflicted a ``significant wound'' on his
loved ones.
	   ``One has to accept responsibility for choices and decisions
they make,'' he said. ``I don't think my credibility as a general
manager will be affected by this.''
	   The Mets have a sexual harassment policy, but do not explicitly
prohibit relationships between superiors and their workers. The
Mets still contend that the lawsuit from the former employee in the
team's Florida office has no basis.
	   ``I appreciate the support of the organization,'' Phillips said.
	   At the time he announced his leave of absence, Phillips
acknowledged having a consensual sexual affair with the woman, as
well as other extramarital affairs. The woman was fired last winter
when Phillips reorganized the team's minor league operations so
that all officials would work out of the main office in New York.
	   ``We're an organization, like most, that depends on humans,''
said David Howard, the Mets' chief legal officer. ``Mistakes
happen. ... The image of the organization was not a serious
consideration. This was a personal matter.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors are to return to
Baghdad on Tuesday in the first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate
fully in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
	   On Monday, the first U.N. relief workers who were pulled out in
fear of a U.S. military strike returned to Iraq. And diplomats
disclosed the behind-the-scenes drama in Baghdad that led to Iraq's
sudden announcement Saturday it would reverse course and end its
blockade of arms inspectors.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview that Iraq was being watched closely
to measure its resolve in cooperating with the U.N. inspectors
searching for forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was to leave Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and
council members on the situation.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 30 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   About 120 more U.N. humanitarian workers were due overnight on a
bus convoy through the Jordanian desert.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report that they have been able to resume work,
the council has said it will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi government
wants the review to lead quickly to the lifting of sanctions _ a
move both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross told The Associated Press in
Bahrain, where the weapons experts were evacuated last week, that
they expected ``full cooperation'' on their return.
	   ``They will be the first to know if the cooperation is full and
unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said.
	   There was great concern _ especially in neighboring countries _
that a missile strike would prompt Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to
ban UNSCOM forever, ending any hope of long-term monitoring to
prevent Iraq from rebuilding prohibited weapons.
	   Late Friday night, the ambassadors of France, Russia and China _
Iraq's defenders in the Security Council _ met with Foreign
Ministry officials to warn that the United States was serious about
a strike and urge Iraq to let the U.N. inspectors back. The Russian
ambassador carried a letter from President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Just hours later, at about 2 a.m. Saturday (2300 gmt Friday),
Iraq's ambassador in New York, Nizar Hamdoon, faxed a similar
appeal from Annan to the Iraqi leadership in Baghdad.
	   Iraq broke its silence 12-1/2 hours later, when Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz telephoned Shah to say that there would be a
``positive reply'' to Annan's letter.
	   But apparently the attack seemed close enough that Iraq wanted
to get word out publicly. So an Information Ministry official
issued a one-sentence statement at 3:30 p.m. (1330 gmt) Saturday to
the scores of Western reporters drawn to Baghdad by the crisis.
	   ``I have information that the leadership will respond positively
to Annan's letter,'' the official said.
	   By about 4:30 p.m., Iraq's formal response was read to Shah's
office for transmission by fax to Annan. A typed copy signed by
Aziz was delivered later.
	   The two-paged letter promised that Iraq would renew cooperation
with U.N. inspectors. Washington, however, viewed an attached annex
as containing unacceptable conditions and rejected the pledge as
unacceptable.
	   Later that night, it took repeated phone calls to Baghdad to
produce U.N. ambassador Hamdoon's three separate ``clarifications''
that Iraq's decision was unconditional _ which finally satisfied
the Americans.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief monitor in Kosovo warned
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that the observer
force won't tolerate intimidation, but seemed to back off
statements that his people were fired on by Yugoslav soldiers.
	   William Walker, the American who leads what eventually will be a
2,000-strong unarmed civilian force that is monitoring a Yugoslav
troop pullback, met with Milosevic and other officials for 90
minutes.
	   Walker said he was sent to see Milosevic ``to express our
concern with the perception that security in Kosovo has
deteriorated.''
	   The monitors, who are being overseen by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, eventually will spread out
throughout Kosovo, a province in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia
where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   He said the OSCE won't ``tolerate any intimidation from either
side.''
	   But Walker appeared to back down from statements Sunday that a
Yugoslav army convoy fired weapons over a car carrying diplomatic
observers.
	   ``Our people heard noises and thought they saw flashes from
muzzles,'' he said. The Yugoslavs claim the noises were three
vehicle backfires.
	   Walker said the incident is being looked into. He said the
Yugoslav army vehicle definitely turned and pointed a gun turret at
the observers. ``That in itself is unacceptable,'' he said.
	   Asked if the Serbs are in compliance with the agreement
Milosevic signed with American negotiator Richard Holbrooke, Walker
said: ``We have a difference of opinion on the question of full
compliance.''
	   Faced with NATO intervention, Milosevic on Oct. 12 agreed to
reduce his security forces in Kosovo, end a crackdown on the ethnic
Albanian rebels and allow international verifiers to observe his
compliance.
	   ``Yugoslavia sticks to the agreement,'' Milosevic said in a
statement after meeting Walker. He blamed any post-agreement
violence on the ethnic Albanians.
	   Walker's meeting with Milosevic came as ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo rejected a new initiative by Serbian
authorities for long-sought direct talks.
	   Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, denounced the latest offer as a ``propaganda'' move, and
said any negotiations must be held under United States and European
mediation.
	   Serb President Milan Milutinovic had proposed chairing
face-to-face talks with the ethnic Albanians in Pristina, with
international officials in attendance as guests but not as active
mediators.
	   Three violent incidents were reported in Kosovo on Monday, and
the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
ethnic Albanian leadership, reported two ethnic Albanian women were
wounded in one of them. The center said the two were wounded by
Serb police on a road about 16 miles north of Pristina.
	   Serb officials reported bouts of shooting by ethnic Albanians,
but no casualties.
	   Later Monday, the government released statistics claiming that
238 ``terrorist attacks'' occurred since the agreement, considered
a de-facto cease-fire. Most of them were against police with seven
policemen killed and 22 wounded, 12 heavily.

Parcells says he talked to Bledsoe, not to Johnson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Coach Bill Parcells insists he had nothing more
than a friendly chat with quarterback Drew Bledsoe and did not use
the conversation to disrupt the New England Patriots.
	   The U.S. National Football League is checking on that.
	   ``We have made an inquiry into the reported telephone
conversation to determine if there has been a violation of the
league's anti-tampering policy,'' Greg Aiello, the NFL's vice
president of public relations, said on Sunday.
	   Parcells welcomed the investigation.
	   ``Let's just take the deposition and we'll see who did what,''
the New York Jets coach said.
	   CBS television reported on Sunday that Bledsoe sought out
Parcells, his ex-coach at New England, for a handshake after the
Jets defeated the Patriots 24-14 on Oct. 19.
	   Parcells said he was so touched by the gesture that he called
Bledsoe the following week to thank him.
	   ``I called him to say thank you for coming up to me after the
game,'' the coach said. ``It was about a three-minute
conversation.''
	   In that conversation, Bledsoe mentioned that wide receiver Terry
Glenn would be unable to play the following weekend against Miami.
CBS said the Patriots claimed that Parcells then called Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson to advise him that Glenn would be out of the
lineup. The Dolphins defeated New England 12-9 the following
Sunday.
	   Parcells denied turning the information over to Johnson. ``I
didn't tell anybody anything,'' he said.
	   On Monday, Johnson confirmed no phone conversation had taken
place and accused the media of trying to create controversy.
	   ``I didn't talk to Parcells. I had no idea what was going on.''
	   CBS reported that the Patriots filed a tampering charge,
although the NFL did not confirm that. There is a long-standing
feud between Parcells and the Patriots dating back to his departure
from New England after the 1996 season to coach the Jets.
	   NFL policy says any contact between members of one organization
with players of another organization could potentially interfere
with employer-employee relationship. Clubs whose personnel engage
in such contact do so at their own risk and expose themselves to
disciplinary action, including forfeiture of draft choices.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced a doubling of U.S. aid to hurricane-ravaged
countries of Central America on Monday and French President Jacques
Chirac also brought a message of support.
	   Calling Hurricane Mitch ``the worst natural disaster in this
hemisphere that we have record of,'' Mrs. Clinton announced new aid
that brings the U.S. total to more than dlrs 250 million.
	   Local governments say at least 10,000 people died and hundreds
of thousands were left homeless as Mitch rampaged across Nicaragua,
Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala from Oct. 25 to the first week
of November.
	   More deaths could come from disease in the storm's aftermath,
she warned on arrival in Honduras on Monday, ``so we're not by any
means through.''
	   President Bill Clinton on Saturday announced dlrs 45 million in
additional aid for the region, bringing the total U.S. commitment
so far to more than dlrs 126 million.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, Mrs. Clinton announced new
plans that would double that _ adding 16 new helicopters to the 39
already in the region and bringing U.S. troop strength in the area
to 5,600 from 1,300.
	   She announced some dlrs 55 million in additional military-based
aid such as roadbuilding, medical detachments and water
purification, and dlrs 51 more in food aid.
	   The United States will also cancel two years of debt payments
from Honduras and Nicaragua _ about dlrs 54 million worth, she
said.
	   Mrs. Clinton opened her rapid visit to the region at Soto Cano
Air Base, a center for U.S. relief efforts some 30 miles (50 kms)
northwest of Tegucigalpa.
	   Standing atop a makeshift podium based on boxes of bottled water
brought in as aid, she praised the servicemen's efforts as ``heroic
and important and significant.''
	   She also praised the ``the great spirit'' of the Honduran
people, ``who are willing to literally pull up their sleeves and
dig themselves out.''
	   Chirac arrived a few minutes earlier in the capital, Tegucigalpa
aboard a camouflage-painted C-160 cargo plane, calling television
images of Hurricane Mitch's destruction ``impressive.''
	   He joined Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse in a minivan
for a quick tour of flood-damaged areas in the city. The first
visit to Honduras by a French head of state was scheduled to last
less than three hours.
	   Before leaving Guatemala, Chirac said that France would forgive
the debts of Guatemala and El Salvador in addition to those of
Nicaragua and Honduras, to help those countries recover from Mitch.
The total for the four countries was dlrs 134 million.
	   Chirac also suggested creation of a Central American
reconstruction fund, to be overseen by the World Bank. Chirac
arrived in Guatemala for a previously scheduled trip on Saturday.
He extended his trip to visit Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   Despite the pledges of much-needed aid, one U.S. military
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, complained that visits
by dignitaries were using aircraft, personnel and airport space
that could have gone to the relief effort.
	   In Guatemala, Chirac promised that France would help the country
recover from its 36-year civil war, which ended only two years ago.
	   ``France can help you consolidate peace and democracy,'' he told
the nation's congress Monday morning, speaking of economic and
educational aid.
	   Spain's Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon, meanwhile, flew to
Guatemala from El Salvador. He said his country had pledged dlrs
113 million in credit or donations to the affected nations.
	   On Monday, the prince visited the site of a toppled bridge on
the Lempa River, about 40 miles (70 kms) east of San Salvador and
visited a school sheltering 211 refugees.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Self-proclaimed anarchists pelted Greece's
premier and education minister with eggs and tomatoes Monday during
a ceremony to mark a 1973 student uprising against military rulers.
	   An office belonging to former Public Order Minister Sifis
Valirakis was later firebombed in central Athens. Four people
working inside the second floor apartment were not injured.
	   Premier Costas Simitis and Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis
hastily left the ceremony after placing wreaths outside the Athens
Polytechnic, where as many as 37 students died in clashes with
soldiers and police on Nov. 17, 1973.
	   Police said the attack against Valirakis' office was carried out
using three camping gas canisters soaked in gasoline. Although such
attacks have become commonplace in the capital, they usually
intensify during the anniversary of the polytechnic uprising.
	   Police said a group calling itself the ``Children of November''
claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to an Athens
newspaper. The group claimed the attack was in retaliation for the
arrest of more than 500 self-proclaimed anarchists and others who
occupied and torched parts of the Polytechnic University during the
1995 anniversary of the uprising.
	   A range of self-proclaimed leftist and anarchists groups,
including Children of November, have carried out nearly 200 arson
attacks against cars and offices this year. Most have been aimed at
diplomats, government officials and offices, foreigners and
journalists.
	   The polytechnic student rebellion was credited with helping
topple the 1967-74 military junta.
	   Arsenis reportedly received the worst of the bombardment by a
small group of demonstrators who claim to oppose all forms of
authority. Simitis' security guards shielded him with umbrellas.
	   Riots, including attacks on businesses and police, have often
followed the marches and memorials on the anniversary. Greece's
most deadly terrorist group, November 17, takes it name from the
day of the crackdown on the student revolt.

Crawley assaulted en route to team hotel

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England cricket officials said Monday
they will not take police action after middle order batsman John
Crawley was assaulted Sunday night while returning to the team
hotel.
	   England team manager Graham Gooch said Crawley was attacked by
an unknown man late Sunday night on a city street in the north
Queensland city.
	   Crawley had spent the night socializing with teammates and
members of the Queensland team, who the tourists played in a
four-day fixture which ended Monday with a one-wicket win by
England.
	   Gooch, who described the attack as unprovoked, said Crawley
suffered general bruising to his face, cuts and bruises above both
eyes and a cut above the top lip as a result of the assault.
	   The England team manager said Crawley was verbally abused and
then punched in the face by the assailant, causing the cricketer to
fall to the ground.
	   He said the incident happened as Crawley was returning alone by
foot to the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Cairns' city center.
	   ``John was naturally upset by the matter but other than cuts and
bruises to his face he is fine and fully fit,'' Gooch said.
	   ``We considered informing the police but John was keen to put
the matter behind him.''
	   Crawley did not attend the final day's play against Queensland,
spending the day at the team hotel resting.
	   Gooch said the facial injuries were unlikely to prevent Crawley
from playing in the first test against Australia starting in
Brisbane on Friday. (djp)

Canadiens and Blackhawks complete six-player deal

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The Montreal Canadiens traded defensemen Dave
Manson and Brad Brown and goaltender Jocelyn Thibault to Chicago
Blackhawks for goalie Jeff Hackett and defensemen Eric Weinrich and
Alain Nasreddine.
	   Both clubs have been struggling recently. Chicago (4-10-2) is
winless in 10 games and the Canadiens (6-8-2) have lost three
straight.
	   Thibault was drafted 10th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in
1993. He was dealt to the Canadiens, along with Andrei Kovalenko
and Martin Rucinsky, for Patrick Roy and Mike Keane in December
1995.
	   His record is 3-4-2 this season with a 2.61 goals-against
average.
	   Chicago has split goaltending duties among Hackett, Mark
Fitzpatrick and Andrei Trevilov.
	   Manson, a 14-year National Hockey League veteran, was traded to
Montreal from Phoenix in March 1997. He had four goals and 30
assists for Montreal last season.
	   He spent five seasons with the Blackhawks early in his career.
	   Brown had a goal and eight assists with Fredericton last season.
Montreal drafted him in the first round in 1994.
	   Thibault's contract calls for him to make dlrs 1.725 million
this season, while Manson earns dlrs 1.65 million and Brown dlrs
525,000.
	   Hackett is 2-6-1 this season with a goals-against average of
3.78. Weinrich has one goal and three assists in 14 games, while
Nasreddine had no points in seven games before being sent to
Portland of the AHL over the weekend. Weinrich is getting dlrs 1.7
million this season, Hackett dlrs 950,000 and Nasreddine dlrs
975,000.

Croat, two Muslims convicted of war crimes against Serbs

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ U.N. judges Monday handed down the
first international convictions for atrocities committed against
Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian civil war, including the panel's
first guilty verdict for rape.
	   A three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
convicted a Bosnian Croat and two Muslims for murdering and
torturing, as well as raping, Serb prisoners at the Celebici camp
in central Bosnia in 1992.
	   But they acquitted Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander
accused of having overall control of the camp, saying there was not
enough evidence to link him to atrocities.
	   The guilty verdicts were the first by an international court
since post-World War II tribunals in Tokyo and Nuremberg, Germany,
to hold superiors responsible for the crimes of their subordinates.
	   The 20-month trial also broke new ground of another kind: It was
the first to focus on atrocities against Serbs, who are blamed for
the majority of war crimes carried out during the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict.
	   ``We have been appalled by the details of your criminal
actions,'' Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria told
the Celebici camp's deputy commander, Hazim Delic, a Muslim
sentenced to 20 years in prison for the rape, murder and torture of
prisoners.
	   ``You displayed a singular brutality in causing the deaths of
two men ... and a calculating cruelty in the torture and
mistreatment of many others,'' Karibi-Whyte said.
	   Chewing gum given to him by a U.N. guard, Delic showed no
emotion when he heard the verdicts. In their 483-page ruling, the
judges said Delic appeared ``to take a sadistic pleasure in causing
the detainees pain.''
	   The camp's warden, Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty
of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for
overseeing guards who killed nine Serbs and tortured six. The fact
his subordinates carried out the crimes did not spare him
responsibility for their actions, the court said.
	   Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and a cross on a chain around his
neck, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years imprisonment.
Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said he was considering appealing
the ``inadequate'' sentence.
	   A camp guard, Esad Landzo, was ordered jailed for 15 years for
murdering three inmates and torturing others.
	   Prosecutors said Landzo and Delic beat to death one man and
nailed the badge of a Muslim political party to the victim's head.
They said Landzo also beat a 60-year-old man to death with a wooden
plank.
	   Although they were convicted, Mucic, Delic and Landzo also were
acquitted of 34 charges, including several counts of murder and
torture. All four had faced up to life imprisonment.
	   Mucic, Delic and Landzo will likely serve their sentences in
prison in either Italy, Norway or Finland, countries which have
agreed to house war criminals convicted by the tribunal.
	   Blewitt said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal.
	   Serbs account for most of the 56 publicly indicted suspects, and
they have accused the tribunal of being biased against them.
	   ``This is completely unbelievable, a gross injustice,'' Dragan
Cavic, deputy president of Bosnia's hard-line Serbian Democratic
Party, said Monday after the acquittal of Delalic, a Muslim.
	   Blewitt, however, said prosecutors were currently working on
more investigations involving Serbs as the victims of war crimes.
	   Mirza Hajric, an adviser to the Muslim member of the Bosnian
joint presidency, told Associated Press Television News that
Monday's decision proved that even if atrocities were committed by
the Muslim-dominated Bosnian army, ``they were committed by
individuals.''
	   ``All responsible will pay for their crimes,'' he said.
	   Before Monday, the court had convicted a Bosnian Serb and a
Bosnian Croat who admitted taking part in a Bosnian Serb army
massacre of Muslims. Another Bosnian Serb has admitted murdering 12
Muslims.
	   Last month, a U.N. tribunal prosecuting war crimes committed
during the 1994 Rwandan genocide convicted a former mayor from that
Central African country of rape, as well as genocide and crimes
against humanity.
	   It was the first time an international court had punished sexual
violence in a civil war and the first time rape was found to be an
act of genocide aimed at destroying a group.
	   The Military Tribunal for the Far East, also as known as the
Tokyo Tribunal, convicted Japanese officers of rape during their
country's World War II occupation of neighboring Asian countries.

Raiders' Allen out for season with knee injury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Cornerback Eric Allen, one of the
major reasons the Oakland Raiders have gone from the National
Football League's worst defense in 1997 to one of its best this
year, will miss the rest of the season with a torn ligament in his
left knee.
	   Allen, tied for second in the NFL with five interceptions, was
injured in Sunday's 20-17 victory over Seattle.
	   ``The most frustrating thing is my two little kids won't see me
play,'' Allen said Monday. ``It's ironic to end the season on an
interception.''
	   Allen said he expects to have surgery this week. Allen has
missed only one game in his 11-year NFL career, against
Philadelphia in 1989, with an ankle injury.
	   He was injured while returning an interception in the first half
of Sunday's game.
	   ``It wasn't like a pop,'' he said. ``It was like a rubber band.
It stretched but it didn't pop.''
	   Allen, obtained by the Raiders in a March trade from the New
Orleans Saints, has joined rookie cornerback Charles Woodson in
transforming the Raiders' offense. Oakland ranks second overall in
defense in the league.
	   ``It's going to be difficult to replace his level of play,''
free safety Albert Lewis said. ``We have some people that can come
in, but whether they can play at Eric's level is a question. It's a
tremendous loss.''
	   Allen's injury further decimated a secondary that already was
missing starting free safety Eric Turner because of a sprained
right foot that has kept him out of the lineup since Oct. 11. Also,
strong safety Anthony Newman hurt a toe and ankle Sunday against
Seattle.

Mexicans lament end of tortilla subsidies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For generations, impoverished Mexicans could
always count on cheap tortillas _ subsidized by the government _ to
help fill their stomachs.
	   That era may be coming to an end.
	   Finance Undersecretary Martin Werner announced over the weekend
that Mexico has removed most subsidies from corn tortillas and
plans to lift price controls Jan. 1. The government is paring
spending to help bolster an economy buffeted by the global
financial crisis and the sharp drop in oil prices.
	   On Monday, consumers were quick to complain.
	   ``They are taking away what helps us the most,'' said housewife
Mary Huerta, who was lined up at a neighborhood tortilla shop to
buy her family's usual daily supply of tortillas, about 4.5 pounds,
costing 6 pesos or about 60 cents.
	   ``It's practically the only thing we eat,'' she said.
	   A shopkeeper scooped up the hot tortillas as they dropped off a
creaking machine and stacked them onto a towel Huerta had brought
in order to save the 30 centavos (3 cents) that wrapping paper
would have cost.
	   ``It's really very tough, because we can't get by on what our
husbands make,'' said another housewife, Marina Hernandez, a
31-year-old mother of four. She said her husband, a construction
worker, makes the minimum wage of dlrs 3 a day.
	   It's unclear what tortillas, left to free-market forces, without
any subsidies or price controls, might cost. Tortillas handmade of
premium corn sometimes cost several times the official price at
local markets.
	   Officials insist the poor will not be left unprotected: they
will receive some sort of direct aid to buy tortillas, though the
form of aid has not yet been announced.
	   Even so, any price increase is a sensitive issue in a country
where most Mexicans earn far less than dlrs 10 a day.
	   But Mexico's two leading tortilla corn-flour producers on Monday
praised the plan.
	   ``The economy will benefit from a free and open market,'' said
Javier Velez, chief financial officer of the country's largest
tortilla flour producer, Grupo Maseca.
	   ``This subsidy was very inefficient and expensive because it
subsidized 100 percent of consumers,'' not just the poor, Velez
said. Minsa is the second largest corn-flour producer.
	   A sharp drop in world prices for Mexico's crucial oil exports
has forced the government to reduce its spending to a 20-year low
while it increases the prices for government-controlled goods and
services.
	   The government also announced a 15-percent increase in gasoline
prices last week.
	   ``It's highway robbery,'' said government worker Vicente Cardona
as he bought gas for his 1978 Dart wagon. ``It isn't fair. Why
doesn't the government rise our wages?''
	   President Ernesto Zedillo and his predecessors had gradually
reduced subsidies on other key foods _ ranging from flour to oil to
beans _ in recent years. But none had dared the risky step of
allowing prices to rise on Mexico's staple food.
	   ``Zedillo and his officials don't care about the people's
hardships,'' said construction worker Jose Antonio Gonzalez as he
waited to buy tortillas for lunch. ``Everything goes up but our
wages stay the same.''

Attorney general blocks fresh bid to try Pinochet under British
</HEADLINE>
law &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As a panel of judges considers whether to free
Gen. Augusto Pinochet or let Spanish extradition proceedings
continue, Britain's attorney general on Monday blocked a fresh bid
to have the former Chilean dictator tried under British law for
torture and hostage-taking.
	   John Morris said there was ''insufficient admissible evidence''
to bring criminal proceedings against Pinochet, arrested in a
London clinic on Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant alleging he murdered
Spanish citizens in Chile. A second Spanish warrant accuses him of
murder, torture and hostage-taking.
	   Lawyer Geoffrey Bindman, representing human rights groups, had
presented Morris with fresh evidence of alleged torture and
disappearances during Pinochet's 17-year rule. It was their third
attempt to bring a criminal prosecution against the 82-year-old
former leader.
	   Separately, five judges at the House of Lords, Britain's highest
court, must decide whether to endorse a High Court ruling that
Pinochet's arrest was illegal because British law grants former
heads of state immunity from prosecution for deeds committed while
in office.
	   Lawyers for the Spanish government appealed the High Court
decision, saying Pinochet's crimes were so heinous as to be beyond
immunity.
	   At the end of a six-day hearing Thursday, the judges gave no
indication when they will deliver their verdict.
	   A Chilean government report says Pinochet's deeds included
responsibility for the deaths or disappearances of some 3,000
people at the hands of secret police after he toppled an elected
Marxist, President Salvador Allende, in 1973.
	   Pinochet, who stood down in 1990, is under police guard in a
London hospital. Chile has protested his arrest, saying the crisis
risks undermining the country's new democracy.
	   France on Thursday submitted an extradition warrant for
Pinochet, a day after one came from Switzerland. Three French
families have filed complaints against the former leader in France.
	   On Tuesday, London magistrates are expected to set a date by
which Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide whether to authorize
the British courts to consider the Spanish extradition request.
	   Also Tuesday, Pinochet's lawyers are due back at the High Court
to ask for his bail conditions to be changed. Press Association,
the British news agency, said lawyers want to move Pinochet out of
the private Grovelands Priory Hospital, where he is recovering from
spinal surgery.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Horacio Carbonari scored in the 72nd minute to
salvage a 2-2 draw for Derby Monday at Nottingham Forest.
	   The draw gave Derby 18 points, allowing the Rams to hold eighth
place in England's Premier League. With the point, Forest moved up
to 18th place in the 20-team league.
	   Derby took a 1-0 lead in the 56th on Tony Dorigo's penalty, but
Dougie Freeman equalized for Forest a minute later and Pierre Van
Hooijdonk scored what looked to be the winner in the 62nd as Forest
was seeking it first Premier League win since Aug. 29.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who refused to join the club for three months
saying it lacked ambition, changed his mind just over two weeks
ago. He celebrated his first season goal on his own as teammates
initially declined to congratulate him. Several chanced their minds
as Forest fans showed their approval.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Calling the latest crisis with Iraq the
most serious since the 1991 Gulf war, chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler warned Baghdad on Monday that this is Iraq's last
chance to tell the truth about its weapons programs.
	   ``The material we need exists. It is in the possession of the
government of Iraq. They can choose to give it to us or not. It's
their call _ and it's the crucial call,'' he said in an interview.
``I hope they're listening because the consequences are very
severe.''
	   Butler said inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, which
is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
would return to Baghdad Tuesday afternoon.
	   ``Certainly, they'll be at work on Wednesday in full measure,''
he said. ``We'll see where that takes us.''
	   He said he was sending a letter to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Monday asking for unspecified materials for the
commission's operations in Baghdad.
	   Iraq banned spot weapons inspections on Aug. 5 and halted all
dealings with the commission, known as UNSCOM, on Oct. 31,
provoking the latest crisis.
	   In response, the United States carried out a major military
buildup and threatened force unless Iraq agreed to resume full
cooperation with the inspectors. Butler ordered the entire UNSCOM
team to leave Iraq last Wednesday because of the U.S. threat.
	   As U.S. warplanes prepared to attack early Saturday, the Iraqi
government delivered a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
announcing that it was reversing its ban.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton suspended the attack and announced
Sunday that the United States was giving Iraq another chance.
	   Now, Butler said, Iraq must fulfill its pledge to cooperate.
	   ``I think everyone in the world knows this is the last chance _
this is it,'' he said. ``Everyone is tired of the merry-go-round''
of constant crises with Iraq.
	   ``Everyone recognizes that this crisis is the most serious one
that took place since the Gulf War. It was minutes away from
serious military action,'' Butler said.
	   Butler said he hopes Iraq acts quickly in turning over material
to UNSCOM.
	   ``I can't set a time frame. I earnestly hope they set a time
frame _ which is to do it as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   Iraq agreed to the inspections under U.N. resolutions ending the
1991 Gulf War. But it has repeatedly clashed with the inspectors,
saying it has met its obligations and demanding an end to economic
sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said sanctions will only be lifted
after inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The Security Council has promised to conduct a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance once it resumes cooperation with the
inspectors from UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said his government
believes the comprehensive review is probably the best way to get
sanctions lifted.
	   The United States hopes Iraq has ``turned over a new leaf'' and
will be waiting to see if it keeps its promise to cooperate fully
with the inspectors, Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said
Monday.
	   ``We'll only know that by facts on the ground in the coming
days,'' he said.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said 30 humanitarian workers
evacuated last week returned to Baghdad on Monday from Amman,
Jordan. A second group of 100 humanitarian workers was to arrive
later Monday, and the remaining staff expected Wednesday.
	   Eckhard said 86 weapons inspectors were expected in Iraq on
Tuesday on a U.N. flight from Bahrain, and six others expected on
Wednesday.
	   Independent inspection agents who monitor the flow of relief aid
into Iraq for the United Nations also returned to three of four
border points Monday, Eckhard said.
	   Over 130 trucks carrying wheat and other supplies were stalled
at the Turkish and Syrian borders over the weekend because there
were no inspection agents to certify their cargoes. Suppliers can't
be paid until they produce an inspection certificate.
	   But U.N. spokesman John Mills said the flow of humanitarian aid
to Iraq would not be affected. Under U.N. resolutions, Iraq is
allowed to export limited quantities of oil primarily to pay for
food, medical supplies and reparations from the 1991 Gulf war.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Fighting in eastern Congo has driven
65,000 people from their homes since hostilities erupted in August
between rebel and government forces, the U.N. refugee agency said
Monday.
	   Rebels in eastern Congo have been trying since Aug. 2 to topple
President Laurent Kabila. At least half a dozen countries of the
region have allied themselves either with Kabila's forces or the
rebels and have sent troops into Congo, adding to concerns that
regional stability is threatened.
	   In a breakdown, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
fighting has driven more than 14,000 Congolese from the Lake
Tanganyika towns of Uvira, Baraka and Fizi across the lake to
Tanzania, and more than 100 refugees were crossing daily.

Weather lets up and search begins for Trudeau's son
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with helicopter flying over site, no signs of body. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ Helicopters crews saw no sign of
the youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau during an
aerial search Monday over the mountain lake where he is believed to
have drowned.
	   After an unexpected break in what had been snowy, foggy weather,
rescue workers began their hunt for Michel Trudeau, who was swept
into an icy lake by an avalanche Friday in southeastern British
Columbia
	   The RCMP diver leading the search team got his first aerial look
at the remote, glacier-fed lake Tuesday as helicopters bombed its
steep, snow-laden slopes with explosives to reduce the avalanche
hazard.
	   ``The lake is starting to freeze over,'' said Dave Poirier.
``The south end is pretty well inaccessible for us with the boat.''
	   ``There's nothing visible from the surface. We're just going to
have to go to the last seen point and try it from there,'' he said.
	   The divers must work quickly because Kokanee Lake was freezing
over, which could put the search on hold for weeks. Helicopter
crews prepared to drop explosives near the lake to clear an
avalanche hazard before divers headed in.
	   Police have not identified the others in the group, but
published reports say Trudeau, 23, and Andrew Bednarz, 23, were
thrown into the lake by the avalanche. Bednarz managed to pull
himself out.
	   The others reportedly in the group, Jeff Butcher, 22, and
Bradley Hamacher, 23, huddled with Bednarz to keep him warm.
	   ``They yelled at Mike `to swim, swim, swim' but basically just
watched him go under the water,'' Paul Sinclair, who was with the
group a day earlier, told the National Post.
	   Michel Trudeau, a passionate skier and outdoorsman like his
father, knew the risks at Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.
	   It is a popular spot for back-country hikers and skiers, said
area manager for the province's parks service, Steve Kent. But as
its popularity has grown so has the death toll, with 10 avalanche
fatalities in the last decade, including six killed in one slide in
January.
	   Police say Trudeau's group were knowledgeable about avalanche
hazards and survival techniques _ even carrying locator beepers in
case they were buried.
	   A spokesman for Pierre Trudeau issued a statement from Montreal
saying Michel's parents were deeply saddened. He said they
appreciated the many expressions of sympathy they have received and
asked that the family be given privacy.
	   The former prime minister has two other sons, Sacha and Justin.

Group attacks Dr. Bob Arnot's breast cancer prevention diet book
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Avice correct in 12th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A health watchdog organization issued a sharply worded critique
Monday of a TV doctor's best-selling diet book for preventing
breast cancer, calling it bad science and a disservice to women.
	   The American Council on Science and Health said Bob Arnot's book
makes unfounded claims about the power of food to both cause and
prevent breast cancer.
	   The book, ``The Breast Cancer Prevention Diet,'' was No. 1 on
The New York Times list of best-selling advice books on Sunday.
	   ``We are trying to clarify the lack of good science in this
book,'' said Elizabeth M. Whelan, the organization's president.
``We think this hurts women, absolutely.''
	   The organization posted its 17-page analysis on its Web site and
asked broadcasters that have promoted the book _ including Arnot's
employer, NBC _ for a chance to rebut some of its claims.
	   Arnot responded by calling the report ``voodoo consumerism, a
sham, an outright front for the food and chemical industry.''
	   The organization said more than half of its funding comes from
nonprofit foundations, while food and chemical companies provide
less than 30 percent.
	   In the book, Arnot wrote: ``Nutrition is emerging as the most
important way to prevent breast cancer.''
	   Among other things, the book recommends women eat soy, fish oil
and flax seed to prevent cancer. And it says they should minimize a
variety of common foods, including potatoes, white bread, instant
rice and parsnips.
	   While the links between diet and cancer are a hot subject of
research, many experts believe there are few definitive answers
yet. They recommend fruits and vegetables along with avoiding
obesity, but they generally say no diet has been proven to prevent
breast cancer.
	   Spokeswomen for the American Cancer Society and the
Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said their
organizations also have concerns about the book.
	   Avice Meehan, a spokeswoman for Memorial-Sloan Kettering, said
she called Arnot a few weeks ago to tell him doctors there were
unhappy with ``inaccuracies and misstatements'' regarding their
work. She said Arnot agreed to remove references to the hospital in
the book's next edition.
	   ``I do not believe it would be the opinion of our staff that
there is a diet that can prevent breast cancer,'' Meehan said.
	   At the cancer society, spokeswoman Joann Schellenbach said that
while the book's advice on losing weight and exercise is sound,
some of the nutritional material is highly speculative.
	   ``The title is probably the worst problem with the book,'' she
said. ``As far as we are concerned, there's no body of scientific
evidence to support the idea there is a diet that will prevent
breast cancer.''
	   Arnot said he firmly believes that women can reduce their risk
of breast cancer by changing what they eat.
	   ``Someone's got to get out in front and take a stand, and that's
what I've done with this book,'' he said.

Protesters hurl eggs, tomatoes during uprising ceremony

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Self-proclaimed anarchists pelted Greece's
premier and education minister with eggs and tomatoes Monday during
a ceremony to mark a 1973 student uprising against military rulers.
	   Premier Costas Simitis and Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis
hastily left the ceremony after placing wreaths outside the Athens
Polytechnic, where as many as 37 students died in clashes with
soldiers and police on Nov. 17, 1973.
	   An office of former Public Order Minister Sifis Valirakis was
later firebombed in central Athens with camping gas canisters
soaked in gasoline. Four people working inside the second floor
apartment were not injured.
	   Although such attacks have become commonplace in the capital,
they usually intensify during the anniversary of the polytechnic
uprising.
	   Police said a group calling itself the ``Children of November''
claimed responsibility in a phone call to an Athens newspaper. The
group said it was retaliating against the arrest of more than 500
self-proclaimed anarchists and others who occupied and torched
parts of the Polytechnic University during the 1995 anniversary of
the uprising.
	   A range of self-proclaimed leftist and anarchists groups,
including Children of November, have carried out nearly 200 arson
attacks against cars and offices this year. Most have been aimed at
diplomats, government officials and offices, foreigners and
journalists.
	   The polytechnic student rebellion was credited with helping
topple the 1967-74 military junta.
	   Arsenis reportedly received the worst of the bombardment by a
small group of demonstrators who claim to oppose all forms of
authority. Simitis' security guards shielded him with umbrellas.
	   Riots, including attacks on businesses and police, have often
followed the marches and memorials on the anniversary. Greece's
most deadly terrorist group, November 17, takes it name from the
day of the crackdown on the student revolt.

World Jewry struggles to define relationship with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; INCORPORATES Israel-U.S. Jews, Minor Editing &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It used to be simple. Diaspora Jews used to
feel close emotional ties to Israel. But today, the link is more
tenuous, threatened by growing assimilation and a more questioning
attitude toward the Jewish state.
	   In a push to strengthen the bond during this period of changing
relations, Jewish philanthropists are trying to raise dlrs 300
million for ``Birthright Israel,'' a project to bring Jewish youths
from around the world to Israel for 10 days of educational
programs.
	   Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company who helped
launch the project, said Monday he hoped the plan would help
strengthen Jewish life in places.
	   ``It gives them a real coming back to their roots,'' said
Bronfman, a strong supporter of Israel. ``This is where it all
started. It gives them a chance to look at Israel today, modern
Israel and gives them past, present, and hope for the future,''
Bronfman told The Associated Press.
	   The project is being kicked-off as part of the General Assembly,
an annual conference which opens Monday in Jerusalem. Attended by
some 3,000 North American Jewish community leaders and 1,500
Israelis, the GA is being held in Israel for the first time as part
of the country's 50th anniversary celebrations.
	   ``Intermarriage and assimilation threatens like a centrifugal
force to pull our people apart,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in a speech opening the convention. Intermarriage
among North American Jews is estimated at 40 percent and slightly
lower in Europe.
	   Of the Birthright Israel program, Netanyahu said ``I know that
nothing, nothing makes such an indelible impression on
(youngsters). They either stay here or go back forever changed as
Jews and they will touch the hearts and minds of other Jews,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Miami cardiologist Jerome Reich, 61, whose four sons have all
visited Israel, said such projects are crucial in sparking young
people's interest in their Jewish identity but do not embody the
entire Jewish experience.
	   A visit ``is an adrenalin shot but there must be follow-up,''
said Reich, a delegate at the GA.
	   Once Israel and World Jewry were closely bound by a shared past.
The wounds of the Holocaust, participation in the unfolding drama
of Israel as a fledgling nation battling for survival and even the
Yiddish language kept them united in spirit.
	   But, today the battles in a more secure Israel are less
glamorous, more complex, and harder to rally around. American Jews
generally practice the more liberal Reform and Conservative streams
of Judaism and feel alienated in Israel, where Orthodox Judaism has
the monopoly over religious practice. Most Jews outside of Israel
speak little Hebrew, and are less comfortable stating opinions on a
faltering peace process.
	   ``There is clear evidence of the distancing of American Jewry
from Israel,'' said Steven Cohen, a sociologist at Hebrew
University who studies American Jews.
	   ``Israel itself has presented far more ambiguous images and it
is difficult to maintain a one dimensional heroic, romantic,
idealized image of the Israeli,'' Cohen said.
	   Baruch Kostava, 47, a kibbutz member working as a representative
of the movement in New York City, spoke of the difficulties of
finding common dialogue between the communities he works to unite.
	   ``One builds a state not just around glory and euphoria but the
every day,'' he said.
	   Gail Hyman, Vice President of Marketing and Public Affairs for
the United Jewish Appeal, the largest fund-raising arm of the
Diaspora Jewish community, likened the relationship between the
communities to a maturing romance based more on a partnership
grappling with complex issues than fawning in adulation.
	   ``Maybe the first blush of romance is fading,'' Hyman said, ``We
can't live off the past.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky has signed a deal with Princess
Diana's biographer for a tell-all book about her affair with
President Clinton and will talk about the liaison for the first
time in an interview with Barbara Walters.
	   The deals were announced Monday by British publisher Michael
O'Mara, who put the book project together, and ABC News.
	   O'Mara refused to confirm news reports that the book deal runs
to seven figures, but the New York Post reported Monday that the
North American rights alone are worth that. The British news agency
Press Association said Morton and Ms. Lewinsky could earn more than
1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) from publication in Britain.
	   ``It wasn't the money, she could have got much higher prices
elsewhere,'' O'Mara said.
	   ``She likes the idea of an author who is used to writing
sympathetic books about women who have relationships with powerful
men.''
	   The chairman of London-based Michael O'Mara Books said there is
a ``strong personal chemistry'' between the former White House
intern and Morton, whose book, ``Diana: Her True Story,'' blew the
lid on the princess' troubled marriage to Prince Charles.
	   ``We put the two of them together in a New York hotel room last
week, and she said yes immediately,'' said O'Mara.
	   The book, to be called ``Monica's Story,'' will be published
simultaneously in the United States by St. Martin's Press of New
York, said spokesman John Murphy. It is expected to be in stores by
the summer.
	   ABC said Barbara Walters will conduct the first exclusive
television interview with Ms. Lewinsky for the network's ``20/20''
program.
	   The broadcast date will depend on when Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers
get permission from independent counsel Kenneth Starr for her to
speak publicly about the Clinton affair, ABC said. Her immunity
agreement contains a no-talk provision, and she must secure a
release from Starr's office before talking to anyone in the media.
	   Her ABC appearance will be for free, since major U.S. networks
don't pay for interviews. The deal does not allow her to sell the
foreign broadcast rights.
	   O'Mara said Morton already has conducted preliminary interviews
with his subject.
	   ``Monica is an intelligent, well-spoken, average American girl,
not the foolish bimbo that the press paints her as,'' he said.
``That is an image she very much wants to change.''

Boca: Seven points to championship; Chile's Colo Colo rolls on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Boca Junior's Martin Palermo has
done it again.
	   Tied 1-1 with lowly Talleres as regulation time was running out,
Boca needed three points to keep it's edge over Gimnasia in the
standings. The two teams are the remaining contenders for the
season's championship.
	   Undettered by a steady rain, Boca fans filled La Bombonera, the
team's stadium. They too knew the importance of a victory at home.
	   As the game moved into injury time and Boca pressed forward,
looking for a lift. Seconds before the final whistle, a leaping
Palermo used his left foot to push the ball past the Talleres
goalkeeper. Fans rushed forward to the field as the blond-haired
Palermo sprinted over to celebrate with them.
	   Palermo has tied the league record for goals with 16.
	   Meanwhile, Gimnasia also needed a goal in the game's closing
minutes to remain in the hunt. Gimnasia's Reggi headed home the
game-winner off a Messera free kick with five minutes left to beat
San Lorenzo 3-2.
	   Six points seperate Boca and Gimnasia in the standings. Boca
needs two wins and a tie in the season's final five games to go
take home the championship.
	   After stumbling last week, Chilean first division leader Colo
Colo bounced back with a 5-0 rout of Temuco. Second-place
Universidad de Chile struggled with a modest Coquimbo, relying on
some nifty one-on-one moves by striker Leonardo Rodriguez.
	   Showcasing one of the best individual moves of the season,
Rodriguez scored after receiving the ball just at the top of the
goal box area and eluding several defenders before chipping the
ball into the net.

English woman dies in yacht accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAREI, New Zealand (AP) _ An English yachtswoman died after
an accident Tuesday off the far north-east coast of New Zealand.
	   Anita Mary Dean, 52, of Hull, was found dead on the beach but
her 53-year-old husband Roger Dean survived, according to a police
report.
	   ``The Deans had left Fiji and for some four days battled into a
strong southeast wind,'' senior constable Shane Godinet said in a
statement.
	   They set anchor offshore but overslept and when they awoke they
were closer to shore than expected. They set off distress flares
which were spotted by residents on shore.
	   Inspector Janet Hope, of the police northern communications
center in Auckland, said local police found the yacht washed up on
the beach at Great Exhibition Bay.
	   It was not immediately known if the boat overturned or the woman
fell overboard.
	   A local fisherman, Bill Hopkins, said conditions were poor off
the bay.
	   ``It would have been quite horrendous,'' Hopkins said. ``That
was a big sea and it would be a quite horrendous surf.''

Stastny and Goulet inducted into Hockey Hall of Fame
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A city without a team held center stage at the
Hockey Hall of Fame on Monday when Peter Stastny and Michel Goulet,
who starred for the Quebec Nordiques, were inducted.
	   ``My heart belongs to that city,'' Stastny said of Quebec's
capital, which had a National Hockey League team from 1979 until
1995 when it was sold and moved to Denver to become the Colorado
Avalanche.
	   ``To the people of Quebec, hockey is a religion, and we had a
rivalry between Quebec City and Montreal that was special,''
Stastny said. ``It is too bad it had to end.''
	   Stastny, 42, now a scout with the St. Louis Blues, and Goulet,
38, now director of player development for the Avalanche, were
Nordiques teammates through the 1980s.
	   Both played 15 years. Stastny had 450 goals and 789 assists,
while Goulet had 548 goals and 604 assists, with four consecutive
seasons of 50-plus goals. Stastny finished up with the Blues and
Goulet with the Chicago Blackhawks, but they entered the Hall of
Fame as Nordiques.
	   ``I would be on the ice a half hour before everybody else,''
Goulet said of morning practices at Le Colisee. ``I would shoot
pucks _ skate down the wing on the left side and shoot pucks. I'm
convinced that's why I got better and better.''
	   Goulet joined the Nordiques in 1979 after a year in the defunct
World Hockey Association. Stastny signed on in 1980 along with
brother Anton after both defected from Czechoslovakia. Brother
Marian would soon follow.
	   ``I didn't hesitate when I got the chance,'' Stastny said. ``I
wanted to have the challenge to compete with the best players in
the world.''
	   Stastny was the NHL's rookie of the year. He and Goulet helped
the Nordiques made it to their conference final in 1982 and 1985.
	   The stick and puck Goulet used for his 500th NHL goal have been
in the Hall of Fame for five years, but he'd never stepped inside
until Monday.
	   ``As a young boy, you never dream of something like this,'' he
said of his induction. ``You just want to play in the NHL, and to
be on the wall with all the best players, this is heaven.''
	   Also inducted were the late Roy Conacher in the veteran player
category; Monsignor Athol Murray, who created the hockey program at
Notre Dame College in Wilcox, Saskatchewan in the builder category;
Yvon Pedneault, the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for journalism;
and Howie Meeker, the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for
broadcasting.

Satellite operators move to protect them from meteor storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Satellites were being maneuvered Monday to
reduce the possibility of damage as Earth moved through debris in
the tail of a comet that was expected to produce the heaviest
meteor shower in decades.
	   The space storm was expected to peak Tuesday, exposing the
world's 600-plus satellites to possible collisions with speeding
particles of grit from comet Temple-Tuttle.
	   The particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can poke
holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings or
cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   While private and government satellite operators took
precautions to reduce exposure during the 10-hour Leonid meteor
storm, the odds were against any satellites actually being damaged,
experts said.
	   ``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle
is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,
some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, a
senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, California.
	   Greenwich, Connecticut-based PanAmSat, which operates a network
of 18 satellites, put the odds at one in 20,000.
	   ``We fully expect that the meteor storm will be a non-event,''
said Dan Marcus, a spokesman for PanAmSat, whose fleet serves The
Walt Disney Co., Time-Warner, the BBC, long-distance telephone
companies MCI and Sprint, and other big corporate customers.
	   Even so, PanAmSat put additional personnel on duty at its Long
Beach, California, operations center, which monitors company
satellites plus three others it manages for DirecTV, Hughes
Electronics' satellite-to-home TV business.
	   Government agencies took similar measures. The Hubble telescope
was being turned away from the storm to protect lens surfaces. And
the crew of the Russia's Mir space station was to wait out the
worst of the storm in their emergency escape vehicle.
	   Temple-Tuttle passes near the Earth every year, but the
resulting meteor shower intensifies every 33 years. First reported
by Chinese astronomers in 902, the storms are known as Leonid
showers because they appear to come from the constellation Leo.
	   In 1966, when there were fewer than 100 satellites in orbit, the
comet produced showers of 144,000 meteors per hour, but the show
resulted in no major damage. This time, the shower was expected to
range from 5,000 to 100,000 meteors per hour.
	   Although tiny, the particles move at more than 155,000 mph
(250,000 kph). Even a small grain can have great destructive force.
The impact of a particle also creates an electrical discharge that
could cause a satellite to short out.

O'Meara tries to extend dream season in Grand Slam of Golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Mark O'Meara already has won the
Masters, the British Open and the World Match Play Championship.
Starting Tuesday in Hawaii, his dream season has a chance to get
even better.
	   In the hardest tournament to get into, O'Meara, U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen, PGA champion Vijay Singh and Tiger Woods will
square off in match play in the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay
Resort Golf Course on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.
	   The event brings together the winners of the four major
championships. Because O'Meara won two majors, Woods qualified by
having the best overall record in the majors.
	   The format has changed this year from 36-hole stroke play to two
rounds of matches, with O'Meara playing Singh and Janzen going up
against Woods in Tuesday's first round. The winners will meet in
the finals on Wednesday.
	   ``This has been a great year for myself and my family,'' O'Meara
said Monday in a conference call from Hawaii. ``What transpired at
the Masters and the British Open is something I'll never forget.''
	   Singh will do well to forget what happened at the World Match
Play Championship in England last month, when O'Meara handed him
the worst beating in the 35-year history of the event by closing
out their semifinal match at 11 and 10.
	   O'Meara went on to beat Woods 1-up in the finals with a birdie
putt from the fringe on the last hole.
	   Should O'Meara get past Singh, it's possible he'll see Woods in
the finals again. Is a repeat performance in the works?
	   Based on what transpired in the Tour Championship three weeks
ago, O'Meara isn't so sure. Singh set a course record at East Lake
Golf Club with a first-round 63 and wound up losing to Hal Sutton
in a playoff.
	   ``He was playing with Tiger and came to the 18th at 8-under,''
O'Meara said of Singh's first round. ``I looked at him and said,
'Vijay, what course are you playing?' And he said, `I'm getting
ready for you, baby.'''
	   Singh has a strong history of match play. He won the World Match
Play in 1997 and is one of only three players from the
International team with a winning record in Presidents Cup matches.
	   ``Whenever I play Vijay, I've got my hands full,'' O'Meara said.
``I've got to play well tomorrow to repeat that. All you can do is
give it your best.''
	   Singh, who won his first major at Sahalee Country Club and then
won the Sprint International a week later, is coming off a
two-stroke victory over Jesper Parnevik in the Super Tour, where
four rounds were played in four Asian countries.
	   ``I'm very fond of it,'' Singh said of the match play format.
``It gives you a chance to be aggressive. My mode is not to give
holes away and make a lot of pars and birdies.''
	   Janzen and Woods will each be playing the PGA Grand Slam of Golf
for the second time. Janzen tied for third in 1993, the year he won
his first Open at Baltusrol, when the event was moved from Hawaii
to California because of a hurricane.
	   Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, finished three strokes behind
Ernie Els last year at Poipu Bay.
	   The dlrs 1 million event, which awards dlrs 400,000 to the
winner, has been played continuously since 1988 and first started
in 1979.
	   ``This format will make a huge difference,'' Woods said. ``You
can be a lot more aggressive.''

Odd word association: Falcons and Super Bowl

<TEXT>
	   SUWANEE, Georgia (AP) _ Terance Mathis rolled back his head and
chuckled nervously, as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing.
	   In the third week of November, a time when Atlanta has usually
dropped off the National Football League radar screen, someone
asked Mathis if the Falcons were a legitimate Super Bowl contender.
	   ``It's probably deep, deep in a lot of guys' minds,'' the
Atlanta receiver said Monday. ``It's deep in my mind. But I'll keep
preaching what I've said since day one: one step at a time, one
game at a time, one journey at a time.''
	   So far, the season has been an amazing, wonderful journey for
the Falcons (8-2), who find themselves leading the NFC West after
Sunday's 31-19 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.
	   Will they suddenly wake up and find it's all been a dream? Or,
in a season when the more dominant teams seem to be in the AFC, can
an organization such as the Falcons catch an unlikely wave and ride
it all the way to the Super Bowl?
	   ``You've got to keep things in perspective,'' coach Dan Reeves
said. ``I would love for it to happen. It would be beyond anything
I possibly dreamed about prior to the season.''
	   Only one NFC team, Minnesota (9-1), has a better record than
Atlanta, which definitely finds itself looking beyond just making
the playoffs. There are more ambitious goals to pursue, like a
first-round bye and home-field advantage _ all reasonable since the
Falcons have just one team with a winning record left on the
schedule.
	   ``To get as many home games as we can get during the playoffs is
very, very important, especially in the NFC,'' Mathis said. ``We
don't want to go to Green Bay in January. We don't want to go to
San Francisco in January.''
	   Of course, if you had asked the Falcons about those same
possibilities just a few months ago, everyone would have willingly
jumped on the plane. This is a team that has won only two playoffs
games in 32 years and captured its lone division title in 1980.
	   ``I guess I'm a little hesitant about going overboard,'' Reeves
said. ``We've got to continue to do the things we've been doing.
It's such a fragile position we're in, I appreciate it a lot
more.''
	   He probably realizes the season could collapse with a key injury
or two (quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson
immediately come to mind).
	   Plus, the victory over the 49ers was the first against one of
the NFL's truly elite teams since the Falcons began a 14-4 streak
at the midway point of 1997.
	   But Reeves also has been encouraged by the Falcons' resiliency.
	   They have overcome injuries to key players, such as defensive
tackle Travis Hall, cornerback Ronnie Bradford and return
specialist Tim Dwight.
	   They thrived during the toughest part of their schedule, winning
41-10 at New England before coming home to beat the 49ers in front
of the first home sellout in more than three years.
	   ``When we walk on the field, we're not in awe of anybody,''
Reeves said. ``It's not like we've been lucky to win. When we do
what we're supposed to do, the attitude is we're going to win.
There's no false sense of anything.''

tapes by the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday; EDITS throughout

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky has signed a deal with Princess
Diana's biographer for a tell-all book about her affair with
President Clinton and will talk about the liaison for the first
time in an interview with Barbara Walters.
	   The deals were announced Monday by British publisher Michael
O'Mara, who put the book project together, and ABC News.
	   O'Mara refused to confirm news reports that the book deal runs
to seven figures, but the New York Post reported Monday that the
North American rights alone are worth that. The British news agency
Press Association said Morton and Ms. Lewinsky could earn more than
1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) from publication in Britain.
	   ``It wasn't the money, she could have got much higher prices
elsewhere,'' O'Mara said.
	   ``She likes the idea of an author who is used to writing
sympathetic books about women who have relationships with powerful
men.''
	   The chairman of London-based Michael O'Mara Books said there is
a ``strong personal chemistry'' between the former White House
intern and Morton, whose book, ``Diana: Her True Story,'' blew the
lid on the princess' troubled marriage to Prince Charles.
	   ``We put the two of them together in a New York hotel room last
week, and she said yes immediately,'' said O'Mara.
	   The book, to be called ``Monica's Story,'' will be published
simultaneously in the United States by St. Martin's Press of New
York, said spokesman John Murphy. It is expected to be in stores by
the summer.
	   ABC said Barbara Walters will conduct the first exclusive
television interview with Ms. Lewinsky for the network's ``20/20''
program. That appearance will be for free, since major U.S.
networks don't pay for interviews. The deal does not allow her to
sell foreign broadcast rights.
	   The broadcast date will depend on when Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers
get permission from independent counsel Kenneth Starr for her to
speak publicly about the Clinton affair, ABC said. Her immunity
agreement contains a no-talk provision, and she must secure a
release from Starr's office before talking to anyone in the media.
	   But for those who can't wait to hear Ms. Lewinsky's side of the
story, they can get a quick dose of the former intern's own words
when the House Judiciary Committee releases on Tuesday the audio of
the infamous Linda Tripp tapes. While the transcripts were released
this fall, the tapes will present the first opportunity for most
people to hear Ms. Lewinsky's voice.
	   The 37 tapes contain 22 hours of expletive-deleted private
musings from Ms. Lewinsky dissecting her relationship with Clinton.
	   The tapes serve as a curtain-raiser of sorts to the start of the
first presidential impeachment hearings by the Judiciary Committee
on Thursday.

NBA's No. 1 draft pick might play in Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Monday's developments &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With no end in sight to the National Basketball
Association lockout, overall No. 1 draft pick Michael Olowokandi
might go to Europe to play professionally.
	   ``If they cancel the season, or if the season doesn't start
until the latter part of December, then I'll go,'' Olowokandi said
Monday. ``It's not like I already have my bags packed, but it's a
good possibility.''
	   The lockout went through its 139th day Monday. Commissioner
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter have not spoken to each
other during the 10 days since the last negotiating session, and no
collective bargaining talks are scheduled.
	   The latest casualty of the lockout was the NBA Jam Session, an
interactive fan event scheduled during All-Star game festivities.
The league said vendors and sponsors could not set up in time. The
game is still scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
	   Olowokandi's agent, Bill Duffy, said he has had preliminary
talks with Efes Pilsen, a club team in Turkey, and would advise his
client to play overseas if he receives an offer worth dlrs 5
million.
	   ``If we're in the same position with the lockout two weeks from
now, then we have to look at it very seriously. I know interest is
there in Turkey, and I've also talked to teams in Italy and
Greece,'' Duffy said.
	   Olowokandi, a Nigerian citizen, is trying to get a British
passport so he can be excluded from a European league rule limiting
teams to two foreigners.
	   Still, he would not need a British passport to play for Efes
Pilsen since that club does not have any non-Europeans on its
roster.
	   If Olowokandi signs overseas, he would risk the dlrs 10 million
he stands to earn from the Los Angeles Clippers in the first three
years of his rookie contract. Also, it would mean the 7-footer (2.1
meters) from Pacific would have to wait an additional year for free
agency or to be eligible for a lucrative extension to his NBA
contract.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Olowokandi said he is
itching to play basketball again.
	   ``If there's no resolution, I have to do something. If it means
going to Europe to take care of myself on financial terms and to
prove myself, then I don't have a problem doing that for one
season,'' he said. ``Hopefully this lockout is going to end soon,
but you never know. It could extend into next season.''
	   Three other first-round picks from last June's draft are
currently playing in Europe.
	   Dirk Nowitzki, chosen ninth overall by Milwaukee before being
traded to Dallas, is playing for DJK Wurzburg in Germany. Radoslav
Nestrovic, picked 17th by Minnesota, is playing out the final
season of his contract for Kinder Bologna in Italy, and Vladimir
Stepania, chosen 27th by Seattle, is playing for Olympia Ljubljana
of Slovenia.
	   Six second-round picks also are playing professionally in
Europe: Ruben Patterson of Cincinnati (Lakers, 31st overall) with
AEK Athens, DeMarco Johnson of UNC-Charlotte (Knicks, 38th) with
Sony Milan in Italy, Andrew Betts of Long Beach State (Hornets,
50th) with Team System Bologna in Italy, Derrick Dial of Eastern
Michigan (Spurs, 52nd) with Peristeri of the Greek League, Ryan
Bowen of Iowa (Nuggets 55th) with Oyak Renault in Turkey and
Torraye Braggs of Xavier (Jazz, 57th) with Caja Cantabria of the
Spanish League.
	   Vlade Divac, who became a free agent after playing for the
Charlotte Hornets last season, has talked of joining Kinder Bologna
until the lockout ends.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced a doubling of U.S. aid to hurricane-ravaged
countries of Central America on Monday and French President Jacques
Chirac also brought a message of support.
	   Calling Hurricane Mitch ``the worst natural disaster in this
hemisphere that we have record of,'' Mrs. Clinton announced new aid
that brings the U.S. total to more than dlrs 250 million.
	   Local governments say at least 10,000 people died and hundreds
of thousands were left homeless as Mitch rampaged across Nicaragua,
Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala from Oct. 25 to the first week
of November.
	   More deaths could come from disease in the storm's aftermath,
she warned on arrival in Honduras on Monday, ``so we're not by any
means through.''
	   President Bill Clinton on Saturday announced dlrs 45 million in
additional aid for the region, bringing the total U.S. commitment
so far to more than dlrs 126 million.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, Mrs. Clinton announced new
plans that would double that _ adding 16 new helicopters to the 39
already in the region and bringing U.S. troop strength in the area
to 5,600 from 1,300.
	   She announced some dlrs 55 million in additional military-based
aid such as roadbuilding, medical detachments and water
purification, and dlrs 51 more in food aid.
	   The United States will also cancel two years of debt payments
from Honduras and Nicaragua _ about dlrs 54 million worth, she
said.
	   Mrs. Clinton and Chirac later flew separately to Nicaragua,
where they were meeting with Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman.
 &UR; Mrs. Clinton opened, pick up 9th graf pvs.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on John Updike, John Travolta, George
Stephanopoulos and Monica Lewinsky, Julio Iglesias and Arturo
Sandoval. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ Author John Updike likes
biographies, of course. He'd rather not be part of one.
	   The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer took a look Friday at the
University of South Carolina's innovative way of bringing America's
biographers together in one room.
	   The university's Literary Biography Depository in an attempt to
collect a copy of every biography of every author and to make them
available to professors, students and the public.
	   Updike, who was also in town to receive the Thomas Cooper Medal
for literary achievement, said the depository is ``a flower in the
lapel of the university.''
	   Still, he'd rather not be a part of the collection.
	   ``For me, at least, it would be an uncomfortable feeling to
think about sharing my life, while I'm still trying to live it,
with a biographer,'' he said. ``I would feel crowded.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Travolta's love of flying began by gazing
up.
	   The superstar recalls as a child watching jets from New York's
LaGuardia International Airport flying over his home in nearby New
Jersey. Later, he built model planes with his dad.
	   ``I wanted my own little airliner in the backyard,'' Travolta
told Redbook magazine in its December issue.
	   He said he had his girlfriends wear the scouting uniforms and
pretend to be flight attendants. ``I was the captain and they would
have to pretend they were serving people.''
	   In the early years of his career, Travolta spent his acting
paychecks on flying lessons _ until, when he landed sitcom work
with ``Welcome Back Kotter,'' he could afford his own plane.
	   The actor still has his head in the clouds. He recently
moonlighted as the author of a children's book, ``One-Way Night
Coach,'' about flying.
	   ``I have often thought, maybe, it might be fun either starting
an airline, or being part of one that's already established and
making it better,'' Travolta said. ``It would be another side game
to play.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MICHIGAN CITY, Indiana (AP) _ George Stephanopoulos had his own
brush with Monica Lewinsky.
	   The former adviser to President Bill Clinton said Ms. Lewinsky
figured out he liked to have a double latte in the morning, so she
brought him one every day.
	   ``And every single morning, my assistant wouldn't let her
through the door,'' he said during a speech Sunday. ``And for that
I am eternally grateful.''
	   Stephanopoulos again criticized Clinton for the affair but said
Americans are tired of the scandal.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Julio Iglesias stayed in the air and
out of Indonesia because of riots.
	   The crooner was due in Jakarta on Saturday for a concert, but he
landed in Bali instead, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   At least 16 people have been killed since Thursday during street
protests.
	   ``The developments in Jakarta have prompted us to cancel Julio's
promo tour because we don't want to take any risk,'' said Sundari,
a spokeswoman for the sponsor. Sundari, like many people in
Indonesia, uses only one name.
	   ___
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Famed jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval has been
awarded U.S. citizenship after repeatedly being denied because he
was once a member of the Communist Party in Cuba, the musician's
representatives said Monday.
	   Sandoval, 49, received notice of citizenship last week. He will
be sworn in at the Federal Justice Building in Miami on Dec. 7,
said Carl C. Valldejuli, one of Sandoval's representatives.
	   ``Finally justice has prevailed. I never doubted that the
solution to my problem with INS would be resolved,'' Sandoval said.
	   In 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service sent
Sandoval a letter stating that citizenship applicants wouldn't be
naturalized if they had been members of the Communist Party within
10 years of their request.
	   Sandoval was granted political asylum in the United States in
1990. He spent more than two years seeking U.S. citizenship, only
to be denied twice.
	   Sandoval has performed with such jazz greats as Dizzy Gillespie.
His other accomplishments include performances at presidential
inaugural balls, countless musical recordings and concerts
worldwide.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials broke back above 9,000
Monday as stocks rose sharply before a Federal Reserve meeting
expected to produce another cut in interest rates. Closing at the
highest level since late July, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 91.66 points _ or by 1.03 percent _ to 9,011.25, with a late
burst of buying boosting the measure above 9,000 after several
failed forays earlier in the day. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Just weeks ago, the U.S. economy seemed on the
brink of big trouble. The stock market was plunging. A credit
crunch seemed imminent. Some economists were talking recession. But
now, after two interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and an
international rescue for Brazil, the outlook isn't nearly so grim.
For Federal Reserve policy-makers contemplating what would be the
third rate cut in seven weeks, the question is whether the
turnaround is too good to be true. So, what once seemed almost a
sure thing _ another rate cut at Tuesday's Fed monetary committee
meeting _ no longer is certain. Some analysts still expect a cut,
but others don't. (US-ECONOMY-TURNAROUND)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar fell Monday as tensions eased in the
Middle East after Iraq averted an airstrike by agreeing to resume
cooperating with U.N weapons inspectors. Demand for dollars also
was dampened by uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve would
cut interest rates Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted
at 120.07 yen in late New York trading, down from 122.72 late
Friday. The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 1.6677 marks,
down from 1.6841. (US-DOLLAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing widespread bankruptcy, Russia's banks
prepared themselves Monday for a stream of lawsuits from Western
partners after a three-month moratorium on Russia's foreign debt
repayments expired. Analysts say the debts coming due, estimated at
more than dlrs 6 billion, may deal a fatal blow to half of the
country's 1,500 commercial banks. Some western creditors have
already moved to freeze Russian bank assets abroad. A tidal wave of
lawsuits by Western creditors is expected within days, now that
even the most powerful Russian banks are facing severe cash
shortages. The development could be grim news for individual
Russian bank customers, most of whose accounts have been frozen
since August. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Shares of Germany's Hoechst AG and
France's Rhone-Poulenc rose Monday on reports that the chemical and
pharmaceutical giants were close to merging. Neither company would
comment on the rumors. Hoechst was up 5.6 percent in Frankfurt,
closing at 79.10 marks (dlrs 49). Rhone Poulenc shares rose 3.4
percent to close at 264.8 francs (dlrs 47.30) in Paris. Industry
sources and analysts said a full-blown merger would be difficult
and suggested the two companies might be considering merging only
their agricultural products divisions. A full merger wouldn't give
the new company exposure to the still-expanding U.S. drugs market,
where sales growth of about 10 percent a year is more than double
the European rate. (GERMANY-HOECHST-RHONE-POULENC)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cigarette makers have agreed to a dlrs 206
billion settlement of lawsuits by several U.S. states that would
prohibit tobacco companies from advertising on billboards, city
buses and T-shirts popular with teen-agers. But the deal does not
go as far as an earlier agreement that fell apart in Congress.
Eight state attorneys general reached the proposed deal with
tobacco companies after months of negotiation, and have sent the
proposal to all other states in hopes they, too, will join in.
Thirty-nine of the 50 U.S. states now are suing the tobacco
industry in hopes of recovering money spent treating sick smokers,
but seven others that have not sued the industry are eligible to
join the settlement also. (US-TOBACCO DEAL)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Faced with a cautious approach from France,
Germany's finance minister backed off his calls for a cut in German
interest rates Monday, saying he had been misunderstood. The
climbdown by Oskar Lafontaine, who has clamored for weeks for lower
rates to spur the economy, marked the meeting of the two countries'
finance ministers and central bank chiefs. With the center-left now
in power in both countries, Lafontaine and French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn said they broadly agreed on European
economic policy, including the need for a coordinated fight against
the continent's high unemployment. (GERMANY-FRANCE)

Catholics present calendar of millennium events in the Holy Land
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writethru &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Expressing hopes for peace, the Assembly of
Catholic Bishops in the Holy Land on Monday unveiled a calendar of
millennium celebrations that includes events aimed at bringing
together Muslims, Jews and Christians.
	   ``It will be an occasion to join all together, really to praise
God on this opportunity,'' said Bishop Kamal-Hanna Bathish, the
chief organizer of the celebrations commemorating the 2000th
anniversary of Jesus' birth.
	   Pope John Paul II has expressed a keen desire to visit Jerusalem
as part of the millennium celebrations, but has not announced
concrete plans to do so. Such a visit would require ``better
times,'' said the Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah.
	   ``The situation of conflict of the land is one main reason which
we or Rome cannot now decide on a date,'' he said.
	   The pope has declared the Holy Land and Rome as the two focal
points of the millennium celebrations.
	   The Vatican does not recognize Israel's claim to the entire city
of Jerusalem, including traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. It has
asked that sites holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims be protected
by an international statute.
	   The millennium celebrations will begin on Christmas Eve, Dec.
24, 1999 and run though Epiphany in January 2001.
	   The events follow the church's liturgical year, with special
celebrations marking feast days and seasons.
	   Among the events are prayer vigils on the last day of the
millennium, Dec. 31, 1999; pilgrimages to Christian sites; and a
day for weddings and renewal of vow at Cana, where according to the
Bible, Jesus performed his first miracle at a wedding feast by
turning water into wine.
	   Some of the year's events aim to create a dialogue between
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, said Father Robert J. Fortin.
Among these events are a meeting of the religions in Jerusalem and
an event for youth in Haifa.
	   Israel is expecting up to 4.5 million tourists, about twice the
usual number, during the millennium celebrations. Fortin, however,
said estimates were probably too high and that the number of
pilgrims would be limited by space in hotels.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors are to return to
Baghdad on Tuesday in the first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate
fully in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. The return of
U.N. personnel to Iraq began Monday, as 30 relief workers who had
pulled out in fear of a U.S. military strike arrived at a military
air base outside the capital, Baghdad, aboard a special U.N. plane
from Jordan. Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
envoy to Baghdad, said in an interview that Iraq was being watched
closely to measure its cooperation with U.N. inspectors searching
for forbidden weapons. And the chief U.N. weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, warned Baghdad in New York that this is Iraq's last
chance to tell the truth about its weapons programs. (IRAQ,
UN-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is waiting for Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to rescind threats of armed conflict before it will go ahead
with a West Bank troop withdrawal it agreed to in the latest
Mideast peace accord. A statement Monday by the Palestinian leader
saying he would honor the peace agreement fell short of Israeli
expectations when Arafat failed to mention his more inflammatory
remarks a day earlier, Israeli officials said. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the suspension of the
withdrawal, which was supposed to have taken place Monday, during
an address to parliament which began debating the accord.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore on
Monday cheered beleaguered Asian nations with offers of new
financial support, but angered his Malaysian hosts by praising the
country's anti-government protesters. Gore, serving as a
last-minute fill-in for President Bill Clinton at this year's
21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, announced a new
dlrs 10 billion support package for troubled Asian countries. Half
the money will come from the United States and the other half from
Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The Malaysian
trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, told reporters, ``It's the most
disgusting speech I've ever heard in my life.'' (APEC)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced a doubling of U.S. aid to hurricane-ravaged
countries of Central America on Monday and French President Jacques
Chirac also brought a message of support. Calling Hurricane Mitch
``the worst natural disaster in this hemisphere that we have record
of,'' Mrs. Clinton announced new aid that brings the U.S. total to
more than dlrs 250 million. Local governments say at least 10,000
people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless as Mitch
rampaged across Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala from

	   LONDON (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky has signed a deal with Princess
Diana's biographer for a tell-all book about her affair with
President Bill Clinton and will talk about the liaison for the
first time in an interview with Barbara Walters. The deals were
announced Monday by British publisher Michael O'Mara, who put the
book project together, and ABC News. O'Mara said Ms. Lewinsky was
drawn to the book idea because Andrew Morton, whose book, ``Diana:
Her True Story,'' blew the lid on the princess' troubled marriage,
would be the author. ``She likes the idea of an author who is used
to writing sympathetic books about women who have relationships
with powerful men,'' said O'Mara, chairman of London-based Michael
O'Mara Books. (BRITAIN-LEWINSKY BOOK)

World Jewry struggles to define relationship with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It used to be simple. Jews around the world
felt close emotional ties to Israel. But today, the link is more
tenuous, threatened by growing assimilation and more questioning
about the Jewish state.
	   In a push to strengthen the bond, Jewish philanthropists are
trying to raise dlrs 300 million for ``Birthright Israel,'' a
project to bring Jewish youth from around the world to Israel for
education about Judaism and the Jewish state.
	   The money will cover airfare and 10 days of programs in Israel
for any Jewish person in the world between the ages of 15 and 26,
organizers said.
	   Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company who helped
launch the project, said Monday he hoped the plan would help
strengthen Jewish life.
	   ``It gives them a real coming back to their roots,'' said
Bronfman, a strong supporter of Israel. ``It gives them a chance to
look at Israel today, modern Israel and gives them past, present,
and hope for the future,'' Bronfman told The Associated Press.
	   The project was inaugurated as part of the General Assembly, an
annual conference that opened Monday in Jerusalem with some 3,000
North American Jewish leaders and 1,500 Israelis.
	   ``Intermarriage and assimilation threatens like a centrifugal
force to pull our people apart,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in a speech opening the convention. Intermarriage
among North American Jews is estimated at 40 percent and slightly
lower in Europe.
	   Of the Birthright Israel program, Netanyahu said ``I know that
nothing, nothing makes such an indelible impression on
(youngsters). They either stay here or go back forever changed as
Jews and they will touch the hearts and minds of other Jews.''
	   Miami cardiologist Jerome Reich, 61, whose four sons have all
visited Israel, said such projects are crucial in sparking young
people's interest in their Jewish identity. They do not, however,
embody the entire Jewish experience, Reich said.
	   A visit ``is an adrenalin shot but there must be follow-up,''
said Reich, a delegate at the assembly.
	   Once Israel and world Jewry were closely bound by a shared past.
The wounds of the Holocaust, participation in the creation of the
state of Israel and even the Yiddish language kept them united in
spirit.
	   But today the battles in a more secure Israel are less
glamorous, more complex and more difficult to rally around.
American Jews generally practice the more liberal Reform and
Conservative streams of Judaism and feel alienated in Israel, where
Orthodox Judaism monopolizes religious practice. Most Jews outside
of Israel speak little Hebrew, and are less comfortable stating
opinions on a faltering peace process.
	   ``There is clear evidence of the distancing of American Jewry
from Israel,'' said Steven Cohen, a sociologist at Hebrew
University who studies American Jews.
	   Gail Hyman, vice president of marketing and public affairs for
the United Jewish Appeal, the largest fund-raising arm of the
Diaspora Jewish community, likened the relationship between the
communities to a maturing romance based more on a partnership
grappling with complex issues than fawning in adulation.
	   ``Maybe the first blush of romance is fading,'' Hyman said, ``We
can't live off the past.''

Gore offers new help for Asian economies, angers hosts

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Vice President Al Gore has cheered
beleaguered Asian nations with offers of new financial support, but
angered his Malaysian hosts by praising the country's
anti-government protesters.
	   Gore, serving as a last-minute fill-in for U.S. President Bill
Clinton at this year's 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit, on Monday announced a new dlrs 10 billion support package
for troubled Asian countries. Half the money will come from the
United States and the other half from Japan, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank.
	   ``This much is clear _ just as the global financial crisis
started here in Asia, the global economic recovery can and must
start in Asia as well,'' Gore told business leaders and officials
at a dinner on the eve of the two-day meeting.
	   With Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sitting at the
head table, Gore used part of his speech to praise Malaysia's
growing protest movement, which has taken ``reformasi,'' the Malay
word for reform, as its battle cry.
	   ``Among so many countries suffering economic crisis, we continue
to hear calls for democracy and reform in many languages _ people
power, doi moi, reformasi,'' Gore said. ``We hear them today _
right here, right now _ among the brave people of Malaysia.''
	   Doi moi is the Vietnamese word for reform.
	   Also in the audience were leaders of the Philippines, Vietnam,
New Zealand and others participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. The 21 APEC members will hold a summit meeting
hosted by Mahathir on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Mahathir showed no response to the comments and afterward shook
Gore's hand as the vice president left the ballroom.
	   But Mahathir's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, told reporters,
``It's the most disgusting speech I've ever heard in my life.'' She
said it was wrong to ``run down a country and incite things.''
	   Mahathir, who has been in power 17 years, is now Asia's longest
serving ruler after violent protests in nearby Indonesia ended
President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   Malaysia's protest movement has grown in the past two months
after Mahathir fired and then jailed his former protege and now
political rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who
was allegedly beaten while in police custody. Anwar was charged
with corruption and sexual misconduct _ allegations he says are
false and politically motivated.
	   Anwar's trial has been suspended during the APEC summit, but
officials from several countries _ the United States, Canada,
Australia and the Philippines _ have met with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, to voice their support.
	   Gore was sent to Malaysia after Clinton decided to forgo the
trip to deal with the Iraqi standoff. The White House has indicated
Clinton will complete the last part of the planned Asian trip,
stops later this week in Japan, South Korea and Guam.
	   Clinton did issue a statement with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi announcing a new joint initiative that would funnel money to
troubled Asian banks to allow them to shore up depleted reserves
and resume lending to companies.
	   By helping to alleviate a growing credit crunch among Asian
nations, Clinton and Obuchi said the new money will help restart
economic growth.

Saddam's bodyguards lead effort to fool U.N. weapons inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ For years, Saddam Hussein's elite guards
have moved trucks and railway cars loaded with missile parts and
other banned weapons material around the country in an elaborate
shell game to fool U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Iraqi leader's efforts to frustrate weapons experts of the
U.N. Special Commission are so vast that they could involve up to
10 times as many Iraqis as there are weapons inspectors, arms
monitors have said.
	   About 90 monitors are returning to Iraq on Tuesday and they can
expect more confrontations and difficulties.
	   In the past, inspectors have found trouble whenever they have
come close to discovering banned weapons or the crucial documents
that they need to piece together a weapons program that was once so
vast it could have killed millions.
	   Inspectors say they have watched Iraqis at suspected sites burn
documents and dump the ashes into rivers as guards blocked their
entry.
	   They have also seen convoys of trucks pull out the back door of
bases as they waited to enter.
	   The confrontations have occasionally turned violent.
	   In July 1992, Iraqi officials shot in the air to intimidate
inspectors during a three-week standoff outside a government
ministry where inspectors believed documents on long-range missiles
were hidden.
	   ``There is a very sophisticated and aggressive countermeasures
team,'' said Tim Trevan, who served on the weapons inspection team
from 1992-95.
	   ``When a U.N. inspection team arrives (in Baghdad), they ...
note the expertise of the members and clean out those sites,'' he
added in a telephone interview Monday from London.
	   It's a cat-and-mouse game with enormous stakes.
	   Inspectors fear that Iraq could be hiding more than 1,000
gallons (3,800 liters) of deadly anthrax and botulism toxins along
with the chemicals needed to produce VX, one drop of which could
kill a person.
	   The U.N. arms experts are returning after Baghdad agreed to
rescinded its three-month ban on weapons inspections.
	   The monitoring effort is crucial to Baghdad because the
inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its banned weapons
before the U.N. trade sanctions that have devastated the Iraqi
economy can be lifted.
	   ``It's not a cooperative venture here,'' Scott Ritter, a former
inspector said in a recent interview with The New Yorker magazine.
``These are people who will do anything to keep us away from these
weapons.''
	   Saddam's effort to retain parts of his weapons program is so
important that it is led by his personal bodyguards, the Special
Security Organization, along with the Special Republican Guards,
inspectors have said.
	   ``Saddam sees a very clear linkage between his survival and his
ability to hide his weapons of mass destruction,'' said Michael
Eisenstadt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
``Nobody is doing to drive on Baghdad if they feel it is going to
lead to the massive use of chemical or biological weapons.''

Qatar to set up elected parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar's ruler has announced plans for an
elected parliament.
	   Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani said Monday the elected
legislature would be incorporated into the country's upcoming
constitution by a committee that he has empowered to work on the
matter.
	   An elected parliament, which would give men and women the right
to vote and run for office, would be the only one of its kind in
the region.
	   In the conservative oil-rich Gulf, only Kuwait has an elected
parliament, although women there are not eligible to vote or run
for office.
	   Sheik Hamad seized power from his conservative father in a
bloodless palace coup in 1995 and promised to liberalize the
country. He has since introduced a temporary constitution and
lifted press censorship, allowing newspapers to criticize ministers
and government policies.
	   He has also taken steps for the country's first-ever elections
for a municipal council to be held in February. The 29-member
council will have an advisory role and its resolutions will be
non-binding.
	   Qatar, a small emirate on the eastern side of the Arabian
Peninsula, has not allowed popular participation in decision-making
since its independence from Britain in 1971. Before coming under
British occupation, the country was a largely tribal and nomadic
society.
	   Qatar now has an advisory council that is appointed by the emir
but the council lacks legislative powers.
	   Some 600,000 people live in Qatar _ about 450,000 of them
foreigners, mostly laborers from the Indian subcontinent.

Habibie blames opposition groups for orchestrating deadly protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Despite outrage over killings by the
military, President B.J. Habibie has indicated he will stick by his
military commander and planned to travel with him Tuesday to a
meeting of Asian-Pacific leaders in neighboring Malaysia.
	   Flanked by Indonesia's current and former armed forces
commanders, Habibie on Monday accused his opponents of
orchestrating street protests that ended with the shooting deaths
of students by the military.
	   But in an apparent concession to opposition groups, Habibie will
not block moves to speed up next year's balloting for a new
president, close aides said.
	   Hours before Habibie made his accusations in a nationally
televised address, police said they had interrogated 11 opposition
figures, including two retired generals, over Friday's violence _
the worst to hit Jakarta since May, when riots helped topple
authoritarian President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   National police chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi warned more suspects
would be brought in for questioning.
	   Human rights activists said the government was trying to create
scapegoats for the bloodshed as calls mounted for Habibie and
military boss Gen. Wiranto to quit.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed last
week in a wave of protests and rioting.
	   Soldiers opened fire with rubber bullets when protesters tried
to march on Parliament as a special government assembly passed
political changes that students said fell short of true democratic
reform.
	   Habibie and Wiranto were to leave Tuesday for the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit. It will be the president's first
overseas trip since coming to power six months ago.
	   After days of tension, life in Jakarta began to return to normal
Monday, although there were at least half a dozen small
anti-government protests and street marches.
	   Flags flew at half-staff. Tearful students laid wreaths and
wrote condolence messages on sheets outside Atma Jaya University,
the site of the worst violence.
	   Many shops and offices were open and rush-hour traffic choked
the main boulevards. Tanks and armored personnel carriers that had
been deployed on the streets were moved, although squads of
soldiers and riot police still guarded Parliament and the
presidential palace.
	   A somber and slow-speaking Habibie promised the government would
prosecute those responsible for the killings, including members of
the security forces.
	   But he pointed blame at unidentified groups he said were intent
on fomenting anarchy.
	   ``The students' movement, a bearer of moral messages, has been
spoiled by irresponsible groups that want to make use of the
students for their own objective of attacking the government,''
Habibie said.
	   Most of the opposition activists questioned by police had signed
a petition recently calling for Habibie's replacement with a
transitional government led by a presidium of community leaders,
and for general elections to be held immediately.
	   Those already questioned include former political prisoner Sri
Bintang Pamungkas, Lt. Gen. Ali Sadikan, a former Cabinet minister
and Jakarta governor, and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide to
opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Another retired military officer, Lt. Gen. Kemal Idris, was also
brought in.
	   Early Monday, officers detained Haryono, an intellectual who is
active in the University of Indonesia's alumni association, and
Permadi Satrio Wiwoho, a mystic who is famous in a nation where
supernatural beliefs are still practiced.
	   Indonesian Legal Aid Institute secretary Munir said police had
not brought charges. But he said the interrogations were an attempt
to pin blame for the deaths on opposition groups.
	   Several leading opposition figures have demanded that the
national assembly vote for a president within three months of next
year's parliamentary elections, set for May or June.
	   Habibie, who is expected to be a candidate, had said that a new
president would be selected in December 1999. But a senior aide to
the president, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, said Monday that Habibie would
not oppose the opposition's plan if Parliament approved it.

Clemens wins fifth Cy Young Award
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cy Young No. 5 filled Roger Clemens with
thoughts of baseball immortality.
	   ``This,'' he said, ``brings me a step closer to the big house in
New York _ the Hall of Fame.''
	   Clemens won the award for a record fifth time Monday, getting it
for the second straight year. And he did it unanimously for the
second time.
	   ``It's overwhelming,'' he said from his home in Houston. ``For
it to be unanimous kind of makes it bookends to the one I won in
1986.''
	   The 36-year-old right-hander, who won his first three Cy Youngs
with Boston in 1986, 1987 and 1991, went 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA for
the Toronto Blue Jays, striking out 271 in 234 2-3 innings. He went
unbeaten in his final 22 starts, winning 15 decisions after
starting 5-6.
	   Clemens, who gets a dlrs 250,000 bonus, is one of only three
pitchers to win the AL award unanimously, joining Denny McLain
(1968) and Ron Guidry (1978).
	   He had been tied at four Cy Youngs with Steve Carlton and Greg
Maddux, who has an outside chance to win another when the NL voting
is announced Tuesday.
	   AL voters had no doubt about their selection when Clemens tied
for the league lead in wins and was tops in ERA and strikeouts
after finishing first in all three categories in 1997. He received
all 28 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers' Association of
America.
	   Boston's Pedro Martinez was second with 20 seconds and five
thirds for 65 points and got a dlrs 75,000 bonus. David Wells of
the New York Yankees was next with 31 points and earned a dlrs
50,000 bonus, and Yankees teammate David Cone was fourth with 16
points.
	   Clemens has been frustrated since the end of the season, angry
Toronto hasn't re-signed Jose Canseco, wondering if Blue Jays owner
Interbrew, a Belgian company, will spend enough money to field a
competitive team.
	   Clemens, who is signed through 2000, posted a statement on his
Web site last week in which he criticized the team and general
manager Gord Ash for not re-signing Canseco.
	   ``I told Gord I hope it didn't stir anything up,'' Canseco said.
``I apologized. He may be handcuffed, that he can't make any moves
because he doesn't have a budget.''
	   The Yankees have been mentioned as a trade possibility along
with Boston, the team that drafted him in 1983 and let him become a
free agent after the 1996 season. There's also been talk of Clemens
going to the Astros, who play near his home, or to the Texas
Rangers.

	   DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Curled up in sleeping bags on
chilly mountaintops, scores of people began casting their wishes
upon a star _ actually, lots of them _ as the most spectacular
meteor shower seen in 33 years hove into view.
	   The star-gazers in Thailand on Monday night were early birds
among millions of people worldwide hoping to glimpse the Leonids
meteor shower, expected to grace the skies in its full glory
Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning over Asia.
	   Those wanting a preview trundled up Doi Inthanon _ the highest
mountain in Thailand at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet) and one of the
world's prime viewing platforms _ to get the show in Monday night.
	   The summit was reserved for scientists and government officials,
who were preparing for the main event Tuesday night.
	   But along the winding mountain round, scores of hard-core
star-gazers and amateur photographers rolled out sleeping gear,
pitched tents and cracked beers for a comfortable show.
	   They were rewarded at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (0730 GMT Monday)
as streaks of lights _ traced through the night sky at roughly
20-minute intervals. ``Oohs'' and ``aahs'' preceded fervent wishes.
	   ``I already have a daughter. Now, I would like a son,'' said
Thamarong Kudpong, 33, who drove with about 10 friends from the
nearby city of Chiang Mai.
	   Rati Cholumyai, also 33, told his girlfriend of nine years to
wish for a successful wedding: ``We are looking at October next
year.''
	   By 4 a.m., smog began blocking the scene from Doi Inthanon and
nearby Doi Suthep, site of a famous Buddhist temple. Some planned
to return around midnight Tuesday for what they hoped would be a
better show.
	   Local hotels have been booked out by hopeful star-gazers. A
newspaper was teaming up with an astronomer from Switzerland to
hold a star party, charging 1,500 baht (dlrs 40) per head for food,
drink and a lecture on what's happening in the heavens.
	   The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the Comet
Temple-Tuttel. The shower is nicknamed the Leonids because ancient
observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.
	   It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare. But every
33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and sheds
swarms of particles as it nears the Sun. In 1966, the Leonids
display peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.
	   Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its
own orbit. The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowing
contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.
	   Asia should get the best viewing. Astronomers predict that the
Leonids will peak in the night hours over Asia and the Pacific,
while hitting North America at about midday, when viewing is poor.
	   Most interested Asians planned to take the show in Tuesday
night, when news reports said viewing would be best. Skies over
Singapore were cloudy Monday night and nothing was visible.
	   In New Delhi, the Nehru Planetarium, India's largest, was asking
local authorities to turn off streetlights after midnight Tuesday
so people could watch the show.
	   Japanese were concerned about the weather, which was forecast to
turn inclement, which could hamper the nighttime view.
	   But two U.S. research planes stuffed with scientific instruments
were going to take off from Okinawa, Japan, and fly above the
clouds Tuesday night to catch a crystal-clear look.
	   Though strong winds swept Chinese skies clean Monday night,
ensuring a clear view in most of northern China, observation points
were only going to be manned after midnight Tuesday.
	   ``The meteor shower began on the 14th and will continue until
the 20th, but tonight is going to be the best time to see it, so
we're only watching it then,'' said a staffer at the Nanjing Purple
Mountain observatory, who gave only his surname, Shi.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Dominique Van Roost of Belgium gave Conchita
Martinez a lesson in power tennis Monday night, opening the
season-ending Chase Championships with a 7-6 (9-7), 6-2 upset of
the No. 7 seed.
	   Martinez's Spanish Fed Cup teammate, fourth-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, took on Irina Spirlea of Romania in the second
match at Madison Square Garden.
	   The rail-thin Van Roost displayed a surprising power game that
rivaled her big-hitting opponent as they slugged it out from the
baseline. With both players running down shot after shot, each
tried to hit a little harder and a little deeper. Van Roost was
better able to keep the ball in the court.
	   Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion who has never reached the
semifinals here on the Garden's blue carpet, reached the Australian
Open final in January, losing to Martina Hingis. That was the
highlight of her season, even though she won two titles in 1998,
the German Open and in Warsaw, Poland.
	   Van Roost, on the other hand, reached this unique 16-player
season finale with consistency. And she comes into the Chase
Championship at the top of her game, having posted victories over
Hingis and No. 5 Venus Williams at Filderstadt, Germany, last
month.
	   The first player from Belgium to be ranked in the top 10 in the
world, Van Roost traded service breaks with Martinez to begin the
match, neither able to hold serve in the first four games.
	   It was Martinez who finally shook off the nerves enough to hold,
taking a 3-2 lead. And the Spaniard had three set points in the
10th game before Van Roost held.
	   The two again traded service breaks before Van Roost moved on
top 6-4 in the tiebreak, her second set point of the night. She
needed five before wrapping up the opening set.
	   Playing relaxed, Van Roost opened up more of her arsenal in the
second set, using drop shots and a lot of two to keep Martinez a
little off balance. Everything worked, and when she rifled a
backhand down the line after the two had played for one hour, 32
minutes, Van Roost had a spot in the quarterfinals where she will
take on the Sanchez-Vicario-Spirlea winner.

Pain forces Neely to end comeback bid

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Cam Neely insisted all along that he wouldn't go
through the pain again in his comeback bid with the Boston Bruins.
	   On Monday, the four-time All-Star called it quits, saying that
the same pain in his right hip that forced him to retire in 1996
was too great to continue.
	   Neely made the decision after an uncomfortable 30-minute skate.
	   ``I know how I'm feeling now, I know how I felt yesterday and I
know how I don't want to feel,'' the 33-year-old Neely said. ``I'm
young, and I don't want to be struggling at 45 to be getting
around.''
	   The former Bruins forward had been practicing with the team
since last Wednesday to see whether his intensive physical therapy
would allow him to overcome a degenerative hip injury.
	   Neely scored 395 goals and had 299 assists in a 13-year-career.
While playing with an injured knee, he scored 50 goals in his first
44 games of the 1993-94 season. Only Wayne Gretzky has scored 50
goals in fewer games.
	   Since retiring, Neely has written an instructional book,
``Hockey For Everybody'' and has worked for a financial printing
firm.
	   He also became a father. His wife, Paulina, gave birth to their
first child, Jack Cameron, earlier this month.
	   Neely had planned to practice with the team for 45 minutes over
10 days to gauge how his hip responded to the workout. After only
four days, Neely already knew.
	   He said he has no regrets about trying.
	   ``My own expectations weren't as high as everyone else's,'' he
said.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to conform slug to world news digest &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN S. AKRE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Auto Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially becomes a member of the global business community on
Tuesday when its shares begin trading on the New York and Frankfurt
stock exchanges.
	   Celebrations were planned at DaimlerChrysler plants and offices
worldwide.
	   But when the ``Day One'' hoopla is over, ``Job One'' will
remain: the daunting task of truly melding the corporate cultures
of two distinctly different German and American corporations into
one international transportation powerhouse.
	   ``From the very beginning, that has been their major
challenge,'' said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. ``How
do you bring them together and get them to function on the same
team?
	   ``I think it's doable, but it's going to be very challenging.''
	   DaimlerChrysler executives insist a new culture will emerge in
the months ahead, one that they hope will blend the entrepreneurial
spirit and creativity of Chrysler Corp. with the topflight
engineering and focus on quality that built Daimler-Benz AG.
	   But some in the industry wonder how open Daimler's methodical,
top-down culture will be to the looser team approach that is
credited with turning Chrysler into the most profitable U.S.
automaker just a few years after it flirted with bankruptcy.
	   Robert Lutz, who retired as Chrysler's vice chairman in June
after playing a key role in the company's turnaround, said the
supposed culture clash has been overstated.
	   ``Anytime you blend two large organizations, even if they're the
same nationality, you will have some problems,'' he said Monday.
	   The merger's architects, co-Chairmen Robert J. Eaton of Chrysler
and Juergen Schrempp of Daimler, have portrayed the creation of the
new German company as a marriage of equals. While DaimlerChrysler
will be incorporated in Germany, it will have dual headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Michigan. Its leadership will
be divided almost equally between Germans and Americans.
	   Yet turf battles are inevitable in any such marriage. How many
former Chrysler executives, rich with Chrysler stock options that
can now be cashed in because of the merger, will opt to retire
early or go elsewhere if they feel underutilized or slighted?
	   DaimlerChrysler executives acknowledge the merger won't be easy.
Their own study of transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent
failed to achieve the kind of success that was anticipated. And
there is no precedent for a German-American merger on this scale.
	   ``We're breaking new ground here,'' said Thomas T. Stallkamp,
president of DaimlerChrysler Corp., the U.S. arm. ``There is no
model for this. That's both good and somewhat frustrating.''
	   DaimlerChrysler has set a goal of cutting dlrs 1.5 billion worth
of costs in the new company's first year.That savings is expected
to come in large part from combining procurement, logistics and
overhead.
	   There's little overlap of products and markets, and management
has decided not to blend product lines for fear of diluting the
brands (you won't find Mercedes-Benz cars in Plymouth showrooms).
That means there is less opportunity for savings than there might
be with two companies that have more redundant vehicles and
operations.
	   But the stock transaction, valued at dlrs 32.8 billion based on
the companies' share prices when the deal closed, has been embraced
by industry analysts precisely because there's so little overlap.
Gary Lapidus if Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. says the companies
complement each other.
	   ``The halo of the Mercedes brand and Daimler's engineering
capability will help Chrysler improve its tarnished reputation on
quality,'' he wrote in a recent report to investors. ``Chrysler's
lean management and unique business processes can help
Mercedes-Benz re-engineer its way to a more competitive cost
structure.''
	   Most analysts expect DaimlerChrysler to trigger a wave of more
mergers as the industry continues to consolidate. Cole said a top
executive at Ford Motor Co. recently told him he had been spending
a lot of time globetrotting lately.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Satellites were being maneuvered to reduce
the possibility of damage as Earth moved through debris in the tail
of a comet that was expected to produce the heaviest meteor shower
in decades.
	   The space storm was expected to peak Tuesday, exposing the
world's 600-plus satellites to possible collisions with speeding
particles of grit from comet Tempel-Tuttle.
	   The particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can poke
holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings or
cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   While private and government satellite operators took
precautions to reduce exposure during the 10-hour Leonid meteor
storm, the odds were against any satellites actually being damaged,
experts said.
	   ``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle
is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,
some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, a
senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, California.
	   Greenwich, Connecticut-based PanAmSat, which operates a network
of 18 satellites, put the odds at one in 20,000.
	   ``We fully expect that the meteor storm will be a non-event,''
said Dan Marcus, a spokesman for PanAmSat, whose fleet serves The
Walt Disney Co., Time-Warner, the BBC, long-distance telephone
companies MCI and Sprint, and other big corporate customers.
	   Even so, PanAmSat put additional personnel on duty at its Long
Beach, Calif., operations center, which monitors company satellites
plus three others it manages for DirecTV, Hughes Electronics'
satellite-to-home TV business.
	   Government agencies took similar measures. The Hubble telescope
was being turned away from the storm to protect lens surfaces. And
the crew of the Russia's Mir space station was to wait out the
worst of the storm in their emergency escape vehicle.
	   The Associated Press advised its customers that it did not
expect disruptions in service. As a precaution, however, the AP
took steps to deliver news and data through the World Wide Web if
necessary.
	   Meteor showers from the dusty wake of comets are fairly common.
In fact, the Earth annually crosses the path of Comet Tempel-Tuttle
and encounters the Leonids. First reported by Chinese astronomers
in 902, the storms are known as Leonid showers because they appear
to come from the constellation Leo.
	   What makes this year exceptional is that Tempel-Tuttle sped past
the Earth's orbit last February, leaving behind a fresh wake of
dust and gas. This happens only every 33 years.
	   Liebrecht said that the last time Tempel-Tuttle went by, in
1966, it left an even denser path of debris, setting off a
spectacular show of shooting stars.
	   In 1966, when there were fewer than 100 satellites in orbit, the
comet produced showers of 144,000 meteors per hour, but the show
resulted in no major damage. This time, the shower was expected to
range from 5,000 to 100,000 meteors per hour.
	   Although tiny, the particles move at more than 155,000 mph
(248,000 kmph). Even a small grain can have great destructive
force. The impact of a particle also creates an electrical
discharge that could cause a satellite to short out.

Dollar lower against yen, Tokyo stock prices slip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early
Tuesday as investors and traders awaited the outcome of a Federal
Reserve policy-making meeting later in the day. Japanese stocks
slipped.
	   The dollar bought 120.42 yen in early trading, down 1.72 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
120.07 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 34.32 points,
or 0.24 percent, to 14,393.95 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Monday, the average closed up 160.06 points, or 1.12 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved lower on growing
expectations the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates for a
third time. Cuts in late September and early October were pivotal
in sparking Wall Street's dramatic turnaround.
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rallied
again, breaking back above 9,000 points Monday. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 91.66 points _ or 1.03 percent _ closing at
9,011.25, its highest closing level since late July.
	   In Tokyo, Japan's announcement on Monday of 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 196 billion) in new public spending and tax cuts also helped
boost the yen.
	   The dollar rose four of five trading days last week partly
because the United States was preparing to strike Iraq over its
refusal to accept U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq later met U.S.
demands for renewed unfettered access for U.N. inspectors.
	   Investors frequently buy dollars during economic or political
turmoil.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened higher but soon turned
into negative territory as investors continued to assess the
government's economic stimulus package.
	   ``Investors are thinking, the government has now poured over 100
trillion into economic stimulus efforts without much effect,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities.
	   Hatae was referring to the approximate 100 trillion yen (dlrs
820 billion) in economic stimulus spending by the government since
1992.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.42 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,104.08.
The TOPIX closed up 11.98 points, or 1.09 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.855 percent from Monday's finish of 0.850 percent,
driving its price down to 108.36 yen from 108.41 yen.

Israeli troop withdrawal on hold until Arafat retracts remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is waiting for Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to rescind threats of armed conflict before it will go ahead
with a West Bank troop withdrawal it agreed to in the latest
Mideast peace accord.
	   A statement Monday by the Palestinian leader saying he would
honor the peace agreement, fell short of Israeli expectations when
Arafat failed to mention his more inflammatory remarks a day
earlier, Israeli officials said.
	   Monday's crisis was another sign that the Wye River accord,
signed at the White House on Oct. 23, was having trouble getting
off the ground.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who arrived in the region only days ago
to help implement the deal, was to depart Tuesday and wasn't
expected back before the end of the month, said U.S. embassy
spokesman Larry Schwartz.
	   Netanyahu announced the suspension of the withdrawal, which was
supposed to have taken place Monday, during an address to
parliament which began debating the accord.
	   The announcement came after Arafat said Sunday he would declare
an independent state in May and that ``our rifle is ready'' to take
Jerusalem.
	   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances ... until these things are corrected in public,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Despite the delay, the Knesset is to view the maps of the
Israeli pullback when it convenes Tuesday and is expected to vote
in favor of the deal later in the day.
	   After Monday's stormy parliament session, Arafat called in
reporters from The Associated Press and Israel TV and said he was
committed to the peace process with Israel.
	   ``I would like to reiterate here that we are fully committed to
implementing precisely and accurately what was signed in the Wye
River memorandum. As far as we're concerned, our position remains
that peace is a strategic option and we will not shift course,''
Arafat said.
	   He did not relate directly to his statements from Sunday but
said ``Surely we will face difficulties when we negotiate ... the
issue of Jerusalem. As they say in English, where there's a will,
there's a way.''
	   Arafat spoke moments before he met with Ross.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said both
sides were making mistakes.
	   Rubin said Arafat's statements were ``wrong,'' but that Israel
could not hold-up implementing its part of the deal because of the
remarks.
	   Netanyahu did not say when the troop withdrawal would go
forward. Speaking late Monday to a delegation of North American
Jews, Netanyahu said ``we expect a full retraction,'' of Arafat's
comments.
	   ``The government will meet in a few days and will consider
whether we can move forward. We want to move forward, we're seeking
a way to move forward, but we can only move forward on negotiations
for peace and implementation of peace that is pursued peacefully by
the Palestinians.''
	   But Palestinian leaders said Netanyahu was using the comments as
excuses for not carrying out the agreement.
	   ``If we were to suspend our actions in response to statements we
hear from the other side, then the agreement would have never been
launched off the ground,'' said Palestinian minister Nabil Shaath.
	   Shaath said a call by Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon for
Jewish settlers to seize as much West Bank land as they could
before the sides come to a final settlement was also inflammatory.
Rubin said Sharon's comments ``undermine the trust and confidence''
needed to make peace.
	   Under the peace accord, Israel is to withdraw its troops in
stages from 13 percent of the West Bank as Palestinians carry out
detailed security and anti-terror measures.
	   Netanyahu did not say when the troop redeployment would begin.
In comments directed towards his hard-line critics, Netanyahu said
that he had not budged from one inch of land when he thought Arafat
was not fulfilling commitments. His Cabinet was to convene
Wednesday to discuss Palestinian obligations under the accord
including a halt to incitement.
	   Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and has said he would
annex large chunks of the West Bank if Arafat made good on threats
to unilaterally declare independence next May.
	   The Wye agreement does not specifically refer to a possible
declaration of statehood, but urges both sides to refrain from
unilateral actions.

Iraq laying down markers for cooperation with weapon inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ President Bill Clinton made clear exactly
what the United States expects Iraq to do to prove it is
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors. But Iraq's U.N.
ambassador said Baghdad is only bound by U.N. agreements and
resolutions, ``nothing more, nothing less.''
	   And already, Iraq's key supporters on the U.N. Security Council
_ Russia and China _ are warning the weapons inspectors to behave.
	   Iraqi ambassador Nizar Hamdoon also set down Iraq's marker for
resuming cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We have committed ourselves to cooperate with UNSCOM provided
the work will lead at some point to the end of the story,'' he
said.
	   The end of the story, as far as Iraq is concerned, is the end of
crippling economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait _ not necessarily the full disclosure of Iraq's weapons
programs that the U.N. Security Council has demanded.
	   The Iraqi government has maintained for years that it has fully
disclosed its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and
the long-range missiles to deliver them. And it has repeatedly
accused UNSCOM of artificially extending the inspection process to
satisfy U.S. foreign policy goals.
	   As Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said only last week,
every time Iraq thinks it has reached the end of the tunnel,
another tunnel appears. He accused UNSCOM of acting on orders from
the United States and using the United Nations as ``false cover.''
	   Since the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait,
Baghdad has provoked new crises and confrontations with weapons
inspectors, including blocking inspections altogether as it did
Oct. 31, sparking the current crisis.
	   As U.S. warplanes were about to attack Saturday morning, Saddam
Hussein's government made a last-minute pledge to allow
unconditional inspections.
	   Now, all eyes will be on UNSCOM's inspections and Baghdad's
reaction: Will it really cooperate, or will it remain defiant and
raise fresh obstacles?
	   For example, UNSCOM wants an Iraqi Air Force document withheld
from inspectors that accounts for chemical munitions used in the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. It also wants Iraq to account for
conventional shells filled with mustard gas, deadly VX nerve agent
and chemical and biological aerial bombs.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who ordered the
inspectors to return to Baghdad on Tuesday, said the world is tired
of the constant crises with Iraq and warned that this was Baghdad's
last chance to tell the truth about its weapons programs.
	   ``The material we need exists. It is in the possession of the
government of Iraq. They can choose to give it to us or not. It's
their call _ and it's the crucial call,'' he said Monday in an
interview.
	   ``I hope they're listening because the consequences are very
severe,'' he warned.
	   Clinton spelled out exactly what the United States expects when
he announced Sunday that Washington would give Iraq the chance to
keep its promise of unconditional cooperation.
	   Iraq must resolve all outstanding issues raised by UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency, give inspectors unfettered
access to all sites without restrictions, turn over all relevant
documents, accept all U.N. resolutions related to its weapons of
mass destruction and not interfere with the independence of the
inspectors, Clinton said.
	   When asked about Clinton's points, Hamdoon said he wanted ``to
put the record straight.''
	   ``Iraq abides by the relevant Security Council resolutions,''
agreements with UNSCOM, and the memorandum of understanding Aziz
signed with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in February, which
ended the last crisis with Iraq, he said.
	   ``There is nothing more, nothing less,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Butler disagreed, saying Clinton had spelled out what the
Security Council has stated and Hamdoon is ``getting it wrong.''
	   But Iraq's supporters on the Security Council _ Russia, China
and France _ have already started setting the stage for future
attacks on UNSCOM.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun warned UNSCOM to respect the sovereignty and dignity of Iraq
when it resumes inspections.
	   Qin said UNSCOM should remember that it ``remains the subsidiary
body of the (U.N. security) council and should be solely
responsible to the council.''

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start'' but gave
little hint that Germany would provide more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, meets
Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Several
executives from key German banks and other companies involved in
Russia accompanied Schroeder.
	   Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Yeltsin, which helped secure significant German investment and aid
but also brought him criticism from those who blame Yeltsin for
many of Russia's problems.
	   Schroeder insisted Monday that the relationship between Germany
and Russia must not rely too much on personal ties.
	   After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday,
Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency financial
aid outside the money it's providing through international lenders.
	   ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for additional German aid,
Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5 tons (1.65 short tons) of
medicine aid with him, German officials said.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan presented this
weekend a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders to
resume aid. He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend that
the IMF release the money.
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have offered aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder and Primakov pledged that Russian-German relations
would continue to flourish.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said.
``Naturally, we would like to learn more about your experience.''
	   Primakov also said Russia was eager to attract foreign capital
and would guarantee investor security.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who met with Schroeder on
Monday, shrugged off the influx of German money that has made
Germany Russia's most important trading partner outside the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``The relations between former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin were a mere camaraderie. Now I am
counting on good business contacts and mutual understanding,''
Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Shipley poll rating slumps a year after taking office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A year after taking power with
the promise of reviving the governing National Party's fortunes,
prime minister Jenny Shipley has led her party to a poor poll
ranking as the Labor Opposition surges to a new high.
	   Shipley's personal support was down six points to 15 percent and
the National Party was at 32 percent in two similar polls by rival
television stations in the past few days.
	   The latest poll was released Tuesday as Shipley led the New
Zealand delegation at the APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
	   She toppled former prime minister Jim Bolger in a party-room
coup while he was at the APEC conference in Vancouver last year.
	   Both polls gave Labor, led by Helen Clark, enough support to
gain an outright majority of 62 seats in the 120-seat parliament.
	   The result means Labor could govern without the need for any
coalition partner.
	   The TV3/CM Research poll gave Labor 49 percent support, up seven
points since September. National was down three points to 32
percent.
	   That would leave National holding just 40 seats. An election is
due next year.
	   A TV One poll published Sunday night produced a similar result.
Both nationwide polls of 1,000 voters had margins of error of 3.1
percent.

	   DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Curled up in sleeping bags on
chilly mountaintops, scores of people began casting their wishes
upon a star _ actually, lots of them _ as the most spectacular
meteor shower seen in 33 years hove into view.
	   The star-gazers in Thailand on Monday night were early birds
among millions of people worldwide hoping to glimpse the Leonids
meteor shower, expected to reach its full glory Tuesday night and
early Wednesday morning over Asia.
	   Those wanting a preview trundled up Doi Inthanon _ the highest
mountain in Thailand at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet) and one of the
world's prime viewing platforms _ to get the show in Monday night.
	   The summit was reserved for scientists and government officials,
who were preparing for Tuesday's main event.
	   But along the winding mountain round, scores of hard-core
star-gazers and amateur photographers rolled out sleeping gear,
pitched tents and cracked open beers for a comfortable show.
	   They were rewarded at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (1830 GMT Monday)
as streaks of lights traced through the night sky at roughly
20-minute intervals. ``Oohs'' and ``aahs'' preceded fervent wishes.
	   ``I already have a daughter. Now, I would like a son,'' said
Thamarong Kudpong, 33, who drove with about 10 friends from the
nearby city of Chiang Mai.
	   Rati Cholumyai, also 33, told his girlfriend of nine years to
wish for a successful wedding: ``We are looking at October next
year.''
	   By 4 a.m., smog began blocking the scene. Some planned to return
around midnight Tuesday for what they hoped would be a better show.
	   Local hotels are booked out. A newspaper was teaming up with an
astronomer from Switzerland to hold a star party, charging 1,500
baht (dlrs 40) per head for food, drink and a lecture.
	   The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the Comet
Tempel-Tuttle. The shower is nicknamed Leonids because ancient
observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.
	   It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare. But every
33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and sheds
swarms of particles as it nears the Sun. In 1966, the Leonids
display peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.
	   Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its
own orbit. The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowing
contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites were being maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Asia should get the best viewing. Astronomers predict that the
Leonids will peak in the night hours over Asia and the Pacific,
while hitting North America at about midday, when viewing is poor.
	   Most interested Asians planned to take the show in Tuesday
night, when news reports said viewing would be best. Skies over
Singapore were cloudy Monday night and nothing was visible.
	   In New Delhi, the Nehru Planetarium, India's largest, was asking
local authorities to turn off streetlights after midnight Tuesday
so people could watch the show.
	   Japanese were concerned about the weather, which was forecast to
turn inclement, hampering the nighttime view.
	   But two U.S. research planes stuffed with scientific instruments
were going to take off from Okinawa, Japan, and fly above the
clouds for a crystal-clear look.
	   Though strong winds swept Chinese skies clean Monday night,
ensuring a clear view in most of northern China, observation points
were only going to be manned after midnight Tuesday.
	   ``The meteor shower began on the 14th and will continue until
the 20th, but tonight is going to be the best time to see it, so
we're only watching it then,'' said a staffer at the Nanjing Purple
Mountain observatory, who gave only his surname, Shi.

Supreme Court will not take over lawsuits against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's Supreme Court turned down a
government request to appoint a special justice to take over 12
lawsuits against Gen. Augusto Pinochet now being handled by a lower
court judge.
	   Court clerk Carlos Meneses said the justices voted 13-3 Monday
against appointing one of its justices, considering that the suits
against Pinochet do not affect the country's foreign relations as
claimed by the government to justify its request.
	   The refusal also opened the door to at least some of the suits
being transferred to the military courts, a move favored by
Pinochet's lawyers.
	   The government had made its request last week to demonstrate
that even if Pinochet returns home from London, where a court is
deciding whether to extradite him to Spain, he would still face
trial.
	   Pinochet was arrested one month ago in London on a warrant from
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon who wants try him for genocide,
torture and murder. Britain's highest court was deciding whether he
has immunity from prosecution as a former chief of state.
	   The Court's decision also blocked the possibilities for Chile to
request Pinochet's extradition in case the Lords rule that he does
not have immunity. In Chile, is up to the Supreme Court to approve
extradition requests to foreign countries.
	   Local legal experts believed that an extradition request by
Chile would have taken precedence over those from Spain or other
European nations also wanting to try the 82-year-old former
dictator, because he is a Chilean and the alleged crimes were
committed in Chile.
	   During Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, an estimated 3,000 suspected
dissidents were killed or disappeared. Most were Chilean, but some
were citizens of other nations that are also seeking his
extradition.
	   There are currently 12 lawsuits against Pinochet filed by
victims of repression, the Communist Party and the National
Association of Journalists.
	   The Supreme Court decision means that all the suits will
continue to be handled by judge Juan Guzman of the Santiago Court
of Appeals.
	   Guzman's job, however, faces some complex hurdles, as Pinochet
has wide immunity as a member for life of the Chilean senate, and
is further protected by an amnesty law he issued during his regime.

Dollar lower against yen, Tokyo stock prices mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning stock, bond and currency prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Tuesday
morning as investors and traders awaited the outcome of a Federal
Reserve policy-making meeting later in the day. Japanese stocks
traded mixed.
	   The dollar bought 120.99 yen in late morning trading, down 1.15
yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
120.07 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 15.02 points,
or 0.10 percent, to finish the morning session at 14,413.27. On
Monday, the average closed up 160.06 points, or 1.12 percent.
	   On the currency market, the dollar moved lower on growing
expectations the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates for a
third time. Cuts in late September and early October were pivotal
in sparking Wall Street rallies.
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
again, breaking back above 9,000 points Monday. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 91.66 points _ or 1.03 percent _ closing at
9,011.25, its highest closing level since late July.
	   In Tokyo, Japan's announcement on Monday of 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 196 billion) in new public spending and tax cuts also helped
boost the yen.
	   The dollar rose four of five trading days last week as investors
sought the greenback's safe haven as the United States prepared to
strike Iraq over its refusal to accept U.N. weapons inspectors.
Iraq later met U.S. demands for unfettered access for U.N.
inspectors.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened higher but soon turned
into negative territory as traders and investors continued to
assess the government's economic stimulus package.
	   Traders said that Tokyo has now spent a massive amount of money
to kick-start Japan's economy since 1992 _ without bringing an end
to the country's slump.
	   ``Investors are thinking, the government has now poured over 100
trillion into economic stimulus efforts without much effect,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section edged up 0.95 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,106.45.
The TOPIX closed up 11.98 points, or 1.09 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.860 percent from Monday's finish of 0.850 percent,
driving its price down to 108.32 yen from 108.41 yen.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With its posh new Moscow boutique, the elite
Italian fashion house Fendi is betting that the fundamental law of
high fashion will prove stronger than Russia's economic downturn.
	   ``A woman always wants to look beautiful,'' said Alla Verber,
commercial director for Trading House Moscow, which is working in
partnership with Fendi. ``I'm always confident that beauty helps in
these sort of (crisis) situations.''
	   Fendi's fur coats sell for thousands of dollars, far beyond the
reach of all Russians except the very rich. And even the wealthy
might forgo Fendi's luxury handbags, suitcases and designer outfits
during a time of financial turmoil.
	   Yet Fendi and several other big-name foreign firms are setting
up shop in Russia at a time when many local and foreign operations
are retrenching staffs or cutting investment in the face of the
country's economic crisis.
	   By most accounts, the business forecast has not been good since
the government decided in August to effectively devalue the ruble
and impose the moratorium on repayments of foreign commercial debt,
shaking the confidence of investors.
	   The American Chamber of Commerce, traditionally one of the
biggest boosters of foreign investment in Russia, said it was
pessimistic about present market prospects. Business growth is not
likely without major economic, legal and political reform, the
group said.
	   But newcomers such as Fendi, MTV and Vogue magazine made their
decisions to come to Russia more than a year year ago when the
economy was showing signs of life. Now these firms face a difficult
decision: either cut their losses and write off the money they've
invested so far, or forge ahead and try to make the best of their
terrible timing.
	   ``MTV traditionally swims against the tide,'' Bill Roedy,
president of MTV-VH1 International, said at MTV's press conference
announcing its launch in September. ``We have tremendous faith in
the long-term and are deeply committed to the future.''
	   Despite the optimism, MTV is worried, and executives discussed
the possibility of not entering the market after the crisis hit in
August. They've proceeded, but they canceled a lavish launch bash.
	   Some firms are counting on the situation to improve quickly,
such as the fashion magazine Vogue, which is dependent on
advertising to cover a large chunk of its expenses.
	   Others are dropping out of the market completely. The French
magazine Paris Match decided to scrap a September launch and put
off its Russian edition until 2000.
	   At Fendi's opening party, the mood was upbeat and the
predictions were bold.
	   ``This situation doesn't create any fear from our end,'' said
Gabriella Di Carlo, Fendi's commercial director. ``Quality always
stands out.''
	   It remains to be seen whether there will be takers for Fendi's
high-priced, luxury goods. No one knows if Russia's super rich, who
are renowned for their extravagant ways, will survive the economic
crisis. The middle and lower classes have already been hard hit by
inflation and job losses.
	   ``Crisis is a healthy, normal thing,'' Leonid Strunin, who
described himself as an administrator with a fashion company, said
as he watched Fendi models strut down a runway in fur coats. He
added that when the crisis ends, the new rich ``will be richer
still.''
	   Vladimir Zhirinovksy, the bombastic Russian politician, appeared
at the Fendi opening, assured the crowd that the crisis would leave
wealthy Russians unscathed.
	   ``What crisis?'' he asked. ``In reality, people have the money
and desire to buy here.''
	   But who, a reporter asked, would have enough money now to afford
the coats at Fendi?
	   ``(Government) ministers and (parliament) deputies,''
Zhirinovsky replied.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a
doubling of U.S. aid to the hurricane-ravaged countries of Central
America during a rapid tour of the region and French President
Jacques Chirac also brought a message of support.
	   Calling Hurricane Mitch ``the worst natural disaster in this
hemisphere that we have record of,'' Mrs. Clinton announced new aid
that brings the U.S. total to more than dlrs 250 million.
	   Local governments say at least 10,000 people died and hundreds
of thousands were left homeless as Mitch rampaged across Nicaragua,
Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
	   More deaths could come from disease in the storm's aftermath,
Mrs. Clinton warned Monday, ``so we're not by any means through.''
	   President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 45 million in additional
aid for the region on Saturday, bringing the total U.S. commitment
to more than dlrs 126 million.
	   Speaking in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, Mrs. Clinton
outlined plans to double that _ adding 16 new helicopters to the 39
already in the region and bringing U.S. troop strength in the area
to 5,600 from 1,300.
	   She announced dlrs 55 million in additional military-based aid
such as road-building, medical detachments and water purification,
and dlrs 51 million more in food aid.
	   The United States also will cancel two years of debt payments
owed by Honduras and Nicaragua _ about dlrs 54 million worth, she
said.
	   Mrs. Clinton began her tour at the Soto Cano Air Base, a center
for U.S. relief efforts about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of
Tegucigalpa.
	   Standing atop a makeshift podium built from boxes of bottled
water brought in as aid, she praised the servicemen's efforts as
``heroic and important and significant.''
	   She also praised ``the great spirit'' of the Honduran people,
``who are willing to literally pull up their sleeves and dig
themselves out.''
	   Minutes before Mrs. Clinton's arrival, Chirac also flew into the
Honduran capital aboard a camouflage-painted C-160 cargo plane. He
joined Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse for a quick tour of
flood-damaged areas of the city.
	   Chirac's visit, the first to Honduras by a French head of state,
lasted less than three hours.
	   Earlier, in Guatemala, Chirac announced that France would
forgive the debts of Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras
to help in their recovery efforts. The total for the four countries
was dlrs 134 million.
	   Chirac also suggested creation of a Central American
reconstruction fund, to be overseen by the World Bank. Chirac
arrived Saturday in Guatemala for a previously scheduled visit, and
extended the trip to include Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   Despite the pledges of much-needed aid, one U.S. military
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, complained that visits
by dignitaries were using aircraft, personnel and airport space
that could have gone to the relief effort.
	   In Guatemala, Chirac pledged France would help the country
recover from its 36-year civil war, which ended two years ago.
	   ``France can help you consolidate peace and democracy,'' he told
the nation's Congress Monday, in outlining economic and educational
aid.
	   Mrs. Clinton and Chirac later flew separately to Nicaragua,
where they were to meet with President Arnoldo Aleman.
	   In Nicaragua, Chirac said he would work to have international
financial agencies also forgive Nicaragua's debt.
	   In a four-hour visit, Chirac offered his sympathies to the
Nicaraguan people for the suffering caused by the hurricane.
	   ``France felt a deeply moved by the images it saw on
television,'' he said. ``We guarantee our solidarity.''
	   Spain's Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon, meanwhile, flew to
Guatemala from El Salvador. He said his country had pledged dlrs
113 million in credit or donations to the affected nations.
	   On Monday, the prince visited the site of a toppled bridge on
the Lempa River, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of San
Salvador, and a school where 211 refugees have sought shelter.
	   The United States will convene an international conference Dec.
9 to lay out priorities for long-term rebuilding, said Brian
Atwood, head of the Agency for International Development.
	   Atwood said the conference will be followed later by a meeting
in which industrialized nations will be asked to pledge cash
assistance for rebuilding.

Controversial Laos dam takes step nearer construction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ A controversial dlrs 1.2 billion
hydroelectric dam project has taken a major step forward with an
agreement signed by the Laotian government and an international
consortium of developers.
	   The agreement, signed Monday, signals Laos's intention to
complete the proposed 900-megawatt facility known as Nam Then 2,
which has been held up since 1995 because of environmental and
financial worries.
	   The dam site, 250 kilometers (150 miles) east of Vientiane in
the central province of Khammouane, would be the second on the
Theun river, following the opening of the 210-megawatt
Theun-Hinboun dam in April.
	   Some non-governmental organizations have assailed the proposed
development on environmental and social grounds, citing the damage
the 450-square kilometer (180-square mile) reservoir would have on
an area known as the Nakai Plateau. Some 734 households will be
forced to resettle.
	   Defenders say the dam has been the subject of the most extensive
series of environmental, financial and social assessments ever
undergone in a developing country.
	   A report from the consortium of developers, known as the Nam
Theun Electricity Consortium, says the total cost of activities
associated with resettlement will be dlrs 32.1 million.
	   Laos is to gain full ownership after a 25-year concession
period. Officials hope the dam will generate annual revenues of
dlrs 250 million from the sale of electricity to neighboring
Thailand.
	   That would eventually double the annual gross domestic product
of sparsely populated Laos, one of the world's 10 poorest
countries.
	   The estimates are contingent on Laos securing a favorable deal
with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the sole
purchaser. Recession has dampened Thailand's demand for
electricity.
	   Project boosters are waiting for the World Bank to announce its
full support for the dam, which would eliminate financial risk for
investors.
	   If the guarantees come through, construction could start as soon
as early 1999, a consortium official said on condition of
anonymity.

Philippine fast-food giant's profits soar despite Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Seven-year-old Sharimee Cerilo's
relatives took her to some of Manila's most famous sights during a
recent visit from the countryside. But when she returned home, the
first thing she told her friends was, ``I got to eat at Jollibee!''
	   The Philippine fast-food chain's mix of Philippine flavors,
aggressive advertising, reasonable prices and perky
orange-and-yellow honeybee trademark have made it a children's
favorite and one of the country's most recognized brands.
	   While other Asian companies have been struggling to survive the
region's financial crisis, Jollibee's profits and market share are
soaring.
	   ``At Jollibee, you can see all kinds of people,'' said Remigio
Bernardino, eating with his family at a Jollibee's in Manila's
crowded Quiapo district. ``Also, the price is cheap.''
	   The Bernardinos say they have been Jollibee patrons since the
first store opened in the mid-1970s as an ice cream parlor that
also served hamburgers.
	   In two decades, the company has pushed aside foreign fast-food
chains and become undisputed market leader, forcing even McDonald's
to swallow its pride and offer chicken and rice breakfasts and
sweet spaghetti to compete.
	   Jollibee now has 281 branches in the Philippines and 26 others
in 13 countries, including Vietnam, Hong Kong and the United States
_ areas with large communities of overseas Filipino workers.
	   Jollibee says it now controls 52 percent of the fast-food
market, beating McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's
combined.
	   In a powerful combination, it also owns 80 percent of Greenwich
Pizza, which recently overtook Shakey's as the country's dominant
pizza chain. It also operates Mary's Chicken and is Philippine
franchisee for Delifrance, DonutMagic and KoppenHagen ice cream
stores. Its founder and president, Tony Tan Caktiong, holds 50
percent of the leading Chinese fast-food chain, Chow King Food
Corp.
	   Jollibee says it is looking to acquire other fast-food chains as
well, and is rumored to be weighing a buy-in of Goldilocks, the
largest bakery chain.
	   ``Part of our strategy is to be present in all the major
segments of the fast-food industry,'' says Raffy dela Rosa,
Jollibee's vice president for finance. ``Whenever there are
opportunities, we will have interest in looking at them.''
	   Spencer Yap, an analyst for BPI Securities, says Jollibee has
dominated the industry by expanding aggressively and by focusing on
the lower and middle-class market, the largest in the Philippines,
while foreign chains like McDonald's aimed initially at the higher
end.
	   In 1997, Jollibee franchise sales totaled 9.6 billion pesos
(dlrs 240 million), more than double McDonald's estimated 4.5
billion pesos (dlrs 112.5 million), according to ING Barings.
	   In October, the company reported third quarter net income of 214
million pesos (dlrs 5.35 million), 30 percent more than the same
period a year earlier, showing that it is not only surviving but
thriving in Asia's financial crisis.
	   Analysts say Jollibee could actually benefit if a slowing
economy forces consumers to turn away from more upscale
restaurants.
	   Jollibee's offerings include sweet Philippine-style spaghetti
topped with chopped hotdogs; Peach Mango and Banana Jackfruit pies;
Amazing Aloha, a burger with a slab of pineapple and bacon; and
Pansit Malabon, noodles with sauce containing pork rind and
shredded smoked fish.
	   ``We cook our food the way the Asians cook it _ with selected
spices mixed with the basic raw material so that you capture the
aroma as you bite into the food,'' says dela Rosa.
	   Dela Rosa also credits the company's growth to heavy advertising
that promotes Jollibee as a Filipino family restaurant.
	   ``Whenever my son sees Jollibee ads on TV, he always wants me to
take him to Jollibee,'' agrees Lyn Feliciano, a 36-year-old
housewife. ``And whenever I come home, I always have to bring some
Jollibee chicken and spaghetti for him. He doesn't like McDonald's
spaghetti because it's too Italian.''
	   But analysts question whether Jollibee's recipe for success in
the Philippines can translate overseas beyond local Filipino
communities.
	   ``The success factor for Jollibee in the Philippines is they
know the `mouths' of Filipinos,'' says Mike Gotera, an analyst for
DBP Daiwa Securities. ``It's too early to say if they can duplicate
that outside the country.''
	   Jollibee says it is keeping its core menu overseas but adjusting
its ``taste profile.'' In Brunei, for example, the chicken sauce is
a little more spicy. The name ``hamburger'' has been changed to
``beef burger'' in Muslim areas, and in Indonesia the company has
adopted ``nasilemak,'' a local rice and chicken dish.
	   ``If they do succeed in this strategy, then any country is open
to them,'' Gotera says.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Landless rural workers invaded two
farms in a northeastern state Monday morning to protest expected
cuts in the government's land reform program.
	   The invasions come a day after two other farms were occupied by
members of the Landless Rural Worker's Movement who said they
planned to invade another 22 farms in Pernambuco state before next
Sunday.
	   The movement has gained national and international attention by
occupying land it considers unproductive, and which under Brazil's
1988 Constitution can be expropriated and distributed to small
farmers. The effort is intended to pressure the government to speed
up its agrarian reform program.
	   Around 80 movement members invaded the Sibiro Grande farm some
1,160 miles (1,870 kms) northeast of Rio and another 80 invaded the
nearby Curupaiti farm an hour later, said movement leader Carlos
Brasileiro by telephone from Pernambuco.
	   Brasileiro said the movement was worried that budget cuts
detailed in a recently announced fiscal austerity plan would dry up
the estimated 35 million real (dlrs 31.5 million) destined for
agricultural reform in the state.
	   Brazil has one of the worst distributions of land in the world
with about 20 percent of the population holding 88 percent of the
land, while the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A German rancher held hostage five
months by leftist rebels was freed last weekend after humanitarian
pleas by an Ecuadorian bishop of German descent, authorities
confirmed Monday.
	   Rene Peter Moeller was released Saturday by rebels of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest
guerrilla group, in Carmen de Bolivar, a town 340 miles (550
kilometers) north of Bogota in Bolivar state.
	   Authorities said Moeller, a rancher married to a Colombian
woman, was in poor health, but gave no further details on his
condition.
	   Helping to obtain his release was German-born Bishop Emilio
Stehle, a spokesman for the government's anti-kidnapping office
told The Associated Press. Based in Ecuador, Stehle has played a
prominent role in peace discussions between the civilian leaders
and Colombia's other leading rebel group, the National Liberation
Army.
	   Neither the anti-kidnapping office nor the German embassy in
Bogota would confirm press reports that the FARC rebels were paid a
dlrs 316,000 ransom for Moeller's release.
	   The world leader in kidnappings, Colombia had 1,122 abductions
through October this year, according to government figures.
	   Most of the crimes are carried out by the two rebel groups, who
frequently nab their victims at roadblocks on rural highways.
Foreigners are often the targets, since they tend to fetch the
highest ransoms.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Peasants without any training are
risking their lives attempting to clear land mines planted during
Nicaragua's civil war of the 1980s, an Organization of American
States official said.
	   Large property owners are hiring the peasants for little money
to remove mines so land can be used for farming, Sergio Carmagna,
the OAS representative to Nicaragua, told OAS Secretary-General
Cesar Gaviria, on Sunday.
	   Caramagna said that this has occurred in former war zones in
northern and western Nicaragua near the Honduran border, and in the
south near the Costa Rican border, Nicaraguan newspapers reported
Monday.
	   About 90,000 mines remain in the country, despite de-mining
efforts by the Nicaraguan army, which has been aided by the OAS and
several nations.
	   Flooding caused by Hurricane Mitch has caused some buried mines
to surface.

Poll: Only 30 percent of Puerto Ricans want to be U.S. state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Only 30 percent of Puerto Ricans
polled said they would vote to join the United States, according to
a newspaper's poll.
	   A survey of 1,000 people by El Nuevo Dia newspaper Monday found
the other voters polled in the U.S. territory were divided between
various options including the current commonwealth arrangement, a
loosely defined ``free association,'' independence or none of the
above.
	   Puerto Ricans will choose between the options in a Dec. 13 vote.
The islandwide telephone poll, taken between Oct. 20 and Nov. 5,
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
	   The results appeared to be a setback for Gov. Pedro Rossello,
who has flooded TV and radio stations with advertisements in a
high-profile campaign for U.S. statehood.
	   The U.S. Congress refused to approve a bill this year aimed at
untangling Puerto Rico's complicated legal ties to the United
States.
	   In frustration, Rossello called a local, non-binding vote in the
hope it would spur Congress to act.
	   Under the current commonwealth, the island's 3.8 million
residents are U.S. citizens but cannot vote for president and have
no vote in Congress. They pay no U.S. taxes but received limited
federal benefits, and they can be drafted into the U.S. military.

Markets keep Fed-watchers off-balance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHET CURRIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As the mood in the stock and bond markets keeps
changing from day to day, so do expectations on Wall Street of what
the Federal Reserve might do next.
	   Two weeks or so ago, most analysts were convinced that the Fed's
policy-makers would take another step at their regular meeting on
Tuesday to push short-term rates lower in order to cushion the
effects of a slowing economy.
	   The debate focused mainly on whether the rate on federal funds,
or overnight loans between banks, would drop by a quarter or a half
of a percentage point.
	   But as stock prices have extended their powerful rally that
began in early October, more and more forecasters have developed
doubts about the whole prospect.
	   ``A few weeks ago,'' says Richard Rippe, director of the
economics research group at Prudential Securities, ``financial
markets were in the grip of fears about recession and financial
dislocation. But recent signs are generally more positive, which
makes the next Fed meeting a much closer call.''
	   Adds Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc., ``Stock investors assume that the Fed will cut rates again on
Nov. 17 by 25 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point), if
not 50 basis points. I still expect a quarter-point cut, but I'm
losing my confidence in this forecast.
	   ``Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to be concerned that his Oct.
15 rate cut may have revived irrational exuberance in the stock
market much more than it reduced excessive risk aversion in the
credit markets.
	   ``If he cuts the federal funds rate again, the Dow could soar
into record territory and the government bond yield (now about 5.25
percent) could approach 6 percent. This is not a scenario that
would be welcomed by the Fed.''
	   Recent weeks have certainly produced one of the most dramatic
changes of direction for the markets in modern memory.
	   From mid-July through early October, stock prices went into a
swoon that by some measures qualified as a full-fledged bear
market. But in just a few weeks since then, most of those losses
have been recouped. ``It's hard not to be impressed by the
performance of the U.S. stock market recently,'' says Greg Smith,
Prudential Securities's investment strategist.
	   At the same time, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds,
which had tumbled below 4.75 percent, rebounded to well above 5
percent.
	   Against this backdrop, analysts say, the Fed still has plenty to
worry about in the international financial crisis, which may have
eased but has by no means gone away.
	   ``The circumstances which caused the Fed to lower interest rates
at the October Federal Open Market Committee meeting remain just as
compelling today as they were in early October,'' says Douglas Lee,
Washington analyst at HSBC Securities Corp. ``Now that the Fed has
started down the path of lower interest rates, we expect further
movement in the same direction.
	   ``Some have questioned whether the significant rise in the
equity market since the October FOMC meeting would influence the
decision to lower rates further,'' Lee acknowledges. But he adds,
``We believe that the rise in the stock market reflects the
expectation of further rate cuts. If they are not forthcoming,
disappointment would be the likely result.
	   ``We do not believe the Fed would be pleased by more market
volatility in the current environment, and therefore do not view
this as an obstacle to lowering rates.''

Moody's downgrades Japanese government debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leading ratings agency cut its assessment of the
creditworthiness of the Japanese government Tuesday, in the latest
sign of growing international dissatisfaction with Tokyo's
management of its economy.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of all
securities issued or guaranteed by the Japanese government by one
notch from the highest rating of Aaa to Aa1.
	   ``The rating actions were taken because of the uncertainties and
heightened risks over the long term arising from economic and
policy weaknesses,'' the U.S.-based agency said in a statement.
	   The move could lead to higher borrowing costs for both the
government and world-class Japanese companies.
	   Minutes after announcing the downgrade, Moody's also cut its
ratings of four of Japan's largest utilities companies, which had
enjoyed the Aaa rating.
	   Moody's lowered its ratings of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Co., Chubu Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co. and Tokyo
Electric Power Co., also to Aa1.
	   In cutting the government's rating, Moody's cited concern over
Japan's ballooning government debt _ made worse just a day earlier
by a 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) stimulus package.
	   While Tokyo has now spent 100 trillion yen (dlrs 820 billion) on
public works and tax cuts since the economy tanked in the early
1990s, it has little to show except a cumulative budget deficit
that is now the largest in the industrial world.
	   Moody's said Japan has so far avoided making the painful
structural reforms needed to restore its economy to growth.
	   ``More extraordinary macroeconomic and reform policies may be
required for Japan to overcome its economic malaise,'' the agency
said.
	   It is also an embarrassment to Japan, which has been unable to
extract itself from a prolonged economic slump.

Mayor to apologize to English over Crawley attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Cairns Mayor Tom Pyne said Tuesday he
will write a letter of apology to the English cricket team after
player John Crawley was assaulted in the North Queensland city on
Sunday night.
	   Test batsman Crawley suffered cuts and bruises to the face after
he was attacked by an unknown assailant. He was unable to attend
Monday's final day of England's match with Queensland, which
England won by one wicket, but will be fit for the start of
Friday's first test in Brisbane.
	   ``I'm writing to the England team management today to apologize
for the unfortunate incident,'' Pyne said. ``I'd like to catch the
bloke who did this and give him a good boot up the backside.''
	   England team manager Graham Gooch said Crawley was walking to
the team's hotel after a night socializing with teammates and
members of the Queensland team when he was attacked.
	   He said Crawley had been abused and punched to the ground.
	   Gooch said the England team management considered reporting the
incident to police but at Crawley's insistence did not.
	   But Cairns police spokesman Phill Tori said police should have
been informed.
	   ``We can't investigate unless these incidents are reported, and
the sooner we know about it the better chance we have of locating
those involved,'' he said.
	   Tori said Cairns police had been ``inundated'' with media calls
from England on Tuesday since news of the assault was reported.

Chinese retailers scrambling for elbow room
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Sea-Sky Department Store opened for business last
winter, adding its blaze of Christmas lights to those of a
half-dozen other malls along the same stretch of road in eastern
Beijing.
	   Those lights went dark last week when the store's landlords had
water and electricity stopped in preparation for eviction.
	   These are grim times for Beijing's retailers. New shopping malls
like Sea-Sky have sprung up on almost every major city block, while
wallets shrink as city factories lay off workers by the thousands.
	   Winter and summer, crowds cram Beijing's department stores and
malls, seeking diversion and an escape from extreme cold and heat,
but not the daily necessities they usually get at cheaper outdoor
markets.
	   The escalators of the New Dong An Plaza, a swanky mall downtown,
are often jammed with potential customers. Elderly couples escort
their grandchildren into the glass elevators. Young lovers gaze at
the sunroof above the six-story atrium mall.
	   Most shopping at Dong An, however, is of the window variety.
	   Beijing already has more than 70 large department stores and
malls, up from only eight in 1990. Despite a moratorium on
approvals of shopping complexes, by 2000 more than 110 of what the
newspaper Beijing Youth Daily dubbed ``commercial dinosaurs'' are
expected to open their doors.
	   With a total of 5.6 million square meters (60 million square
feet), Beijing will then be the city with the most shopping space
per capita in the world, the newspaper said.
	   As China cracks open its markets hoping to gain membership in
the World Trade Organization, foreign retailers are joining the
fray, setting up Western-style discount stores and Japanese-style
supermarkets.
	   Meanwhile, retail sales growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the
first three quarters of the year compared with a year earlier, down
from 10 percent in 1997; 12.5 percent in 1996 and 26.6 percent in
1995.
	   Five Beijing department stores have already shut down and others
are expected to follow. In cities across China the glut of new
malls begat by a boom in real estate development has left retailers
gasping for air.
	   Two-thirds of Shanghai's 130 large department stores are losing
money, according to a recent report in the China Economic Times.
The reasons are the same as in Beijing: too many stores, too few
buying customers, poor management and price wars that have driven
many to the edge of bankruptcy.
	   Sea-Sky, a latecomer featuring a mix of expensive imports and
cheaper Chinese-made goods, succumbed in just 11 months. The first
signs of trouble came when some 200 wholesalers gathered in front
of the store to protest nonpayment for their products. Gradually,
the store's shelves and floor space were emptied. Then, the
landlord moved to evict, saying the store owed 27 million yuan
(dlrs 3.27 million) in rent and utilities.
	   Sea-Sky officials declined comment except to say the store was
undergoing an ``internal reorganization.''
	   Chinese once waited hours in lines for such mundane items as
soap and toothpaste. Now they choose from shelves loaded with
cosmetics, household appliances, clothing and food.
	   With factories trucking products directly to city sidewalks to
try to clear inventories of unsold or unsaleable items, now it's a
buyer's market.
	   Many families choose to save what little extra they have, and to
scout around for the best discounts when they do buy. Retailers are
responding with profit-crunching price wars and other gimmicks,
slashing prices by as much as half and undercutting their already
slim profit margins.
	   ``The average person's capacity for shopping is just not that
great,'' said Robert Mu, former assistant general manager of
Beijing Pricesmart, which runs two Beijing discount marts modeled
on the San Diego membership shopping chain, Price Club.
	   Pricesmart, owned by a wealthy Beijing man who prefers to remain
anonymous, is one of a half-dozen or so large discount stores
modeled on U.S. warehouse stores that hope to win the hearts of
thrifty shoppers with bargains on appliances on items like toilet
paper, inexpensive clothing and bulk foods and beverages stacked
ceiling-high on warehouse-style shelves.
	   Many foreign retailers that have set up shop in China are
focusing on the broader discount market, hoping to beat the retail
glut. So far, they have made little headway, accounting for only
0.9 percent of China's total retail and wholesale sales, according
to official statistics.

Spaniards knocked out of Chase Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second match &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Spanish armada floundered on opening day of
the season-ending Chase Championships, clinching the year-end No. 1
ranking for Lindsay Davenport.
	   After seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez was ousted by Dominique
Van Roost of Belgium 7-6 (9-7), 6-2, fourth-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario fell to Romania's Irina Spirlea 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.
	   Davenport now cannot be overtaken for the No. 1 ranking on the
Corel WTA Tour computer. Once Sanchez-Vicario lost, it meant
Martina Hingis could not get enough bonus points in this week's
dlrs 2 million tournament to overtake the Newport Beach, California
right-hander.
	   The reigning French Open champion, Sanchez-Vicario fought
fiercely in the opening set, battling Spirlea on even terms and
fighting off four set points in the tiebreak.
	   But when her forehand down the line was called wide, giving
Spirlea the first set, Sanchez-Vicario leaned on her racket, stared
at the person who made the call and smiled.
	   Like her Spanish Fed Cup teammate Martinez in the opening match,
it was all downhill for Sanchez-Vicario after losing the first-set
tiebreak.
	   ``I think she lost her concentration at the beginning of the
second set,'' Spirlea said. ``She just missed three games. I didn't
do much those three games. Once you are three games ahead, you play
different than if it is 2-all or 2-1.
	   Spirlea has now beaten Sanchez-Vicario five times in their last
six meetings.
	   In the opening match, the very-thin Van Roost gave Martinez a
lesson in power tennis. The Belgian displayed a surprising power
game that rivaled her big-hitting opponent as they slugged it out
from the baseline. With both players running down shot after shot,
each tried to hit a little harder and a little deeper. Van Roost
was better able to keep the ball in the court.
	   ``She hits every ball very hard, and I just think I played too
much at her,'' Martinez said. ``I couldn't get the rhythm and the
pace of the ball.''
	   Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion who has never reached the
semifinals here on the Garden's blue carpet, reached the Australian
Open final in January, losing to Hingis. That was the highlight of
her season, even though she won two titles in 1998, in Berlin and
Warsaw, Poland.
	   Van Roost, on the other hand, reached this unique 16-player
season finale by being consistent. And she comes into the Chase
Championship at the top of her game, having posted victories over
Hingis and No. 5 Venus Williams at Filderstadt, Germany, last
month.
	   ``I always hit that hard,'' Van Roost said. ``Sometimes it
doesn't stay on the court, but I usually hit hard.''
	   The first player from Belgium to be ranked in the top 10 in the
world, Van Roost traded service breaks with Martinez to begin the
match, neither able to hold serve in the first four games.
	   It was Martinez who finally shook off the nerves enough to hold,
taking a 3-2 lead. And the Spaniard had three set points in the
10th game before Van Roost held.
	   The two again traded service breaks before Van Roost moved on
top 6-4 in the tiebreak, her second set point of the night. She
needed five set points before wrapping up the opening set.
	   Playing relaxed, Van Roost opened up more of her arsenal in the
second set, using drop shots to keep Martinez a little off balance.
Everything worked, and when she rifled a backhand down the line
after the two had played for 1 hour, 32 minutes, Van Roost had a
spot in the quarterfinals where she will take on Spirlea.

Bank of Japan sees economy still deteriorating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's credit crunch has begun hurting the
country's larger companies and stagnant consumption is forcing
businesses to cut production, the Bank of Japan said in its monthly
report Tuesday.
	   The bank said overseas funding for Japanese banks has improved
since fears of a worldwide credit crunch have receded, but domestic
financial markets are hampered by funding problems of banks and
companies.
	   The cautious lending attitude by banks, due to their own
troubles and those of borrower companies, ``seems to be adversely
affecting not only small and medium-sized firms but also large
ones,'' the BOJ said.
	   As companies move to secure on-hand liquidity for the calendar
and fiscal year-ends by restraining spending on capital investment,
the BOJ said, ``the move to scale back on capital investments can
spread over to large companies, in addition to smaller firms.''
	   ``The development of severe corporate financial conditions
toward the year-end and their influence on the economy continue to
warrant careful monitoring,'' the BOJ said.
	   The central bank further downgraded its assessment of private
consumption, noting that weakness in consumption has become more
conspicuous.
	   With demand weak, companies have cut back production
``substantially,'' as the ratio of inventory to sales remains high
and corporate profits continue to worsen, the BOJ said. Employment
and income conditions have also deteriorated, it added.
	   ``The economy is hardly expected to recover immediately, judged
from the strong negative interactions and the constraints from
corporate finance,'' the BOJ said. ``Moreover, the appreciation of
the yen since early autumn may exert pressures on corporate profits
for the latter half of the fiscal year.''
	   The continued decline in wages and the yen's rise since early
autumn will ``exert downward pressure on prices, the BOJ said.
``The decline in prices, especially in wholesale prices, may
somewhat accelerate in the future,'' it noted.
	   The BOJ said, however, that it expects the economic
deterioration to moderate gradually due to the government's
economic stimulus package released in April and the monetary easing
in September.
	   The BOJ said it is closely monitoring the effects on corporate
and household sentiment of the government's 24 trillion yen
economic package announced Monday and the bank rehabilitation
scheme established last month to strengthen banks' capital bases.

Moody's downgrades Japanese government debt

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leading ratings agency cut its assessment of the
creditworthiness of the Japanese government Tuesday in the latest

	   Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of all

Habibie to commute to Asian summit to avoid spending night
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a sign of the level of concern
among Indonesia's leaders over growing unrest at home, President
B.J. Habibie will commute to a two-day Asian economic summit to
avoid spending the night outside Jakarta.
	   Habibie arrived here Tuesday to meet with other leaders
attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but will go
back home, and spend the night there, before returning to Kuala
Lumpur for the second day of meetings.
	   Habibie was scheduled to leave Kuala Lumpur at about 6:00 p.m.
(1000 GMT) Tuesday evening, said an Indonesian government official.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed last
week in a wave of protests and rioting in Jakarta. The violence was
the worst there since May, when hundreds died in violence that led
to the resignation of Habibie's predecessor, Suharto.
	   Police questioned 11 prominent opposition figures on Monday over
the deadly student protests after Habibie accused opponents of
trying to overthrow his 6-month-old government.
	   Despite outrage over the recent killings by the military,
Habibie has indicated he will stick by his military commander.
	   Habibie told reporters here that the situation at home was
``good'' but declined to elaborate. He made the comment after a
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.

Spill from ship crash little threat to environment: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An oil spill caused by the collision of two ships
off the south China coast last week has left little pollution and
does not pose a major threat to wildlife in the area, the official
newspaper China Daily reported Tuesday.
	   The report contradicted earlier articles in the same newspaper
that said the spill threatened the Chinese white dolphin, a mammal
already on the verge of extinction in the waters off Hong Kong.
	   The spill left an oil slick about 10 kilometers (6 miles) long
and 5 meters to 50 meters (16 feet to 165 feet) wide off the mouth
of the Pearl River in Guangdong province, about 5 kilometers (three
miles) from habitat of the white dolphins.
	   But Tuesday's report said the spill was of a type of oil that
was highly volatile, unlike extremely destructive heavy crude oil,
and that it had already dissipated.
	   It said few dead fish or animals had been found and that local
fishermen were already bringing in catches from the area.
	   The white dolphins _ actually a bubble-gum pink in nearby Hong
Kong _ also are found off South Africa and Australia, where their
colors are blue, gray or green.
	   Research shows the dolphins are being killed off by chemicals
discharged along the Pearl River, which runs through heavily
industrialized Guangdong province. Hong Kong's new
multibillion-dollar airport was built on an island in the middle of
dolphin habitat. So few dolphins remain that experts predict they
will be extinct in a few years.

China's satellite business proper, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has not obtained sensitive military
technology via satellite launching deals with U.S. firms, officials
told a state-run newspaper in a report published Tuesday.
	   Such deals have been put on hold as the U.S. government conducts
investigations into allegations that China used commercial
satellite launching services to obtain military secrets.
	   The officials, who made the remarks while attending an
international air show in Zhuhai, southern China, reiterated
Beijing's defense of its satellite launching deals and said China
hoped to soon resume cooperation in launching U.S. commercial
satellites.
	   ``We have in no way received any satellite technology from our
U.S. counterparts,'' Xu Fuxiang, director of the Chinese Academy of
Space Technology, was quoted by the China Daily as saying.
	   The officials said that following two consecutive launch
failures in 1996 China tightened quality control and it would
continue to improve management and operations of its satellite
program.
	   ``We hope the United States will conclude the investigation as
soon as possible to benefit U.S. satellite manufacturers and
operators as well as launch service providers'' said Wang Liheng,
vice president of China Aerospace Corp.
	   Chinese government officials have repeatedly denied any link
between China's satellite launchings and the transfer of sensitive
technology.

U.N. aid workers return, arms inspectors to test Iraq's pledges

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors made their way back
to Baghdad on Tuesday and said they expect full cooperation from
Iraqi officials in eliminating the nation's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   On Monday, the first U.N. relief workers who were pulled out in
fear of a U.S. military strike returned to Iraq. And diplomats
disclosed the behind-the-scenes drama in Baghdad that led to Iraq's
sudden announcement Saturday it would reverse course and end its
blockade of arms inspectors.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview that Iraq was being watched closely
to measure its resolve in cooperating with the U.N. inspectors
searching for forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was to leave Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and
council members on the situation.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 30 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   About 120 more U.N. humanitarian workers were due overnight on a
bus convoy through the Jordanian desert.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report that they have been able to resume work,
the council has said it will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi government
wants the review to lead quickly to the lifting of sanctions _ a
move both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross told The Associated Press in
Bahrain, where the weapons experts were evacuated last week, that
they expected ``full cooperation'' on their return.
	   ``They will be the first to know if the cooperation is full and
unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said.

Money talks in tour to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Nearly 1,000 South Koreans were to
depart Wednesday on an unprecedented tour to North Korea to see a
pretty mountain _ and virtually nothing else.
	   Guided by a multipage list of do's and don't's, their visit will
contain enough restrictions on their activities to satisfy the
harshest prison warden.
	   Most will be elderly natives of North Korea who were separated
from their families by the Korean War in the early 1950s, a fate
shared by some 10 million South Koreans.
	   The border between North and South Korea has been sealed for
nearly half a century and only a handful of family reunions have
been permitted by the rival governments.
	   No reunions will be allowed on this trip, which marks the first
time South Korean tourists have been permitted to visit the
secretive, Marxist North since the war.
	   But such is the mystic draw of their homeland, that 780 people
paid up to dlrs 2,530 just to set foot on its soil and trek the
heights of scenic Diamond Mountain on its east coast. They'll be
accompanied by 200 reporters, photographers and TV cameramen.
	   They will not be allowed to photograph or talk to any North
Koreans, say or do anything that might offend their communist hosts
or stray from their group.
	   Failure to obey the rules will be costly.
	   Litter, and the fine is dlrs 23. Carelessly toss away a
cigarette and cause a forest fire, and pay dlrs 3,000 for each
damaged square meter (yard) of land plus restoration costs.
	   Interfere with North Korean quarantine and customs proceedings,
damage ``natural beauty'' or cultural or tourist facilities, and
pony up dlrs 92.
	   Those are just some of the numerous penalties North Korea says
it will impose on any tourist who breaks the rules on the five-day,
four-night tour.
	   ``It's just like going to North Korea to pay fines,'' Seoul's
JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in a recent editorial criticizing the
tough guidelines.
	   After a successful test run over the weekend, the tour will
officially begin Wednesday when the first chartered cruise ship
departs the South Korea's east coast port of Donghae.
	   The ship will sail into Changjon port, a gateway to Diamond
Mountain, the next day after a 12-hour voyage across the military
demarcation line that separates the Koreas roughly along the 38th
parallel.
	   The organizer of the tour, the Hyundai group, hoped to send up
to 2,000 tourists a week on the tours, the first major joint
venture between the two rival Korean states.
	   But only 1,200 people have signed up for the first two cruises,
reflecting both disappointment in the restrictions imposed and
tighter individual purse strings amid South Korea's economic slump.
	   The North Korean guidelines, in some points, are so ambiguous
that South Korean officials are warning travelers ``just look and
don't do anything else.''
	   All travelers are required to attend a two-hour orientation by
the Seoul government in which they're repeatedly warned to ``stay
away from trouble.''
	   ``Extra-precaution is needed, because North Koreans are doing
this reluctantly to earn badly needed foreign currency,'' Sohn
In-sup, a government instructor, said during a recent orientation.
	   The tour project has the blessing of the government of President
Kim Dae-jung, who is trying to open up the North's closed society
under his ``sunshine policy.''
	   That policy calls for wide-ranging civilian exchanges between
the two Koreas, which are still technically at war, with no peace
treaty signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
	   Hyundai has agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over the
next six years for the right to operate the tours. Seoul officials
say the money is enough to fill the North's annual shortfall of 1.5
million tons of grain until 2004.

Sixteen bogus 10,000 yen (dlrs 83) bills found among from taxi
</HEADLINE>
fares paid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Several taxi companies in Tokyo have reported 16
fake Japanese bills were found among fares paid by customers over a
four-day period last week, police said Tuesday.
	   Each of the bogus bills was a 10,000 yen bill (dlrs 83), said a
Tokyo police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Taxi drivers apparently could not tell the bills were phony when
customers used them to pay fares, but company officials later found
they were fake and reported it to police, the spokesman said.
	   Police believe the bogus bills were printed by a portable
printing machine because they had all the same serial number on
them. The fake bills were found among from sales from taxi
customers from last Wednesday through Saturday, the spokesman said.
	   According to National Police Agency figures, a total of 150
bills, each worth 10,000 yen, were recovered across the nation last
year.
	   Late last year, a North Korean ship captain arriving in Japan
was arrested on suspicion of using fake Japanese currency.

Kidby begins domestic part of epic air journey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ The man who flew solo from England
to Australia to commemorate Bert Hinkler's historic flight 70 years
ago began the final leg of his journey to Perth in Western
Australia on Tuesday.
	   In his 1927 Avro Avian biplane, Lang Kidby, 51, set off from the
Farnborough Airshow in England on Sept. 13 and arrived in Darwin
six weeks later. It was the same route that Hinkler, also an
Australian, took in 1928.
	   In 1933, Hinkler was killed when his DH80A Puss Moth crashed in
mountains in Italy on a later trip from England to Australia.
	   On Tuesday, Kidby landed at Coolangatta Airport on the Gold
Coast on the first leg of his solo flight around eastern Australia
to Perth, following in the same steps as Hinkler, who toured the
country when he arrived home.
	   The journey will probably be Kidby's last in the biplane _ he
will be forced to sell it to help pay for the flight which was
funded by savings and a mortgage on his house.
	   ``We've got to sell the aircraft and we hope it goes to a major
museum or an enthusiast who would like to fly it,'' Kidby said.
	   ``We've had a number of overseas offers but that would be an
absolute last resort.''
	   Kidby said he should reach Perth by Dec. 5 and the journey
should take in every place where Hinkler landed, including Coffs
Harbour, Port Macquarie and Newcastle in New South Wales state as
well as Australia's capital cities.

APEC leaders to call for review of rating agencies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A statement issued by Pacific Rim
leaders likely will include a call for the study of credit-rating
agencies and their influence on global capital flows, an official
familiar with the statement said Tuesday.
	   The call won't lead to the regulation of ratings agencies, said
the official, who asked not to be identified. Instead, it reflects
a ``gesture'' of deference to Malaysia, which is hosting the annual
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   A final declaration from the 21 leaders will be read at the end
of the summit Wednesday.
	   Malaysia has blamed currency traders and ratings agencies for
sparking the Asian financial crisis, and has called for tighter
regulation of them. The United States opposes that stance.
	   In a speech at APEC Tuesday, U.S. Vice President Al Gore said:
``Our challenge is to build a foundation for more stable and
sustainable capital flows -- not to halt or control the flow of
capital, but to make sure it is used wisely and effectively, in the
most productive ways possible.''

Former minister removed in corruption scandal dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A former agriculture minister ousted from
Myanmar's military government in an anti-corruption shakeup last
year has died, official newspapers reported Monday.
	   Lt. Gen. Myint Aung, 67, known for his tough handling of the
pro-democracy opposition when he was a regional military commander
a decade ago, died Monday at home. No cause of death was given.
	   Myint Aung's death came a year and a day after he was removed as
minister of agriculture and irrigation in an attempt by Myanmar's
ruling generals to improve the image of their government.
	   A handful of ministers were placed under loose house arrest and
an official probe was launched into allegations of illegally
acquired wealth and property. No results of the inquiry have ever
been made public. Myint Aung was not under house arrest at the time
of his death.
	   The shakeup was accompanied by the ruling State Law and Order
Restoration Council, or SLORC, changing its name to the more benign
State Peace and Development Council. The SLORC came to power in
1988 and crushed protests against an earlier generation of military
rulers.
	   As commander of the Irrawaddy Division near Yangon, Myint Aung
was known for tough treatment of pro-democracy activists, including
top dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, who was rumored to have once been
personally stopped by one of his officers when she was trying to
drum up support.
	   Myint Aung was later appointed agriculture and irrigation
minister. He was relatively successful and Myanmar, also known as
Burma, was able to export rice in 1996 for the first time in many
years.
	   He is survived by his wife and daughter.

Habibie heads to APEC summit in Malaysia despite last week's unrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Some Indonesians take single names.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ignoring student calls for his ouster
following deadly street clashes, President B.J. Habibie left for
the Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia Tuesday on his first trip
abroad since unrest dislodged his predecessor in May.
	   But worried about Indonesia's volatility, Habibie said he would
commute to the two-day meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian capital is a
two-hour flight from Jakarta.
	   ``I cannot stay overnight because I have a lot of work to do at
home,'' State Secretary Akbar Tanjung quoted Habibie as saying.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed last
week in protests and rioting in Jakarta that recalled the tumult
six months ago that led to the ouster of authoritarian leader
Suharto.
	   At that time, Suharto had to cut short a trip to Egypt to rush
home as unrest enveloped the tropical capital of 11 million people.
	   His former protege, Habibie, has faced calls to step down for
months despite his pledge to dismantle the rigid political system
left behind by 77-year-old Suharto. Activists who want swifter
democratic change suspect Habibie is maneuvering to stay in power.
	   Student anger toward the president intensified after the deadly
clashes with security forces last week, which touched off mob
rioting by thousands of youths with no apparent political agenda.
	   Jakarta's streets were quiet on Tuesday, a Muslim holy day and
national holiday. Red and white Indonesian flags flew at half-mast
outside houses, hotels and offices in mourning for the slain
students.
	   Habibie was accompanied on his trip to Malaysia by Gen. Wiranto,
who has also faced calls to step down for his handling of the
protests.
	   On Monday, Wiranto stood at Habibie's side as the president
appeared on national television and accused his opponents of
orchestrating the street demonstrations. Habibie has indicated he
will stick by his military commander despite outrage over the
killings.
	   The violence erupted near Parliament as a special government
assembly passed political changes that students said fell short of
true democratic reform.
	   Police said they had interrogated 18 opposition figures,
including two retired generals, over Friday's violence, the
official Antara news agency reported. Human rights activists said
the government was trying to create scapegoats for the bloodshed.
	   Most of the opposition activists questioned by police had signed
a petition recently calling for Habibie's replacement with a
transitional government led by a presidium of community leaders,
and for general elections to be held immediately.
	   In an apparent concession to opposition groups, Habibie has said
he would not block moves to speed up next year's balloting for a
new president. Habibie, who is expected to be a candidate, had
earlier said that a new president would be selected in December
1999.
	   Several leading opposition figures have demanded that the
national assembly vote for a president within three months of next
year's parliamentary elections, set for May or June.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore
sparked a diplomatic row at a meeting of Pacific Rim leaders when
he praised the anti-government movement in Malaysia. A Malaysian
government official called the remarks ``disgusting'' and other
countries said the United States should not meddle in their
internal affairs.
	   The vice president, a last-minute fill-in for President Clinton
at this year's 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit,
praised the growing protest movement in Malaysia known as
``reformasi'' in dinner comments Monday night with Malaysian
President Mahathir Mohamad sitting at the head table.
	   Speaking of rising voices around the world seeking democracy,
Gore said, ``We hear them today _ right here, right now _ in
Malaysia.''
	   An official of Mahathir's government, Trade Minister Rafidah
Aziz, immediately after the dinner called Gore's comments ``the
most disgusting speech I've ever heard in my life.''
	   On Tuesday, Gore came under criticism from other Asian leaders
for distracting the discussions from the economic crisis facing
many APEC countries and meddling in another country's internal
affairs.
	   ``In APEC, we should concentrate on APEC matters,'' said
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. ``We should leave the
domestic matters alone. It is okay if the leaders want to talk
about it quietly.''
	   ``You have to be very, very careful toward each other's
feelings,'' said Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuan. '' We are
here to solve the (economic) problem and compare notes. ... We have
to have understanding.''
	   Before the start of two days of APEC sessions Tuesday, Gore had
a one-on-one meeting with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
During the photo-taking session before the talks, Gore refused to
back down from his comments.
	   As Primakov listened, Gore told reporters, ``My point is very
simple _ these economies have some very difficult choices to make
for reform to move forward. Democracy and freedom are essential
prerequisites for making those kinds of decisions and getting that
kind of support.''
	   In his dinner remarks, Gore announced a new dlrs 10 billion
support package for troubled Asian countries. Half the money will
come from the United States and the other half from Japan, the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   ``This much is clear _ just as the global financial crisis
started here in Asia, the global economic recovery can and must
start in Asia as well,'' Gore told business leaders and officials
at the dinner.
	   Mahathir showed no response to Gore's comments on
anti-government protesters in his country and afterward shook
Gore's hand as the vice president left the ballroom.
	   Mahathir, who has been in power 17 years, is now Asia's longest
serving ruler after violent protests in nearby Indonesia ended
President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   Malaysia's protest movement has grown in the past two months
after Mahathir fired and then jailed his former protege and now
political rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who
was allegedly beaten while in police custody. Anwar was charged
with corruption and sexual misconduct _ allegations he says are
false and politically motivated.
	   Anwar's trial has been suspended during the APEC summit, but
officials from several countries _ the United States, Canada,
Australia and the Philippines _ have met with Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail, to voice their support.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Azizah on Sunday,
which prompted a testy exchange between Rafidah and Albright at a
news conference.
	   Gore was sent to Malaysia after Clinton decided to forgo the
trip to deal with the Iraqi standoff. The White House has indicated
Clinton will complete the last part of the planned Asian trip, with
stops later this week in Japan, South Korea and Guam.
	   Clinton did issue a statement with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi announcing a new joint initiative that would funnel money to
troubled Asian banks to allow them to shore up depleted reserves
and resume lending to companies.
	   By helping to alleviate a growing credit crunch among Asian
nations, Clinton and Obuchi said the new money will help restart
economic growth.
	   The additional dlrs 5 billion in U.S. direct support represents
dlrs 1 billion each in new loans to Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea, the nations hit hardest by the crisis, and dlrs 2 billion in
new support from two U.S. lending agencies, the Export-Import Bank
and the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
	   Because of legal restraints, the United States is not providing
any direct financial support to the dlrs 5 billion program to help
banks provide new loans to corporations. Japan said it would
provide up to dlrs 3 billion in this effort with the rest coming
from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Several top officials attending an
Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia criticized U.S. Vice President Al
Gore on Tuesday for using the event to sympathize with the
country's anti-government protesters.
	   But Gore defended the move, saying nations that are fighting off
economic crises must work just as hard to promote democracy.
	   ``My point is very simple: these economies have some very
difficult choices to make for reform to move forward,'' Gore told
reporters just as he began meeting with Russian Prime Minister
Yergency Primakov. ``Democracy and freedom are the essential
prerequisites for making those kinds of decisions and getting that
kind of support.''
	   Gore's speech to Asian leaders and businessmen in Kuala Lumpur
on Monday night was mostly devoted to the Asian economic crisis.
	   He announced a new dlrs 10 billion support package for the
stalled economies of the hard-hit region. Half the money will come
from the United States and the other half from Japan, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   But the speech also expressed concern about the social unrest
that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been trying to
contain, especially during the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit currently under way in Kuala Lumpur.
	   In a slap at the United States, New Zealand's prime minister,
Jenny Shipley, said on Tuesday: ``It's not New Zealand's style to
do a megaphone diplomacy. ... It's critical that bilateral issues
do not get confused with APEC.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had planned to attend the APEC
summit, but he sent Gore in his place while holding emergency
meetings in Washington about the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   In the end, Clinton canceled an expected military attack on Iraq
for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors. Clinton still plans to
complete the last part of the planned Asian trip, including stops
later this week in Japan and South Korea.
	   Mahathir, who has been in power 17 years, is now Asia's longest
serving ruler after violent protests in nearby Indonesia ended
President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   Malaysia's protest movement exploded two months ago after
Mahathir fired and then jailed his former protege and now political
rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was charged with corruption and sexual misconduct _
allegations he says are false and politically motivated.
	   Anwar's trial has been suspended during the APEC summit, but
officials from the United States, Canada, Australia and the
Philippines have gone out of their way to meet with Anwar's wife,
Azizah Ismail, to voice their support.
	   They also have expressed concern over reports that Anwar was
beaten in prison, and whether his trial would be fair. This has
delighted Azizah and infuriated the Malaysian government.
	   In fact, ever since APEC summits began six years ago to promote
free trade, this is the first time that the forum's meetings have
focused on issues such as human rights and social unrest in any
country.
	   On Monday night, Mahathir was at the head table in the ballroom
where Gore gave his speech. Mahathir showed no response and
afterward accepted Gore's handshake.
	   But soon after that, Mahathir's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz,
called Gore's comments ``disgusting'' and said they could end up
inciting more unrest in Malaysia.
	   Two protests, one involving thousands of pro-Anwar supporters,
have occurred since the APEC meetings began last week. During one
of them, police opened fire in the air for the first time since the
anti-Mahathir demonstrators started in early September.
	   On Tuesday, Malaysia's education minister, Najib Tun Razak, said
he was outraged by the American vice president.
	   ``We reject Al Gore's speech,'' he told reporters. ``This is
clearly meddling in our internal affairs, which we find an
absolutely intolerable state of behavior and unbecoming of a leader
of the United States.''
	   Several other APEC officials also seemed unhappy.
	   ``In APEC, we should concentrate on APEC matters. We should
leave the domestic matters alone,'' said Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's
prime minister. ``It is okay if leaders want to talk about this
quietly. But we shouldn't be distracted from APEC.''
	   Thailand's foreign minister, Surin Pitsuwan, said: ``You have to
be very, very careful toward each other's feelings. We are here to
solve the (economic) problem and compare notes.''

Jayasuriya developing new batting technique
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's best-known batsman says he
has revised his batting technique because bowlers are familiar with
his style.
	   From obscurity in a fishing village a few years ago, Jayasuriya
has risen to earn the nickname ``master blaster'' and has put Sri
Lanka on the top in world cricket.
	   During the recently concluded three-nation tournament in the
Middle East, Jayasuriya failed to live up to his reputation.
Jayasuriya says bowlers have have concentrated on his weak points,
going round the wicket to tap him leg before or hit his stumps.
	   Jayasuriya won't spell out his new technique, but he promised
reporters on Monday that he is determined to play the role of Sri
Lanka's main batting stay in future tournaments. Sri Lanka is
scheduled to go to Australia in January.
	   During the 1996 World Cup, Jayasuriya clobbered the ball with
ease for a hundred boundaries. The same year he traveled to
Pakistan with a Sri Lankan-B team and scored two centuries.
	   Although a gifted all-rounder, he is particularly good at
batting. He relishes one-day games and his ability to hit over the
top in the early overs has given his side a tremendous impetus.

Luzhkov seeks more economic ties, help on submarines from Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov assured Japan on Tuesday
that some regions in Russia are safe for foreign investment.
	   ``It is understandable that Japanese businessmen will be
cautious about investing in Russia,'' Luzhkov told reporters while
on a visit to Japan to promote economic ties between the two
nations.
	   ``But the economies in some regions remain strong and reliable,
and it is possible to carry out low-risk investments.''
	   The popular Luzhkov, who has turned Moscow into the nation's
only boomtown, said he made his pitch during a meeting with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Luzhkov, a likely presidential contender in 2000, said he also
asked Obuchi for help to scrap 50 Russian nuclear submarines.
	   Russia has acknowledged that the discharged submarines holding
spent nuclear fuel in the north are critically dangerous but has
also said it lacks the money to scrap them.
	   The Japanese Foreign Ministry declined to comment.
	   Luzhkov also said that the centrist coalition of political
parties formed recently to support him will hold its first formal
meeting on Thursday.
	   The new alliance offers a more constructive alternative in a
nation dominated by radical parties, he said.
	   But in response to a question about his presidential bid,
Luzhkov stressed he has not announced his candidacy.
	   ``I have to disappoint you,'' he said. ``As a man who does not
drink, I can clearly remember what I've said.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin has appeared increasingly weak
recently, raising doubts about his ability to govern.
	   At a news conference, Luzhkov lashed out at what he called the
``careless miscalculations'' of the International Monetary Fund in
dealing with Russia's economic problems.
	   Many IMF policies merely worsened the problems, he said.
Privatization of state-owned industries and pushing for zero
inflation were among the disastrous decisions, said Luzhkov.
	   ``I never trusted the IMF from the beginning,'' he said.
	   Luzhkov is expected to depart Wednesday.

Moody's downgrades Japanese government, top companies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Moody's considering Toyota downgrade in 10th graf,
comment by analyst in 16th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leading ratings agency cut its assessment of the
creditworthiness of the Japanese government Tuesday in the latest
sign of growing dissatisfaction with Tokyo's management of its
economy.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of all
securities issued or guaranteed by the Japanese government by one
notch from the highest rating of Aaa to Aa1.
	   ``The rating actions were taken because of the uncertainties and
heightened risks over the long term arising from economic and
policy weaknesses,'' the U.S.-based agency said in a statement.
	   The move was a vote of no confidence just a day after Japan
announced its biggest stimulus package ever as it struggles to jog
its economy out of a stubborn recession.
	   The cut could lead to higher borrowing costs for both the
government and world-class Japanese companies. It is also an
embarrassment to Tokyo, which once promoted its economy as a model
for developing nations and lectured Washington about its financial
problems.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment
specifically on the Moody's decision.
	   ``Japanese government bonds are the most trusted in the world,''
he told reporters.
	   Minutes after announcing the downgrade, Moody's also cut its
ratings of four of Japan's largest utilities companies, which had
enjoyed the Aaa rating.
	   Moody's lowered its foreign currency debt ratings of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Co., Chubu Electric Power Co., Kansai
Electric Power Co. and Tokyo Electric Power Co., also to Aa1.
	   Moody's also said it was considering a similar downgrade for one
of Japan's premier manufacturing companies, Toyota Motor Corp.
	   In cutting the government's rating, Moody's cited concern over
Japan's ballooning government debt _ made worse by Monday's 24
trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) stimulus package.
	   While Tokyo has now spent 100 trillion yen (dlrs 820 billion) on
public works and tax cuts since the economy tanked in the early
1990s, it has little to show except a cumulative budget deficit
that is now the largest in the industrial world.
	   Moody's said Japan has so far avoided making the painful
structural reforms needed to restore its economy to growth.
	   ``More extraordinary macroeconomic and reform policies may be
required for Japan to overcome its economic malaise,'' the agency
said.
	   Analysts in Tokyo agreed.
	   Moody's is ``saying what everyone already knows _ that we have
Japan doing all these fiscal packages, but the packages aren't
creating growth or boosting tax revenues, so the fiscal situation
just continues to get worse,'' said Kenneth Landon, senior currency
strategist for Deutsche Bank.

China, Philippines try to reduce tensions in Spratlys conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of China and the
Philippines gave their support on Tuesday to a plan designed to
reduce tensions between nations claiming the Spratly Islands.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada met China's President Jiang
Zemin here on the first day of a meeting of Asian leaders attending
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The two leaders endorsed a proposal to form a group of experts
who would work on finding ways to build confidence between the
nations involved in the territorial dispute, said Philippines
Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Estrada, who took office in June, said earlier he would urge
nations claiming the Spratly Islands to come together to resolve
the dispute.
	   The Philippines leader was attending his first APEC summit.
During the meeting with Jiang, Estrada read from cue cards.
	   Earlier this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing for the construction of large barracks on Mischief Reef,
which the Philippines believes could be easily put to military use.
	   ``If experts look at the problem we are confident the problem at
Mischief Reef can be solved diplomatically,'' said Philippines
presidential spokesman Jerry Barican.
	   China says the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen and
the construction photographed by Philippine reconnaissance planes
was just repair work.
