   CUBA-MIGRATION _ HAVANA _ The ever-smoldering war of words
between Cuba and the U.S. over immigration policies is flaring up
again after the shark-eaten bodies of two Cuban men were found off
the Florida Keys in August. Cuban officials charge that the U.S.
Cuban Adjustment Act encourages Cubans to risk the perilous voyage
across the Florida Straits by granting automatic asylum to any
Cuban who sets foot on U.S. soil. U.S. officials, meanwhile, say
the Cuban government has been blocking Cubans with proper visas
from emigrating. We profile the controversy, hopefully by finding
Cubans willing to talk about their problems in trying to obtain
visas. NOTE: This could prove difficult, and many interview
subjects are likely not going to agree to be named, for obvious
reasons. (Williams, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   RUSSIA-JOURNAL _ MOSCOW _ How long does a superpower remain a
superpower? Ten years ago, the Soviet Union was dissolved, but many
Russians continue to believe their country is a great nation.
Adults proudly extend as proof Russia's high education levels,
industrial base, art and culture, and of course, their nuclear
arsenal. But as the remnants of this Soviet past rust and fade
away, what does the next generation of Russians, who grew up after
the end of the Cold War, believe? We spend a day in one of Moscow's
public schools to find out. Developing. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   BLACK-VOTE _ Democrats are banking on a strong turnout from
African American voters to match gains in 1998 and help Vice
President Gore carry a handful of Southern states. But without the
benefit of President Clinton's impeachment, which drove record
African American turnout two years ago, they are turning to a pot
pourri of local issues that they concede don't have the potency of
impeachment. Inititial hopes that Gov. Jeb Bush's re-organization
of Florida affirmative action programs would spark turnout are
fading. In Georgia, Democrats will have to motivate African
American voters without the presence of any African Americans on
the statewide ballot. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   FLOYD _ PACTLOUS, N.C._ Tens of thousands of North Carolinians,
including Jackie Wilson, have yet to return to their homes a year
after Hurricane Floyd flooded much of the eastern portion of the
state. The high water soaked Wilson's house in Pactlous, east of
Greenville, but with several thousands of dollars in government aid
and charitable contributions, she was prepared to refurbish her
home. But workers discovered termite damage, raising the cost of
restoration to $50,000. So she moved a mobile home next to her
house, but county inspectors wouldn't allow her to hook up sewage
services because her septic system was outdated. So, she's back to
paying apartment rent. So many others face such obstacles that it
may be three to five years before Floyd victims return to permanent
homes, relief officials say. Some of those moving back into homes
are so financially strapped, said Methodist disaster relief
official Cliff Harvell, they are ``sleeping on the floor or eating
on the floor.'' (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 40 inches.

   TECH-ELECTION _ WASHINGTON _ When it comes to high-tech issues,

While the race for the White House won't be won by the candidate

playing an ever-larger role in shaping the nation's economy. An
in-depth look at what Bush and Gore have had to say on the

   TECH-HOLLYWOOD _ LOS ANGELES _ Tom Arnold hasn't had the best of
luck with the Internet. The actor recently did some adsvertisements
for a high-speed Internet access company. But it took the company
months to install service at his home. When he was considering
starting whether to start a Web site, he went to several companies
that promised the world, but couldn't deliver. ``If you would've
told me a year ago that you were thinking about doing something on
the Internet, I would've puked,'' Arnold said. ``But the perception
of the Internet has changed. The medium has changed.'' And with it,
the entertainment world _ Hollywood and the Southern California
cities that surround it _ have embraced the Internet in a big way.
The resulting marriage of glitz and geek promises to produce
everything from Internet movies to star-powered technology business
incubators. (Keefe).

   DEATHROW-GOBSON _ Death row inmate Exzavious Gibson is best
known for being the only capital defendant in the modern history of
the death penalty to go through a habeas corpus appeal without the
aid of an attorney. The Georgia Supremes ruled last year that was
OK, making Georgia the only state in the nation not to require
lawyers at this stage of their appeals. Had the Georgia Supremes
sent the case back for a hearing, with a lawyer, the judge would
have learned new revelations that, when he was convicted and
sentenced to die, Gibson was represented by a lawyer who was
working as an assistant state attorney general _ a clear conflict
of interest. And this lawyer billed just 33 hours of work for the
case _ including 6 hrs for travel. Now, a federal judge in Augusta
has taken extraordinary steps to bypass the Georgia Supremes,
demanding new hearings. Saying he'd never seen anything like it in
his 20 years on the bench, federal judge Dudley Bowen even called
the state court judge to ask him to consider hearing the case.

   DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE _ Many immigrants, particularly women, are
more susceptible to domestic violence and less likely to report
abuse than native born Americans. Many don't speak English and are
dependent on a spouse who works; they don't know a shelter exists
and, even if they do, can't speak enough English to steer
themselves to one. There are cultural barriers, too. Many South
Asian women who get divorced are considered ``discarded objects''
with little chance of re-marrying b/c divorce is such a cultural
taboo. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ The push for school vouchers is a folly founded
on a fallacy. For the most part, it's driven by an ideology that
argues that government can do nothing right, that every
public-policy problem can be solved by turning it over to private
enterprise. Newt Gingrich used to capture that attitude perfectly
when he derisively referred to public schools as ``government
schools.'' (Bookman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GLASS-COLUMN _WASHINGTON _ In 1996, a friend ran across
Madeleine Albright at the Democratic National Convention as she
strolled down Chicago's Miracle Mile with her security guards in
tow. ``I hear you've got a good shot at being Secretary of State,''
the friend said. Albright pressed a finger to her lips. ``Don't
talk about it,'' she pleaded. ``It could screw things up.'' That
encounter came to mind at a recent dinner party attended by Richard
Holbrooke, Albright's successor as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations and a leading candidate to succeed her as secretary should
Al Gore move into the White House next year. (Glass, Cox News

   CCE-ALM _ATLANTA _John Alm has some big shoes to fill as
president of Coca-Cola Enterprises. Replacing Henry Schimberg, the
Michael Jordan of the beverage industry according to one analyst,
will not be easy. Schimberg, who started out as a route driver and
retired at the end of last year after spending more than four
decades in the industry, is widely credited with turning
Atlanta-based CCE into the Coke system's premier bottling
organization. After buying concentrate or syrup from Coca-Cola Co.,
a bottler adds water and carbonation, then fills cans and bottles
with the soft drinks before distributing them to retailers. During
the 1990s, Schimberg and Chairman Summerfield Johnston Jr. nearly
tripled the size of the company through a series of acquisitions in
North America and Europe that boosted revenue to more than $14
billion. With nearly 70,000 employees in eight nations, CCE
currently accounts for three-quarters of Coca-Cola's case sales in
North America and 22 percent globally. (Unger, Atlanta

   ALM-CAMP _ HYATTVILLE, Wyo. _ Toya Williams never rappelled down
a mountain before. Jason Harrison never rode a horse. And Christina
Edwards never shot a bow and arrow. All that changed this summer
when the Los Angeles middle school graduates stayed at a cattle
ranch in a picturesque mountain canyon just outside this town of
100. The three teenagers, and 33 others, were a world away from the
gangbangers and drug dealers that inhabit many of their inner city
L.A. neighborhoods. They were a world away from poor adult role
models, broken homes or inadequate supervision that made up some of
their lives. And they were a world away from having to worry about
where or when their next meal might come from. They were in summer
camp _ a special one created by someone they're likely never to
forget. That someone is John Alm, a high-powered, high-energy
beverage executive who spent several million dollars of his own
money to fulfill a long-term dream. (Unger, Atlanta

   EZELL- 401K _ After all the whooping about tax cuts, it looks

   PAYDAY-LOANS _GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ The number and amount of
high-interest ``payday'' loans - where you get money and the lender
promises not to cash your personal check until a certain date - is
exploding in western Colorado. Of the 14 licensed lenders in Grand
Junction, Clifton and Montrose, seven started doing business in
2000. In 1999, the companies made more than 21,000 loans for a
total of more than $2.8 million, according to the state. Statewide,
there were 600,000 such loans last year, for a total of $86.4
million, almost 30 percent more than in 1998. (Grand Junction)

10: Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight, who had violated his
zero tolerance policy, had been fired. The chain reaction that
followed stopped the state of Indiana in its tracks. Students
protested and were arrested. Threats were made to the parties who
made Knight's actions public. Players announced they would quit if
their ultimatums were not heeded. Assistant coaches said they would
heed Knight's advice on whether to remain at the school. School

that have hit the city in recent years? The Panthers have had to
deal with the media frenzy surrounding the arrest of former
first-round pick Rae Carruth and the sudden death last summer of
former running back Fred Lane. And the tragedies haven't been
limited to the football team - last year's death of Charlotte
Hornets player Bobby Phills and the death of two fans at Lowe's
Motor Speedway in Charlotte two years ago. Through the first two
weeks of the season, the off-the field occurrences apparently
haven't impacted the team on the field as the Panthers are 1-1
heading into Sunday's game against the Falcons. But we will attempt
to gauge the interest in Charlotte and see if the town's sports
fans, who have been hit with several tragedies, are rallying behind
the Panthers. (Sugiura, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    LOTT READY TO DEAL ON VISA BILL FOR HIGH-SKILLED IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will negotiate
with Democrats next week on a bill raising the number of visas for
high-skilled foreign workers, Lott told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leader will seek to limit amendments to the bill,
allowing the long-stalled measure to move toward passage, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The tech industry welcomed the prospect of compromise on the
H-1B visas, one if its top priorities in the waning weeks of the
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's promise is ``one giant step in the right direction,''
said Connie Correll, a spokeswoman for the Information Technology
Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington. ``If the
Senate moves it, then it puts pressure on the House to do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   The H-1B visas allow skilled foreigners, such as computer
programmers and engineers, to work in the United States for up to
six years. Technology-driven companies say they are facing a worker
shortage so severe that only an immediate infusion of foreign
talent will help.
</P>
<P>
   A spirit of compromise appeared to be spreading as industry
steps up its fierce lobbying for the visa bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, we've heard lot of positive talk'' among key
members of Congress, Correll said. ``We're very optimistic that the
talk is going to turn into something'' that can pass both the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That the bill has not already passed may seem strange,
considering that both Democrats and Republicans support the effort
to nearly double the number of visas granted each year to 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a near-consensus on the need for more workers,
partisan fighting broke out this summer. The flash point came when
Hispanic groups began pushing Congress to link H-1B legislation to
a separate measure granting legal residency to as many as 2 million
undocumented immigrants living in the United States since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who along with Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif., co-authored a bipartisan bill for expanding H-1B visas,
surprised Republicans when she suddenly agreed with those Hispanic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   She sent a letter to Dreier saying the two issues ought to be
linked. That infuriated Republicans, who insisted the White House
was trying to use the immigration amnesty bill to make the GOP
appear unfriendly to Hispanic voters during an election year. Tech
lobbyists overwhelmingly have sided with Republicans in saying that
the complex amnesty issue should not be tied to the high-tech
visas.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Eckstein, a spokesman for Lofgren, insists Democrats were
just trying to be helpful, believing that linking the issues would
get the Hispanic Caucus to support high-tech legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, we suggested in a letter ... that it might be a
good strategy to include these (amnesty issues) because it might
help grow the vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mills, a spokesman for Dreier, said he letter was never
intended to be helpful, and in fact ``derailed the House and Senate
H-1B bills by inserting unrelated immigration issues into the
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Now lawmakers are trying to get back on track. But the clock may
be running down, as Congress has set a target adjournment date of
Oct. 6 so members can hit the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott wins a deal to limit amendments on the Senate bill and
get a vote next week, that may break the logjam in the House as
well. But should the effort to approve a separate bill fail,
tech-industry supporters see another way to enact the measure:
attaching it to a widely expected consolidated budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Dreier is committed to working towards a bipartisan
H-1B solution, even if that means including it in end-of-the-year
wrap-up legisation,'' Mills said.

FILM DIRECTORS CALL FOR CLEARER RATINGS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Directors Guild of America, stung by
widespread criticism that Hollywood sells violence to children,
called for a uniform ratings code for all entertainment media that
would help parents monitor what their children see or hear.
</P>
<P>
   The guild's downtown press conference Thursday was in a response
to a Federal Trade Commission report issued this week that
chastised entertainment companies for marketing explicitly violent
or sexual movies, recordings and video games at younger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than denouncing the FTC report as a stepping stone toward
government censorship, the DGA embraced the study's conclusions,
its support of First Amendment concerns and its call for
self-regulation rather than government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No filmmaker wants his or her film to be seen by those for
whom it was not intended,'' said Rob Reiner, reading at a news
conference from the policy statement prepared by the guild's Task
Force on Violence and Social Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call upon theater owners to employ a zero-tolerance policy
with respect to allowing underage children to enter the theater
playing a movie that has been deemed inappropriate for their age
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We further support an industry-devised code of conduct to
govern the marketing of movies intended for mature audiences, and
encourage all who produce and distribute such materials to develop
these policies as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes Craven, who directed the ``Scream'' horror movies, declined
to speculate on how those smash hits would have done at the box
office if ushers had kept out most underage moviegoers and the
advertising had been aimed strictly at adults.
</P>
<P>
   If there were industry-imposed regulations that restricted a
future fright movie's advertising reach, Craven said, ``I'm willing
to accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make films that are for 17 and over. In my mind the core
audience is 17 to 35,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Barclay, who directed many episodes of ``NYPD Blue'' and
now helms ``ER'' and ``The West Wing,'' said Hollywood sometimes is
blamed for societal ills because ``politicians are finding it
easier to quantify the marketing of films to children than to
quantify a lack of parental attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclay also directed the R-rated comedy ``Don't Be a Menace to
South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,'' a 1995 spoof
of coming-of-age ``hood'' movies that is thick with crude humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a 13-year-old tells me, 'I've seen that film 10
times,' it makes me cringe,'' Barclay said.
</P>
<P>
   The position paper offered no real details or mechanism for
implementation, but its general points included:
</P>
<P>
   _ One standardized ratings system for movies, TV shows,
recordings, video games and Internet entertainment to minimize
consumers' confusion
</P>
<P>
   _ More detailed information than the currently wide-reaching R
rating issued by the Motion Picture Association of America, which
encompasses everything from scattered obscene language to abusive
sex and extremely gory violence. Under the suggested system (whose
particulars have not been determined), a movie's ads and trailers
would explicitly state the type of objectionable content that
warranted its rating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marketing plans that aim the product at its intended audience,
not a younger crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the MPAA, was traveling Thursday and
could not be reached for comment. Other representatives of the
association declined to discuss the DGA proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti will speak at related upcoming hearings of the Senate
Commerce Committee chaired by John McCain, R-Ariz., and studio
chiefs _ none of whom appeared at Wednesday's hearings in
Washington _ have been asked to appear in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Recording Industry Assn. of America and
the Interactive Digital Software Assn. did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report and the task force's formation in June 1999 grew
out of an outcry about the apparent negative impact of
entertainment violence on teens and children after the Columbine
High School shootings in April 1999 and other recent acts of
violence by children.

A BIZARRE TYSON HAS HIS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Mike Tyson, who already has said he
would eat Lennox Lewis' children, threatened Thursday to kill Lewis
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, speaking at a strange-as-it-comes news conference to
promote his fight with Andrew Golota on Oct. 20, said he felt
intimidated by the bigger Lewis when they ran into one another in
London recently and vowed not to let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he tries to intimidate me again, I'll put a bullet in his
(expletive) skull,'' Tyson said in a Beverly Hilton Hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the most bizarre comment of many in a
profanity-laced dialogue with reporters that was disturbing even by
Tyson's standards.
</P>
<P>
   First, the former champion arrived 2 hours late and after Golota
had left. And, when he finally did get there, he was in an unusual
state. He was in a good mood, almost giddy at times, but didn't
behave like a person who was in control of his senses.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he stripped off his shirt and jumped on a table at
the dais in response to a question about his physical condition,
which was out of character for the normally sullen, even
belligerent fighter.
</P>
<P>
   He takes antidepressants and admitted they affect him in many
adverse ways. However, it wasn't clear whether they played a role
in his behavior Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be on something,'' several members of the media said
during the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain some of his comments, although he's infamous
for many things he's said under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of what Tyson said Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   --On the antidepressant Zoloft, which he must stop taking before
his fights: ``I'm on the Zoloft thing. I'm on that to keep me from
killing you all. It has really messed me up and I don't want to be
taking it, but they are concerned about the fact that I'm a violent
person, almost an animal. And they only want me to be an animal in
the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   --``I'm a hell raiser. I'll get in trouble or killed one day.
There's nothing I can do about it. It's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   --On whether he could beat Lewis if the two meet in the ring:
``I know I can kill him, I know I can beat him into oblivion. Does
that answer your question?''
</P>
<P>
   --``I'm a n-----, a street person. I don't want to be a street
person. It's just the tragedy of my life. You all (the media) made
me that way. ... Just make sure you talk about me, make sure your
kids and grandkids know about me. Your grandkids will say, 'Wasn't
that a bizarre individual?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tyson's people couldn't argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   Several rolled their eyes and shrugged their shoulders as they
left the dais after the news conference. Tommy Brooks, one of
Tyson's trainers, was asked, ``Well, that was interesting, wasn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   He could only laugh, although the news conference was more
pathetic than funny.

NET INCOME AT PAYLESS CASHWAYS RISES 37% IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Payless Cashways Inc. turned in a mixed but
mostly positive quarter for the three months that ended Aug. 26,
earning 12 cents a share compared with 9 cents a share last year.
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $2.4 million, a 37 percent boost over net income
of $1.7 million in last year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, same-store sales for the home improvement retailer fell
18.6 percent, mostly due to deflation in lumber and wallboard
prices, reductions in advertising activity and continuing business
restructuring. Same-store sales are sales at stores open at least
one year.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales were $392 million, compared with $492 million for
the same quarter last year, a drop of more than 20 percent. The
company had four fewer stores in the just-ended quarter than in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company managed to squeeze $23.3 million out of selling,
general and administrative costs, down to $84.7 million, a 21.6
percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-flow measure EBITDA _ earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization _ increased to $22.6 million, 5.8
percent of sales, compared with $22.4 million, 4.6 percent of
sales, for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Year to date, Payless has reported a 19.5 percent increase in
EBITDA, to $48.1 million, while the net loss narrowed to $1.7
million, a 69.5 percent improvement over the year-to-date loss of
$5.4 million for the first three quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the first three quarters of 2000 were $1.16 billion, a
13.4 percent decline in same-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our third-quarter results reflect our many positive turnaround
initiatives as well as the negative effects of sector-slowing
dynamics,'' said the company's chief executive officer, Millard
Barron.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking about the improvements in EBITDA, selling, general
and administrative costs and better gross margins, Barron said, ``I
believe these fundamental improvements combined with our many sales
initiatives and a solid focus on building stronger relationships
with our target customers are key steps forward in our journey
toward a successful future for our company.'' ( 30 )

STUDY SAYS GIRLS FRET ABOUT IMAGES EARLIER &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bolstering criticism that sexual content in
movies, television and music has aged children before their time, a
new study has found an alarming number of girls as young as 8 years
old worry unduly about looks and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The study, a first by the Girl Scout Research Institute, found
that sexual images in the media have ``compressed'' the mental,
physical and emotional development of preteen girls, causing them
to emulate and act like teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad when you hear that 7- and 8-year-olds are worried
about dieting,'' said Ellen Christie Ach, a spokeswoman for the
Girl Scouts. ``It's not that these girls look up to these women _
these actresses and models _ it's that they are really worried that
they don't look like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about bashing the media, but adults do need to help
girls get realistic expectations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Jackie Munoz said she doesn't feel much pressure
from the media, but does feel some from her peers. Her solution:
Ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older people reject you because you're younger,''
said Jackie, a student at Francis Parkman Middle School in Woodland
Hills. ``If you don't act or dress older, they won't talk to you.
But I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ach said that attitudes like that among preteens are the
exception. While girls may be developing more rapidly physically,
she said, their emotional development has not kept pace. Ach said
the resulting stress has not before been seen in girls in this age
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is for them to find people to help them through
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the study _ ``Girls Speak Out: Teens Before Their Time'' _
researchers used focus groups and surveys, interviewing 214 girls 8
to 12 across the country. As well, an additional 1,082 online
surveys were collected.
</P>
<P>
   Bombarded by sexually-laced media images, preteen girls are
trying more and more to emulate those images in an effort to be
popular with both boys and girls, researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Britney Spears would be nice because you could wear a
bikini without a big fat tummy sticking out all over the place,'' a
third-grader told researchers.
</P>
<P>
   At Francis Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills, results of
the Girl Scouts' study did not surprise students, parents and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of peer pressure to wear makeup, to look older
and be more mature,'' said Karen Miller, who has been teaching
middle school for 11 years. ``These kids are growing up very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the school, while waiting to pick up her 11-year-old
daughter Jessica, Vickie Strelioff said she tries to limit her
daughters exposure to mature images and themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let her watch things like MTV,'' she said. ``I'm not
overprotective, but I don't think those outside influences are
good. They're encouraged to be sexual.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jessica said she feels some pressure from friends and
movies to look and act older, she said she is more focused on
school: She wants to go to college and become a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at the school, however, said they see daily the effects
of myriad images on their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media makes adolescence more manic now,'' said Michael
Gross, a seventh-grade teacher. ``There are pressures from the
Internet, TV, the content of lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year teaching veteran Colleen Schwab agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dealing with very mature issues without the
maturity,'' she said. ``They're so worried about having an image
that I see it getting in the way of focusing on their education.
It's a problem classroom teachers have to battle every day.''

KANSAS MAN IS AMONG TARGETS OF SEC CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET STOCK
SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An Independence, Kan., school bus mechanic
was charged last week in a nationwide crackdown on 33 companies and
individuals accused of using the Internet to defraud investors by
manipulating the prices of small companies' stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission focused
on ``pump and dump'' schemes in which promoters hype stocks through
false contentions, pumping up their prices, and then sell the
shares at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said last week's sweep, its fourth against online
investment scams in the last two years, involved the stocks of more
than 70 thinly traded companies. The agency said the perpetrators
had made illegal profits of more than $10 million by pumping up the
total market value of the companies by more than $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What used to require a network of professional promoters and
brokers, banks of telephones and months to accomplish can now be
done in minutes by a single person using the Internet and a home
computer,'' Richard H. Walker, the SEC's director of enforcement,
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinly traded microcap stocks are particularly susceptible to
online manipulations. ``That's why we have made this area one of
our highest enforcement priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15 enforcement actions brought by the SEC in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Nevada, New York and
Oklahoma sought to curb the use of electronic newsletters, Web
sites, Internet chat rooms and e-mail to promote stocks through the
dissemination of false or misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that many of the individuals and companies who
were targets of the crackdown had no experience in the securities
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Independence school bus mechanic, the SEC
alleged that Christopher P. Hastings, using the screen name
Stockpicks1, promoted the stock of 10 companies through a free
e-mail newsletter with up to 400 subscribers and on various
Internet message boards. The agency said Hastings included false
and misleading data concerning his track record for stock picks,
which he said averaged increases of 410 percent after his touts.
</P>
<P>
   In two instances, the SEC said, Hastings sold his personal
holdings of the touted stocks for profits of $70,309.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Hastings last week consented
to an order barring him from future violations of federal
securities laws and agreed to give up $22,312. The order was filed
in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, 33, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael MacPhail, an attorney with the SEC's regional office in
Denver, said the consent order called for Hastings to pay $70,309
plus prejudgment interest, ``but we waived the rest of it based on
his demonstrated inability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy typifies a trend of unsophisticated people without
any securities experience that are out there on the Internet
promoting stocks,'' MacPhail said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case brought by the SEC in New York, the agency charged
that Gursel Mandaci, a college student and driver for a car
service, purchased penny stocks using a margin account at an online
broker. He then posted messages on the Internet touting the stocks.
The SEC said Mandaci made more than $23,000 in six stocks,
including one whose price jumped from 1 cent to 38 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In another case brought in Nevada, the SEC alleged that Chill
Tech Industry Inc. and its chief operating officer issued false and
misleading statements about Chill Tech's ``environmentally
friendly'' Arctic Can, supposedly a self-cooling beverage can. In
fact, the agency said, the Arctic Can used Freon, a banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said that crackdowns in October 1998 and February 1999
dealt with the unlawful touting of publicly traded companies over
the Internet and that a May 1999 sweep focused on the sale of bogus
securities over the Internet. ( 30 )

ASSERTIONS OF SURPLUS ARE A LIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they turned off New York City's National Debt Clock
recently, a wire story said the decision was made because the
national debt ``has actually decreased since the beginning of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no, no! A thousand times no! The Treasury's debt summary
dated Aug. 31 shows total public debt $5 billion higher than it was
on Aug. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, this number reflects laudable progress. It means
Washington has essentially balanced income and outgo for the past
year. In another respect, however, it reveals claims of budget
surpluses and declining debt as the fiscal shams they are.
</P>
<P>
   When July's Treasury report showed $4.8 billion in black ink, it
was cheered as that month's first surplus since the '50s, and the
year-to-date surplus for fiscal 2000 was put at $181 billion. Only
in the Wonderland of U.S. budgetary accounting, though, can anyone
claim a $181 billion surplus even as the national debt has actually
increased.
</P>
<P>
   While the Treasury calls all its obligations ``public debt,''
there are two kinds of debt. One component is marketable
securities, with market value, held by investors, financial
institutions and foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   The other component is called nonmarketable debt. It is created
when the Treasury diverts revenue earmarked for specific activities
to other purposes. Revenue not needed to cover Social Security
benefits, for example, goes to finance general fund outlays. The
Social Security trust fund in turn receives a credit in the form of
a nonmarketable security _ an IOU with no market value. As such,
it's an unfunded liability of the U.S. government _ i.e., taxpayers
_ to be redeemed whenever Social Security revenue starts falling
short of benefit obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is merely the largest and most visible program
with more income than outgo, however. The national debt deception
involves focusing on the marketable debt and ignoring the
nonmarketable debt piling up in the form of myriad trust funds'
IOUs.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury has indeed been paying down marketable debt. On
Aug. 31, marketable debt was $3.056 trillion, or $224 billion lower
than a year earlier. Nonmarketable debt, however, is another story.
It stood at $2.611 trillion on Aug. 31, which was $229 billion
higher than a year ago. This means that despite Treasury's
marketable debt paydown, total national debt still rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? Revenue tagged for activities such as
Social Security, highway construction, air travel system
improvements, and myriad smaller programs having trust funds
generated more revenue than was spent toward their dedicated
purpose. The excess was spent on general budget items but still
counted as surplus even though the IOUs deposited in the trust
funds boost the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   When someone in Washington boasts of budget surpluses, Americans
should have but one response: Show us the money.
</P>
<P>
   The officially proclaimed budget surpluses for fiscal '98, '99
and 2000's first nine months total nearly $375 billion. The total
public debt outstanding during these 33 months has risen more than
$150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What we've got, it seems, is an accounting misunderstanding
amounting to more than half a trillion dollars. &QL;

KEYES REITERATES TRADITIONAL VALUES MESSAGE IN BAKER UNIVERSITY
SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALDWIN CITY, Kan. _ Alan Keyes struggled to attract voters as a
Republican presidential candidate, but he did attract attention
with his ideas about the importance of traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Holding to that message, Keyes received a standing ovation from
a crowd of about 800 who listened to his lecture Thursday at Baker
University's annual opening convocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had to choose between right and wrong,'' he said.
``There's never been a time when it's as important as it is (now)
and will become.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the economy prospers, Keyes thinks the United
States will succeed only if people and government are guided by a
code of decency and justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were founded on moral principle,'' he said at a news
conference after the address. ``If we lose our sense of that, our
institutions will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, 50, ran for president this year and in 1996. He was the
Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Maryland in 1988 and
1992, and lost both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a classic political nobody,'' Keyes said. ``The fact that
I'm having any impact at all is a tribute to the grass-roots
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker spokesman John Fuller said the crowd Keyes attracted was
one of the largest in the history of the Loreine Collins Dietrich
Distinguished Lecture Series, which was established in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Previous speakers include former President Gerald Ford, former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Republican vice
presidential candidate Dick Cheney and newspaper columnist George
Will.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Keyes, university President Daniel Lambert
described him as someone who ``seldom leaves any doubt where he
stands on important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said he would like to see the content of television shows
and movies cleaned up, but not by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to reform their products,'' he said, ``we should
reform our tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   When a student reporter suggested that today's young people are
uninterested in politics, Keyes disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience that's a myth,'' he said. ``But they want
substance, not shallow garbage fed to them.'' ( 30 )

`PRIZE' FOR ANGELS LIKELY OUT OF REACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They know why you're here. That's a wreath
carried, not some feel-good bouquet. It's a solemn look, if almost
from a father still proud from the failed effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels have been assigned their roles, told exactly
their place, yet keep squirming into some crack of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Marc Antony routine, where we come more to bury the
Angels than to praise them.
</P>
<P>
   And the great temptation is to tip the cap, admire a season
where they performed better than most imagined, and then resign
them to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you're talking to the wrong guy,'' said Angels manager
Mike Scioscia, and you just knew he would say that.
</P>
<P>
   Reality can offer a rude awakening, and the reality is the
Angels left town Thursday six games back of Seattle in the American
League West and 5 behind Cleveland for the wild-card spot. They
have but 16 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Time is not an ally here, only a cold reminder of flaws
identified long ago that still haunt. The Angels do not return to
Anaheim again until the final three games of the year against
Seattle. That follows four games at second-place Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's still time for us to get there,'' Scioscia
said. ``We have some head-to-head games down the stretch that are
going to help. But to get to where those games are really going to
be meaningful, it may take a club that's not in contention against
a club in contention helping us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's come to that, but that the Angels could even get there
seems fairly stunning.
</P>
<P>
   They remain a team without a rotation. They have tried starting
13 different pitchers this season, none of whom have started at
least 25 games. None of whom has won even eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Old, broken-down guys. Eager kids with their first driver's
license. Guys discarded at midseason by others from unimpressive
rotations. Guys one step ahead of the scalpel. Calling it a parade
of mediocrity would be oh-so generous.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Angels and starting pitching is a problem older than
Tim Belcher. It's a traditional embarrassment. Certainly, it has
the albatross over many a failed season long before Bill Stoneman
showed up as the new general manager in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman let Chuck Finley walk but appeared to recognize the
problem in the spring when the traded outfielder Jim Edmonds for
right-hander Kent Bottenfield. Then apparently getting too carried
away with the success of his young starters, rather incredibly, he
traded Bottenfield to the Phillies July 30 for veteran outfielder
Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   That netted Gant (batting .213 and long-since relegated to the
Angels bench) for Edmonds (.302, with 39 homers and 99 RBI), who's
five years younger. Not Stoneman's finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Angels persisted in hanging in the race, which is both
testament to their resolve and the woeful state of the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to say this in a nice way, but I could care less what
anybody thinks,'' Angels outfielder Darin Erstad said. ``Everybody
has their opinion, but as a group we're confident. We believe in
ourselves, and that's to a man every single guy. No matter what the
score is, we feel like we can win the baseball game. We've had that
attitude all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia deflects praise that he had gotten more from a team
with a ravaged and green rotation than could have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this team has overachieved,'' Scioscia said. ``I
think this team is very talented. We've shown that when we get the
pitching to match this offense, that we can go against anybody and
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And if their success seems unexpected, they are still only two
games away from being a .500 club. A .500 team in the spring
wouldn't have sounded like such a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception might be out there that we had a good year but
aren't going to get it done,'' Scioscia said. ``That's not our
feeling in the clubhouse. We're not going to be satisfied with any
season unless you finish on top. That's still our goal. We have our
eye on the prize.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be looking pretty distant by now. The eulogy has been
polished. Time to tip the cap, and count the days.

SENATE PANEL HEARS DEBATE ON USING U.S. MONEY FOR STEM CELL
RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists, famous film stars and influential
lawmakers said Thursday the potential for curing diseases justifies
using federal funds for embryonic stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Russell E. Saltzman, a Kansas City, Mo., minister with diabetes,
begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee heard testimony on legislation that would
allow researchers to use federal money to obtain stem cells from
leftover embryos created through the in-vitro fertilization
process.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research, which is legal if privately financed, has
shown promise in curing diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
diseases, spinal cord injuries, heart ailments and other illnesses,
experts told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are the basic cells in newly formed embryos that
generate all other tissues in the body. Some scientists think they
could use stem cells to create healthy tissue to replace diseased
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Michael J. Fox, Mary Tyler Moore and Jennifer Estess
testified in favor of the legislation, saying it could lead to
breakthroughs in the treatment of their illnesses. Fox has
Parkinson's disease, Moore has diabetes and Estess has amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Saltzman, pastor at Ruskin Heights Lutheran Church, told the
committee he would not want his diabetes cured if it meant
destroying an embryo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes to a question: Is the human embryo human life or is
it a mere bit of research material?'' Saltzman told the committee.
``If it is mere research material, then why should any human life
at any stage carry any special privileges?''
</P>
<P>
   Saltzman, asked to testify at the hearing by the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, was one of three witnesses who said
that destroying an embryo for research purposes is morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators at the hearing acknowledged the Senate is divided
as well, just as it was seven years ago when Congress decided
federal money could be used to pay for research using cells and
tissue from aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should get the misimpression we don't wrestle with the
ethical and moral implications of what this is all about,'' said
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, ranking Democrat on the appropriations
subcommittee overseeing human services, which held the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Harkin, sponsor of legislation to allow federal money to be
used for stem cell research, said the embryos in question would be
destroyed anyway. Extra embryos are often created for multiple
in-vitro attempts for successful pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to be discarded, is it more moral and
ethical to use these to reduce human suffering and to prolong
life?'' Harkin asked. There are about 100,000 frozen embryos in
existence that will be discarded if not used, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin and Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who
is chairman of the subcommittee, said they don't think of an embryo
as a human life. Moore said it ``has no more resemblance to a human
being than a goldfish.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saltzman said everyone came from an embryo, no matter the
circumstances of their conceptions. Saltzman said he was conceived
by step-siblings, perhaps through rape, and was put up for adoption
25 years before abortion became legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all once were human embryos, we all once were fetuses
quickening in our mothers' wombs,'' Saltzman said. ``We are all,
each, human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Heagy, a California man who became a quadriplegic after a
surfing accident at age 17, said he doesn't think tax dollars
should be used for embryo research, even if it may lead to progress
in treating spinal cord or other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to research,'' said Heagy. ``I'm not opposed
to walking again. I'm just opposed to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   A physician and research scientist with diabetes, Anton-Lewis
Usala, spoke of other effective ways to research and treat diseases
without have the government intervene in the fate of embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, the perceived right of the government will
supersede the right of the individual,'' Usala said.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin, however, said his proposal addresses some of the moral
concerns. Embryos cannot be created for the purpose of research;
any fees would only be for transportation and actual costs involved
in the work; donors would have to sign written consents to permit
donation; and no one could be paid for embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new guidelines have established high ethical and
procedural standards that both federally funded and private sector
researchers would be expected to follow,'' Harkin said. The money
would come from the budget of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the Senate leadership promised a vote on stem cell
research before adjournment next month. He has had film stars
testify at previous hearings to tell their stories, despite some
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no apologies for this, because we need public
awareness of this issue,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, star of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' of the 1970s, has
had diabetes for 30 years and has been at risk of blindness or the
need for amputation because of the disease. Moore said study has
shown that stem cells hold potential to develop insulin-producing
cells in diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that stem cell research should be pursued vigorously
and is appropriate for federal funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox _ who recently received an Emmy for ``Spin City,'' the ABC
sitcom that he has left to devote more time to fighting his
neurological disease _ cited research he said indicates the value
of transplanted cells may have for patients with Parkinson's
disease and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This research offers the potential to eliminate diseases and
literally save millions of lives,'' Fox said. ``It's time to act on
what we have learned. Further delay would come at a high price.'' (

UNITED WAY TAPS FORMER DRUG DEALER FOR ROLE IN NEW CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ John Taylor, a former drug-dealing,
gunslinging high school dropout, once spent 17 months in prison for
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way hopes he's still adept at getting money from
people.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is among those featured in television commercials and a
campaign video that the United Way thinks will tug at donors'
hearts in coming weeks and help it reach this year's $39.5 million
five-county fund-raising goal.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way's campaign video, in which a song plays over
images of people helped by United Way agencies, will be shown at
more than 2,500 area businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor appears with his daughter, JonNieca, 9. She's playing on
a slide. He's in a wheelchair, watching.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a wheelchair because he says the devil came to get him
nine years ago. Bullets tore into his neck and the back of his
head, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down. But the devil
didn't win, Taylor says. God did.
</P>
<P>
   United Way officials thought Taylor's bad-guy-turned-good-guy
story was so inspiring, they felt comfortable featuring him in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically do the same thing,'' Taylor, 32, says of the
United Way. ``We help others.'' Bad company
</P>
<P>
   John ``Fats'' Taylor, who grew up near 24th Street and Brooklyn
Avenue, dropped out of Central High School in the 1980s because he
would not graduate, even if he took summer school.
</P>
<P>
   One October, Taylor robbed some men at a coin-operated laundry.
When he returned from prison in 1988, his friends were selling
marijuana and crack cocaine. Taylor's job paid only $100 to $175 a
week, not enough for the lifestyle he craved.
</P>
<P>
   So Taylor sold marijuana, then expanded his inventory to crack
and ``water,'' the street name for PCP.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he and a friend were netting $700 an hour. They had gold
jewelry and cars. Taylor and his friends carried guns. So did their
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   One night Taylor dreamed he got shot. That, plus the fact his
girlfriend was pregnant, made him consider retirement.
</P>
<P>
   His nightmare came true first.
</P>
<P>
   It was the spring of 1991, 10 days before Taylor's 23rd
birthday. He had two passengers in the car, one of whom had just
spent 15 minutes inside an apartment, probably getting high.
</P>
<P>
   A handgun rested in Taylor's lap. The rear-seat passenger
carried two small-caliber handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fats, what do you want to do?'' the guy in the back asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want to do,'' Taylor answered.
</P>
<P>
   Pow! A bullet tore into Taylor's neck, instantly paralyzing him.
His uncontrolled car swerved into a parked car.
</P>
<P>
   Pow! Pow! Pow!
</P>
<P>
   Eight more bullets struck Taylor in the head, neck and shoulder.
He played dead, hoping the shooter wouldn't shove the gun into his
mouth for a final shot.
</P>
<P>
   As the shooter and the other passenger calmly walked away,
Taylor prayed: ``God, will you save me? Don't let me die like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, Taylor heard a woman whisper that there was
nothing they could do. His mother came into the room. She had been
crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Jr.,'' his father said, ``I love you. You was the
strongest son I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Was? Why did he say that in past tense, John wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Someone gave Taylor intravenous medication, and he faded from
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, at the Rehabilitation Institute of Kansas City, a
therapist asked Taylor his goals. Taylor wanted to walk out of the
United Way-funded institute someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, John, what do you really want to do?'' the therapist said.
``Realistically.'' Slow improvement
</P>
<P>
   As the years dragged by, Taylor improved slightly. He learned to
operate a motorized wheelchair. He regained some function in his
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   He also endured depression. He considered selling drugs again _
and for a while, got a girlfriend to do it for him. He smoked
marijuana when he could.
</P>
<P>
   He lived different places, including 18 months at Swope Ridge
Geriatric Center, another United Way agency.
</P>
<P>
   His faith wavered. Four weeks in a row, a minister showed up on
Sundays to take him to church. Three times, Taylor turned him down.
Finally, he said yes just to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   At church, as members prayed for him, Taylor pretended to pray,
but he really wanted to get home to watch football. Then he felt
something kick in his stomach, as if it wanted out. His eyes flew
open. What had that minister done? Taylor felt scared.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, he began speaking at schools. He told youths
not to join gangs and not to sell drugs, or they could end up like
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, Taylor gradually gained movement in his
right leg and toes. He experienced additional spiritual moments in
church services, including one Taylor took as God promising he
would walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by his birthday in mid-1999, Taylor feared his chances were
slipping away. Newly resumed therapy was going poorly. Taylor
stopped outside the Rehabilitation Institute and begged God to show
up and help.
</P>
<P>
   That day, he stood with the assistance of a walker with padded
arm rests and stepped as usual with his right foot. Therapist Renee
Hughes kicked his left leg along, as usual. Then she didn't kick
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor walked 60 feet without her help.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' said a surprised Hughes. ``Now we've got something to
work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside afterward, Taylor wept. And thanked God. Giving others
hope
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Taylor rolled his wheelchair into a
fourth-floor pod at the Jackson County Detention Center downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up, man?'' one inmate asked. ``We've been waiting for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone pulled a thick, worn Bible from Taylor's backpack as the
inmates scrambled to retrieve their own Bibles. Taylor flipped to
Genesis 22:1.
</P>
<P>
   An inmate read how God tested Abraham by telling him to
sacrifice his only son, Isaac, and how an angel stopped Abraham
just when he got out his knife. Abraham showed he feared God, so
God spared Isaac.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor equated the story to the inmates' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a test,'' he said. ``It's a test of several
things. It's a test of your faith. It's a test of your obedience.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor volunteers 14 hours a week at the jail, praying and
talking with inmates. He also spends more than five hours each week
at Swope Ridge, meeting with residents.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner Thursday, the Jackson County Detention Center
presented Taylor with a Volunteer of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   He works out twice a week at the Rehabilitation Institute. Part
of that time, he walks. With great effort, he pushes himself up
from his wheelchair and grabs the walker. Then slowly,
methodically, he plods down the hallway. The troublesome left leg
shakes as he strains to lift it. He looks down to see where it is.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Taylor experienced what he calls another miracle.
In his bedroom, he lifted his arms from his walker and stood
without support for 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his visiting nurse cried.
</P>
<P>
   He has done more than doctors ever expected. Especially standing
alone _ something very rare for a quadriplegic, said Chris
Anderson, the Rehabilitation Institute's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor believes he will walk again someday without the walker.
</P>
<P>
   Then he wants to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing shall be impossible to them that believe,'' he said. (

DOCTORS OPTIMISTIC AFTER PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And now just in time for what promises to be an
intriguing offseason, a possible excuse for an ineffective Carlos
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez underwent successful arthroscopic surgery Thursday
afternoon to remove a chipped bone spur and clean up the base where
it calcified.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Jobe said the area had been sore for some time, and it
could be the reason why Perez had lost velocity the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' Jobe said. ``There's no way to measure it,
but the thought did occur to me when we were doing it that could be
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll have more range of motion now, and it will
hopefully help him to regain his former glory.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Jobe and Dr. Ralph Gambardella should be enshired
immediately into the Medical Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was 5-8 with a 5.56 ERA before going on the shelf. This
after going 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers are still on the hook for $7.5 million
next year for Perez, the last season of his now infamous three-year
$15.6-million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe said Perez should be ready to start spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas quashed: A Chicago judge quashed the subpoenas issued
to 18 members of the Dodgers organization and Alan Mills (since
traded to Baltimore) in the criminal case of Charles Carlin,
meaning none of the players will have to testify in the case, said
attorney Mike Abernathy. That trial begins Monday as Carlin faces
misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct stemming from the May 16
fight at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the Dodgers organization were subpoenaed in the
criminal case of Ronald Camacho, also charged with disorderly
conduct. A trial date hasn't been set for that, but Abernathy,
hired by the Dodgers to handle the cases, said he will argue those
subpoenas be quashed as well. ``It's the same thing,'' Abernathy
said. ``I don't see it as being a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery for Leyritz: Reserve catcher Jim Leyritz will also have
arthroscopic surgery to repair a small tear in his right surgery
following the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, batting .200, will be available for pinch hitting until
the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Pena improved: Catcher Angel Pena reported improvement Thursday
to the ligament strained to the outside of his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   After an evaluation Thursday of his MRI, Jobe said the Dodgers
will let Pena go through complete pregame workouts to see if the
ligament shows continued improvement.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, then Jobe said surgery will be required. Pena
said the thumb has been bothering him for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know within two weeks if he'll need surgery,'' Jobe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena was the organization's minor league player of the year
1998, but reporting the next season overweight and lacking a strong
work ethic, he quickly grew into disfavor. Many, however, still
consider him the Dodgers catcher of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Last season in 120 at-bats, he hit just .208.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my chance last year,'' Pena said. ``I didn't play 100
percent. For now, give me a chance again and I'll be there 110
percent every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault.'

SOX GET JOB DONE BEHIND PEDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It has come to this: Baseball, Red Sox-style,
Thursday night became an exercise in mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   Manning the point was the sniper, Pedro Martinez, chosen the
chief ``warrior'' by platoon leader Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him were the foot soldiers, led by the incendiary Carl
Everett (4 for 5, with a homer and three RBIs), keeper of the
mission statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be fearless and not care about our opponents,''
Everett said. ``Don't worry about offending them. That's the
attitude we have to take to the field: `I don't care what it takes
to win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And there was the enemy, the Indians, who got whacked by
Martinez, Everett, and the Red Sox, 7-4, as Boston moved within two
games of Cleveland in the American League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, before 42,709 at Jacobs Field, was Boston's third
in four crucial road games since the Sox were pasted by the Yankees
in a three-game sweep at Fenway last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The message? ``We are warriors,'' said Martinez, who allowed
three runs on only four hits and a walk over seven innings to
improve his record against Cleveland to 9-0. ``Nobody can take us
for granted. We are a team that fights back.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Sox flew out Thursday night for a four-game weekend
series in Detroit, while the Indians were bound for New York and
four games with the Yankees. The teams meet again next week for
five huge games in three days at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Williams likes what he is seeing. ``They're tough, they're
resilient,'' he said. ``They're battle-tested every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Martinez, Williams said, ``He's got the heart of a
lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez set the pace Thursday night, retiring the first 13
Cleveland batters before a crowd he said called him ``trash'' and
an array of profanities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another day at the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. It's not every game Martinez's bid for a
no-hitter is broken up so brutally. With one out in the fifth,
Martinez (17-5) issued a walk to Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Then away went the no-hitter and shutout in one fell swoop. The
count was 1 and 1 to David Segui, who crashed Martinez's next pitch
into the right-center-field bleachers for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Segui had only three hits, and 11 strikeouts, in 23
at-bats against Martinez. And the Indians had gone 32 1/3 innings
without an earned run against their top nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to throw a sinker away,'' Martinez said. ``But the
sinker backed up on me and he hit it out. That's what you're
suppposed to do when somebody makes a mistake on you.''
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to some clumsy Cleveland defense and timely two-out
hitting by his teammates, Martinez was more than mighty enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox seized their first opportunity, with an assist from the
Indians. With two outs in the first, Everett reached on an infield
grounder that shortstop Omar Vizquel might normally have played for
an out.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra promptly took advantage by blasting a pitch by
Cleveland starter Charles Nagy for a double off the wall in
left-center to score Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox exploited another mistake in the third. Nagy, who was
involved in a memorable beanball incident with Martinez on April
30, opened the inning by hitting Lou Merloni in the arm with his
first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon's sacrifice bunt moved Merloni to second. He took
third on Jose Offerman's ground out and scored when center fielder
Kenny Lofton let Everett's high fly fall at his feet for a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come in with your best against these guys,'' Nixon
said, ``or they're going to bury you.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sox did the burying after Segui's bomb had cut
their lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no panic,'' Everett said. ``I just felt the way we
were going they couldn't stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   They broke it open with two outs in the sixth. After Nixon's
two-out single off Nagy, Offerman singled off reliever Justin
Speier, moving Nixon to third. Speier then threw a wild pitch at
Everett's feet, allowing Nixon to score to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then Offerman, who took second on the wild pitch, scored when
Everett deposited Speier's 3-and-2 pitch in the upper deck in
right, a 441-foot bomb that expanded the lead to 6-2. The homer was
Everett's 34th.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra followed with his second double of the night,
prompting Indians manager Charlie Manuel to replace Speier with
Chris Nichting. And the next batter, Troy O'Leary, lined to left,
scoring Garciaparra with the seventh run.
</P>
<P>
   Though Martinez said he had some of his best stuff of the year,
the powerful Indians lineup seemed to wear him down. Cleveland
touched him for a third run in the seventh after Roberto Alomar and
Manny Ramirez led off with back-to-back singles. A batter later,
Segui looped a single to right to score Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't dominating this team,'' Martinez said. ``I could have
easily lost this game if we didn't score, but I had a whole team
right behind me and that paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the team dared not take him for granted. ``He's the MVP
of this club,'' said designated hitter Dante Bichette, whose
fourth-inning homer gave the Sox a 3-0 lead. ``He's so valuable, I
don't even know if you can measure it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rod Beck on in relief in the eighth, the Indians scored on
a single by Vizquel and double by Roberto Alomar. But closer Derek
Lowe got the last out in the eighth and finished for his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   As they packed up afterward, the Sox were wary of landmines
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency is to leave here on a high note and forget about
these four games in Detroit,'' Lowe said. ``Those are just as big
as the ones we just played.''
