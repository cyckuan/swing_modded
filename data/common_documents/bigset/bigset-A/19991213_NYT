Minnesota Vixens, 12-6. It was a momentous day, especially for the
Sharks, a squad that put on the pads only about three weeks ago.
The Vixens, members of the Women's Professional Football League,
have four games under their belts, and have been on the field since
the beginning of October on a barnstorming tour to gauge the
interest in and audience for what the league advertises as ``high
quality smash mouth tackle football.'' By Tina Kelley.

CHARGERS STUN SLUMPING SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seahawks took another step backward Sunday in
their quest to become a playoff team, and another stumble in the
opposite direction from trying to look like one.
</P>
<P>
   When Todd Peterson's 38-yard field goal attempt doinked off the
left upright and dropped into the end zone with 70 seconds to play
at the Kingdome, the Seahawks had lost their third consecutive
game, a 19-16 decision to the San Diego Chargers, to see their
once-seemingly insurmountable three-game lead in the AFC West
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Chiefs pulled into a share of the division lead
with the Seahawks last night by beating the Minnesota Vikings,
31-28.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the rematch between the Seahawks and Chiefs at the
Kingdome on Dec. 26 even bigger. The winner of that game probably
wins the division, if the Seahawks can find a way to rediscover
their winning ways next week in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thin line,'' coach Mike Holmgren said when asked the
difference between the Seahawks team that had won five consecutive
games and now has dropped three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very painful right now,'' he added. ``We can't seem to
catch a break we need to get us over the hump to win one of these
games. We have to roll up our sleeves. We have three games left.
... And it is hugely important.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to blame this loss on Peterson, who ran his
string of consecutive field goals to a club-record 15 by hitting
three in a row in the first half before missing three in a row in
the final 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were huge kicks,'' Peterson said of coming up short from
48 and 52 yards, then slapping what would have been a game-tying
kick off the upright. ``We needed to have those kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also needed other things on this day when their
performance before another sold-out crowd was as dreary as the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The defense too often was befuddled by the Chargers' no-huddle
offense, which created confusion and mismatches as Jim Harbaugh
completed 20 of 35 passes for 229 yards and was sacked only once.
</P>
<P>
   The offense again was more miss than hit, scoring just one
touchdown and blowing other opportunities as Jon Kitna misread the
Chargers coverage on a pass to Joey Galloway that was intercepted
at the San Diego 12-yard line and Galloway and Sean Dawkins could
not hold passes in the end zone after having their hands on them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the biggest problem with the Seahawks' slide from 8-2 and
a three-game division lead to being 8-5 and fit to be tied: It's
not one thing, it's everything. And in different weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss to Tampa Bay two weeks ago, Kitna turned the ball
over six times to waste the best effort of the season by the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss at Oakland last week, the defense was pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it was missed field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hope to make the playoffs at all this year, we want to
be on a roll when we go in,'' guard Brian Habib said. ``We were on
a roll there for five games and now we're struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   It begs the question: Does any team that gets swept by the
Chargers even deserve to go to the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps better yet: Can any team that has been swept by the
Chargers have enough confidence left to do what it will take to get
to the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been nowhere, we haven't done anything,''
cornerback Shawn Springs said, a reference to the Seahawks not
having had a winning season since 1990 to go with their
league-worst 10-year playoff drought. ``We don't know about success
or failure. We just play.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was there to be taken by the team that made plays at
the most opportune times. Again, the Chargers came out winners in
that matchup.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was John Carney, the Seahawks' perpetual pain in
the you-know-where. He kicked four field goals, including a
41-yarder that proved to be the game-winner with 3:19 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kind of games we have been playing lately, he's just
invaluable,'' Chargers rookie coach Mike Riley said of his veteran
kicker. ``He proved how valuable he was today.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Junior Seau, the Chargers' whirling dervish of a
linebacker. In addition to finishing with nine solo tackles, he got
a hand on two Kitna passes. A completion on either one could have
provided a different ending to this game.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays before Peterson's last kick, Seau blitzed and rejected
a Kitna pass with enough force that it landed several yards behind
the line of scrimmage. Kitna was going to Dawkins, who was open ing
across the middle inside the Chargers 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior made a great play that last drive,'' Kitna said. ``We
had a touchdown. Sean could have walked into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau also made another great play earlier in the quarter. Kitna
had running back Ricky Watters open over the middle on third-and-4.
The pass was there, as was the yardage needed for the first down.
But so was Seau, who reached in to flick the ball away. Peterson
then came up short on his 48-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were trying to go one-on-one with me with my
injury,'' said Seau, who missed the Chargers' last game with a
strained abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, meanwhile, handed the credit where credit was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, what a big play on pass defense,'' Riley said of
Seau tipping away the pass to Watters, although he could just as
easily have been talking about the rejection of Kitna's pass. ``We
see him on the run defense all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will be seeing Seau, too. In their nightmares.
Carney will be there. And Peterson. And those Kitna passes that
Galloway and Dawkins couldn't hold in the end zone. And that
no-huddle offense that stumped the Seahawks defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach was trying to dwell on the positive,'' linebacker Chad
Brown said when asked about Holmgren's demeanor after the game.
``Which is tough after dropping three games which you really feel
like you should have won.''

POOR TIME TO BE SAME OLD SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Swept by the Chargers?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, swept by the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold italic) Swept by the Chargers! (end bold italic)
</P>
<P>
   Neither English punctuation nor modern typography has sufficient
ordnance to convey the sporting embarrassment that was visited upon
the Seahawks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers were a broken, shamed outfit led by a
rookie coach who relied on plays never seen outside schoolyard
dirt. Losers of six of their last seven games, they went with a
no-huddle offense most of the game because, really, what was there
to discuss?
</P>
<P>
   These misfits beat the Seahawks 19-16 Sunday. They won in the
hostile Kingdome, in December, against a division leader. The day
was a Buster Douglas in cleats _ times two, no less, since in
October the Chargers won 13-10 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The only way it could have been worse for the locals was if Ryan
Leaf had thrown a touchdown pass, slapped Mike Holmgren and walked
out on his bar tab at the Metropolitan Grill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Seahawks must be credited with having a sense of the
times, since shame is the prevailing civic feeling this holiday
season in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat the AFC West leader was not part of anyone's plan,
except ours,'' said Junior Seau, the Chargers linebacker who was
his usual aggravation to the Seahawks. ``It shows we haven't given
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking reward for not quitting, especially when one is paid
millions, is some sad coin in the modern realm of pro sports. But
Seau is right: The Chargers, who brought nothing to the game except
the look of a cheap doormat, played as if the game meant something
to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, on the other hand, mysteriously failed to conjure
the wherewithal required for an NFL December game for a
playoff-bound franchise. It was team-wide: offense, defense,
special teams, coaching.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Seahawks' worst game _ that was probably the first
meeting with the Chargers, when they lost under circumstances not
unlike Sunday. But Sunday was the worst time this season for
bonehead moments, since they came after two straight losses and
against an eminently beatable 10-point underdog at home.
</P>
<P>
   This should have been as easy as December games get for
contenders. Which removes it from the realm of the recent
on-any-given-Sunday defeats to adequate opposition in Tampa Bay and
Oakland. This was a defeat that gives body to the ghosts that
Holmgren has been so desperate to exorcise the last couple of
weeks:
</P>
<P>
   The same old Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   This was a defeat from the Tom Flores/Dennis Erickson tradition.
Not a blowout, not a butchery, just an absence of well-planned,
well-executed plays at a few critical junctures.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way that team should beat us,'' wide receiver Mike
Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way they're better than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard knew the Chargers could be had.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a feel for a team's attitude before a game,'' he said.
``They were real loose, they had nothing to lose. If we could get
up on them quickly ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Chargers, with no-huddle hustle and
desperate-looking wide-receiver screens, took the opening drive 73
yards for a touchdown. Instantly, what figured to be a revival game
for the Seahawks became a survival game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Seahawks rallied to take a 16-13 lead into the
fourth quarter, they were never in command, never mustering the
authority that sparked their road wins in Kansas City and Green
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Todd Peterson's three missed field goals in the final
nine minutes were the obvious blunders, the Seahawks were so much
better and healthier than the Chargers that Peterson's sudden
whiffs shouldn't have been decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you guys are blaming the kicker, but I
wouldn't,'' Pritchard said. ``To make the playoffs, you shouldn't
be worried about just making a field goal to get to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't know by now what it takes to make the playoffs ...
well, that's the big question.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the first time in Holmgren's initial season, there
is legitimate doubt that he and his staff have managed to convey
the requirements for contention.
</P>
<P>
   Heady as was the 8-2 start, no one, including Holmgren, didn't
figure the Seahawks were in for two or three more losses. But
suddenly losing three in a row, including Sunday's desultory
affair, leaves three hard games while injuries make each week more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Seahawks look like the worst division leader
since the John Candy character in the movie ``Volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to spring a little realism when when we were 8-2
and feeling good about it,'' Holmgren said. ``But we're not there
yet. Now we're fighting for our (postseason) lives a little bit,
and learning a lot about each other and how we handle this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   What was learned was not pleasant for Seahawks fans. After
witnessing a Chargers sweep, they learned the bandwagon they jumped
on a few weeks ago still hasn't cleared its axles of some
decade-old mud.

UCLA'S RUSH IN NO HURRY TO GO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Suspended UCLA forward JaRon Rush is in good
spirits and has no plans to leave school unless forced to, his
grandmother said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's OK, and he wants to stay there,'' said Jeanette Jacobs,
who dined with Rush on Saturday night. ``He doesn't want to leave,
he doesn't want to transfer. He likes it there. He's staying until
it gets resolved, and (if Rush is declared ineligible), then we'll
deal with it. Otherwise, he's staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a sophomore from Kansas City, was suspended indefinitely
Friday for a possible violation of NCAA rules. UCLA athletic
director Peter Dalis said Rush's future at the school could be in
jeopardy, depending on the results of an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``JaRon doesn't know what's going to happen,'' Jacobs said.
``He's a good kid who does silly things. Hopefully, this will be a
learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two issues involved, according to sources: Rush's
relationship with his former AAU coach, Myron Piggie, and his
dealings with a Southern California sports agent with ties to
Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA, the Pacific-10 or the NCAA determine Rush received
improper benefits from Piggie or the agent, Rush could be suspended
and forced to make restitution _ or he could be declared
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Rush missed several practices last month to testify about Piggie
before a grand jury in Kansas City, according to a source close to
Rush.
</P>
<P>
   His future might depend on how the NCAA interprets his
relationship with Piggie _ whether they had a pre-existing
relationship or whether it was a direct result of Rush's status as
a high-profile athlete, which would render improper any benefits
Piggie gave to Rush.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is investigating Piggie on suspicion of income
tax evasion, fraud and money laundering, according to the Orange
County Register. Last week, an FBI representative informed Dalis
that Rush may have admitted to breaking NCAA rules during the
testimony, the paper reported.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
So eager was Dana Dimel, the Houston Cougars' new football coach,
to dig into his upcoming job that he checked into his downtown
hotel, then returned to his future office Sunday night to watch
film of his future players.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dimel, who arrived Sunday afternoon via a UH private plane, will
be introduced today at a 3 p.m. news conference at the
Athletics/Alumni Center on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw the ball around and do our best to score
points,'' Dimel said in a brief meeting outside his future office
Sunday night, accompanied by his wife, Julie. ``I've already
watched some film on Jason McKinley (the Cougars' returning senior
quarterback) and his receivers, and I can't wait to start working
with them. We'll put Jason in the shotgun with a controlled passing
game and try to balance it with a strong running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel, 37, who already had visited the UH facilities, expects to
bring four or five assistants with him from Wyoming, where the
Cowboys were 23-12 in his only three years as a head coach. In
1997, he became at age 34 the youngest head coach of a Division I-A
program when Wyoming hired him to succeed Joe Tiller after Tiller
went to Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   The financial terms of Dimel's contract were not immediately
disclosed. His base salary at Wyoming was $110,000 with a total
package of about $250,000 a year, with two years remaining.
Estimates of his multiyear deal with UH range from $550,000 to
$650,000 annually, possibly higher depending on bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   In its past, Wyoming has lost several notable coaches who went
on to higher-level programs, including Bob Devaney (to Nebraska),
Bill Lewis (East Carolina and Georgia Tech), Dennis Erickson
(Washington State and Miami), Fred Akers (Texas) and Pat Dye
(Auburn).
</P>
<P>
   Dimel is a former offensive lineman at Kansas State who served
as an assistant there for 10 years, including the time when head
coach Bill Snyder rebuilt the program. He said Sunday night he will
hire quarterbacks coach Phil Davis of Nevada to be the Cougars'
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ranked in the top three nationally in passing in each of
the last five years, and that's what we have in mind,'' Dimel said
of Nevada. ``We intend to play an exciting game to bring fans from
the city of Houston to our stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Matsakis, Wyoming's offensive coordinator, is joining the
staff of new Texas Tech coach Mike Leach. Wyoming assistant head
coach Sheahon Zenger may be considered as Dimel's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel, whose name was part of earlier speculation regarding
vacancies at Texas Tech and North Carolina State, noted Wyoming has
18 Texans on its roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can recruit Texas kids to Laramie, you should certainly
be able to recruit them to the University of Houston,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his first year in coaching as a Kansas State graduate
assistant in 1987, Dimel said, ``My first day of recruiting I spent
in Austin. I've recruited in San Antonio, Dallas-Fort Worth, Waco,
Killeen, all over the state. I think I have some pretty good ties
with Texas high school coaches, and they are going to be seeing a
lot of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in a state with a population of about 430,000, Dimel and
his Wyoming staff had to range far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my years of recruiting Texas, I had always aspired to be
the head coach of a school in this state,'' Dimel said in a
prepared statement. ``This has been a career goal of mine, and now
I have my chance. I know Houston is on the verge of being a great
football program once again, and there is no reason why we can't
keep great players in this state and city at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really fired up about this opportunity. I look forward to
bringing a high-powered and high-scoring offense to the fans of
Houston and in the process pack the stadium for our home games.
This is going to be a lot of fun for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming averaged 400 yards and nearly 30 points per game in
1999, finishing 7-4 and losing out on a share of the Mountain West
championship via a 39-7 loss to San Diego State in the final game.
Wyoming was 8-3 in 1998 and 8-5 in '97, when the Cowboys' defense
was second nationally in sacks, sixth in pass defense, 17th in
scoring defense and 23rd in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our community will truly enjoy the incredible
enthusiasm Dana brings to Houston,'' UH athletic director Chet
Gladchuk said in a prepared statement. ``As a proven Division I-A
coach who has enjoyed unquestioned success at Wyoming and did a
remarkable job assisting in the building of Kansas State's program,
I believe we can expect to win at Houston, both in the classroom
and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dana has a clear vision for the future of the program and an
intelligence for football that rivals some of the best coaches in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said UH chancellor/president Arthur K. Smith: ``Dana Dimel
brings extraordinary energy and an outstanding background of
football leadership and success to our program. He has exactly the
right blend of coaching skills, personal integrity and commitment
to the academic success of student-athletes that will carry Cougar
football to high national standing and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years as a graduate assistant at Kansas State, Dimel
was promoted to offensive line coach in 1989 when Snyder was hired
as head coach. Four years later, Dimel was put in charge of both
the running game and offensive line, then spent 1995 and '96 as
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   While with the Wildcats, Dimel coached 11 offensive linemen who
went on to the NFL. Ten of his Wyoming players signed NFL
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   While Snyder is known for holding a tight rein over media
contacts, player interviews and accessibility, Dimel sounds like
the exact opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most cooperative coach, media-wise, I have ever dealt
with,'' said Kevin McKinney, Wyoming's sports information director,
who has been through 11 coaching changes. ``He would talk with
anybody at any time. He was always the same, win or lose.''

COWBOYS' OFFENSE SHOWS SIGNS OF LIFE IN VICTORY OVER EAGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys made a statement Sunday for
the offensively challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-10 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles at Texas
Stadium, the Cowboys threw the ball downfield _ six pass plays of
16 or more yards _ and scored two offensive touchdowns in a game
for the first time in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys managed to accomplish all this with Troy Aikman
playing while he had the flu and Emmitt Smith being sidelined after
the first play because of a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory, a relatively reserved Cowboys locker room
showed no signs of back-slapping, chest-thumping or wild
predictions. The players obviously see the bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   They probably have to win their division to make the playoffs,
and they don't control their destiny at this point. And they have
to do it without defensive end Greg Ellis, the team's sack leader,
who was lost for the season with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   With three games remaining, the 7-6 Cowboys trail NFC East
Division-leading Washington (8-5) by one game and are tied with the
New York Giants. All three teams won Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Sunday's game mean to the Cowboys? Pretty much the
same to anyone who was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo: ``It means we've got a chance,
and that's all it means. It keeps us in the hunt. It's just one
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey: ``We're on a mission. I think our guys
understand exactly where we are and what our mission is ... we're
glad to win, but we have more ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Erik Williams: ``We're 1-0 so far in the
stretch drive. We need to win three more games ... and that's not
necessarily going to be easy since we haven't put together a
four-game winning streak since (November 1998).''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who finished with his most passing yardage (242) since
the 38-20 victory against Washington on Oct. 24, was still wearing
his football pants and a T-shirt when he turned his attention to
the New York Jets, the Cowboys' opponent next Sunday at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've got to focus on beating the Jets,'' Aikman
said. ``We haven't put back-to-back victories together since the
third week of the season when we started out 3-0. The Jets ...
that's where my focus is.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys didn't put on a laser show Sunday, they did
take a lively step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eagles are very aggressive, and so you have to try to
(counter) that somehow,'' Aikman said. ``We hoped to be able to
take some shots downfield. We watched film and saw that the teams
that moved the ball against Philadelphia were able to make some big
plays in the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' six longest receptions went to Rocket Ismail (26
and 17 yards), tight end David LaFleur (25 yards), running back
Chris Warren (24 yards _ mostly on the run after the catch), wide
receiver Jason Tucker (19 yards) and tight end Eric Bjornson (16
yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in these guys,'' Aikman said of his
ever-changing cast of receivers. ``It's just a matter of getting
some playing time with them, and that's been hard to come by. We're
playing with a lot of different guys. We're just trying to go with
the guys who are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we never seem to know, from one week to the next _
literally, from one series to the next _ who that's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On defensive, the Cowboys kept rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb
corralled and eventually knocked him out of the game late in the
third quarter with a knee sprain.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys failed to score first for only the second time this
season. Also for the second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   After Cowboys newcomer Eddie Murray, who was 2-for-4 Sunday in
field-goal tries, missed a 49-yarder on the Cowboys' first
possession, the Eagles capitalized on the good field position to
drive 34 yards in nine plays before settling for a 44-yard Norm
Johnson field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who had scored only four offensive touchdowns in
their previous 18 quarters, responded by driving 60 yards in eight
plays, with Chris Warren scoring on a 4-yard burst behind Flozell
Adams and Solomon Page on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Passes of 25 and 10 yards to LaFleur and fullback Robert Thomas,
respectively, set up the touchdown run by Warren, who was playing
with a bruised right leg. He finished with 92 yards on 25 carries,
both season highs.
</P>
<P>
   Passes of 26 and 16 yards to Ismail and Bjornson, respectively,
led to the Cowboys' second touchdown drive capped by an 8-yard pass
from Aikman to LaFleur that made the score 20-3 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys squandered a late first-quarter Darren Hambrick
interception of a McNabb pass and could get only three points after
being set up on a 24-yard Sean Landeta punt in the second quarter.
They added nine penalties for 55 yards to their NFL-leading totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some costly penalties again that we have to
eliminate,'' Gailey said. ``And we still have to pass the ball more
consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be defined as a start.

A CENTURY OF CHANGE IS SHOWN BY THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th graf to define typical as statistically average) (ms) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1900, the typical American was a boy, not yet a teenager,
named John. He lived with his parents and his sisters, Mary and
Helen, on a farm in New York or Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century closes, the typical American is a young
woman, between 25 and 34, named Lisa. She lives in a California
suburb with her daughter, Emily, (these days, odds are no better
than 50-50 that mother and father live together with the children).
She is thinking of having another child, who will be called
Samantha or Michael.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits are drawn by the Statistical Abstract, which is
being released Monday. The annual compendium from the U.S. Census
Bureau is a motion picture, emphasizing America's changing face
over the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Available in a book, on CD-ROM and on the Internet, its 1,447
tables of statistics should be enough to help schoolchildren with
their end-of-the-century homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   John, the statistically average American of 1900, did not have
the Web, of course. With an annual income of about $3,000 a year in
today's dollars, his family also had no indoor plumbing, no phone,
and no car. He probably would not finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and little Emily end 1999 with a household income of
$45,000, enough for two cars and cable TV. Lisa has been to
college, of course.
</P>
<P>
   John's newest neighbors were from Austria-Hungary and Italy.
Lisa's children attend school with classmates from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   John could expect to live to age 46, if he escaped measles and
diphtheria. He might die of tuberculosis or the flu. Lisa can
expect to live into her 70s. She and her children are inoculated
against most preventable diseases, except AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes highlighted in the Statistical Abstract have
moved steadily through the century.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's population has nearly quadrupled (from 76 million
to an estimated 274 million today). More than 10 times as many
Americans are 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   That population has moved from rural areas (60 percent) to urban
areas (75 percent). The nation that was 88 percent white is now
about 62 percent so and rapidly changing. Two cities that were in
the top 10 in population in 1900 are barely in the top 50: St.
Louis (was 4th, now 47th) and Buffalo (8th, now 54th).
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy increased for men (up to 74 years from 46), but
even more for women (up to 79 from 48). The average household size
fell from 4.8 people to 2.6. The number of bachelor's degrees rose
from 29,000 in 1900 to a projected 1.2 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of foreign-born residents has increased
(growing to 25.8 million in 1997 from 10.3 million in 1900), a
higher percentage of the country is born in the United States (90
percent vs. 85 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, the 20th century has to be the most dynamic in our
history, and these statistics paint a picture of rapid and massive
change,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Statistical Abstract is on the Web at
http://www.census.gov/prod/www/statistical-abstract-us.html. It is
available from the National Technical Information Service ($34
softbound, $41 hardbound) by calling toll free, (800) 553-6847.
</P>
<P>
   The long view of the census bureau allows some changes that are
taken for granted to be studied in more detail. Everyone knows, for
example, that people get married older than they had.
</P>
<P>
   The median age of first marriage is now about 25 years for
women; back in 1900, it was only 22 years. For men, the change has
been less: 26 in 1900, nearly 27 now.
</P>
<P>
   But the change did not occur in a straight line. The age of
first marriage went down from 1900 until about 1956, when it
bottomed out at 22.5 for men and 20.1 for women. It has leveled off
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners of the century may have been buy-and-hold
investors. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite stock index has
risen from 6.2 in 1900 to 1,417.04 today.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers were Florence and Bertha. Among the most
popular names given to girls in the year 1900, they no longer make
the top 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 names in 1900, according to the Social Security
Administration, were the following: 1. John; 2. William; 3. James;
4. George; 5. Charles; 6. Joseph; 7. Frank; 8. Henry; 9. Robert;
10. Harry. Girls: 1. Mary; 2. Helen; 3. Anna; 4. Margaret; 5. Ruth;
6. Elizabeth; 7. Marie; 8. Rose; 9. Florence and 10. Bertha.
</P>
<P>
   Meet your high school graduating class of 2017, based on Social
Security applications in the first eight months of 1999:
</P>
<P>
   Boys: Michael, Jacob, Matthew, Christopher, Joshua, Austin,
Nicholas, Tyler and Joseph. Girls: Emily, Samantha, Madison,
Ashley, Sarah, Hannah, Jessica, Alyssa, Alexis and Kayla.

PATRIOTS RUN OUT OF GAS AT INDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It was, for all intents and purposes, the last
lap at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' possibilities of making the playoffs became
minuscule Sunday following a 20-15 loss to the Colts in which they
held the high-powered Indianapolis offense to two touchdowns and
two field goals but struggled on offense in the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stunned Patriots said the ``right things'' after the
game, others told it like it really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the highest payrolls in the NFL,'' said New
England quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who completed 31 of 44 passes for
379 yards, with one touchdown and one interception. ``To need help
from other teams to get into the playoffs is unacceptable. I want
to apologize to Mr. Kraft because it's unacceptable. We're all
accountable for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7-6 Patriots could win out and not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last drive I really thought we were going to pull it
out,'' said tight end Ben Coates. ``We had enough time. We were
moving the ball. But we just couldn't get it done. That was the
case all day. On chances we had to score touchdowns, we scored
field goals. Our defense did a great job keeping us in it. It's
very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration? Offensive lineman Bruce Armstrong oozed it. He had
to come out of the game in the fourth quarter when he twisted his
left knee. He watched the Patriots march down the field near the
end of the game, but on fourth and 13 from the Indianapolis 31,
Bledsoe couldn't connect with Shawn Jefferson for the first down.
The game was over and the very loud RCA Dome crowd exploded as the
Patriots departed for the locker room in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, when we need to make a play, we're not doing it,''
said Armstrong. ``We're practicing well, but once we get into the
game situation we're not scoring points. You like to think we can
get better, but right now we're stagnant. That's the worst part.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, that will be blamed on coach Pete Carroll. Carroll
said he and the players ``felt sick'' after this one because they
could have won it. The Patriots outgained the Colts, 401 yards to
287. Bledsoe had 379 yards in the air to Peyton Manning's 186. But
the Patriots were a woeful 3 for 13 (23 percent) on third-down
opportunities to the Colts' 3 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   The defense kept the team in it despite cornerback Ty Law
playing with a broken hand, cornerback Steve Israel leaving early
with a sprained left ankle, and safety Chris Carter leaving in the
third quarter with a hamstring pull. On offense, running back Kevin
Faulk suffered a low ankle fracture on his right leg similar to the
one Terry Glenn had a year ago and will be lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood in this locker room is that of a team that hasn't
quit,'' said defensive tackle Chad Eaton. ``No way will we quit on
this season. We were all over them all day. We just didn't make the
plays when we had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Embattled offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese certainly tried.
He again came up with different looks, using the backs as dumpoff
receivers for Bledsoe, who still was sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots shot themselves in the foot with 12 penalties for
85 yards. Twice Willie McGinest jumped offsides. On a key
third-quarter drive, on a fourth and goal from the 3, right tackle
Zefross Moss was called for a false start just before Bledsoe hit
Lamont Warren for a 3-yard TD that would have made it 20-13.
Instead Adam Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field to make it 20-9. An
earlier false start had pushed the Patriots from the Colts 3 to the
8.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were moving again early in the fourth quarter as
Bledsoe nailed Glenn (nine catches, 148 yards) with a 35-yard
completion to the Colts 25. But Bledsoe was sacked by Chad Bratzke
for an 8-yard loss, then threw an interception to Tyrone Poole, who
had a monster game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Patriots weren't done. They marched 57 yards on six
plays, capping the drive with a 10-yard pass from Bledsoe to
Jefferson with 3:07 remaining in the third, making it 20-15. The
2-point attempt failed as Bledsoe threw it away.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots got a break with 2:10 remaining when the Colts were
running down the clock as Manning fumbled the snap. Lawyer Milloy
emerged from the pile with the ball at the Patriots 33. Two catches
by Troy Brown, one a beauty on which he leaped to snare the ball
between two defenders for a 28-yard gain to the Colts 27, gave the
Patriots a first down with 1:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   But from there the Colts tightened, forcing Bledsoe to run for 5
yards, then sacking him when Mike Peterson came untouched up the
middle. That forced the fourth and 13, and Bledsoe's overthrow to
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts took a 7-0 lead on their first possession when Marvin
Harrison broke away from Law for a 52-yard gain to the Colts 20. An
offside penalty on McGinest hurt, and Manning eventually found
tight end Marcus Pollard, who lunged over the goal line on a 5-yard
pass with linebacker Ted Johnson tugging on his legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots countered when Vinatieri nailed a 34-yard field
goal. His 28-yarder with 5:39 left in the second made it 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the half, the Colts connected on two long passes to
Harrison, for 22 and 27 yards. That culminated in a TD on a 2-yard
shovel pass from Manning to Edgerrin James. Two third-quarter field
goals made it 20-6, Colts. But there was time.
</P>
<P>
   In another time, the Patriots would have overtaken their foe on
that final lap at Indy. But not this time.

AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE REPLACES THE GAILEY GRIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey promised
changes on offense.
</P>
<P>
   And he delivered in Sunday's 20-10 victory against the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders' contributions at wide receiver had an
impact on what seemed to be a breakout performance by the Cowboys'
offense, which reached the end zone only twice in the previous
three games but accounted for two touchdowns Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference for the Cowboys was in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the conservative, ``let's let the defense win it
for us'' group of recent weeks. Gailey's offense was bold and
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman, who completed 22 of 40 passes for 242
yards, took shots down the field and not to the flat. He threw the
ball past the first-down marker and not underneath. Aikman's passes
resulted in drive-extending first downs 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aikman and Gailey said the difference had a lot to do with
the Eagles' blitzing style of play. Teams have had success going
downfield against them all season. The Cowboys were no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were loading up to stop the run and blitzing secondary
people,'' Gailey said. ``That leaves the corners out there, and we
were able to get the ball down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' new-found aggression was evident three plays into
the game, when Aikman aired one down the middle to Jason Tucker,
who had a step on Eagles cornerback Troy Vincent. The pass was
incomplete, but Vincent was called for pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   The play also demonstrated that Aikman was not going to be shy
about throwing to receivers other than Raghib Ismail, which was
imperative, considering injuries have continued to deplete the
receiver corps. Rookie Wane McGarity joined Michael Irvin and James
McKnight on the injured reserve list Thursday. And veteran Ernie
Mills missed his second consecutive game because of a strained
quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Sanders' move to offense. It put first-year free
agent Tucker in the starting lineup for the first time. Chris
Brazzell, another first-year receiver who was signed from the
practice squad last week, played in a game for the first time. And
backup tight end Eric Bjornson saw time as a backup receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That the Eagles decided to double Ismail and Sanders as much as
they could made it even more crucial that Aikman spread it around.
Tucker and company rewarded Aikman's confidence by making plays.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail led the way with four receptions for 52 yards, but Aikman
completed passes to eight players. Tight end David LaFleur and
running back Chris Warren each caught four passes. Tucker caught
three. Bjornson, Sanders and fullback Robert Thomas caught two. And
Brazzell caught one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough because we've been relying on guys we haven't spent
a lot of time playing with,'' Aikman said. ``That's been the
biggest challenge for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Aikman, who came into the game battling the flu, was
up for the challenge against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a different group is on the field every week,''
Gailey said. ``He's done a good job adjusting to who is on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy Aikman and Gailey want to see on the field more with the
regular offense is Sanders. He was in on 11 offensive snaps to go
along with the 72 snaps he played on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said that because the Eagles rolled coverages toward
Sanders, it opened up things in the running game and opened up the
middle for LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he would like to expand what the Cowboys did with
Sanders, especially when he's on the field with Ismail.

CAUTION FLAGS WERE IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ One loud expletive boomed out of the corner of
the loser's locker room Sunday and then all was silent. Frankly,
there was nothing else to say.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but what has been said before about these New England
Patriots. Nothing but they aren't as good as they think they are
and they aren't as good as their fans hoped they'd be and tey
aren't anything special anymore in enough places to win against the
top teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but to point out once again that they aren't going
anywhere this year and if something big doesn't change they w't be
going anywhere but home for a while because their time is growing
short and their window of opportunity to do big things as a team is
closing fast.
</P>
<P>
   It closed a bit more Sunday after a 20-15 loss to the
Indianapolis Colts dropped their record to 7-6 and brought them one
step closer to elimination from playoff contention even though the
Buffalo Bills helped their cause by losing themselves. That is what
it has come to these days for the Patriots: The only chance they
have left is a mathematician's.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be on a day when they held the powerful Colts
offense to two touchdowns and two field goals and outgained them by
more than 100 yards?
</P>
<P>
   How can they score only one touchdown when they average 5.8
yards a play and quarterback Drew Bledsoe goes 31 for 44 for 379
yards and is incredibly enough the team's No. 2 rusher as well,
averaging 4.5 yards on four scrambles?
</P>
<P>
   How can that be when they are paid tons of money at so many
positions by an owner who has paid the price and then some, and has
had to look out on the field and too often see his players
scrambling around at the last instant like ants in a maze before
the ball is snapped as if they have no clue what is expected of
them?
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Patriots made enough stupid mistakes to beat
themselves twice. They committed a dozen penalties, including one
in the third quarter that took 7 points off the board when a
touchdown pass to Lamont Warren was called back because Zefross
Moss couldn't keep himself from flinching on the snap count. When
you are having the trouble New England is scoring, you can't afford
to take points down once they've beenput up because chances are
they won't return . . . which they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   You have a first down at the Colt 27 with 88 seconds to play in
a 5-point game. You would seem to be in good shape until your
receivers all wander downfield aimlessly on first down and none get
close to open. In a situation where there is no room for waste, you
waste a play.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, on third and 5 at the 22, you are outguessed by
the Colts' defense and do not have enough blockers in to keep out
the extra blitzer and Bledsoe is nailed for an 8-yard loss. You
wasted a second play.
</P>
<P>
   Two wasted plays out of three and then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's fourth down and forever,'' Bledsoe said. He didn't
have to point out that forever never came.
</P>
<P>
   No one should blame Ernie Zampese for this. New England's
offensive coordinator called a sharp game that got Terry Glenn free
numerous times for big gains and kept the ball moving all
afternoon. Zampese called plays that produced gains of 52, 35, 28,
and 21 yards. He called plays that produced 401 yards of total
offense. He called plays that put his team in first-down situations
on the Colt 3, 8, 10, 11, and 17. Out of those opportunities the
Patriots scored one touchdown, so stop blaming the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme is moving the ball. It's the players who are moving
the ball backward by their consistent inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've wasted so many opportunities all season,'' tired and
hurting left tackle Bruce Armstrong said. ``Eventually you run out
of opportunities. You can only go to the well so many times. We all
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   This group has been going to the well since the second year Bill
Parcells was here and the well is running dry. It has been four
years now since their Super Bowl run of 1996 nd each year they have
produced just a little less than the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   One point from the AFC Championship Game in 1997. One game and
out of the playoffs in 1998. Probably one game short of making the
playoffs in 1999. Down, down, down. Slowly but steadily. The same
way they lost the game Sunday. Slowly but steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the defense is tiring of the offense's
ineptitude at theonly thing that counts _ scoring points. Sunday
that defense righted itself after some early problems and held the
Colts down, allowing only two field goals in the second half while
recovering a critical fumble two plays after the Patriots finally
scored a touchdown with 2:11 to play to cut the lead to 5.
</P>
<P>
   That recovery by Lawyer Milloy of Peyton Manning's mishandled
snap might have been a turning point in other years. It was the
kind of opportunity Bledsoe craved, and he got it, but he got no
more points because his teammates didn't get open when he needed
them to and got him sacked when he needed them not to.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean Bledsoe is blameless in the dissolution of
the team's offense. At times he has been way off rhythm. But that
was not the case Sunday. Sunday it was others who exhibited the
rhythm of Don Knotts at a disco and the result was predictable.
Just enough mistakes to get beat.
</P>
<P>
   When you do that often enough, as this collection of players has
all season against good teams, it is no longer an accident.
</P>
<P>
   It's who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is give them as many chances as possible,''
Milloy would say carefully after he had seen his team's offense
come up short once again. ``We did that. nthe end, we had a chance
to win the game. That's all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's all these Patriots seem able to do, too.

RED SOX MAKE PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-OS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Red Sox made a major push Sunday at the
winter meetings to acquire a middle-of-the-lineup hitter in a
proposed trade with Houston for switch-hitting center fielder arl
Evertt. According to sources, the deal was contingent on Boston
general manager Dan Duquette agreeing with Everett's agent on a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were prepared to accept the Red Sox' offer of
shortstop prospect Adam Everett (no relation) and a pitching
prospect from the lower minors in exchange for Everett, who had the
best season of his career last season, when he batted .325 with 25
home runs and 108 RBIs in 123 games.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was paid $2.4 million last season, is in position
to double that amount in arbitration this winter, but more
important to the Sox is the fact that he is eligible for free
agency after the 2000 season. Duquette, according to sources, has
had conversations with Everett's agent, Larry Reynolds. Also, any
long-term financial commitment would undoubtedly require CEO John
Harrington to sign off on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   There also was some question whether Harrington might be
reluctant to OK a deal because of a situation involving Everett
when he was with the Mets in 1997. In August of that year,
Everett's two children were taken into custody by New York City
officials after a Shea Stadium child-care worker noticed bruises on
his 6-year-old daughter, Shawna. Charges of child abuse
subsequently were dropped by a Family Court judge, who ruled tha
Everett's wife, Linda, inflicted ``excessive corporal punishment''
on their children and the player did little to op her.
</P>
<P>
   In a later court ruling, the couple, who underwent counseling,
regained custody of their son but lost custody of their daughter.
The Mets traded Everett after the '97 season to Houston for
reliever John Hudek, and in his two seasons with the Astros, he has
been regarded as a model citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who has a strong arm, also can play right field. He had
10 assists from center field last season; Sox center fielder Darren
Lewis had one. Picking up Everett would seem to leave the Sox in a
position of needing to move an outfielder. Lewis has $5.1 million
remaining on a contract that carries him through the 2001 season
and has given the Sox Gold Glove-caliber defense. Rookie Trot Nixon
platooned last season in right, and the Sox after the season picked
up Jermaine Allensworth, who was expected to compete with Michael
Coleman to be Damon Buford's replacement in a platoon with Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In a media briefing late Sunday, Duquette made no reference to
his talks with Houston. Meanwhile, Astros officials, who had met
with Duquette early Sunday morning, were waiting to hear back from
the Sox GM n Everett. Houston has a surplus of outfielders. Moises
Alou has a no-trade clause, Richard Hidalgo is their star of the
future, and teams have little interest in Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Having just signed Craig Biggio to a long-term extension and
facing free agency with slugger Jeff Bagwell, the Astros need to
move some salary. If the Sox did not move on the deal, Houston was
prepared to talk with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duquee insisted the Sox' priority remained adding
pitching. As of early Sunday &UR;  &LR; night Boston had not made an offer
for lefthanded free agent Chuck Finley, who had received three-year
proposals from three teams, the Mariners, Indians, and Orioles. All
of those offers were believed to be in the $22 million to $23
million range. Finley's agent, Tim Shannon, said that no team had
yet met the salary the 37-year-old would like.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was vague about whether the Sox would make a proposal,
saying the team is also looking at other free agent possibilities
as well as trades. Talks with San Diego about lefthander Sterling
Hitchcock did not seem to be progressing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had talked to the Dodgers about righthander Ismael
Valdes, who Sunday was traded along with second baseman Eric Young
to the Cubs for reliever Terry Adams in what Dodgers GM Kevin
Malone acknowledged was a salary dump. Duquette said the Dodgers
had had interest in Boston talent, but the Cubs' willingness to
take both Valdes and Young, who had played for new Cubs manager Don
Baylor in Colorado, was a dealmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets Saturday night signed Todd Zeile, who's topped 90 RBIs
in each of the last four seasons, as a replacement at first base
for John Olerud, even though Zeile has played just 76 games at
first in his major league career.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, word of a proposed four-team trade, a
throwback to the days when deals were much less money-driven than
they are now, circulated. Montreal would trade catcher Chris Widger
to the Brewers. Milwaukee would deal third baseman Jeff Cirillo to
the Rockies. Colorado would ship third baseman Vinny Castilla t the
Devil Rays, and Tampa Bay would send pitcher Rolando Arrojo to the
Expos.

JOHNSON, KNICKS FINISH CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is how life without Paul Pierce begins: With a
very nice first nine minutes, with a very nice final nine minutes,
with embarrassing stretches of baffling ineptitude in between and,
finaly, with Antoine Walker losing control of the basketball and
never even getting off a shot that could conceivably have won the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best player is out,'' said Walker, whose classically
Walkeresque performance included a team-high 24 points on 7-for-21
shooting. ``We've got to continue to fight and squeak out a few of
these games.''
</P>
<P>
   Said squeaking will have to take place some other night during
wha promises to be an educational week for Rick Pitino's boys
(three more road games and a Wednesday night home date with Utah).
Sunday night, the Knicks did the squeaking, pulling this baby out,
99-97.
</P>
<P>
   At times this looked like a winnable game, and at other times
this looked like just Another Bad Night On The Road. The Celtics,
as is their maddening wont, submitted both highlight reel material
and dreary stretches of non-basketball in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that with 8:07 remaining, no one would have
thought this would become a last-possession kind of game. But in
the NBA, such things as 82-67 leads with that much time left, or
96-89 leads with 58.1 seconds left, or even 99-95 leads with 5.7
seconds left might not amount to much. All it takes is a gimme
basket by Kenny Anderson, two missed free throws by the usually
reliable Allan Houston, and suddenly the Knicks are sweating out a
shaky 2-point victory over a team they now have beaten 14
consecutive times in their building.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino might consider carrying around a cassette that contains
his postgame explanation after every losing effort. Until he does,
he must find ways of re-phrasing the same thoughts. ``In every game
we lose t s a letdown in ball movement and player movement,'' he
lamented, not for the first time. There was, as usual, talk of the
need for ball reversal.
</P>
<P>
   This was a bizarre game for the Celtics, who scored 62 of their
97 points in the first and fourth periods, and who almost were
blown out onto Eighth Avenue by a first-half 36-10 New York run
(with five second-quarter Boston turnovers leading to 11 New York
fast-break points) after they had gone up by 9 (24-15) with 2:15
remaining in the first period. And then there was the aggravating
third period, in which the Knicks, who entered it leading by 12
(55-43), scored just 2 points in one stretch of 5:35, and who
nevertheless emerged leading by 12 at 73-61.
</P>
<P>
   But this bunch does play hard, and if you do that, good things
sometimes happen. A little run of 12-4, capped by an Anderson
turnover-induced fast-break layup, got it down to 7 at 86-79
(5:22). And with the Knicks cracking under some pressure (two
traveling violations and _ get this _ a palming violation on
Houston), the Celtics whittled it to 4 (89-85 at 3:16), and,
eventually, 3 (90-87 with 2:14 to go).
</P>
<P>
   This should be where smart, veteran teams do smart, veteran
things. Sure enough, the Knicks posted up Larry Johnson (23) on
Adrian Griffin. LJ powered his way to a 3-point play (93-87). A
minute or so later, he did it again, this time scoring on a running
lefty hook (96-89).
</P>
<P>
   At 99-95, and 5.7 seconds left, the Knicks should have been
safe. But Anderson was allowed to score in advance of the
predictable foul on the inbounds pass. Houston stepped up with 2.1
seconds left and boinged 'em both, giving the Celtics a last chance
with 1.8 remaining on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin inbounded the ball from mdcourt with, according to
Pitino, five options. None were available, but he did get it to
Walker, out near the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to take an extra dribble to get a shot off
without them hanging on me, and I lost the ball,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't where the game was lost, of course. It had been lost
long before, back when the Celtics were forcing useless one-on-one
situations rather than passing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to get it,'' Pitino insisted. ``They're trying.
This is a fun team to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, you read it right. Walker really did admit that Pierce
was the best player on the team. That might have been the most
heartening development of the evening.

YOUNG AMERICA KNOCKS SELF OUT OF CUP SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For whatever sports analogies are worth, it might be said that
this weekend was as dismal for the Young America sailing team of
the New York Yacht Club as it was for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Each team saw its hopes for playoff competition fade to black in
an afternoon that capped a season of sputtering performances. For
the Patriots, the executioner was the Colts, although the seeds of
destruction have been in their own hands all season.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Young America, which was mathematically eliminated
from the semifinals Sunsday when Dawn Riley opted not to sail
America True against France's LeDefi BTT, thus handing the French
the 9 points they needed to sew up sixth place in semifinals that
begin in early January.
</P>
<P>
   And the analogy goes deeper. Both the Patriots and Young America
started the season as highly touted, top-rated teams. Both were
expected to go deep into the elimination rounds and possibly end up
in the ultimate showdown _ Super Bowl for the Patriots, and the
America's Cup finals for Young America.
</P>
<P>
   Each team began the season with good records _ 6-2 for the
Patriots, 8-2 for Young America _ before taking dazzling and
inexplicable noedives in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   The many critics of Riley's America True and perhaps even Paul
Cayard's AmericaOne (which was also accused of throwing a race to
the French Saturday) will argue that the end was unsportsmanlike,
that the two US rivals from San Francisco should have played out
the series and given Young America its fair shot at making the
semis.
</P>
<P>
   But again, like the Patriots, Young America blew so many
opportunities to save itself that in the end it's hard to see them
as victims. Merely, and very surprisingly, as losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking a lot about it,'' said Young America
president John Marshall by phone from Auckland Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, ``and
the obvious question to me is how could a team with so much
potential fall so short? It's hard to find a single factor. But the
program as a whole undererformed and we couldn't put the brakes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look at races lost, they were lost for a variety of
reasons _ some trivial mechanical breakdowns, several attributable
to the massive failure of US 53 (the first boat that broke up),
some due to simply being on the wrong side of windshifts, and at
least one race lost through a serious tactical mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one single answer, Marshall goes back to a decision
to start construction of the two boats about three months later
than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope was we could turn that time into significant
differences in boat speed,'' said Marshall. ``But the price we paid
was the opportunity to sail in Newport in 1999 (with the new
boats). We might have had two or three months of sailing if we had
not made that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall believes the Young America program suffered fm not
having enough sailing time. ``We never gave the sailing team enough
time on the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to predict the first-leg windshifts _ a critical
moment in most races _ never developed well enough in his
afterguard, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the things you need to do to race well began to fall
apart as we dealt with more and more days lost to sailing because
of weather or because of breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we just weren't sailing well enough or
fast enough to make the cut. That's my best perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cataclysmic moment in Young America's campaign
came just over a month ago when the first hull, US 53, cracked in
half and nearly sank. Moving quickly into their newer boat, hull
58, skipper Ed Baird and his team never quite got their sailing
smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early in round-robin 3, leading Italy's Prada late in the
race, Baird made a major tactical error of not covering a trailing
boat, and let Prada through for the win. Had it been a victory, the
series might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   After that, a combination of shifty winds and choosing the wrong
side of windshifts doomed the campaign, which is headquartered in
Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   As Young America emerged as one of the preseason favorites, much
talk centered around the possibility of the America's Cup returning
to the waters of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Young America is hauntingly similar to the New
York Yacht Club's last campaign to get the Cup back from the
Australians in 1987. With a well-heeled team in Fremantle, two
hulls, and a seemingly top sailing team under skipper Jo Kolius,
the effort failed to make the four-boat semifinals. Their nemesis
13 years ago: France's Frnch Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the last-ditch desperation measurfor Young America on
Saturday was to deliver a palate-load of Sam Adams beer by forklift
to Riley's America True compound. ``That diplomacy,'' said Marshall
with a chuckle, ``did not seem to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley's explanation for not racing the French Sunday is that
with just one boat, America True did not want to risk it in a
nonessential race, especially one held in rough weather.
</P>
<P>
   So the top six boats entering the semifinals are Prada, America
True (Cayard), AmericaOne (Riley), Nippon, Stars &AMP; Stripes (Dennis
Conner), and Le Defi Francais.

 By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
YOU pause to admire the speed and dispatch of Chet Gladchuk, the
University of Houston athletic director, who has just hired his
second head football coach in four days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Marshall's Bob Pruett handed the Cougars a lemon, giving
back on Friday a job he had accepted Thursday, Chet went to Wyoming
for his lemonade. He hired Dana Dimel to replace the reluctant
Pruett, the original first choice to succeed Kim Helton, who was
cashiered 21 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars announced their new man Sunday and will present him
to a curious public today at 3 p.m. In moving briskly through a
process fraught with risk, the Cougars seemed to take their motto
from the submarine service: Run silent, run deep. In doing so, they
kept to a minimum any stigma from being jilted by Pruett.
</P>
<P>
   For a fellow who did not have a losing season in his three years
at Wyoming, Dimel is something of a blank page. His name never
surfaced as a candidate at Houston, although clearly he was near
the top of Gladchuk's list. He had been mentioned in connection
with the vacancies at Texas Tech and North Carolina State but
didn't interview for either position.
</P>
<P>
   So quickly did recent events unwind and reopen that Dimel was on
the road recruiting for Wyoming until a day or so before he
committed to the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, blond and burly, he spent 10 seasons as an assistant
coach at Kansas State, his alma mater, the last two as Bill
Snyder's offensive coordinator. The Wildcats finished with records
of 10-2 in 1995 and 9-3 in '96, and Dimel began to attract notice
outside the Big 12. Wyoming came calling, and he rewarded the
Cowboys with 23 wins against 12 losses, sending 10 of his players
to the NFL from his first two squads.
</P>
<P>
   He was Wyoming's 28th head coach, reflecting the school's status
as a steppingstone for those with higher ambitions, including Bob
Devaney, Dennis Erickson, Fred Akers and Joe Tiller.
</P>
<P>
   In your everyday study of the coaching science, you realize the
Cougars still lack the experience in this area of Wyoming, LSU or
Notre Dame. Dimel will be introduced Monday as the school's ninth
and youngest head coach, counting only those who actually signed a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But he brings to the task an interesting personal history. He
was an offensive lineman who won awards as a weightlifter,
suggesting he isn't someone the players can push around. He and his
wife, Julie, have a 4-year-old son, Winston, who was born on
Dimel's birthday, Oct. 9. This may indicate nice timing, a sense of
order or a harmless coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of time in the weeks and months to come to
probe the personality of Dana Dimel. If he doesn't have one,
Cougars fans can overlook it if he continues to enhance his
reputation as a winner. He certainly hasn't known much adversity in
his coaching career, although the Houston job has in the past
filled any shortages in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The line began with hometown products Jewell Wallace and Clyde
Lee, men of quiet dignity who got the program off the ground. Bill
Meek and Hal Lahar were the first two coaches hired away from other
schools; Lahar had played under Bud Wilkinson at Oklahoma and made
his ``name'' at Colgate. Bill Yeoman had a 25-year run that saw the
Cougars achieve national recognition, and he brought with him a
load of enthusiasm and invention.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pardee, who had been an All-America fullback under Bear
Bryant at Texas A&AMP;M and an All-Pro linebacker, was a modest,
soft-spoken type who had been the NFL's Coach of the Year with the
Bears. He finished his NFL career with the Oilers, as many coaches
did. John Jenkins coached the run-and-shoot offense under Pardee,
helped turn Andre Ware into a Heisman Trophy winner and instilled a
sense of abandon and fun in the team before he ran afoul of the
NCAA sleuths.
</P>
<P>
   Helton was a gruff, grizzled veteran of both the college and pro
games, and his honesty won him the loyalty of those who knew him.
But winning games, not friends, was the bottom line. It still is,
which brings us back to Dana Dimel, who is not without Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   His coach his junior year at Kansas State was Jimmy Dickey, a
former Cougars quarterback and assistant coach and a high school
legend at Galena Park. When Dickey was fired, Dana finished the
season under Lee Moon, who later, as the athletic director at
Wyoming, gave him his first head coaching chance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cougars hope he will turn out teams that produce
offensive fireworks, he brought to Wyoming a swarming defense that
ranked second in the nation in sacks in 1997 and sixth against the
pass.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's announcement, out of the office of UH chancellor
Arthur K. Smith, it was noted that the '99 Cowboys beat two
bowl-bound teams, Utah and Brigham Young, back-to-back. Dimel's
record also includes wins over Rice, SMU and TCU.
</P>
<P>
   One conclusion we can already draw about Dimel is that he moves
fast. He had already hired an offensive coordinator Sunday, Phil
Davis, from Nevada. He had lost his guy to the new staff at Texas
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Football historians would probably point out that Dimel is the
first football coach named Dana to work in this state since Dana X.
Bible was building a national power at Texas (and who had won big
earlier at Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M). This could be a good omen, and
the Cougars will take all they can get.

BURNS'S MIND RUNNING ON BRUINS SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pat Burns was up to 50 minutes on the treadmill Sunday
when it first occurred to him he was tired. The Bruins' coach was
so distracted by his team's six-game winless streak (0-3-3) that he
hadn't been monitoring his workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually run about 35 or 40 minutes and all of a sudden I
realized I'd been running for 50 minutes,'' said Burns after his
club's skate at the FleetCenter. ``I was lost in thought about
things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he's not panicking and he doesn't want his team to
panic. But with four games this week, beginning Monday night with
the Phoenix Coyotes, it's not going to get any easier.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's loss to the Red Wings, Burns said he needs more
from his top players _ namely Jason Allison _ and other players
have approached the coach about doing more on their own, including
goalie Byron Dafoe and right wing Joe Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he thinks part of the problem might be that players
are focused on individual goals rather than team ones. The club
plays its 30th game Sunday night, which means more than a third of
the season is over, and Burns said that at this time of year, some
players start doing the math to figure out where they'll be come
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coach's nightmare to have that,'' he said. ``When I
first came into the league there was none of that. You're trying to
get a team ensmble going and all of sudden one guy goes, `I've got
to get going, I've got a big bonus for 20 goals or 30goals.' All of
a sudden things change. I think it's become a part of the game that
coaches have no control over. It's not management's fault. They
have them up against the wall. I hate the whole structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said one player he really needs going is Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about his game,'' said the coach. ``I've
never seen him play like this. I've never seen the falling and
trying to draw penalties and the lack of fight. That concerns me a
lot. I've talked to him, I've done a lot of things with him. Sooner
or later, it's got to come from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from a wrist/forearm injury that caused him to
miss two games early last month, Allison has four goals and nine
points in 14 games. His linemate, Dave Andreychuk, after scoring 13
goals in 17 games, has two goals and four points in his last 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   Allison sounded frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going as good as I can, I know that,'' he said. ``I
don't think that's why we're not winning. We haven't played well.
If I don't play well and the team plays well, we still win,
although it helps, obviously, if I'm playing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said his inability to take faceoffs because of his
injury has resulted in reduced ice time and in turn has reduced his
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a couple the other night because (Andreychuk) got
kicked out and I felt fine, but other things I can't do still, so I
don't know if I should be pushing to do that when I can't do other
simple things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he thought Allison wasn't playing with his usual
confidence and Allison agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things _ being hurt a little bi and not
having my confidence and (seeing) a little less ice,'' he said.
``Since I've been back, I'l be sitting on the bench thinking, `Am I
going to get out now?' That's part of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thinks Burns has less confidence in him now,
Allison nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' he said, ``and maybe deservedly so. Even when I
think I'm playing good and skating good, as a line we're not doing
nothing. I don't think we have too many even-strength goals in the
last 10 games and it's not just our line. I haven't had the
confidence myself, the team hasn't been playing as well, and maybe
him having a lack of confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Dafoe was making heroic saves in the first period
until his teammates found their game. So far this year, Dafoe isn't
playing badly, but the team is giving up early goals and having to
battle back from deficits it didn't face a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say there aren't a lot of goals that have gone
in that have been bad goals,'' Dafoe said, ``but I look at last
year and I was making a lot of the big saves early to keep us in
the game until we got going. We were notorious last year for
starting slow, as we are this year. The difference is (other teams
are) scoring this year.''

RELAXED EDDIE MURRAY GLAD TO BE KICKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ At 43, playing football is still better than
talking about it. Kicker Eddie Murray left his job as sideline
reporter for the Detroit Lions radio broadcast team to rejoin the
Dallas Cowboys last week and in his first game in almost two
seasons made field goals from 30 and 34 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really pleasantly surprised with my emotions,'' Murray
said after his 2-for-4 performance Sunday in the Cowboys' 20-10
victory against the Philadelphia Eagles. ``I thought I would be a
lot more nervous. I was anxious during the week. It felt like this
game would never get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Murray, his first game since the 1997 season
didn't come down to a field goal. He barely missed his first
attempt, a 50-yarder that bounced off the right upright. He also
missed wide right on a 33-yarder, but connected on two
second-quarter field goals to give the Cowboys a 13-3 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed with the short one,'' he said. ``I fully
expect to kick much better. I felt I had a good rhythm going. It's
a timing factor. I am a little off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing twice, Murray has a renewed faith in the kicking
game, coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, he kicked the ball solid,'' Gailey said. ``Like
everyone else, he needs to get out there and play.'' nn

FANS, DEFENSE WORTH SHOUTING ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Patriots found out Sunday what all the
``noise'' is all about in Indianapolis, and they couldn't deal with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were back on their heels most of the day,'' said Colts
defensive end Chad Bratzke, who had a monster game. ``There were
times at the end of the game that the crowd was the loudest I've
ever heard it in here. And it helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The raucous, or was it ``rock us,'' crowd in the RCA Dome
cowered the Patriots' offensive line so badly it took New England
right out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some stats for New England's offensive line:
</P>
<P>
   Six false start penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Two ineligible men downfield penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Five sacks allowed.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the minimum, another five hurries on quarterback Drew
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd had a big impact,'' said Colts general manager Bill
Polian. ``The noise bothered the New England offense. You could see
it, and it helped our defense at the same time. That was the best
job our defensive front has done coming off the ball all year, and
our crowd had something to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, coming to play in the dome was like a vacation. The
Colts weren't very good, the games didn't sell out, and the crowd
didn't seem to care what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is the first time we got the crowd to where it is a
homefield advantage,'' Polian said. ``It didn't start out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our first home game this year, I called our marketing
people in and said, `Listen, we've got to do a better job of
getting our crowd into the game. Put those signs up on the
scoreboard. Let them know that they are supposed to be quiet when
we come to the line on offense, and noisy as hell when the other
team gets over the ball.' We've finally got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots played an excellent game on defense. This was only
the third time in 13 games that the Indianapolis offense has been
held to 20 points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played us tough,'' said Colts quarterback Peyton Manning.
``They did some nice things against us with their defense. They
kept changing it up. And we had to keep adjusting. In the first
half we made some big plays to get us those two touchdowns, but the
second half, we missed some key plays that stopped drives, and we
had to take field goals. Their defense played very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts were much better on the line of scrimmage than the
Patriots. Indianapolis consistently got pressure on Bledsoe rushing
four men, and didn't blitz as often as it normally does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to cover them more today rather than bringing
pressure,'' said Colts defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. ``We
wanted to keep everything in front of our defensive backs. We
didn't want to let Bledsoe beat us deep. We gave up a lot of yards,
but we did the job near the goal line and kept them out of the end
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had no running game whatsoever. The Colts shut that
down early, and concentrated on getting to Bledsoe after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got up on them we knew they weren't going to hurt us
anymore on the run,'' said Polian. ``Bratzke made a couple of great
plays against the run. Terry Allen looked like he was going to
break it for some yardage a couple of times in important
situations, and Bratzke closed right down the line of scrimmage to
make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were out of it until the Colts made their only
turnover in the game, when they appeared to have everything under
control. ``My guard was pulling out and he knocked the ball out of
my hand,'' said Manning, explaining the fumble, recovered by Lawyer
Milloy, that gave the Patriots the ball in the final two minutes,
trailing just 20-15, with a chance to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to suck it up right there,'' said Colts coach Jim Mora,
``and our guys handled it on defense. We had some adversity, and we
overcame it.''
</P>
<P>
   The key play in the game, and the Patriots' season to date, came
with 1:17 left. The Colts had the 5-point lead, but the Patriots
had the ball at the Indianapolis 22, third and 5.
</P>
<P>
   Fangio called a blitz, with Mike Peterson coming up the middle
to sack Bledsoe, forcing a fourth and 13 on which Bledsoe had no
chance the way he was pressured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellis Johnson made the big play on that blitz,'' said Bratzke.
``He tied up two of their offensive linemen inside and the guy that
was supposed to block our blitzer couldn't block (Peterson) and he
came free to make the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the play, the crowd was the loudest ever. They sensed what
was at stake. Bledsoe was in the shotgun. They had a silent count.
He couldn't try to call the signals because it was so loud his
linemen wouldn't have heard him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were keying on the center. We watched Bledsoe lift his leg
to tell the center to snap it, so we knew when he put his head down
to look between his legs, he was going to snap it. The offensive
linemen were back on their heels, and we had a great chance to get
off with the snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critical point came in the third period, with the Colts
leading, 20-6, and the Patriots on the Indianapolis 1, with third
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a defense on that play that we hadn't used all year,''
said Fangio. ``We noticed in their films that they had a play on
the goal line that they had run with success, something similar to
what our offense does. We changed up a little, and had our
defensive linemen pinch down toward the middle, and when it
happened, Allen couldn't go off tackle (where the play was supposed
to go) and we had the stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had to settle for a field goal, a 4-point swing,
and ended up with a loss, even with Bledsoe throwing for 172 yards
in the fourth quarter.

WARREN SHUCKS BURDEN TO CARRY TEAM

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The last time we left running back Chris Warren,
Dallas Cowboys fans were ready to run him out of town. After
Sunday, he might have the run of it.
</P>
<P>
   After starter Emmitt Smith was injured on the first series,
Warren came in to gain 138 total yards in leading the Cowboys to a
20-10 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Chris to come out and play the way he did, that was an
impressive showing by him,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
``That's why he's on the team, to give us that ability to go out
there and run like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren lost two fumbles and his job in the 27-13 victory against
the Green Bay Packers on Nov. 14. In the next three games, he had
three carries for 7 yards. Against the Eagles, he carried the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Warren ran 25 times for 92 yards and a touchdown as the Cowboys
gained 112 rushing yards. He also had four catches for 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about that \RGreen Bay game\S,'' Warren said.
``I just wanted to go out and play well today. I didn't think about
last week or next week.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first play from scrimmage, Smith gained 2 yards. He also
suffered a strained left groin. But the only thing that changed for
the offense was the running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a pro,'' Cowboys running backs coach Clarence Shelmon
said. ``He's been around. He's done it before. He gives the team a
calming effect. People know he can still make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren has 10 seasons, four 1,000-yard seasons and three Pro
Bowls on his resume. Lately, however, he had little on which to
hang his helmet.

<P>
   In the past three seasons, Warren has had only two better
rushing days than the 92 yards he had Sunday. And his 25 carries
were the most since Nov. 19, 1995, when, while with Seattle, he had
29 carries for 136 yards and a touchdown against the Washington
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why his bruised right leg didn't feel so bad as he
limped out of Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough because, yeah, I'm used to playing every down,''
Warren said. ``I want to go out there, and I know I can help the
team. But it's my role, and I chose to come here. I knew that was
what the situation would be. I just have to be ready to play
whenever I'm called.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren did lose a fumble against the Eagles, but he didn't lose
his job to Robert Chancey this time. The game was well in hand when
strong safety Tim Hauck's helmet knocked the ball out of Warren's
hand with 8:26 remaining in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good hit,'' Warren said. ``Not much I could do
about it. I tried to get my \Rother\S hand over to cover it, but it
was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will have his injured groin re-examined Monday. Warren has
been there, done that, too. He missed the first three games of last
season with a left groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny injury,'' Warren said. ``You never know what the
severity is going to be. If he's down for a while, I'll be able to
play. I'll get prepared, and I'll have to come in and do my job.''

INJURY TO McNABB THROWS SCARE INTO EAGLES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The present is ugly for the Philadelphia Eagles,
which is why it was so disturbing for them to see their future
limping off the field Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter of the Eagles' 20-10 loss to the
Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium, Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett
timed the snap, leaped over Eagles center Steve Everitt and slammed
into rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb. McNabb fumbled and Dallas'
Brandon Noble recovered, but more importantly, Philadelphia's top
draft choice and quarterback of the future was knocked out of
action with a sprained left medial collateral ligament.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, who made his fifth consecutive start since replacing
Doug Pederson, is scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging test
today to determine the extent of his injury. But he was encouraged
by the fact he was able to walk and predicted a return for next
Sunday's game against New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very anxious to get back out there,'' McNabb said. ``We
were starting to get things going on offense, starting to get some
chemistry in our passing game and our running game. It was going
the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks like it's nothing serious. I'm trying to
stay positive and focus on the best, and that means being out there
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb said he told coach Andy Reid he wanted to stay in the
game, but Reid vetoed that idea and finished the game with
Pederson. Pederson had better statistics than McNabb, completing 8
of 12 passes for 108 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions.
McNabb was 7-of-17 for 49 yards with an interception and no scores.
He was sacked three times. Pederson was not sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reid said the quarterback situation is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Donovan can go, he'll go,'' he said. STILL GOING...
</P>
<P>
   Norm Johnson made his only extra-point attempt to extend his NFL
record conversion streak to 293. Johnson, who is fourth on the
all-time NFL scoring list and fifth on the career field goal list,
hasn't missed an extra point since Sept. 29, 1991, when he played
for Atlanta against New Orleans. His 630 career conversions rank
third all-time behind George Blanda (943) and Lou Groza (641).
DON'T LEAVE HOME...
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have lost 13 consecutive NFC East road games. Their
most recent division victory away from Veterans Stadium was on Nov.
3, 1996, when they beat the Cowboys at Texas Stadium. Since a road
victory against the New York Jets on Dec. 14, 1996, Philadelphia is
1-23-1 on the road, including a 19-game winless streak that was
broken with a victory at Chicago on Oct. 17. BACKED UP
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles didn't put together much offense _ only 233 total
yards _ but part of the problem was the poor field position they
were stuck with most of the day. Indeed, they got the ball at their
20 or deeper on seven consecutive possessions, a span that
encompassed the entire second and third quarters. In those seven
series, the Eagles failed to make a first down four times, had only
one first down on two possessions and fumbled on the third play of
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that makes it harder, but it's not like you can't drive
the ball from there,'' quarterback Donovan McNabb said. ``We've
done it in the last couple of weeks. But when you go three-and-out,
three-and-out, it becomes hard to get a rhythm going.'' nn

COWBOYS PLAY GAME OF FIELD POSITION TO PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys punter Toby Gowin provided the
defense the perfect opportunity to play an aggressive, attacking
style against Philadelphia Eagles rookie quarterback Donovan
McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   Gowin tied the team record by landing five punts inside the
Eagles' 20-yard line, the second time Gowin has pulled off the feat
and only the fourth time in team history it has been accomplished.
Gowin continually kept the Eagles' lethargic offense stuck in
horrible field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``Any
time you start with field position in your favor, it's big.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Eagles started at the Cowboys' 36-yard line with 33
seconds remaining in the first quarter _ a drive that ended with a
Darren Hambrick interception of a McNabb pass on the first play _
the Eagles' starting field position on their next eight drives went
like this: own 10, own 17, own 16, own 18, own 16, own 20, own 11,
and own 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was key,'' safety George Teague said. ``Whenever you get
somebody back inside their 20 for half the game, we can do a lot of
different things and be very aggressive.'' ELLIS LOST FOR THE
SEASON
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got the victory, but the barrage injuries they've
suffered this season continued.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial was to defensive end Greg Ellis, who suffered a
season-ending fractured left tibia in the first quarter when
defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman fell on his leg. Ellis, the team's
sack leader with 7.5, was replaced by rookies Peppi Zellner and
Ebenezer Ekuban. He underwent surgery to repair the fracture last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is the 13th Cowboys player to suffer a season-ending
injury in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Mathis could also miss the final three games
after suffering a sprained left knee. CORYATT RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Coryatt, expected to be the starting strongside
linebacker before he unexpectedly opted to leave the Cowboys before
the season opener, returned to the field for the first time since
1997 when he was with the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, who said the combination of a shoulder injury and an
Achilles' tendon injury forced him to take the first 12 weeks off
to rehabilitate, saw action on about 10 plays and combined on one
tackle. He said he is clearly not in football shape, but should be
in time for the playoffs. FIRST SACK
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Ebenezar Ekuban recorded his first career
sack and then added a second as he received extended playing time
after Greg Ellis suffered a fractured left tibia early in the first
quarter. Ekuban finished with three tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels great when you finally get an opportunity
to play,'' Ekuban said. ``Unfortunately, it came through the wrong
way because someone got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban's two sacks are the most by a Dallas rookie since Russell
Maryland recorded two against Pittsburgh on Nov. 28, 1991. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Wide receiver Chris Brazzell, who was signed off the practice
squad on Friday when Wane McGarity was placed on injured reserve,
caught one pass, a third-down, 12-yard reception for a first down
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Troy Aikman's 8-yard touchdown pass to David LaFleur in the
third quarter marked Aikman's 153rd career touchdown pass, tying
him for second place in team history with Roger Staubach. The
franchise leader? Danny White with 155. nn

RANGERS OWNER HICKS WILL ACCEPT YOUTH MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Rangers will have a younger team next
year, younger perhaps than they expected going into the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Spurned by Todd Zeile and aghast at the asking price of starting
pitching, the Rangers are bracing themselves for a team that not
only has Ruben Mateo in center and Gabe Kapler in right but also
Mike Lamb at third base and Matt Perisho in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Tom Hicks said he's willing to do that and go through a
potentially painful transition period rather than spend recklessly
for free-agent pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision that we couldn't win the World Series with
last year's roster,'' Hicks said yesterday. ``You have to find a
way to get there. We don't have to get there next year. It would be
great if we did and if we improve our starting pitching, we might
have a better chance than last year. But if we have to be more
patient, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin seems to be leaning that way as the
Rangers regrouped at the winter meetings the day after losing Zeile
to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we were a little bit older, a little slower and
not as athletic,'' Melvin said. ``I get very excited about young
players. When we're talking about Ruben Mateo, Gabe Kapler, Mike
Lamb and Francisco Cordero, we're talking about young guys who are
highly respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said the Rangers are not looking for a front-line third
baseman. They will not pursue Colorado's Vinny Castilla or
Milwaukee's Jeff Cirillo _ both are available _ and it's unlikely
they will pursue Tony Fernandez or Ed Sprague, the best of the
remaining free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely they'll discuss a veteran who could help Lamb with
the transition from Double A. They talked with agents yesterday for
Gary Gaetti, Shawon Dunston and Tom Evans. Giants utility infielder
F.P. Santangelo remains another possibility, through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching remains the Rangers' top priority, but an expensive
waiting game has developed all through the industry.
Representatives for the available free-agent pitchers are looking
for three- to four-year contracts for at least $9 million to $10
million a year while clubs aren't willing to spend more than $7
million to $8 million per annum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gap or you'd have more signings,'' Indians general
manager John Hart said. ``A lot of it is the expectations that are
out there and the reality some clubs have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have offered Aaron Sele a four-year contract worth
$28 million, and they met with agent Scott Boras yesterday
concerning Kenny Rogers. But Melvin said the Rangers have yet to
make an offer to Rogers and remains reluctant to overpay for the
pitching available.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think they'll take you to the next level,''
Melvin said. ``If you tie up those kind of dollars, you could be in
trouble for the next three or four years. It could be expensive
going through a whole rebuilding program if it fails.''
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball officials believe Chuck Finley will be the next
starting pitcher to sign, thereby setting the market for Sele,
Rogers and others. The Indians, Seattle Mariners and Baltimore
Orioles have made offers but have yet to meet agent Tim Shannon's
asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a figure in mind,'' Shannon said. ``I've told them, the
first team that hits that number, I'm going to put that in front of
Chuck, and he'll say yes or no. We're not trying to set any records
or break anybody's bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers have seen the kind of money that pitchers are
asking for, and they're holding back. It's just one reason why
youth could be served next year at The Ballpark in Arlington.

ORDERING BLITZ PROVED SOUND CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ On first down from the Colts 27 with 1:28 left in
the game and many of their futures riding on what happened, the
Patriots squandered play Sunday. None of the receivers seemed to
know where they were supposed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe had to throw the ball away, and on
second down that oh-so-familiar sight of New England receivers
heading deep and toward the sidelines reappeared like a ghost from
games past and chances lost. Bledsoe, again finding no one open,
had to scramble and picked up 5 yards. And now came third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches made a good call on that down,'' said Indianapolis
linebacker Mike Peterson. ``We caught 'em by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the fourth quarter, as the Patriots tried to come
back, the Colts often had rushed only three linemen and played a
prevent defense. But, said Peterson, ``I'm an aggressive player and
I like it when we're aggressive.'' On that third down, the Colts
went aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots ``didn't have enough blockers when we came,'' said
Cornelius Bennett, the old man of the football wars who also came
with Peterson on the blitz. ``They tried to pick me up because I'm
the one who does most of the blitzing, but they didn't pick up the
other guy (Peterson).''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, at the Colts' hotel, Bennt had gathered his
teammates around him ``and gave a really good motivational
speech,'' said Indianapolis coach Jim Mora. ``He talked to the club
about a lot of things and he showed why he's one of our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, of course, has been to four Super Bowls with the Bills,
was with the Falcons in the last Super Bowl, and said, ever
modestly, ``I love football and football loves me. And wherever I
go, I win. And I'm still playing good for an old fart.'' The
linebacker is now 37 and in his 14th season, ``and I'm not going to
count myself out until the fat lady sings and she's nowhere to be
found right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in training camp, Bennett could only practice once a day
``and I remember telling (defensive back) Jason Belser because I
had a lot of chances to stand back and look, `We've got a chance to
be a special football team.' From my knowledge of football, and
being around as long as I've been, I just saw the way these young
guys were busting their butts in practice. And now we've come
together real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was asked if these ``young guys,'' who have helped the
Colts clinch a playoff spot, have made him feel younger or if he
has made them play older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a little bit of both,'' Bennett said. ``You know, I
feel that, at my age, I can't let these young pups outdo me. And
they probably feel they can't let this old dog outperform them.
I'll probably keep playing another five years if we keep winning
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that third down that so symbolized the demise of the
Patriots, the ``young pup'' _ Michael Peterson _ and the ``old
dog'' _ the ever-emotional and vrtalkative Cornelius Bennett _
teamed up to totally surprise the New England offense.
</P>
<P>
   As Peterson recalled the blitz, ``we had practiced it all week
and we hadn't run it the whole game. Then we called it at a good
time. Give all the credit to the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson came right up the middle ``and the look we gave then
made them think of something else, a great disguise we had,''
Bennett said. ``It was all the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' defense ``was sucking air at that point,'' said
Peterson, ``and I kind of looked off the center (the Patriots'
Damien Woody) and I kind of looked like I was going somewhere else.
But, at that last moment, I kind of hit it and I came free. They
never even got a piece of me. That's the way it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson sacked Bledsoe for an 8-yard loss. The Patriots were
done, their fall continuing. The Colts were ecstatic, their rise
quickening.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bennett said, ``This team is making this old dog feel like
a young pup again.''

METS' APPEAL FOR ZEILE: BETTER SHOT AT WINNING SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Todd Zeile believes the New York Mets have a
more realistic chance of winning the World Series than the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he spurned the Rangers and agreed to a three-year,
$18 million contract with the New York Mets late Saturday night.
Zeile will play first base for the Mets, replacing John Olerud, who
signed with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets have a more realistic possibility of (winning the
Series) during what I consider the remaining term of my career,''
Zeile said. ``There were more question marks and uncertainty with
the Rangers than the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's decision stunned Rangers general manager Doug Melvin,
who met with Zeile's agent, Seth Levinson, late Friday night and
went to bed believing that a deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did everything they asked us to do,'' said
Melvin, who now has to decide if he'll go with rookie Mike Lamb at
third base or make a run at aging free-agent veterans Tony
Fernandez or Ed Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and Levinson had agreed on the terms of a three-year, $16
million contract that included a complete no-trade clause for the
first two years. In the last year of the deal, Zeile would have
been able to designate 15 teams that he couldn't be traded to by
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth told me that's (a deal) he could convince Todd of,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't. Instead Mets catcher Mike Piazza, a former teammate
with the Dodgers and Marlins, convinced Zeile that New York was the
place to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piazza must have done a good job,'' Melvin said. ``He should
be an agent when he's done playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile met with Melvin on Saturday night before making a decision
and expressed two concerns. Zeile said he wasn't happy the Rangers
had taken too long to offer a three-year contract and was concerned
about their chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was worried the Rangers had yet to re-sign pitcher Aaron
Sele, and they were going with young players, most notably center
fielder Ruben Mateo and right fielder Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd did have some concerns about our club being younger,''
Melvin said. ``But I get a little tired of veteran players talking
about younger players. They were once young, too. But I give Todd
credit. He came in and expressed his concerns to me face-to-face.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin also pointed out, ``Our payroll is going to be higher
than 25 other teams. We're just distributing the money
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile said the pace of the negotiations ``to some degree left me
a little frustrated. They knew from the beginning of the off-season
I expressed serious interest in getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers started the process early in November by offering a
two-year contract plus a club option for a third year. Levinson
countered that with a four-year proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who lives in the Los Angeles area, had purchased a house
in the Metroplex, contingent on the Rangers' re-signing him by Nov.
15. When that date passed, he started to get irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it can get done quickly if you just give the player
what he's asking for,'' Melvin said. ``We had a lot of things going
on, and we were reluctant to go three years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Rangers were concerned about how much it
would take to sign free-agent pitching. The Rangers didn't offer a
three-year contract to Zeile until last week. By then, the Mets had
lost Olerud, and general manager Steve Phillips was pursuing other
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if things had moved sooner, it would have been done
before I got a chance to talk with Steve,'' Zeile said. nn

CUBS ACQUIRE PITCHER VALDES, INFIELDER YOUNG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN and SIMON GONZALEZ c.1999 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Before taking the job as Chicago Cubs manager,
Don Baylor wanted to know if the team was willing to do what it
takes to put a winning team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interview process, that was something that we talked about,
the baseball people and the Tribune Company,'' Baylor said. ``I was
looking for commitment, and they promised that.''
</P>
<P>
   Management made good on its promise yesterday. The Cubs were
able to trade reliever Terry Adams and two minor-leaguers to the
Los Angeles Dodgers for starting pitcher Ismael Valdes and second
baseman Eric Young because ownership was willing to take on about
$10 million in salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to accomplish some things right away, and we've
done that with the backing and blessing of the company,'' Baylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions about Young's defense and attitude but
Baylor, who managed him in Colorado, wanted him in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very exciting player for me in Colorado,'' Baylor
said. ``He brings to us something that this club needed, a leadoff
hitter with speed. Fifty-two stolen bases was probably more than
our entire club had last year.'' Protecting Palmeiro Signing Rafael
Palmeiro last year gave the Rangers some protection for Juan
Gonzalez in the middle of their order. The departure of Gonzalez
and third baseman Todd Zeile now leaves manager Johnny Oates
wondering who will protect Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way a way to make them pitch to Raffy,''
Oates said. ``The key is not so much protecting the young kids
\RRuben Mateo, Gabe Kapler\S but protecting Raffy so they'll pitch
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said one solution is to have the designated hitter platoon
of Lee Stevens and Mike Simms in the fifth spot. One result of
Zeile signing with the Mets on Saturday is the Rangers aren't
likely to trade Stevens, who is arbitration eligible, as a
cost-cutting measure.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he has no idea what his Opening Day lineup will be,
but he is leaning toward Rusty Greer as his leadoff hitter, Luis
Alicea batting second, Ivan Rodriguez third and Palmeiro in the
cleanup spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he was sorry to see Zeile and Mark McLemore _ two of
his favorites _ leave but added, ``I've lost a lot of good players
in my career. But life goes on. Everybody has decisions to make.
Nobody is bigger than the game.'' Palmeiro wins DH award Rafael
Palmerio has been named the American League's Outstanding
Designated Hitter for 1999. He is the first Rangers player to win
the award since it's inception in 1973. He is also the first player
to win that award and the Gold Glove as a first baseman in the same
season. Briefly Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood, coming off major elbow
surgery, is expected to throw off a mound today. The Grand Prairie
High School graduate might be ready for the start of the season,
but manager Don Baylor won't rush him. ``I'm going to baby him as
much as I can, try to keep him away from throwing a lot of
pitches,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, in need of a catcher after losing Brent Mayne and
Scott Servais to free agency, traded right-handed pitcher Chris
Brock to the Phillies for Bobby Estalella. Estalella, 25, who a
.218 average with 14 home runs and 34 runs batted in in 76 career
big-league games, is considered a good defensive catcher. Brock,
29, was 6-8 with a 5.48 earned-run average in 19 starts for the
Giants last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar confirmed interest in free
agent slugger Greg Vaughn. The Indians and Mets also want Vaughn,
who hit 45 home runs and drove in 118 runs for the Reds last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are interested in Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez
as well as Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. They are dangling closer
Armando Benitez, starting pitcher Octavio Dotel and outfielder
Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox would rather see a Mets lineup with
Todd Zeile at first base than departed free agent John Olerud. ``I
was really glad to see Olerud leave,'' Cox said. ``I think he's one
of the best hitters in the game. I like Zeile, don't get me wrong,
but I love Olerud. He's got one of the best swings I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack, the National League's stolen base leader in his
first three full major-league seasons, agreed to a $17 million,
four-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks, The Associated
Press reported.

KRAFT SHOULD GET DOWN TO BUSINESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Many of them appeared to be as sad as this
droopy-eyed city's nightlife. They began Sunday living on their
own, simply needing to win the rest of their games to get into the
playoffs. But their 20-15 loss to the Colts changed everything. Now
the Patriots have to do the NFL equivalent of moving in with the
folks to get what they want. They are highly paid dependents. They
need outside help and they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   That was the surface reason for a football team's sadness Sunday
at RCA Dome, but sadness is usually deeper than what appears on the
surface. You would have to conduct a private organizational poll to
find out what each Patriot believes is the definitive problem (or
problems) on a 7-6 team.
</P>
<P>
   I have not conducted a poll, but I am sure my summary would
include a line like this: The problem is that not many people can
agree on what the problem is. I also would add: This certainly is
not a divided team and organization, but it is not seamlessly
united, either.
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive wins or losses to end the season will not
change what ails the Patriots. Only one man can do that. He is the
same man who was headed toward a private plane as one of his
employees was sending a message to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say that I apologize to Mr. Kraft,'' quarterback
Drew Bledsoe said after passing for more than twice as many yards
(379) as winning quarterback Peyton Manning. Bledsoe mentioned that
the Patriots have ``one of the highest payrolls in the NFL'' and
that ``(Kraft) spends a lot of money for the players he has on this
team'' for it to be in a situation where ``it needs help getting
into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   People react to apologies in different ways; I would love to
hear Robert Kraft's initial reaction to Bledsoe's. Does the owner
believe that he has invested too much money in a team that wins
slightly more often than it loses? Is he thinking of reshuffling
some of the players who hold the weighty salaries and/or the people
who signed them to those contracts? He is a rich man, but does he
have the same feeling that a lot of us have after excessive
spending doesn't bring satisfaction? You know, the feeling that he
has wasted his money?
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, money might be a Patriot problem. But then, some don't
think it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to talk to Big Money,'' Lawyer Milloy said,
referring to Bledsoe. ``That's not football. Money doesn't have
anything to do with it. Because, we weren't the highest-paid team
out there when we had a whole bunch of role players and ended up in
the Super Bowl. So, you can't bring up money. We're still that same
team. We're just not producing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are tough words coming from the team's most ferocious
hitter. But the more you listen to him, you realize he is
frustrated as much as he is afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that we need help (getting into the playoffs),''
he said. ``It's obvious. We could still end up with 10 wins. But
the way the AFC is and the way our division is, those 10 wins might
not get us in. So right now the feeling is . . . it's a scary
thought. To think that we could possibly go home early this year is
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is only one man in the organization with the
power to finger the nonproduction problem and fix it. Ultimately,
Kraft will have to determine if offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese
is ineffective or if the problem is with the players he is given to
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese's schemes were good enough Sunday for Bledsoe to pick
the Colts defense apart at times. Bledsoe said the Colts did
nothing to confuse him, and no one mentioned anything about the
receivers not being able to get open. The chain-smoking
coordinator's offense was good enough for Terry Glenn to produce
nine catches and 148 yards. In fact, Zampese's offense seems to
work for Glenn when the Patriots play 150 miles or fewer from
Glenn's hometown of Columbus, Ohio. He had 22 catches for 362 yards
in games against Cleveland and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But who was at fault for the major mistake at the end of the
third quarter? The Patriots trailed, 13-6, and had a third and goal
from the 1. Coach Pete Carroll said the call for Terry Allen was an
off tackle play. Well, either it was a bad call, bad block, or bad
run because it turned into a 2-yard loss and eventual field goal.
These things have been happening to the Patriots often enough this
season for their record to be an uneasy 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft also will have to analyze his last few drafts and ask
himself if he is happy with what they have produced. In 1998,
Kraft's Bobby Grier-led personnel team sat with him in the team's
war room and told him that they liked a great athlete who was a
risky pick. But, they said, since the team had two first-rounders
it was a risk the team could afford. The player, of course, was
Tebucky Jones. I see the man and think ``safety,'' but I don't
coach nor sign checks. As Bledsoe pointed out, Kraft does sign a
lot of checks and endorses the hiring and firing of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Kraft may have pleasant conversations about Carroll's
performance, but publicly he has done classic Michael Jackson
moonwalks away from his coach the past couple weeks. After Sunday's
game, he was as noiseless as the tumbleweed rolling through the
prairie that is this city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kraft is silent because he doesn't want anyone to feel he
is looking over a shoulder. I can respect that. But no matter what
the Patriots do in the next few weeks, Kraft will have to do some
deep thinking in 2000. That process may involve admitting that he
was wrong on some of his previous football decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This organization definitely needs something new _ either new
management, new coaching or new players. Kraft has a tough job: He
has to find the problems before they find him. If not, the
second-most important part of his business (winning) will be a
memory.

BLEDSOE AIRS IT OUT AFTER THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ He was seething, but he tried not to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe is not often a captive of his
emotions, but Sunday, after the offense he leads had done
everything it could to self-destruct at the most critical of
moments, he was ready to pop his cork.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe silently has grown weary of blown assignments, receivers
covered like they were wrapped in flypaper, and penalties that take
points off the board or cause his team to go backward just when it
is beginning to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   He is tired of seeing offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese blamed
for the wrongs of his players, tired of seeing himself and his
teammates make just enough mistakes that Zampese is always starting
over when he tries to call a game rather than starting to set
something up.
</P>
<P>
   So on a day in which he completed 31 of 44 passes for 379 yards
and threw two touchdown passes but was credited for only one
because the other was wiped out by an illegal procedure call,
Bledsoe was steaming. So angry he refused to speak for a long time.
A long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he did, his true emotions were masked by a blank
look, a calm voice, and a personal decision to admit what has been
obvious to some for quite a while now.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of myself and the team I really want to apologize to
Mr. (Robert) Kraft (the Patriots' owner),'' Bledsoe said an hour
after that team had lost to the Indianapolis Colts, 20-15, to fall
to 7-6 and register its fourth loss in the last five games. ``He's
paying us a lot of money and not getting his money's worth. To be
in a position where we need help to get into the playoffs is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he got it out of Bledsoe, who completed eight passes
of 16 yards or longer and three for gains of more than 25 yards
(28, 35, and 52). He was accurate and on time with his throws and
four times ran away from pass rushes for gains when in the recent
past he might have been sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the end, all Bledsoe had to show for this effort was
more frustration, more anger, and a need to apologize for the kind
of game most quarterbacks never have in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very good game,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll said of
his downcast quarterback. ``He was alive the whole time. I thought
he was whipping the ball around and was in control of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took advantage of the opportunities that were there. I
thought he played very, very well in this game. It's unfortunate he
didn't get to finish it. I know he's dead sick about not finishing
it. It's the kind of situation he looks forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bledsoe looks forward to is having the ball handed back to
him with just over two minutes to play and the game on the line.
His team trailed by 5 points by then, but he had the ball and more
than enough time to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   When he found Troy Brown for a 28-yard completion to the Colts
27 with 88 seconds still on the clock, he knew, just knew, he would
get his team in the end zone this time.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up too little, too late at the end,'' Bledsoe said
after he was forced to throw the ball away on the next play when no
one was close to being open and was sacked for an 8-yard loss on a
blitz two plays later to put the ball back on the 30, making it
``fourth down and forever,'' according to Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense did as good a job as they've done all year,''
Bledsoe said. ``They did everything they could, including turn the
ball over to us late (when Lawyer Milloy recovered Peyton Manning's
fumbled snap).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to get the ball to the end zone at the end of the
game and I didn't get it done. For the most part we were able to
move on them but you have to score touchdowns. Field goals aren't
going to win for you against a team like this. I knew it was a
problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a problem Drew Bledsoe could not solve Sunday and so he
seethed instead. Seethed until he composed himself and did the only
other thing he could think to do for his team.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized for it.

KARIYA SAYS KOHN'S FIGHT WAS KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Playing on a team with heavyweights Stu
Grimson and Jim McKenzie, 5-foot-11, 192-pound winger Ladislav Kohn
doesn't figure to make much of an impact with his fighting skills.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Paul Kariya, it was Kohn's willingness to
defend himself against Atlanta's Kelly Buchberger that turned
Sunday's game in favor of the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that was the biggest play of the game,'' said Kariya of
the Kohn's fight at 1:14 of the second period. ``He stood up for
himself and got us going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't believe it,'' joked Teemu Selanne. ``We thought
`what is he doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, who was hit high by Buchberger after the Ducks winger had
checked Atlanta's Patrik Stefan, said it was all in a night's work
on the fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was answering the bell, facing the music,'' he said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohn got rewarded for his efforts shortly after leaving the
penalty box when he converted Kariya's two-on-one pass into his
second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A goal and a fight ... if you had told me that before the
game, I'd have taken it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __Even Dominic Roussel was involved in some rough stuff. The
Ducks goalie, who won his first game since Oct. 27, got a a
roughing penalty for pushing Ray Ferraro after the Atlanta pest got
in his face and bumped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like it,'' said Roussel. ``With the new rules you've
got let them know who is boss (in the goal crease).''
</P>
<P>
   Roussel's win came in his first appearance since he lost a 6-3
decision in Detroit on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played very well,'' said Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg. ``We kind of left him alone at times in the third
period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot the Thrashers 36-28, but Atlanta had the edge,
16-12, in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stapleton's shot bent the cage on Roussel's mask and had
him ``seeing stars'' just seconds before Dean Sylvester scored the
Thrashers' goal at at 8:11 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   __The Ducks had scored three or more goals in only four of their
previous 14 games. Anaheim has topped the three-goal mark only
eight times in the first 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   __Ferraro, an ex-King, considered retirement after Los Angeles
did not re-sign him last summer, but the center was selected by
Atlanta in the expansion draft and is getting more playing time
than he has in recent years. Ferraro leads the Thrashers' forwards
in ice time (16:23 a game) and is second in scoring (5-11-16).
Andrew Burnette leads Atlanta with 13 goals and 26 points.

FOX, O'NEAL LIFT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That wasn't some bad Vegas lounge performer
playing ventriloquist on the Staples Center floor Sunday night. It
just looked that way.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the part of the dummy _ the Detroit Pistons. Displaying
the latest technique for denying Shaquille O'Neal the ball, Piston
after Piston planted himself in O'Neal's large lap as he took
position outside the paint.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, to a point, but O'Neal came up with 22 points anyway.
And the Los Angeles Lakers shooters, led by Rick Fox's 20 points,
took advantage of the added space to roam to take the 101-93
victory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also pulled down a season-high 24 rebounds and blocked
four shots, but was limited by foul trouble and a constant crowd of
Piston defenders. Coach Phil Jackson said O'Neal would have done
much more damage if not for the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (referee) Steve Javie is the only one who could stop
Shaq because of the way he played,'' Jackson said. ``He was
dominating _ so much so that they conceded our outside shot and
gave us whatever we wanted, and kept us at bay because we have such
a predictable type of orientation toward going inside. The first
quarter took us a long time to build a rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that was a consequence of losing Glen Rice for the
evening. With Rice nursing a 100-degree fever at home, the Lakers
lacked an outside shooting threat to keep the Pistons' guards from
sagging into O'Neal's lap.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Fox filled that role instead. Coming off the bench
to play a season-high 37 minutes, Fox had his best statistical game
of the season. He hit 9 of 18 shots, and his points and rebounds
(eight) were both season highs. He also dished out four assists and
blocked a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going so well for Fox, he even made plays when he
wasn't looking. Early in the fourth quarter, Robert Horry saved the
ball from going out of bounds, and his quick toss caromed off Fox's
head before landing back in Horry's hands. The possession was
saved, and Fox eventually dished to Brian Shaw for a layup that
gave the Lakers an 89-71 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect encore to Fox's breakout-type performance the
day before against Vancouver. After a month and a half of
struggling to find a shooting groove in Jackson's offense, Fox
wasn't about to declare he'd found a comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare I speak so soon,'' he quipped. ``No, I always enjoyed
playing this offense and am comfortable in knowing it gets
opportunities for everyone. But being a perfectionist and liking to
see things happen the same way every night, I'd like to have the
shots go down a lot more consistently. And I'm probably harder on
myself than anyone else is going to be. It will only get better if
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two games, it has, and Fox is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely reminds me that I'm not stealing money from the
Lakers,'' he said. ``It allows me to feel good about a contribution
to the team, especially when we miss one of our superstars.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fox firing, O'Neal rebounding and Kobe Bryant slashing for
a team-high 26 points, the Lakers took a double-digit lead in the
third quarter and were on their way to a rout when they extended
the margin to 20 points in the fourth. But a shaky outing from the
Laker reserves let the Pistons knock the lead down to eight late in
the game before the Lakers sealed the win, their ninth in the last
10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said Pistons coach Alvin Gentry, ``is you
have to find so much time and energy trying to figure out what you
are going to do with Shaq ... that he breaks your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson knows that axiom well enough, having coached against
O'Neal. ``It's probably why I'm coaching here now,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured the top two scorers in the NBA, and both
league leader O'Neal (averaging 28.3 points) and Grant Hill (27.5)
set the tone for their teams in the first half, with 16 points
each. But the Lakers got the better supporting effort to take a
58-51 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, despite leading the Pistons with 25 points and 12
rebounds, struggled with his shot, finishing 7 of 19, and had four
turnovers.

DODGERS TRADE VALDES, YOUNG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It became apparent midway through the
tumultuous 1999 season that the Dodgers wanted to trade
right-hander Ismael Valdes and second baseman Eric Young. Finding a
club to absorb the cost was another subject.
</P>
<P>
   After months of trying and numerous talks, the Los Angeles
Dodgers found a match in the Chicago Cubs. Sunday the two teams
pulled off the first big trade of the winter meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes and Young went to the Cubs, while the Dodgers, in
addition to cutting $14 million of payroll, received right-handed
reliever Terry Adams, minor-league pitcher Chad Ricketts and
another minor-league player to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 26, is 19-26 with a 4.03 ERA and 37 saves in four-plus
seasons with the Cubs. Ricketts, 24, had 80 strikeouts in 67
innings at Double-A West Tennessee. The Dodgers project him out to
be a set-up guy for the 2001 or 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who made $736,000 last year, is eligible for salary
arbitration and expected to earn approximately $1.3 million next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an option, a legitimate option, moving (Valdes)
solely by himself,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
``We have to look at the bigger picture. You probably could have
gotten a little more talent, but reality is this is more than a
talent issue. The reality of this is there were economic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic issues was a mandate by Dodgers managing general
partner, chairman and CEO Robert Daly to move payroll. The Dodgers,
who had an $83 million payroll last season, cut their current
payroll to approximately $80 million after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is being criticized throughout the industry because the
Dodgers traded two starters for a relief pitcher and two
minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers thought Valdes was expendable after his agent,
Jim Bronner, said the Mexico native wouldn't sign a multi-year
contract before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Valdes, who has a career 61-54 mark with a 3.38 ERA,
wants to test the free-agent waters after the 2000 season. Valdes
is considered one of the top pitching talents in baseball, but his
toughness is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate giving up players, and we especially hate giving up a
Valdes,'' Daly said. ``You hate to lose Valdes, but, again, he was
going to be a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Dodgers without a leadoff hitter or second
baseman, though more moves are expected. In the interim, Malone
said rookies Eric Gagne, Jeff Williams and Mike Judd would battle
for a starting spot, while a number of options are being considered
for second base.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino, Alex Cora and Juan Castro are among those
considerations, as is a platoon involving Craig Counsell. Malone
also said publicly for the first time it was possible shortstop
Mark Grudzielanek could move to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said Grudzielanek could bat leadoff, which
he did in Montreal. If the Dodgers somehow retain third baseman
Adrian Beltre, he could bat second, Johnson said. Last season
Grudzielanek became the first Dodgers shortstop to hit more than
.300 since 1963. He batted .326, mostly from the second spot.
</P>
<P>
   The trade also means the feud between Young and manager Davey
Johnson, which escalated as the season wore on, won't infiltrate
the clubhouse again. The relationship between the two took a
drastic turn in July, when Young failed to turn a double play ball
on a routine grounder and team officials considered Young a
defensively liability.
</P>
<P>
   It was further strained when Young wanted to go on the disabled
list because of an ankle injury but the Dodgers didn't oblige
because they wanted to trade him before the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very relieved and at peace right now because I know I'll
be going to a situation where I feel wanted,'' Young, 32, said.
``There was too much finger-pointing going on in our locker room,
and it wasn't only the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Malone was great to me over there, but I think he has a
lot to overcome in doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, he had people working against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was third in the National League with 51 stolen bases,
though he was caught 22 times. He batted .281 with 24 doubles and
41 RBI, but was roundly criticized by scouts for hitting too many
pop flies. Some teammates quietly questioned Young as well,
wondering why he didn't work more on his defense in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a bad relationship with Eric,'' Johnson said.
``He played the first half of the season hurt, but after he was
healthy he played well. One of the things we wanted to do was get
more balance, and we started doing that (with Shawn Green) and get
bullpen help. And Terry Adams is still young, and he can be a good
set-up guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading Young has been a major point of emphasis since last
offseason. But the Angels, Colorado Rockies and St. Louis Cardinals
each shunned a possible trade because of Young's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were willing to take on Young's salary to fill holes.
General manager Ed Lynch, whose job is on the line, came to the
winter meetings looking for a No. 2 or No.3 starter and a second
baseman/leadoff hitter. Both gaps were filled with this move.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Young reunited with former Rockies manager Don
Baylor, but also with former infield instructor Gene Glynn, who
Young credits with helping his fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings us something this club needed with a leadoff hitter,
one with speed,'' Baylor said. ``Fifty-two stolen bases is probably
more than our entire club had last season. Valdes, a quality young
starting pitcher was one of our objectives this year.''

GRIFFEY'S REVENGE? STAYING, WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now is a good time for all citizens of Marinerville to
start thinking World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the Mariners have John Olerud, Edgar Martinez and
Alex Rodriguez _ three former batting champs _ anchoring their
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mariners have Ken Griffey Jr. _ Player of the Decade,
All-Century Team selection, Seattle's own ... still.
</P>
<P>
   Championship teams are built for one-year crusades these days.
Why not try and win the 2000 World Series without a care as to what
value you get in a timely, sensible trade of the best player of his
generation?
</P>
<P>
   Why not the Mariners?
</P>
<P>
   Why not consider Griffey sticking it out by sticking it to the
M's as a golden opportunity for Marinerville to exult in one year
of glory?
</P>
<P>
   A-Rod. Griffey. Martinez. Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   Right. Left. Right. Left.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner March ... all the way to October.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is eating yourself alive with anger,
frustration, boredom and assorted other feelings about why the
Mariners and Griffey can't part company in a timely and fruitful
manner, like we had all hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, through his good-guy agent Brian Goldberg, Griffey
announced that unless the Mariners can work a deal with the Reds _
the only team to which Griffey is now willing to accept a trade _
Griffey will be back in Seattle for the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the scenario anyone had hoped for, although the
potential for such back-firing was in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last season when Griffey vowed that his status as a
10-year veteran with five years of service with one team let him
hold the ultimate hammer?
</P>
<P>
   For a man who thrives on trying to control a very uncontrollable
and, at times, overwhelming circus surrounding a big-time sports
star, Griffey takes great comfort in knowing that ultimately, at
least in this deal, his grip is tightest on the hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mariners are beginning to feel it coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hard line by Griffey two months before the start of
spring training?
</P>
<P>
   Because Griffey keeps reading newspaper stories that quote new
general manager Pat Gillick saying Griffey changes his mind as
often and with the same inexplicable fluidity as the way sand dunes
shift shape.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Gillick was not briefed on how to do business with
Junior _ the politics and poetics of what you should and should not
say. So that would be an error on Mr. Gillick.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to committing the sin of inadvertently insulting
Griffey, Griffey believes the Mariners have betrayed his word on
what teams to which he would be willing to consider a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey gave the Mariners a list, but instead of sticking to the
list, Gillick went back to Goldberg and Griffey with deals from
teams not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   This would be another way of testing Griffey's patience _
another no-no.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Griffey narrowed his focus to the Reds, because
no other teams he was interested in were biting. But the Mariners
have refused to make a deal with the Reds, all because of a guy
name Pokey Reese, whom the M's insist on getting in any deal.
</P>
<P>
   So Griffey is so frustrated with the Mariners that he is
apparently more than prepared to exact his most delicious revenge.
His plan?
</P>
<P>
   He will come back to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He will play hard _ harder than he did last August and September
when the Mariners depleted the team around him by trading David
Segui and Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   He will hit homers and win a Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   He will produce one of his best seasons ever.
</P>
<P>
   He may even help take the Mariners to the postseason, because
with Griffey, Olerud and A-Rod (or whoever they get for A-Rod), the
M's will be the team to beat in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   And after all this, Griffey will walk away from Seattle after
next season saying: ``I told you so. You should have traded me to
the Reds, like I wanted, when you had a chance to get something in
return.''
</P>
<P>
   What's odd about all this is that the Mariners said they learned
everything they needed to know about handling a superstar
free-agent-to-be who wants out of Seattle. One season with a sullen
and suffering Randy Johnson was all the Mariners needed to declare
they would move expeditiously the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   So, never again. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe wrong _ enough to lead the faithful but restless
citizens of Marinerville to serious worrying and hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you take the opposite approach.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you say that with Griffey, who will be out to prove he is
no Randy Johnson, the Mariners are a pretty darn good club _ even
for just one year. Sometimes, one year of glory is all you get
anyway, so why not visualize World Series?
</P>
<P>
   Why not choose sanity over insanity, which is the only place all
this Griffey stuff leads you anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Junior. You hold the hammer and the key. The world
will be watching.

DODGERS TRADE ALL PART OF BIG PUZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Industry folks _ managers, general managers,
scouts and everyone else _ were ripping the Los Angeles Dodgers for
whacking payroll and getting one major-league arm for a gifted
starting pitcher and a starting second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, that seems right. Saturday's trade that sent
right-hander Ismael Valdes and Eric Young to the Chicago Cubs for
middle reliever Terry Adams leaves the Dodgers with holes ... and
questions about how to fill those voids. But it had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Tangibly, the Dodgers didn't get better.
</P>
<P>
   But tangibles related to a disastrous 1999, mainly because the
intangibles were lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Two problems the Dodgers had was an ongoing feud between Young
and Dodgers manager Davey Johnson after Johnson tried to bench
Young in July. It blasted the clubhouse and caused rift after rift
in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, for all his talent, had his moxie questioned publicly by
the pitching coach and privately by some teammates. True, he's 26,
and the market is starving for pitching, but it just shows the cost
the Dodgers had to pay to crawl out from the burden of Young's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a deal that can be judged today or tomorrow, but
rather when the Dodgers' wheelin' and dealin' ends.
</P>
<P>
   Adams offers help in the bullpen, which the Dodgers need, but
moving Young's $9 million of contract creates other options, and
what the Dodgers do with those options is the significant part of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're positioning ourselves to do some other things,'' said
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone. ``We're moving forward in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   That process, of course, will be slowed by the Adrian Beltre
situation. The Dodgers cleared money to sign low- to medium-impact
free agents, but Malone and Dodgers managing general partner Robert
Daly said they would most likely wait until Beltre's case is
settled before making another move.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's impending status also is important in this deal.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball rules Beltre a free agent, the Dodgers would like
the opportunity to re-sign him. Baseball could rule against the
Dodgers re-signing Beltre. But if that happens the players' union
would likely file a grievance to get the Dodgers involved in a
bidding war that could net Beltre $50 million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   By moving Young's salary, the Dodgers positioned themselves to
be part of the bidding, if allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we finish the (winter) meetings, we'll sit down and talk
to free agents,'' Daly said. ``We need to know what happens with
the Beltre situation. We may make some offers to free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it means the Dodgers can begin lining up potential free
agents to fill the void of a leadoff hitter, second baseman, bench
depth and bullpen help, particularly a hard-throwing lefty.
</P>
<P>
   One option is Terry Shumpert, but a source said the Dodgers
won't sign him because they'd have to give Colorado a draft pick to
get him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also talked to Shawon Dunston's representatives.
He's being courted by the Mets, St. Louis, Toronto, Cleveland and
the Dodgers, and something could happen late next week, a source
said. Dunston is willing to sign a one-year deal just to play every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rockies infielder Kurt Abbott also remains a possible
option.
</P>
<P>
   The trade of Valdes also means Darren Dreifort's status is
clear. Though manager Davey Johnson hypothesized about using
Dreifort in the bullpen, he's now inked into the rotation while
Jeff Williams, Mike Judd and Eric Gagne, by far the leading
candidate, duel for a starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Daly admitted to talking to former Dodgers pitcher Orel
Hershiser about returning to his first team. But given the Dodgers'
current economic state, Daly said it's unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to Hershiser, but he's on a different time table
than we're on,'' Daly said. ``He'll probably sign somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly also said his ``gut feeling'' also was that lefty Arthur
Rhodes couldn't be had by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are few because the free-agent class is weak.
But, because of Daly's mandate to move payroll, even the few,
nondescript free-agent possibilities didn't exist when the winter
meetings began here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they do.

REDS OR NOTHING FOR GRIFFEY

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Griffey Jr. will return to the Mariners
next season unless the Cincinnati Reds resume trade talks for the
star center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Brian Goldberg confirmed Sunday that Griffey, who has veto
power over trades, has narrowed his list to one team, the Reds.
With Cincinnati emphatically withdrawing from talks on Saturday,
the Mariners have no team to which they can deal him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason Junior's list has narrowed really is because
the Mariners are pursuing us constantly about teams and situations
not on the original list,'' Goldberg said. ``(Griffey) doesn't like
the misleading and the game-playing, so he decided to shut it down.
The last two weeks, the Mariners have known their only option was
Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners general manager Pat Gillick continues to talk to teams
about Griffey, who told the Mariners last month that he did not
want to re-sign with them, effectively requesting a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at the winter meetings here Friday night, Gillick
has talked with five teams, and he received offers from at least
two. The M's met with the New York Mets about Griffey last night.
</P>
<P>
   But for those talks to mean anything, Griffey has to change his
mind and approve a deal to a team other than the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to change his mind quite often,'' Gillick said. ``So
I think there's a possible chance he'll change his mind (again).''
</P>
<P>
   Through Goldberg, Griffey declined comment. But he talked Sunday
to friend and former teammate Harold Reynolds, an ESPN analyst, and
Reynolds stressed that Griffey controls the situation. Because he
has 10 years in the majors and the past five with the same team,
Griffey must approve a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior's 10 and 5,'' Reynolds said. ``If the only place he
wants to go to is Cincinnati, then who's to say Cincinnati won't
sign him next year? Big deal; let's not forget who's got the power.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to get in a war, they're going to lose and get
two draft picks. He's got too much power in this, and that's the
right of a player. I call him the silent assassin. Everyone's
shooting all these big bullets, and he's saying, `You know what?
I've got my finger on the button that counts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' ``bullets'' analogy was in reference to the
characterization of Griffey as a person who constantly changes his
mind. Even so, the main motivation for Griffey's Reds-only stance
is the fact that the Mariners talked trade with teams he would not
play for.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners started doing that sometime after the GM meetings
in mid-November, when they were unable to make a deal with
Griffey's preferred clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has long said he would never play for the New York
Yankees _ who may have made an offer _ and has no interest in
resurrecting the Pittsburgh Pirates in the same manner he helped
build the Mariners franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ticks me off, as much as it does Junior, that they had the
audacity to try to trade him to the Pirates,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners do not want to lose Griffey to free agency after
next season and receive only compensatory draft picks. They also
want to avoid a repeat of 1998, when Randy Johnson wanted out and
the distraction helped ruin the Mariners' season.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he believed Griffey would respond to playing out
a lame-duck season in Seattle, Gillick said he was confident
Griffey would handle it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``For certain players, if there's a distraction off the field,
once they cross the white lines they're professional and they have
a certain pride and a certain passion for the game _ and I think he
has that,'' Gillick said. ``There might be times that, off the
field, he might not be happy to be with the Mariners. But I think
on the field he'll be a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   After the All-Star break last year, with the Mariners depleted
and out of contention, Griffey batted .255 and appeared to play
without his usual joy. He was often irritable on the topic of his
future, which he raised periodically without being prompted.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey could use the controversy over his future as
motivation during a farewell season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is if he goes back to Seattle, the media will allow
him to concentrate on his job,'' Goldberg said. ``I don't worry
about Junior and I don't worry about the Mariners. Those two
parties are fine with each other, and if people think otherwise,
they're just dead wrong. I can only hope that outside influences
such as the media will not create the circus atmosphere they did
two years ago with Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said that if Griffey and Goldberg decided to re-open
negotiations on a contract extension, he would take that request to
ownership. But there probably will be no need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never say never,'' Goldberg said. ``(But) I sincerely
doubt it. I don't want to ever mislead anybody, but I sincerely
doubt it. It's not a knock on anything about Seattle. People should
not forget that most of the reasons Junior wanted to play in
Cincinnati were the same reasons why John Olerud came to Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gillick did not appear totally convinced the Reds
wouldn't re-enter trade talks, Goldberg has reason to speak of
Cincinnati in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of it,'' Bowden reiterated to Cincinnati reporters
Sunday. ``There will be no further discussions. The issue is behind
us. We are going forward with the team we have.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, most likely, are the Mariners, who probably will have
Griffey for one more year.
</P>
<P>
   FREE AGENT TALKS: The Mariners made their first offer to
Japanese closer Kazuhiro Sasaki Sunday, which could be an
indication they believe Bowden when he said trade talks are off
with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki, the all-time saves leader in Japan, will probably sign
somewhere by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``All offers are in the eye of the beholder,'' agent Tony
Attanasio said of the Sasaki offer. ``I'm sure they viewed it as
very reasonable, and I viewed it as a very reasonable first
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Attanasio also represents former Texas infielder/outfielder Mark
McLemore, and the clubs traded proposals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The M's also met with the agent for former Anaheim starter Chuck
Finley Sunday. Seattle is one of seven teams bidding for Finley,
according to agent Tim Shannon; Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, both
New York teams and Texas are the others.
</P>
<P>
   Finley and Shannon are seeking a three-year deal, possibly for
$27-$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   TRAINERS HONORED: Mariners trainers Rick Griffin and Tom Newberg
were named the Major League Baseball's outstanding trainers for
1999 by the Professional Baseball Athletic Society.

DODGERS MIGHT HAVE TO PAY MORE TO KEEP KARROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Eric Karros wants to stay with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, but when Todd Zeile signed a three-year, $18 million
contract with the New York Mets late Saturday night, the cost to
keep him most likely has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Moorad, the agent for Karros, is expected to meet with the
Dodgers before spring training to discuss an extension, and no
doubt Zeile's contract will come up.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, a third baseman by nature, will play first for the Mets
and make $6 million per year. Karros is slated to make $5 million
in 2000, but his numbers last year and over the past five years and
over his career are much better than Zeile's numbers. And at 32,
Karros is two years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile batted .293 with 41 doubles, 24 homers and 98 RBI last
season with Texas. Karros hit .304 with 40 doubles, 34 homers and
112 RBI last year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Zeile hit .269 and averaged 29
doubles, 23 homers and 87 RBI, while Karros hit .284 and averaged
29 doubles, 31 homers and 104 RBI. Karros played one more game over
the span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Eric has made it clear his preference is to remain in
L.A. for the rest of his career,'' Moorad said. ``At some
appropriate time in the future, I would expect to sit down with
(Dodgers managing general partner, chairman and CEO) Bob Daly and
(general manager) Kevin Malone to discuss his future. At that time
the contracts (of comparable players) I'm sure will be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort surgery: Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort had
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Dec. 2 but is expected to be
ready for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in for a normal check-up and said it was giving him a
little bit of a problem,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone. ``Even if this was the season, he'd be ready in a couple of
weeks so it's nothing major, nothing that's going to impact his
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was done by Dodgers team physician Dr. Ralph
Gambardella. It was done after Dreifort came to Los Angeles for an
annual physical but complained about stiffness in the knee.
Dreifort, 27, was 13-13 with a 4.79 ERA last season.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: One piece of news that came out of last year's
winter meetings was Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth's demand
to be traded through Moorad, his representative. No such demand is
coming out of these meetings. ``Todd's preference is to have a
chance to play every day,'' Moorad said, but his role will be
discussed at a later date.... As expected, the Dodgers promoted
Stan Johnston to head athletic trainer and added Matt Wilson as
assistant athletic trainer.

HEALTHY MAMIIT REIGNS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC ERWIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ He began 1999 with a bang, beating Andre
Agassi and reaching the Sybase Open final. He ended it with
another, beating Alex O'Brien 7-5, 6-3 on Sunday to defend his
title at the drkoop.com Tennis Championships of Burbank at the
Burbank Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Cecil Mamiit, the 1997 NCAA champion while at USC
who is now ranked No. 105 in the world, battled himself and his
knee. It was not a battle he frequently won.
</P>
<P>
   Hampered by nagging injuries throughout the year, Mamiit
struggled to regain the form he showed at Burbank last year and
early this year in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been real up and down,'' said Mamiit, who won $7,200. ``I
was playing great at the beginning of the year, then I kind of got
injured. It's been nagging injuries, so I'd do well for awhile then
not so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit said he finally started feeling good again around the
U.S. Open, and he won his first-round match in New York. Now, he's
finally back to full-strength, and it showed against O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Although O'Brien was in control through much of the first set,
Mamiit showed a few glimpses his knee was sound, hustling for balls
O'Brien believed he had put away. Two times, Mamiit chased them
down and flicked backhand winners past a stunned O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relaxed, and you can't relax against a guy as fast as he
is,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Brien closed out his early service games with ease
while Mamiit struggled just to hold. O'Brien broke to take a 5-4
lead but seemed to tense up when serving for the set. He mis-hit a
forehand volley three inches long, then double-faulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I was serving for the first set, and I just played
a bad game and let him back into the match,'' said O'Brien, ranked
No.160 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit said he started feeling more comfortable against
O'Brien's serve, and he certainly appreciated the unforced errors.
Down love-40, O'Brien hit two big serves to make it 30-40, but
Mamitt hit a crisp return on the next point to earn the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mix,'' Mamiit said. ``I started getting a rhythm.
Things change so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit held to go up 6-5, then broke O'Brien again to win the
set _ but not without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   On his serve, O'Brien hit a clean winner down the line at 15-15,
but the chair umpire overruled and called it wide. Instead of
taking command of the game, O'Brien got flustered and Mamiit broke
to win the first set.
</P>
<P>
   Another service break at the beginning of the second set gave
Mamiit a quick 3-0 lead, and he cruised from there.
</P>
<P>
   After that, O'Brien, one of the top doubles players in the world
who won the U.S. Open and the world doubles championship this year,
questioned several line calls and wasn't shy about arguing with the
umpire. He earned two code violations costing him a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get bad calls _ that's just part of the game,'' he
said. ``But they were all going against me for awhile there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit said he just tried to ignore the argument delays and
concentrate on his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to be quiet,'' the Eagle Rock native said. ``Last
year I was really rowdy, dancing around and everything. I just
wanted to keep my cool.''
</P>
<P>
   And he'd like to keep his momentum going into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to getting ready for the Australian
Open,'' Mamiit said. ``And staying healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit wasn't able to pull off a sweep, however, as he and
partner Scott Humphries fell to brothers _ and former Camarillo
High standouts _ Bob and Mike Bryan 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 6-1 in the
doubles final.

JACKSON NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT RICE'S SHOOTING SLUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An upper respiratory infection knocked Glen Rice
out of Sunday night's game. It's still unclear what illness has
sapped him of his jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers' purported shooting ace is making just
41.9 percent of his field-goal attempts and has hit two fewer
3-pointers than Derek Fisher. And he's only been getting worse of
late.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five games, Rice has shot 35.2 percent from the
field and is 4 for 16 from 3-point range. That includes a 5 for 15
performance Saturday at Vancouver, where he was 0 for 3 behind the
arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had three shots that could have stayed in as well
as came out,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``so that makes a big
difference in a shooter in a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson seemed unconcerned about Rice's jumper, but can't claim
the same about his troubles taking it to the rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not finishing at the hoop on drives as well as he can,
although he dunked one the other day that showed he can get to that
place to finish if he gathers himself,'' Jackson said. ``His
shooting percentage has not been good and he's the first one to
admit it, but he finds a way to get the scoring done and help us
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has done that by getting to the foul line, where he's gone
33 for 36 over the last five games while averaging 17.0 points.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shooting slump started in November, Rice also has had
to adjust to getting fewer opportunities with Kobe Bryant back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take time,'' Jackson said. ``I just think rhythm-wise
it's something he's got to work with, find out where the shots are
going to come from so he's ready and prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Devean George took Rice's place in the lineup and made
his first NBA start. Jackson could have used former starter Rick
Fox but chose to keep his rotation intact.
</P>
<P>
   His Airness arrives: Michael Jordan attended Sunday night's game
as a guest of Jerry Buss and watched from the Lakers owner's luxury
suite, next to executive vice president Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan powwowed with Jackson behind closed doors before tipoff
but did not make himself available to reporters camped outside the
coach's dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Ron Harper, hampered by a badly bruised left
quadriceps suffered Saturday when Grizzlies center Bryant Reeves
kneed him, was able to start Sunday's game despite the lingering
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore,'' he said. ``There's a nice knot in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat watch: Shaquille O'Neal has taken over the NBA scoring
lead, thanks to the long layoff of Philadelphia 76ers star Allen
Iverson. Iverson, out injured most of the month, no longer has
played the minimum number of games to qualify for the scoring lead.
O'Neal slid into the lead with 28.3 points per game.

GREEN HAPPY TO BE WITH DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shawn Green, one of the new Los Angeles Dodgers
darlings, sees his team change before his eyes, yet remains
convinced it's for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing on a winning team, that's why I came here,'' Green
said Sunday while appearing at the West Valley Community Jewish
Center. ``I know they had problems last year, but a change here and
a change there and it's a totally different team. It's not
far-fetched to go to the championship. The main pieces are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, making one of his first public appearances since signing
a six-year $84 million deal, clearly is happy to be here and
obviously wants the honeymoon to continue.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't speak at the ceremony to open the new Ferne Milken
Sports Complex, leaving that to Dodgers vice president Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (new Dodgers owner) Bob Daly, where we were getting ready
to sign Shawn, Bob Daly went to Shawn and said, `Shawn, do you want
to be a Dodger?''' Lasorda said. ``Shawn said, `Ever since I was 6
years old.'''
</P>
<P>
   Green later explained he rooted for the Dodgers in 1988 and the
Angels two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he has to perform if he wants the World Series
ring he seeks and didn't come close to in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He's aware the Dodgers want him for his left-hand bat and isn't
worried he hasn't faced National League pitchers. He reminds others
that John Olerud and Robin Ventura had successful years after
leaving the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup looks pretty solid in the middle of the order,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, he can only watch the personnel changes while
waiting for spring training to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to meeting my new teammates,'' he said,
``whoever they are.''

FEW FANS, BIG WINS FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the easiest ticket in town.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1,000 fans showed up last week when the Cal State
Northridge men's basketball team easily beat Oral Roberts. The
Matadors were playing at home for the first time since beating
Fresno State on Nov.30. Only a few hundred saw the tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, only 183 fans came to see the CSUN women, last
season's Big Sky Conference champion, roll to an 26-point win over
UC Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN athletic director Dick Dull isn't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of apathy, from the (San Fernando Valley) to
the student community, as well,'' Dull said. ``Our basketball
programs are best-kept secrets. People need to be alerted to the
fact there is quality Division I basketball being played here.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's basketball team, which had another quality road win
Saturday night, 79-77 at Oregon, doesn't play at home again until
Dec.28. The Matadors were dead last in home attendance in the Big
Sky last year, averaging 823 fans per game. The women also were
last, averaging only 379 in an arena which seats 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find a way to generate enthusiasm,'' Dull said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on: Brooke Michelle resigned as the athletic department's
director of marketing and promotions last month to take a marketing
position with WinStar Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle is the fourth high-ranking department employee to leave
this year, following Brian Swanson (assistant athletic
director/external affairs), Michael Rehm (assistant athletic
director/development) and Kathy Heitzman (director of compliance).
</P>
<P>
   Dull combined Swanson and Rehm's positions _ and salaries _ to
attract experienced candidates for the crucial task of fund-raising
for the department. He said the job will be filled in the next
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be somebody that has the ability to interact
with the (university's) development office,'' said Dull, who added
his preferred priorities for the new person should be ``developing
a plan and doing research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect the person to be out on the street the first
day, asking for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeleton crew: The new director of compliance will be announced
this week, as early as today. Tom Shannon, the athletic
department's faculty representative, has been in charge of
compliance since Heitzman left last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon hasn't been the only employee taking on more work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here is doing more than one job,'' Dull said. ``It's
extended everybody. It's not been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the winners are ...: Michael Preis, a senior men's soccer
player, and junior women's swimmer Lisa Andrade were selected as
CSUN's athletes of the month for November.
</P>
<P>
   Preis, a forward, scored two goals, his 10th and 11th of the
season in the season finale, against Loyola Marymount on Nov.7. He
finished sixth on the school's career chart for goals (35), fifth
in assists (27) and sixth in points (97).
</P>
<P>
   Andrade, a transfer from Riverside Community College, went
undefeated in November and won the 100 and 200 breaststrokes at the
Malibu Invitational on Nov. 19-20.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult circumstances: Tara Harrington, an assistant women's
basketball coach at CSUN last season who took a similar position at
Montana State in the summer, was elevated to the Bobcats' top
assistant job last week.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, a Stanford graduate, was hired at Northridge 1{
years ago by then-head coach Michael Abraham, who resigned last
year after he was arrested for cocaine trafficking. Harrington's
new boss, MSU head coach Tracey Sheehan, was fired in November for
alleged NCAA violations.

for Sunday, Dec. 12, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Chechnya has become the no
man's land in the fight for human rights. As Russia demolishes the
Chechen capital of Grozny, what is the world to make of the new
doctrine it thought was emerging _ a doctrine that seemed, after
Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor, to be empowering the bulk of the
world to intervene in countries that abused their own citizens? Now
comes the harshest test of that doctrine: Russia, a humbled
superpower desperate to hold together its very territory, not to
mention its national pride, in the face of international
condemnation of its methods. By Craig R. Whitney. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-MAVERICK-REVIEW (Washington) _ The deluge of hype about
the rise of Sen. John McCain overshadows a fundamental question:
Can a politician win the Republican nomination by bashing the
Republican Party? In the history of the Republican Party, far more
so than in the Democratic Party, the presidential nominee has
rarely been an insurgent; it is almost always the man with the most
institutional support. McCain has not only taken stands that are
unpopular within the GOP; he is actively disliked by many within
the party and groups aligned with it. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved
in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is the legal fight against guns
is a sequel to the tobacco war _ a struggle against products that
kill, and against industries that have dodged or defeated change in
Congress? As with the anti-tobacco campaign, the threat of ruinous
monetary awards is supposed to force gun manufacturers to change
their practices. But the parallels between the two may be
overdrawn. Unlike tobacco, which is harmful when used as intended,
guns do have certain legitimate and safe uses, and in order for the
manufacturer's product to harm someone, a third party is usually
involved. Thus, the gun lawsuits appear to be weaker than the
anti-tobacco claims. By Barry Meier. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOLS-CHEATING-REVIEW (Undated) _ A rash of systematic
cheating on school tests, most notably uncovered in New York and
Texas, has spread at the same time that superintendents and
politicians across the U.S. have set tough new test-score targets
for their school systems. The `standards' revolution is tying
promotion and graduation of students and even cash bonuses for
everyone from principals to cafeteria workers to measurable
achievement. Does this make the temptation to cheat even greater
than it would be otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   HACKERS-IMAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The computer hacker, a uniquely
modern character in film, television and theater, has undergone a
radical transformation since its birth in the early 1980s. Gone is
the plaid-shirted, pizza-stained nerd who guzzles soda while
fumbling through cyberspace. Today's hacker characters are
portrayed wearing black leather, trench coats, form-fitting vests
and pants, tinted sunglasses .. and they're usually villains. By
Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   COLDS-CAUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this age of modern science,
we're supposed to know that colds and flu are caused by viruses.
The germ theory may appeal to the intellect, but don't we know in
our hearts that no good can come from a bare head, wet feet or
wearing an inadequately warm coat? What about time-honored scourges
like sudden warm spells during the winter, failing to change out of
wet clothes or going back and forth between sweltering heat and
frigid air conditioning? By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   MIRANDA-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Supreme Court's 1966
Miranda ruling, which guarantees certain rights for criminal
suspects, was initially opposed by much of the law enforcement
community. But most detectives have long since accepted it and
incorporated it into their routines. And in a surprising number of
instances, suspects still make self-incriminating statements even
after being told they have the right to remain silent. By Juan
Forero.
</P>
<P>
   XMAS-LIVESTOCK-REVIEW (Undated) _ One of the world's oddest
holiday catalogs must surely be that of Heifer Project
International. Since 1944, the nonprofit charity has shipped
livestock to poverty-stricken areas all over the world. The Heifer
Project's holiday gift program, begun about 10 years ago, seems
rather like those adopt-an-adorable-Third-World-urchin ads you see
in magazines. By Tom Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   BULLY-PREVENTION-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Educators are
redoubling efforts to discourage student aggression from an early
age. And they are turning to tools like `Quit It! A Teacher's Guide
on Teasing and Bullying for Use with Students in Grades K-3.'
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-SYRIA-REVIEW (Lebanon) _ Syrian President Hafez has a
record of ruthlessness, but he has also ruled with finesse and
brought about three decades of domestic stability. Little wonder,
then, that he has long been seen as the Arab neighbor with whom
Israel most wants to make peace. More than any of his Arab
counterparts, Assad is seen as a man who understands both power and
survival. And he has kept what few bargains he has struck with
Israel. So he is viewed as someone who, if he made a deal, would
make one that sticks. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-CHILD-REVIEW (Miami) _ Playing geopolitics with a tiny
prop: a look at the plight of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and the
U.S.-Cuban tensions it has ignited. By Rick Bragg.

   MIDEAST-SYRIA-REVIEW (Lebanon) _ Syrian President Hafez has a
record of ruthlessness, but he has also ruled with finesse and
brought about three decades of domestic stability. Little wonder,
then, that he has long been seen as the Arab neighbor with whom
Israel most wants to make peace. More than any of his Arab
counterparts, Assad is seen as a man who understands both power and
survival. And he has kept what few bargains he has struck with
Israel. So he is viewed as someone who, if he made a deal, would
make one that sticks. By Douglas Jehl.

   &UR; THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND &LR;  By Giles Foden. Vintage
International, $13. Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor in
the employ of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, is anything but
heroic: He's weak, indecisive and easily manipulated. ``Therein
lies the admirable risk'' of this ambitious first novel, Michael
Upchurch wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year, and
despite the doctor's moral failings he emerges as an oddly
sympathetic protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT HOME WITH THE MARQUIS DE SADE: A Life &LR;  By Francine du
Plessix Gray. Penguin, $14.95. Talk about standing by your man:
Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil de Sade, the wife of the legendary
18th-century sexual rogue, persevered through sex scandals, police
raids and prison terms (the marquis spent 15 of the 27 years they
were married in prison or on the run). In fact he might never have
written a word had it not been for her saintly servitude, according
to this biography, which effectively defangs Sade while suggesting
that perhaps a bit of the scoundrel's unfettered narcissism lurks
deep in every psyche. The result is a ``bold, imaginative'' book,
Emily Eakin wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TALE OF THE 1002ND NIGHT &LR;  By Joseph Roth. Picador USA, $14.
The Austrian writer's final work of fiction, published in 1939, is
an erotic fairy tale set in Hapsburg Vienna, featuring the shah of
Persia and a string of pearls that dooms everyone who gets near it.
Last year the reviewer Iain Bamforth praised Roth's ``wonderful
style ... for the way it plunges us into the swim of time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIBLE AS IT WAS &LR;  By James L. Kugel. Belknap/Harvard
University, $19.95. The author draws on diverse sources to explain
how the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, was understood by
ancient peoples and how the interpretations of early scholars
altered our perceptions of biblical teachings. In 1997, Phyllis
Trible called this a ``fascinating study'' handled ``with erudition
and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE HIDDEN JESUS: A NEW LIFE &LR; , by Donald Spoto (St. Martin's
Griffin, $14.95), a theologian (and celebrity biographer) examines
the life of Jesus of Nazareth and argues that his true vision
remains alive and active today. The result is ``a personal
statement of faith'' that ``thoughtfully challenges some of
Christianity's traditions,'' Alexandra Hall wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JESUS THROUGH THE CENTURIES: His Place in the History of
Culture &LR; , by Jaroslav Pelikan (Yale University, $13.95), is a
celebratory study of Jesus' impact on Western art, thought and
culture over the last 2,000 years. ``Believers and skeptics alike
will find it a sweeping visual and conceptual panorama,'' John
Koenig wrote in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE SHE WENT: Stories &LR;  By Kate Walbert. Penguin, $12.95. In
these 14 linked tales, a lonely company wife moves from place to
place, a journey echoed years later by her adult daughter, who
travels the world in search of fulfillment. ``Their stories are
small, elegiac and inconclusive,'' Molly Giles wrote in 1998.
```Where She Went' contains many quick flashes of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA &LR;  By Richard Hughes. New York Review,
$12.95. This dreamlike 1929 novel explores the tangled fates of a
group of children en route from the West Indies to England and the
ragtag crew of pirates that reluctantly captures them. ``There is
an air of fantastic credibility about this odyssey,'' The New York
Times Book Review wrote, and it is a fascinating study in child
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DOCTOR STORIES &LR;  By Richard Selzer. Picador USA, $14. These
tales by a former surgeon, culled from three decades of short
fiction, explore lives on both ends of the scalpel and are
carefully imbued with the language of sickness. ``Selzer's fiction
is refreshingly old-fashioned: His prose is formal, his ironies
straightforward,'' Tobin Harshaw wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DOSSIER: The Secret History of Armand Hammer &LR;  By Edward Jay
Epstein. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95. The larger-than-life oil magnate
(1898-1990), who courted world leaders from Lenin to George Bush,
emerges in this well-researched biography as ``a morbidly
fascinating compound of ambition, greed, unscrupulousness and power
hunger,'' Joseph E. Persico wrote in 1996. ``It is hard to imagine
a sharper picture of how a tycoon is both born and made.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OH, JACKIE &LR;  By Maudy Benz. Berkley, $12.95. The 15-year-old
narrator of this first novel, left by her parents to spend the
summer of 1963 with her wealthy cousins in Michigan, tries to
imagine what her idol, Jackie Kennedy, would do to escape the
clutches of her lecherous uncle. Benz tells the story ``with
tenderness and impressive control,'' Sally Eckhoff wrote in The New
York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BREAKING NEWS &LR;  By Robert MacNeil. Harvest/Harcourt, $13. This
lively novel by the former PBS news anchor centers on a 60-ish
network anchorman grappling with both a life crisis and a career
crisis. The result is ``a provocative cri de coeur aimed at what
one character calls `information/entertainment television,''' Eric
Alterman wrote in 1998.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Dec. 4 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

CHEATING ON TESTS: THE HIGHER THE STAKES, THE GREATER THE
TEMPTATION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Last week, investigators in New York City said they had
uncovered the most widespread public-school cheating scandal in the
nation, encompassing 32 schools, dozens of teachers and two
principals. The methods _ from teachers using palm cards to
overzealous test coaching _ were so varied and so widespread that
they might only be the tip of the iceberg, investigators contended.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same sort of thing occurred recently in Texas, where
school officials and politicians like Gov. George W. Bush were
brandishing the results of a standardized test to claim victory
over ignorance. There, too, a cheating scandal has erupted which
calls some of the achievement into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While officials trumpet higher scores, it also appears that an
old staple of education is gaining ground: cheating. And it is not
just students who are the culprits, but adults: the teachers,
principals, superintendents and other administrators charged with
watching over them.
</P>
<P>
   This rash of dishonesty has spread at the same time that
superintendents and politicians across the country have set tough
new test-score targets for their school systems. A ``standards''
revolution is sweeping through the classroom, tying promotion and
graduation of students and even cash bonuses for everyone from
principals to cafeteria workers to measurable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The current scandals have emboldened critics who question the
validity of standardized testing, in particular high-stakes,
high-pressure tests tied to promotion and graduation. And they have
sharpened the argument over whether it is possible to have
accountability without some form of testing.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum are organizations like Fair Test,
based in Boston, a group that monitors testing abuses and has been
a staunch critic of the testing industry. They see the new
accountability measures _ from publishing test scores in local
newspapers to state takeovers of failing schools _ as a way of
encouraging abuses. ``It's sort of like the Soviet Union; everybody
ends up lying,'' said Monty Neill, executive director of Fair Test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-test groups oppose even the newest tests, which require
children to organize their ideas into a coherent essay and, in
math, ask them to explain their reasoning, not just present
answers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence are educators and scholars like
Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who
passionately defends testing. ``To say that tests create cheating
is wrong,'' Dr. Ravitch said. ``What creates cheating is people who
cheat. If we spent as much time teaching kids as showing them the
answer, they might have learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of standards, tests and stark consequences for
failing to meet them _ like withholding high school diplomas _ say
that for too long, an officially sanctioned system of low
expectations has consigned many poor and disadvantaged children to
a second-class education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about how hard it is to raise test scores, it
sounds like you are defending current practice,'' says Seymour
Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation in New
York City. New tests that require 9-year-olds to write essays with
correct spelling, grammar and punctuation are a far cry from the
multiple choice bubbles of the past, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea that kids should be able to find a main idea;
that they should know how to find supporting details; how to draw
an inference, vocabulary,'' Fliegel said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is evidence that testing has always encouraged
cheating, at least where the stakes were high enough.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Haney, a professor at the Center for the Study of Testing
at Boston College, points out that the current debate is following
a pattern established in 19th century England. A program called
``Payment by Results'' reigned in English and Welsh elementary
schools from 1862 to 1897. Every student was examined annually by a
royal inspector, and teachers received government grants if their
students performed well. Among the results were that teachers
school-hopped, looking for positions that would pay better.
</P>
<P>
   There were also complaints that teachers tried to get copies of
arithmetic questions used in other schools, and then drilled their
students in them, in the hope of raising test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Test preparation is one of those ethical gray areas, where the
line between what is legitimate and illegitimate may be ill
defined. In fact, many school districts not only sanction test
preparation but spend large portions of their budgets paying for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The public schools have embarked on a new mission _ or at least
begun a new fad. Suddenly, teachers and students are expected to
produce results. But the reality is that real change and real
progress in the schools is hard to produce and takes time. Cheating
may be one of the unintended consequences of the increasing
reliance on standardized tests and the pressure to perform better,
fast.
</P>
<P>
   That is one motivation behind the accusations in New York and
Texas. Last January, the Texas Education Agency sent letters to
Houston and 10 other school districts saying that an analysis of
test results showed that unusually high numbers of wrong answers
had been erased and replaced with correct ones. In April, the
county attorney in Austin charged the city's school district and a
top administrator with test tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials have publicized statistics showing a narrowing
achievement gap between white students, who typically score higher,
and blacks and Hispanics. But in a legal challenge to the tests, an
expert witness has testified that 10th-grade test scores among
black and Hispanic children have been inflated by holding back
those who are failing, so they are not counted in the results.
</P>
<P>
   Even when tests are conducted honestly and scores do go up
sharply, it is often for reasons that have little to do with
improvements in teaching or learning. More commonly, the big jumps
_ what statisticians call statistical outliers _ betray something
more insidious at work: a new magnet program that attracts more
affluent or gifted students, perhaps, or test preparation mania.
Ultimately, standardized tests are probably most useful in
measuring the improvement, or decline, of an educational system
over an extended period of time.

   Anonymous vs. Anonymous, Or Poor Little Rich Girl  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 75 years ago about trying to economize
in his magazine article, ``How to Live on Practically Nothing a
Year.'' A $100-a-month governess offered to work for $40 a month
``and do the baby's washing.'' Patricia Duff, the most recent
ex-wife of the billionaire Ronald Perelman, may be looking for such
a governess. Justice Franklin Weissberg of New York state Supreme
Court rejected her request for as much as $132,000 a month in child
support, ordering Perelman to pay $12,825 a month for the couple's
4-year-old daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In his 22-page decision, the judge, who takes a brown-bag lunch
to court every day and who showed signs of impatience with Ms. Duff
during hearings in September, dismissed Ms. Duff's demands for more
money with words like ``absurd'' and ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed intent on seeing that state child-support
guidelines were not used to redistribute wealth. Perelman's income
ranges from $40 million to $60 million yearly, the judge said,
while Ms. Duff's is about $2.4 million yearly. Her lawyers argued
that having a mere millionaire for a mother would hurt Caleigh
psychologically. ``There is not a shred of evidence in the record
to support these conclusions,'' the judge said. ``There are far
more important things in the life of a young child than private
jets, yachts, obsequious staffs and pandering guests. The reality
is that Caleigh will never suffer a shortage of material
comforts.''

   Peaceful Clash of Symbols &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While decorating a Christmas tree or lighting the candles of the
Hanukkah menorah are joyous activities in most households, many
interfaith couples find December holidays a source of angst.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, couples, especially Christians and Jews, would
forgo one holiday or display all the symbols together. But as the
rate of religious intermarriage increases in America _ today some
50 percent of Jews marry outside their faith, up sharply from
previous decades _ many families have developed an alternative:
religious syncretism, or the blending of two different, dissimilar
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace has responded by producing dual-faith
decorations: tree ornaments painted with menorahs or Kwanzaa
lights; angels with wings, halos and dreidel-print dresses; and
Christmas lights that have Stars of David.
</P>
<P>
   The devout deplore such melding. ``It is a terrible sign of
intellectual and religious confusion,'' says Elliott Abrams, who
wrote ``Faith or Fear: How Jews Can Survive in a Christian America
(Free Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But to many, the ornaments are peacemakers. Susan Greenberg, a
Jew who has two children with a husband who was raised Christian,
says, ``It is our way of carving out our own particular family
tradition.''

   Nuclear Engineer Charged With Stealing Data  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in New Mexico indicted a nuclear engineer
on 59 counts of stealing highly classified nuclear data from secure
computers at the Los Alamos weapons lab where he worked. The
engineer, Wen Ho Lee, whose case has been furiously debated within
the cloistered worlds of counterintelligence, law enforcement and
nuclear energy, was not charged with espionage although
investigators have unsuccessfully tried to determine whether he
passed secrets to China. The crime Lee is charged with is
punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison.

   Lost: Large Spacecraft

   That was NASA's conclusion after the $165 million Mars Polar
Lander failed to signal home. The agency promised a thorough
investigation of the causes and implications behind the
spacecraft's disappearance and a ``major rethinking'' of the
strategy for the entire Mars exploration program. In September the
lander's companion craft, Mars Climate Orbiter, which cost $125
million, was lost as it approached the planet.

   Death and a Bid for Attention
</P>
<P>
   At first, police believed they were looking for two hooded
assailants who tried to gain entry to Edmond Safra's lavish Monte
Carlo penthouse and then set a fire that killed the billionaire
banker and one of his nurses as they huddled for safety in a
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   But now investigators said another of Safra's nurses, Ted Maher,
has confessed to making the whole story up. There never were any
masked men brandishing knives in the predawn hours of Dec. 3. Maher
admitted that he had concocted the story, slashed his own leg and
started the fire himself, so he could be seen as a hero.

   Ruling for Another View
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one years after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., a jury in Memphis, Tenn., held someone
accountable. After an odd four-week trial in a civil case brought
by King's family, the jury found that Loyd Jowers, 73, was liable
for the civil rights leader's wrongful death. The Kings' lawyer,
who once represented James Earl Ray, argued that Jowers acted as
part of a sweeping government and Mafia conspiracy. Jowers, who did
not testify, has claimed to have been a middleman between a
mob-connected grocer and the now-deceased Memphis police officer
who he has named as the gunman.

President Clinton ordered federal agencies to find ways to reduce

each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insuring patient safety is not about fixing blame,'' Clinton

</P>
<P>
   Testifying in front of Congress in 1996, representatives of
Swiss banks said they knew exactly how many dormant Nazi-era
accounts were still on their books: 775. As the controversy over
how these banks handled Jews in particular intensified, the figure
rose to the thousands. Last week, former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker said a three-year audit he supervised put the figure
closer to 54,000. Some banks, he said, issued ``deliberately
misleading statements'' to keep Jews from recovering their assets.

   Seattle's Latest Casualty  &QL;

<P>
   The protests in Seattle may have calmed down since the World
Trade Organization talks ended, but turmoil continues. The police
chief announced his resignation, saying he wanted to
``de-politicize'' investigations into how his force handled
demonstrators. More than 600 people were arrested, and the police

   A 13-year-old boy described by friends as pleasant and friendly
opened fire at his middle school in rural Fort Gibson, Okla.,
injuring five students and leaving investigators baffled.
Prosecutors are expected to file charges, accusing the boy of
shooting his father's 9-millimeter handgun into a crowd of students
waiting outside Fort Gibson Middle School before the morning bell.

   Not All Cell Phones Are Safe Calls  &QL;

<P>
   Two Israeli researchers say they have cracked a cell phone code
that protects private conversations and data transmissions. The
encryption method is part of the Groupe Speciale Mobile, or GSM,
wireless phone standard, the most widely used system in the world.
The researchers' method may make widespread eavesdropping possible.
Most cell phones in America, however, are based on other wireless
technologies, but companies like Pacific Bell and Omnipoint Corp.
use the GSM standard.

   Angering gay rights advocates, Exxon Mobil revoked a policy at
Mobil, which Exxon acquired last month, to offer health benefits to
partners of newly hired gay employees. Though five of six large
companies still do not offer such benefits, the trend, which has
been driven by a tight job market and changing attitudes, has been
to provide them.. Some municipalities also have ordinances that
prevent companies that do not offer the benefits from getting city

   Anonymous vs. Anonymous, Or Poor Little Rich Girl  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 75 years ago about trying to economize
in his magazine article, ``How to Live on Practically Nothing a
Year.'' A $100-a-month governess offered to work for $40 a month
``and do the baby's washing.'' Patricia Duff, the most recent
ex-wife of the billionaire Ronald Perelman, may be looking for such
a governess. Justice Franklin Weissberg of New York state Supreme
Court rejected her request for as much as $132,000 a month in child
support, ordering Perelman to pay $12,825 a month for the couple's
4-year-old daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In his 22-page decision, the judge, who takes a brown-bag lunch
to court every day and who showed signs of impatience with Ms. Duff
during hearings in September, dismissed Ms. Duff's demands for more
money with words like ``absurd'' and ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed intent on seeing that state child-support
guidelines were not used to redistribute wealth. Perelman's income
ranges from $40 million to $60 million yearly, the judge said,
while Ms. Duff's is about $2.4 million yearly. Her lawyers argued
that having a mere millionaire for a mother would hurt Caleigh
psychologically. ``There is not a shred of evidence in the record
to support these conclusions,'' the judge said. ``There are far
more important things in the life of a young child than private
jets, yachts, obsequious staffs and pandering guests. The reality
is that Caleigh will never suffer a shortage of material
comforts.''

   Peaceful Clash of Symbols &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While decorating a Christmas tree or lighting the candles of the
Hanukkah menorah are joyous activities in most households, many
interfaith couples find December holidays a source of angst.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, couples, especially Christians and Jews, would
forgo one holiday or display all the symbols together. But as the
rate of religious intermarriage increases in America _ today some
50 percent of Jews marry outside their faith, up sharply from
previous decades _ many families have developed an alternative:
religious syncretism, or the blending of two different, dissimilar
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace has responded by producing dual-faith
decorations: tree ornaments painted with menorahs or Kwanzaa
lights; angels with wings, halos and dreidel-print dresses; and
Christmas lights that have Stars of David.
</P>
<P>
   The devout deplore such melding. ``It is a terrible sign of
intellectual and religious confusion,'' says Elliott Abrams, who
wrote ``Faith or Fear: How Jews Can Survive in a Christian America
(Free Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But to many, the ornaments are peacemakers. Susan Greenberg, a
Jew who has two children with a husband who was raised Christian,
says, ``It is our way of carving out our own particular family
tradition.''

   Nuclear Engineer Charged With Stealing Data  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in New Mexico indicted a nuclear engineer
on 59 counts of stealing highly classified nuclear data from secure
computers at the Los Alamos weapons lab where he worked. The
engineer, Wen Ho Lee, whose case has been furiously debated within
the cloistered worlds of counterintelligence, law enforcement and
nuclear energy, was not charged with espionage although
investigators have unsuccessfully tried to determine whether he
passed secrets to China. The crime Lee is charged with is
punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison.

   That was NASA's conclusion after the $165 million Mars Polar
Lander failed to signal home. The agency promised a thorough
investigation of the causes and implications behind the
spacecraft's disappearance and a ``major rethinking'' of the
strategy for the entire Mars exploration program. In September the
lander's companion craft, Mars Climate Orbiter, which cost $125
million, was lost as it approached the planet.

   Death and a Bid for Attention

   At first, police believed they were looking for two hooded
assailants who tried to gain entry to Edmond Safra's lavish Monte
Carlo penthouse and then set a fire that killed the billionaire
banker and one of his nurses as they huddled for safety in a
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   But now investigators said another of Safra's nurses, Ted Maher,
has confessed to making the whole story up. There never were any
masked men brandishing knives in the predawn hours of Dec. 3. Maher
admitted that he had concocted the story, slashed his own leg and
started the fire himself, so he could be seen as a hero.

Luther King Jr., a jury in Memphis, Tenn., held someone
accountable. After an odd four-week trial in a civil case brought
by King's family, the jury found that Loyd Jowers, 73, was liable
for the civil rights leader's wrongful death. The Kings' lawyer,
who once represented James Earl Ray, argued that Jowers acted as
part of a sweeping government and Mafia conspiracy. Jowers, who did
not testify, has claimed to have been a middleman between a
mob-connected grocer and the now-deceased Memphis police officer
who he has named as the gunman.

   Testifying in front of Congress in 1996, representatives of
Swiss banks said they knew exactly how many dormant Nazi-era
accounts were still on their books: 775. As the controversy over
how these banks handled Jews in particular intensified, the figure
rose to the thousands. Last week, former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker said a three-year audit he supervised put the figure
closer to 54,000. Some banks, he said, issued ``deliberately
misleading statements'' to keep Jews from recovering their assets.

CHEATING ON TESTS: THE HIGHER THE STAKES, THE GREATER THE
TEMPTATION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, investigators in New York City said they had
uncovered the most widespread public-school cheating scandal in the
nation, encompassing 32 schools, dozens of teachers and two
principals. The methods _ from teachers using palm cards to
overzealous test coaching _ were so varied and so widespread that
they might only be the tip of the iceberg, investigators contended.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same sort of thing occurred recently in Texas, where
school officials and politicians like Gov. George W. Bush were
brandishing the results of a standardized test to claim victory
over ignorance. There, too, a cheating scandal has erupted which
calls some of the achievement into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While officials trumpet higher scores, it also appears that an
old staple of education is gaining ground: cheating. And it is not
just students who are the culprits, but adults: the teachers,
principals, superintendents and other administrators charged with
watching over them.
</P>
<P>
   This rash of dishonesty has spread at the same time that
superintendents and politicians across the country have set tough
new test-score targets for their school systems. A ``standards''
revolution is sweeping through the classroom, tying promotion and
graduation of students and even cash bonuses for everyone from
principals to cafeteria workers to measurable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The current scandals have emboldened critics who question the
validity of standardized testing, in particular high-stakes,
high-pressure tests tied to promotion and graduation. And they have
sharpened the argument over whether it is possible to have
accountability without some form of testing.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum are organizations like Fair Test,
based in Boston, a group that monitors testing abuses and has been
a staunch critic of the testing industry. They see the new
accountability measures _ from publishing test scores in local
newspapers to state takeovers of failing schools _ as a way of
encouraging abuses. ``It's sort of like the Soviet Union; everybody
ends up lying,'' said Monty Neill, executive director of Fair Test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-test groups oppose even the newest tests, which require
children to organize their ideas into a coherent essay and, in
math, ask them to explain their reasoning, not just present
answers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence are educators and scholars like
Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who
passionately defends testing. ``To say that tests create cheating
is wrong,'' Dr. Ravitch said. ``What creates cheating is people who
cheat. If we spent as much time teaching kids as showing them the
answer, they might have learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of standards, tests and stark consequences for
failing to meet them _ like withholding high school diplomas _ say
that for too long, an officially sanctioned system of low
expectations has consigned many poor and disadvantaged children to
a second-class education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about how hard it is to raise test scores, it
sounds like you are defending current practice,'' says Seymour
Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation in New
York City. New tests that require 9-year-olds to write essays with
correct spelling, grammar and punctuation are a far cry from the
multiple choice bubbles of the past, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea that kids should be able to find a main idea;
that they should know how to find supporting details; how to draw
an inference, vocabulary,'' Fliegel said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is evidence that testing has always encouraged
cheating, at least where the stakes were high enough.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Haney, a professor at the Center for the Study of Testing
at Boston College, points out that the current debate is following
a pattern established in 19th century England. A program called
``Payment by Results'' reigned in English and Welsh elementary
schools from 1862 to 1897. Every student was examined annually by a
royal inspector, and teachers received government grants if their
students performed well. Among the results were that teachers
school-hopped, looking for positions that would pay better.
</P>
<P>
   There were also complaints that teachers tried to get copies of
arithmetic questions used in other schools, and then drilled their
students in them, in the hope of raising test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Test preparation is one of those ethical gray areas, where the
line between what is legitimate and illegitimate may be ill
defined. In fact, many school districts not only sanction test
preparation but spend large portions of their budgets paying for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The public schools have embarked on a new mission _ or at least
begun a new fad. Suddenly, teachers and students are expected to
produce results. But the reality is that real change and real
progress in the schools is hard to produce and takes time. Cheating
may be one of the unintended consequences of the increasing
reliance on standardized tests and the pressure to perform better,
fast.
</P>
<P>
   That is one motivation behind the accusations in New York and
Texas. Last January, the Texas Education Agency sent letters to
Houston and 10 other school districts saying that an analysis of
test results showed that unusually high numbers of wrong answers
had been erased and replaced with correct ones. In April, the
county attorney in Austin charged the city's school district and a
top administrator with test tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials have publicized statistics showing a narrowing
achievement gap between white students, who typically score higher,
and blacks and Hispanics. But in a legal challenge to the tests, an
expert witness has testified that 10th-grade test scores among
black and Hispanic children have been inflated by holding back
those who are failing, so they are not counted in the results.
</P>
<P>
   Even when tests are conducted honestly and scores do go up
sharply, it is often for reasons that have little to do with
improvements in teaching or learning. More commonly, the big jumps
_ what statisticians call statistical outliers _ betray something
more insidious at work: a new magnet program that attracts more
affluent or gifted students, perhaps, or test preparation mania.
Ultimately, standardized tests are probably most useful in
measuring the improvement, or decline, of an educational system
over an extended period of time.

   The opening of ``Y2K,'' a new play by Arthur Kopit, in a New
York theater last week was notable in a couple of ways, not the
least of which was the continued abuse of the millennium's most
overused catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   But Kopit's thriller stands out for another reason as well: its
villain. The character, Costa Astrakhan, is an evil computer genius
who methodically eliminates the hero's credit rating and bank
accounts and frames him as a child molester, all the while hissing
lines like: ``When I'm on the hunt, I'm as relentless as the wrath
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   While critical reaction to the play has been largely negative,
the emergence of Astrakhan seems to mark the continued evolution of
a uniquely modern character in film, television and, now, in
theater: the hacker. And it is a character _ some would say a
stereotype _ that has undergone a radical makeover since its birth
sometime in the dark ages known as the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the bespectacled, plaid-shirted, pizza-stained wretch
who guzzles soda while fumbling through cyberspace. Astrakhan wears
leather, dyes his hair blonde and dons strawberry-tinted
sunglasses. If he weren't busy destroying lives via his laptop, he
could pass for a fashionista. The same style is also evident in
this year's uber-hacker hit, ``The Matrix,'' which had its heroes
swathed in trench coats, form-fitting vests and pants _ all in
black leather and latex.
</P>
<P>
   But not only are the hackers dressing better, they've also taken
on a distinctly new attitude. And more often than not, there's a
reason the characters are dressed in black. They're the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kopit's creation, consider the recent NBC movie,
also called ``Y2K,'' in which two teen-age hackers caddishly
abandon a teen-age girl after the fabled millennial glitch causes a
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Films, in particular, have grabbed hold of the hacker as a handy
villain. In 1995 ``The Net'' featured a sinister conspiracy that
destroyed Sandra Bullock's identity and tried to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Even James Bond hates hackers. ``Goldeneye'' featured the
character of Boris, a Russian hacker, who fulfilled a
double-villain quotient by combining a Cold War bad guy with a
cyber world one. Not only does Boris betray his best friend, but he
also has the obnoxious habit of screaming ``I am invincible!'' (To
the contrary, he is frozen by a plume of liquid hydrogen.)
</P>
<P>
   Hacker advocates complained to Miramax Films last year about the
early version of a screenplay of ``Takedown,'' which is based on
the 1996 book by Tsutomu Shimomura with John Markoff of The New
York Times about the capture of Kevin Mitnick, who pleaded guilty
in March to computer fraud and wire fraud and was sentenced to 46
months. They were concerned about a scene in which the Mitnick
character attacked a pursuer with a garbage can lid and several
others they say were invented. Emmanuel Goldstein, who publishes
2600, a hacker magazine, called the initial depiction of Mitnick a
``low blow'' but added that the film company had been receptive to
the hackers' complaints and made changes in the script. Miramax
spokesman Andrew Stengel had no comment on the film, which is in
post-production.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and others who cover the hacker world say negative
depictions are part of the media's and the public's limited grasp
of what computers _ and the people who master them _ can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a tendency to vilify what they don't
understand,'' said Luke Reiter, a reporter for the interactive
cable channel ZDTV, which covers the Internet. ``And there's a
certain amount of unknown about what happens with a hacker: who he
is, what he looks like. People simply don't know what that person
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Wellen, who also covers the hacker community for ZDTV,
pointed out that while hackers often work in positive ways _
testing computer security and tracking down child pornography
rings, for example _ much of the news the public gets is bad. Last
week, a New Jersey hacker, David Lee Smith, pleaded guilty to
creating the ``Melissa'' virus, the most widely spread, disruptive
and costly computer virus in history.
</P>
<P>
   The daily annoyances of the computer age perhaps contribute to
the artist's distrust of those who glibly navigate cyberspace. The
demise of the hero in ``Y2K'' was inspired by an actual incident in
which Kopit's hard drive crashed while he was writing the play.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe computer bad guys are just more fun to watch, Wellen said.
``Portraying someone as a villain is much more interesting than
someone who can recognize a security flaw in a computer system,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this. Take ``War Games,'' the 1983 movie
that is arguably the parent of all hacker movies, plays or
television shows. The film starred Matthew Broderick as David
Lightman, a nerdy but nice computer enthusiast whose idea of making
trouble was changing a chemistry grade. Granted, he nearly starts
World War III looking for free video games, but in the end he
outsmarts a supercomputer to avert a global thermonuclear
catastrophe and teach us a valuable lesson about the futility of
armed conflict. (``The only way to win is not to play.'')
</P>
<P>
   The cinematic watershed seemed to occur around 1995, which
brought not only ``The Net'' and ``Goldeneye,'' but also
``Hackers,'' a B-movie about a gang of high school computer
whizzes. But it wasn't the subject matter that was important, it
was the lifestyle. The hackers in ``Hackers'' smoked. They listened
to techno music. They had sex. They were, well, hip.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Keanu Reeves (``The Matrix'') and Tom Cruise
(``Mission: Impossible'') were playing characters who hack. Things
would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the growing pantheon of characters matches the
reality is an open question. ``There really are no absolutes in
personality, style or viewpoint in the hacker community,'' said
Reiter. ``I mean, some wear leather jackets, some wear Armani
suits.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the character is still open for writers. Hackers in
bikinis? Why not? Hackers in love? Let the writing begin.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems to support the credo of Kopit's beleaguered
hero in ``Y2K.'' Quoting Gustave Flaubert, he says, ``Everything
you invent is true.''

CHECHNYA: THE NO MAN'S LAND IN THE FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grozny means ``terrible'' in Russian, and the capital of
Chechnya is once again living up to its name.
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian army reduces the already ruined city to rubble,
warning 40,000 civilians to get out or be ``destroyed'' with the
Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who Moscow says are its real
targets, a feeling of outrage and impotence spreads in countries
that went to war against Yugoslavia over similar outrages in Kosovo
only a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So the question arises: What is the world to make of the new
doctrine it thought was emerging _ a doctrine that seemed, after
Bosnia and Kosovo and East Timor, to be empowering the bulk of the
world to intervene in countries that abused their own citizens?
Large parts of the world, it seemed, were embracing the idea that
universal standards of human rights were putting at least some
limits on sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the harshest test of that doctrine: Russia, a
humbled superpower desperate to hold together its very territory,
not to mention its national pride, in the face of international
condemnation of its methods. ``Human rights are no reason to
interfere in the internal affairs of a state,'' Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov protested last week, offering the same
argument that Russia and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic made
during last spring's NATO air war against the Serbian attempt at
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is that some countries are more
sovereign than others. Sheer power still counts.
</P>
<P>
   Partly out of respect for its power, the European countries and
the United States have made some allowances for Moscow's conduct of
the war, recognizing that what Russia is trying to do in Chechnya
is very different from what the Serbs tried to do in Kosovo. But
they still point out that the ham-fisted Russian tactics could cost
thousands of innocent lives. ``The continuation of it and the
amassing of hundreds of thousands of refugees,'' President Clinton
said Wednesday night, ``will further alienate the global community
from Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those mild remarks, hinting at the prospect of a freeze on
International Monetary Fund loans to Russia and mostly verbal
criticism by the European Union, provoked chilling ire from
President Boris Yeltsin as he was visiting China on Thursday.
``Clinton allowed himself to pressure Russia yesterday,'' he said.
``He must have forgotten for a moment what Russia is. It has a full
arsenal of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin knew full well when he sent Russian troops into Chechnya
that international criticism of Russian actions there was likely to
be limited to finger-wagging.
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean the interventionist doctrine is being dealt a
mortal blow? Is there still room for Kosovo-like operations when
dictators _ or democrats, for that matter _ commit war crimes on
their own territory? In fact, human rights are likely to remain a
strong reason to interfere in the internal affairs of some states,
as two examples show: East Timor, where Australia led an
international peacekeeping force that went in after Indonesian
atrocities were committed against the people for voting in favor of
independence, and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia and Yugoslavia do not have nuclear weapons, a fact
that allowed stronger nations to reach a consensus and step in to
halt the outrages. Still, for every Kosovo or East Timor the world
eventually bestirs itself to save, there is some Rwanda that the
``international community'' stays out of, or a Somalia that it just
gives up on.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of inaction in Chechnya _ like critics of inaction in
Rwanda _ argue that there's a double standard, and so there is.
President Clinton offered an answer to that objection early in the
Kosovo operation last spring, when he laid out his sense of
America's obligation to intervene: when it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the
world, but just because we can't do everything for everyone doesn't
mean that, for the sake of consistency, we should do nothing for no
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a moral standpoint, of course, that rationale is more
questionable when the failure to intervene is in a place like
Africa. There, it is easy to imagine that the rich nations of the
West often stay aloof more for their own convenience or out of
prejudice than because they see no way to help. In Chechnya,
though, it is obvious that the risks really do preclude military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite having stood by during an equally brutal, if
utterly unsuccessful, Russian campaign to subdue Chechnya five
years ago, countries in both hemispheres have shown a growing
willingness to use military means to force states to respect human
rights. And having now built a couple of precedents, one result is
that even mere words may carry more weight against abuses than they
did during the Cold War, when the option of military action was
immobilized virtually everywhere, so the words of outrage were
mostly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, under international pressure, even Russia showed some
sensitivity, softening its ultimatum and assuring civilians in
Grozny that they would have time and transports to take them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remember 1999 as the year in which sovereignty gave
way in places where crimes against humanity were being committed,''
said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch,
the New York-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia (and China) having a veto in the Security Council,
consensus on outside intervention to protect civilians in Chechnya
is as unlikely as it would be in Tibet, but that does not mean
Western nations are hypocritical in refraining from an intervention
that could prove suicidal, so long as they urge Russia to stop and
think again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-CHECHNYA-RIGHTS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: think again. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most of life's greatest wounds _ for individuals and
for countries _ are self-inflicted,'' said Clinton. ``I don't think
the strategy will work.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Yeltsin knows that the allies are not going to risk
military confrontation over Chechnya, the world seems to have come
a long way from the early 1990s, when the fragile pretense of
civilization began to fall apart in Bosnia and every outside power
remained impotent until 1995. Many people paid for that indecision
with their lives, and hundreds of thousands more did in Rwanda in
1994 when the United States and the world turned their eyes aside
from genocide.
</P>
<P>
   After it became clear that inaction in Rwanda had only allowed
the chaos there to engulf neighboring Congo, Clinton admitted that
it had been a colossal mistake for the United States to block a
U.N. mandate for a stronger international force. Now there is a
U.N. tribunal to assess criminal responsibility and try to ensure
that nothing like that bloodletting happens again.
</P>
<P>
   That does not, of course, mean every atrocity will now be
stopped. Realistically, it still seems likely that the major powers
will let internal politics and domestic constraints make their
interventions selective. Just last week, the chief U.S. delegate to
the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, was telling Africans that
while America wants to help with their problems, it remains
unwilling to send U.S. troops there.
</P>
<P>
   So increasingly, regional security organizations seem likely to
become the first defense against atrocities. Europe and the United
States have told African countries that it is up to them,
primarily, to organize international forces to intervene, as they
have in Sierra Leone and Liberia. And the European Union, wary of
having to rely on the United States again, is moving rapidly to
acquire the ability to raise and send peacekeeping forces on its
own. But as all of these examples show, it still takes too long for
the world to get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan may have done the best at
defining the uncertain progress in a speech last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we recall tragic events such as those of Bosnia or Rwanda
and ask, `Why did no one intervene?' the question should not be
addressed only to the United Nations, or even to its member
states,'' he said. ``Each of us as an individual has to take his or
her share of responsibility. No one can claim ignorance of what
happened. All of us should recall how we responded, and ask: `What
did I do? Could I have done more? Did I let my prejudice, my
indifference, or my fear overwhelm my reasoning? Above all, how
would I react next time?'''
</P>
<P>
   It takes time to rouse the world to anger, which sometimes comes
too late to do any good. So Annan's challenge applies perfectly
well in Chechnya _ not just to Americans or Western Europeans but,
above all, to the ordinary Russians in whose name Yeltsin's
government is issuing unacceptable ultimatums to innocent
civilians.

Kosovo operation last spring, when he laid out his sense of
America's obligation to intervene: when it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the
world, but just because we can't do everything for everyone doesn't
mean that, for the sake of consistency, we should do nothing for no
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a moral standpoint, of course, that rationale is more
questionable when the failure to intervene is in a place like
Africa. There, it is easy to imagine that the rich nations of the
West often stay aloof more for their own convenience or out of
prejudice than because they see no way to help. In Chechnya,
though, it is obvious that the risks really do preclude military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite having stood by during an equally brutal, if
utterly unsuccessful, Russian campaign to subdue Chechnya five
years ago, countries in both hemispheres have shown a growing
willingness to use military means to force states to respect human
rights. And having now built a couple of precedents, one result is
that even mere words may carry more weight against abuses than they
did during the Cold War, when the option of military action was
immobilized virtually everywhere, so the words of outrage were
mostly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, under international pressure, even Russia showed some
sensitivity, softening its ultimatum and assuring civilians in
Grozny that they would have time and transports to take them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remember 1999 as the year in which sovereignty gave
way in places where crimes against humanity were being committed,''
said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch,
the New York-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia (and China) having a veto in the Security Council,
consensus on outside intervention to protect civilians in Chechnya
is as unlikely as it would be in Tibet, but that does not mean
Western nations are hypocritical in refraining from an intervention
that could prove suicidal, so long as they urge Russia to stop and
think again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-CHECHNYA-RIGHTS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: think again. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most of life's greatest wounds _ for individuals and
for countries _ are self-inflicted,'' said Clinton. ``I don't think
the strategy will work.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Yeltsin knows that the allies are not going to risk
military confrontation over Chechnya, the world seems to have come
a long way from the early 1990s, when the fragile pretense of
civilization began to fall apart in Bosnia and every outside power
remained impotent until 1995. Many people paid for that indecision
with their lives, and hundreds of thousands more did in Rwanda in
1994 when the United States and the world turned their eyes aside
from genocide.
</P>
<P>
   After it became clear that inaction in Rwanda had only allowed
the chaos there to engulf neighboring Congo, Clinton admitted that
it had been a colossal mistake for the United States to block a
U.N. mandate for a stronger international force. Now there is a
U.N. tribunal to assess criminal responsibility and try to ensure
that nothing like that bloodletting happens again.
</P>
<P>
   That does not, of course, mean every atrocity will now be
stopped. Realistically, it still seems likely that the major powers
will let internal politics and domestic constraints make their
interventions selective. Just last week, the chief U.S. delegate to
the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, was telling Africans that
while America wants to help with their problems, it remains
unwilling to send U.S. troops there.
</P>
<P>
   So increasingly, regional security organizations seem likely to
become the first defense against atrocities. Europe and the United
States have told African countries that it is up to them,
primarily, to organize international forces to intervene, as they
have in Sierra Leone and Liberia. And the European Union, wary of
having to rely on the United States again, is moving rapidly to
acquire the ability to raise and send peacekeeping forces on its
own. But as all of these examples show, it still takes too long for
the world to get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan may have done the best at
defining the uncertain progress in a speech last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we recall tragic events such as those of Bosnia or Rwanda
and ask, `Why did no one intervene?' the question should not be
addressed only to the United Nations, or even to its member
states,'' he said. ``Each of us as an individual has to take his or
her share of responsibility. No one can claim ignorance of what
happened. All of us should recall how we responded, and ask: `What
did I do? Could I have done more? Did I let my prejudice, my
indifference, or my fear overwhelm my reasoning? Above all, how
would I react next time?'''
</P>
<P>
   It takes time to rouse the world to anger, which sometimes comes
too late to do any good. So Annan's challenge applies perfectly
well in Chechnya _ not just to Americans or Western Europeans but,
above all, to the ordinary Russians in whose name Yeltsin's
government is issuing unacceptable ultimatums to innocent
civilians.

 WHAT IF McCAIN GAINS THE WORLD, BUT LOSES THE PARTY?  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is the rage in Republican
presidential politics, so much so that Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the untouchable pace-setter for months who has been taking his
lumps of late, last week declared that McCain may be the
front-runner in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly trying to dampen expectations for himself. But
it wasn't all spin: McCain did breeze ahead of the Texas governor
in polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary. He won
acclaim for besting Bush in two televised debates. He also made the
cover of Time magazine, which trumpeted ``his heroic life story and
passion for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the deluge of hype about the rise of the senator from
Arizona overshadows a fundamental question and a challenge that
many Republicans say is all but insurmountable: Can a politician
win the Republican nomination by bashing the Republican Party?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, some prominent Republicans say they could
imagine McCain winning a string of primaries _ and even snatching
his party's nomination _ although they considered that a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But the odd reality is that McCain's appeal to the contrarian
voters of New Hampshire and to the press, which showers him with
flattering coverage, is that he is a brusque maverick (and war
hero) who dares to take on his party: He championed a campaign
finance measure that conservative groups say would kill them. He
supported a tax on tobacco that is anathema to Republicans. On
issue after issue, McCain has collided with leaders of his party.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain is that in the history of the Republican
Party, far more so than in the Democratic Party, the presidential
nominee has rarely been an insurgent. It is almost always the
person with the most institutional support. Once the party settles
on a front-runner, whether Bob Dole or the elder George Bush, it
rallies behind him even if he stumbles _ or flubs a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party has a more settled sensibility,'' said former
Education Secretary William Bennett, who is advising both Bush and
McCain. ``It tends not to go out on a limb and take a chance and
turn things upside down in the middle. It's the daddy party; it
makes up its mind where it's going and goes there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett did not entirely reject a McCain upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is changing,'' he said, ``we all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's predicament is not merely that he is lacking his
party's support; rather, he is actively disliked by everyone from
the Republican leadership in the Senate to the heads of influential
groups like the National Right to Life Committee, the Christian
Coalition and Americans for Tax Reform.
</P>
<P>
   These and other groups, complaining that McCain's campaign
finance plan could cripple them, traveled to New Hampshire in
September to hold a press conference denouncing McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's moniker is that he is bucking the trends of his own
party,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who backs Bush. ``That's
great if you're running for the Senate from Arizona. I'm not sure
it's great running for the nomination of your party by running
against your party.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said bluntly: ``There are
groups on our side of the aisle that view this guy as the outright
enemy. They would try to trip him up every chance they got.''
</P>
<P>
   The peril for McCain is that he has offended so many important
constituencies and power centers in his own party that the better
he does, the more likely it could trigger a backlash: his enemies
might try to stop him from capturing the nomination _ or, at least
rough him up in the process, causing disunity within the ranks
during the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from the traditional method for winning the
nomination, McCain is concentrating on wooing independents and
Democrats instead of first building a foundation among
conservatives, who are critical in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating his challenge is the degree to which the
party establishment _ from governors to members of Congress to
state party leaders _ are invested in Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of politicians have staked their future on George
Bush's success,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who withdrew from
the race and endorsed Bush. ``This is where their next job comes
from. What are they going to do if he doesn't win?''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain poses a formidable threat to Bush in New
Hampshire, his success in the state is magnified in part by the
media, which are always looking for a race.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is not so rosy, at least not yet. McCain is not
competing in the important Iowa caucuses. His only other
organizations are in South Carolina and his home state of Arizona.
By contrast, Bush has a national operation and, in the polls, is
beating McCain everywhere outside of New Hampshire. And while the
McCain boomlet has been a boon to his fund raising, Bush has still
amassed nearly five times more money.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hope is that he will triumph in New Hampshire, and that
the win will somehow provide the momentum to prevail in the
compressed schedule of contests, from South Carolina to Arizona to
the critical California primary of March 7 _ and that Bush will
have little time to recover from early defeats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-MCCAIN-MAVERICK-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: early defeats. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't place a bet on it as a sure thing, that's for
sure,'' said Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, of the
prospects for winning the nomination. ``It's a tough deal. George
Bush has an overwhelming financial advantage. If we win early, the
clock works for us.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Steve Duprey said he
believes that no matter what happens in his state, Bush has such
financial and institutional advantages that he will be virtually
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for the insurgent strategy to win,'' he said.
``Is McCain doing it as well as anyone can? Yes. But it's a very
uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many Republicans, the bottom line is winning back the
White House. And if McCain sweeps the primaries, his foes just
might forgive him in the name of victory. Kieran Mahoney, a
Republican strategist who worked for former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., pointed out that his boss was hardly the party favorite
when he was first elected in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a New York political environment working for a
guy who the entire Republican establishment hated,'' he said. ``We
had virtually no structural support in the states whatsoever. But
what is going to matter is purely the votes of the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain outlasts Bush and wins the nomination, the challenge
would be for Republicans to unite behind him in the general
election _ and work aggressively for his election. In 1972, Sen.
George McGovern managed to win the Democratic nomination _ and defy
the entire party establishment. (He, of course, lost overwhelmingly
to President Richard M. Nixon in November.)
</P>
<P>
   But many conservatives, like American Conservative Union
chairman David Keene, wince at the thought. Keene said the
hostility toward McCain was ``a shame'' because the senator is
quite conservative on many issues. ``The problem,'' he said, ``is
that if you disagree with him, it turns into a holy war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain surge continues, Republicans should brace for
their most rancorous holy war yet.

HOW MUCH IS THAT PIGLET IN THE WINDOW?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me ... a cow?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it doesn't roll off the tongue like partridge in a
pear tree. But believe it or not, it's the kind of gift you can
send, thanks to what is surely one of the world's oddest holiday
catalogs, that of Heifer Project International (www.heifer.org).
</P>
<P>
   Since 1944, the nonprofit charity, based in Little Rock, Ark.,
has shipped livestock to poverty-stricken areas all over the world
(inspiring a memorable 1987 headline in this very newspaper:
``Doomed Cows Get Foreign Homes'').
</P>
<P>
   The Heifer Project's holiday gift program, begun about 10 years
ago, seems rather like those adopt-an-adorable-Third-World-urchin
ads you see in magazines:
</P>
<P>
   1) You decide to spring for, say, a $120 goat in honor of dear
Aunt Gertrude (actually, each nominal livestock ``purchase'' goes
to the charity's entire program).
</P>
<P>
   2) Aunt Gertie receives a handsome gift card, describing your
generous contribution in her honor: a lovely goat!
</P>
<P>
   3) Hard-up family A in country X gets goat and agrees to donate
the animal's first female offspring to destitute family B, which
agrees to do the same thing and so forth in a continuing process of
rural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: This is the gift that keeps on smelling
funky. Here's a sampling of what else is available from the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Pig: $120
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Pig: $10
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: The holidays are right around the corner, and it's
time for more piglet gifts for your mother. Something about their
cute, squishy faces and their curlicue tails brings a smile to
Mom's face. Over the years, her holiday gifts have ranged from pig
T-shirts to pig doorstops to pig weather vanes _ and everything in
between. This year, how about the gift of a real live pig to put a
smile on Mom's face and brighten the future for a struggling
community?
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Sheep: $120
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Sheep: $10
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: When you were just a wee thing, Aunt Dee Dee
taught you the basics of knitting. And the wool sweaters you
created together were nothing short of wonderful. This holiday
season, let her know what all of those knitting sessions by the
fire meant to you: give the gift of a sheep through Heifer Project
and share those moments of ``shear'' pleasure with a family in
need.
</P>
<P>
   Flock of chicks: $20
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: It's time to buy the kids' favorite teacher a
holiday present _ but you suspect that Mrs. Lynley doesn't need
another engraved Christmas tree ornament. How about the gift of a
flock of chicks in Mrs. Lynley's name to wish her happy holidays
and to thank her for giving your ``chickadees'' the gift of wisdom
throughout the school year?
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Llama: $150
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Llama: $20
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: Uncle Gene has traveled the world. His incredible
stories and eccentric gifts were always the highlight of Christmas
morning festivities. Remember the camel saddle he brought you when
you were 9?
</P>
<P>
   Now it's your turn to provide your adventurous uncle with a
present he'll never forget: a rugged llama that will mean the world
to a family in need.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Water Buffalo: $250
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Water Buffalo: $25
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: At dawn in northern India, 9-year-old Parmatma
Prashad rises from the bed of burlap-covered hay he shares with his
father and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing shorts and a tattered sweater, Parmatma carries a steel
pail to the shed. In the early morning chill, Parmatma carries out
a routine chore that is changing his family's life: He milks the
buffalo.

send, thanks to what is surely one of the world's oddest holiday
catalogs, that of Heifer Project International (www.heifer.org).
</P>
<P>
   Since 1944, the nonprofit charity, based in Little Rock, Ark.,
has shipped livestock to poverty-stricken areas all over the world
(inspiring a memorable 1987 headline in this very newspaper:
``Doomed Cows Get Foreign Homes'').
</P>
<P>
   The Heifer Project's holiday gift program, begun about 10 years
ago, seems rather like those adopt-an-adorable-Third-World-urchin
ads you see in magazines:
</P>
<P>
   1) You decide to spring for, say, a $120 goat in honor of dear
Aunt Gertrude (actually, each nominal livestock ``purchase'' goes
to the charity's entire program).
</P>
<P>
   2) Aunt Gertie receives a handsome gift card, describing your
generous contribution in her honor: a lovely goat!
</P>
<P>
   3) Hard-up family A in country X gets goat and agrees to donate
the animal's first female offspring to destitute family B, which
agrees to do the same thing and so forth in a continuing process of
rural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: This is the gift that keeps on smelling
funky. Here's a sampling of what else is available from the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Pig: $120
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Pig: $10
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: The holidays are right around the corner, and it's
time for more piglet gifts for your mother. Something about their
cute, squishy faces and their curlicue tails brings a smile to
Mom's face. Over the years, her holiday gifts have ranged from pig
T-shirts to pig doorstops to pig weather vanes _ and everything in
between. This year, how about the gift of a real live pig to put a
smile on Mom's face and brighten the future for a struggling
community?
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Sheep: $120
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Sheep: $10
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: When you were just a wee thing, Aunt Dee Dee
taught you the basics of knitting. And the wool sweaters you
created together were nothing short of wonderful. This holiday
season, let her know what all of those knitting sessions by the
fire meant to you: give the gift of a sheep through Heifer Project
and share those moments of ``shear'' pleasure with a family in
need.
</P>
<P>
   Flock of chicks: $20
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: It's time to buy the kids' favorite teacher a
holiday present _ but you suspect that Mrs. Lynley doesn't need
another engraved Christmas tree ornament. How about the gift of a
flock of chicks in Mrs. Lynley's name to wish her happy holidays
and to thank her for giving your ``chickadees'' the gift of wisdom
throughout the school year?
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Llama: $150
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Llama: $20
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: Uncle Gene has traveled the world. His incredible
stories and eccentric gifts were always the highlight of Christmas
morning festivities. Remember the camel saddle he brought you when
you were 9?
</P>
<P>
   Now it's your turn to provide your adventurous uncle with a
present he'll never forget: a rugged llama that will mean the world
to a family in need.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Water Buffalo: $250
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Water Buffalo: $25
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: At dawn in northern India, 9-year-old Parmatma
Prashad rises from the bed of burlap-covered hay he shares with his
father and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing shorts and a tattered sweater, Parmatma carries a steel
pail to the shed. In the early morning chill, Parmatma carries out
a routine chore that is changing his family's life: He milks the
buffalo.

HAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)

<P>
   Do any Americans with a television not know that they have ``the
right to remain silent,'' ``the right to a lawyer,'' and that
anything they say may be used against them in a court of law?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to television and its Kojaks and Andy Sipowiczs, these
phrases from the Supreme Court's landmark 1966 Miranda decision are
surely among the best-known phrases in the language.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda was a controversial decision, one that law enforcement
officials, in particular, railed against. They argued that no
criminal in his right mind would talk after being advised that he
didn't have to. A few months after the decision, the legendary
Manhattan district attorney, Frank Hogan, told the U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee that the Miranda ruling was a ``fundamentally
unsound edict'' that ``significantly inhibits the making of a
statement by a suspect to a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprising number of instances, suspects sing, despite
clear warnings about the pitfalls of self-incriminating comments.
``If you take a look at the Miranda warning and say it slow and
clear to a person with half a brain, you would think why would they
say anything after that,'' said Bob Connelly, a retired New York
City homicide detective who supports Miranda. ``But they do it all
the time. A lot of them just want to take it off their chest.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the warning became standard operating procedure in police
departments, many of the detectives whom Miranda opponents said
were hamstrung by the ruling made their peace with it. It became
ingrained in their routine, drummed into them as academy cadets and
reinforced throughout their careers. ``Our members have accepted
Miranda,'' said James Fotis, executive director of the Law
Enforcement Alliance of America, which represents 65,000 active and
retired officers.
</P>
<P>
   Even detectives express support for Miranda. ``If a friend of
mine was to be arrested for something, I would want him to know his
rights. There's a need for it,'' said Detective Sgt. Michael
Bettin, a narcotics investigator with the Essex County, N.J.,
Sheriff's Department. George Lytwyn, a retired Newark, N.J., police
detective, added: ``It's like when you get up in the morning and
brush your teeth _ it's automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investigators often get creative delivering the
warning, angling to minimize the possibility that a suspect will
ask for a lawyer and remain silent. ``Some of them get cute about
it, the way they phrase it, the way they time it, the way they try
to maneuver around it,'' said Susan Hendricks, deputy attorney in
charge of the criminal division for the Legal Aid Society in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hernandez, a retired Newark, N.J., police detective, said
investigators will try to ingratiate themselves, bringing a suspect
coffee or a sandwich, making idle chitchat to make a suspect feel
comfortable _ all with an eye toward drawing out a confession.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling's critics, however, continue to regard Miranda as a
loophole that sets criminals free. Paul Cassell, a University of
Utah law professor who has crusaded against Miranda for years and
will argue for Section 3501 before the Supreme Court, said Miranda
creates a ``mine field'' that allows ``indisputably guilty
criminals'' to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Uviller, a Columbia University law professor who wrote a
book about the year he spent with New York police officers, said
Miranda ``deters confessions or prevents the use of evidence in
some important cases.''
</P>
<P>
   This view has now received its most significant judicial
validation in 33 years. The activist 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Richmond, Va., ruled last February, in a case involving
a confession from an accused bank robber, that an obscure 1968 law
permits the admission of confessions in federal court as long as
they were ``voluntary,'' in light of the circumstances and
regardless of any particular warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as Section 3501 of the Omnibus Crime Control Act,
has been ignored since its passage. But in February, the 4th
Circuit Court ruled that Section 3501 could substitute for the
Miranda rules in federal court because, in the court's opinion, the
rules themselves were not required by the Constitution. That has
opened the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether Section
3501 could limit or even overturn Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of overturning Miranda are not certain. For one
thing, Miranda warnings are not required in most arrests, which are
racked up by patrol officers on their beats. ``Most arrests are
made when people are caught red-handed,'' said James Fyfe, a Temple
University criminologist and former New York City Police
lieutenant. ``In almost all those cases, the evidence is so strong
that it's not necessary to talk to a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda comes into play only when the officer _ almost always a
highly experienced detective, more often than not working homicides
_ has arrested a suspect and plans to interrogate. And when the
process moves forward, investigators and criminologists say, good
detectives facing guilty suspects often obtain a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Uviller believes that Section 3501 would be a sensible
alternative. Nonetheless, while detectives don't see Miranda as
flawless, many say it has resulted in better investigations and
stronger cases. They say many of those who remain silent after
being read their rights are often convicted with other evidence,
especially the sort of advanced forensic evidence, such as DNA
analysis, that was undreamed of back in 1966. And then there is the
sense that Miranda is simply fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put the police department on the line, outlined that it had
rules to obey,'' said Detective Peter Killen, who joined the New
York City police four years before the Miranda ruling and now works
in the 68th Precinct in Brooklyn. ``And when it came to the
suspects, well, the suspects were given rights.''

   If there is a patron saint of nagging mothers, it is surely
William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States.
Standing in the cold rain on March 4, 1841, too proud to wear a
hat, delivering a 105-minute speech that is still one of the
longest inaugural addresses ever, he caught a cold and died of
pneumonia a month later (becoming the first president to die in
office and thus keeping his campaign promise never to run again).
</P>
<P>
   Such cautionary tales may impress parents and grandparents, but
of course they have no impact on children, who are too busy
escaping without their hats and boots to listen anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait. This is the age of science: Aren't we supposed to
know that colds and flu are caused by viruses? The germ theory may
appeal to the intellect, but don't we know in our hearts that no
good can come from a bare head, wet feet or wearing a coat that, as
our mothers might have said, you could spit through?
</P>
<P>
   How about time-honored scourges like sudden warm spells during
the winter, failing to change out of wet clothes or going back and
forth between sweltering heat and frigid air conditioning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of any of those things in particular
predisposing to common colds,'' said Dr. Kristin Nichol, a cold and
flu expert who is chief of medicine at the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in Minneapolis, and a professor at the University of
Minnesota, a place where they are supposed to know how to dress for
winter. ``I don't think things like stepping in puddles or letting
your head get cold have been linked to catching a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it stressful to get very chilled, and mightn't that
lower one's resistance? Maybe just worrying about getting cold and
wet could derange a person's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   A woman of science, Dr. Nichol was dubious. ``But I do think
that if one becomes physically exhausted or overextended or
rundown, one may become more susceptible,'' she finally allowed.
Aha!
</P>
<P>
   For people who really want to avoid colds and flu, Dr. Nichol
had this advice: ``Get a flu shot. Wash your hands a lot. One of
the common modes of transmission is to get virus-infected particles
on your hands from touching a surface or shaking someone's hand.
Then if you touch your nose or eyes, you may become ill.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do get sick, Dr. Nichol added, ``Try to avoid coughing on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was still true that a cold will last seven days if
treated and a week if left alone, she laughed politely.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, it seems as if doctors used to have a lot more remedies.
The Merck Manual of 1899 lists plenty of nostrums for ``acute nasal
catarrh,'' including gargling with a carbolic acid solution,
inhaling ammonia or chloroform, adding a bit of arsenic to your
cigarettes or taking hot foot baths before retiring. And if all
else failed, there was always tincture of jaborandi.

   Anonymous vs. Anonymous, Or Poor Little Rich Girl  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 75 years ago about trying to economize
in his magazine article, ``How to Live on Practically Nothing a
Year.'' A $100-a-month governess offered to work for $40 a month
``and do the baby's washing.'' Patricia Duff, the most recent
ex-wife of the billionaire Ronald Perelman, may be looking for such
a governess. Justice Franklin Weissberg of New York state Supreme
Court rejected her request for as much as $132,000 a month in child
support, ordering Perelman to pay $12,825 a month for the couple's
4-year-old daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In his 22-page decision, the judge, who takes a brown-bag lunch
to court every day and who showed signs of impatience with Ms. Duff
during hearings in September, dismissed Ms. Duff's demands for more
money with words like ``absurd'' and ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed intent on seeing that state child-support
guidelines were not used to redistribute wealth. Perelman's income
ranges from $40 million to $60 million yearly, the judge said,
while Ms. Duff's is about $2.4 million yearly. Her lawyers argued
that having a mere millionaire for a mother would hurt Caleigh
psychologically. ``There is not a shred of evidence in the record
to support these conclusions,'' the judge said. ``There are far
more important things in the life of a young child than private
jets, yachts, obsequious staffs and pandering guests. The reality
is that Caleigh will never suffer a shortage of material
comforts.''

   Peaceful Clash of Symbols &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While decorating a Christmas tree or lighting the candles of the
Hanukkah menorah are joyous activities in most households, many
interfaith couples find December holidays a source of angst.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, couples, especially Christians and Jews, would
forgo one holiday or display all the symbols together. But as the
rate of religious intermarriage increases in America _ today some
50 percent of Jews marry outside their faith, up sharply from
previous decades _ many families have developed an alternative:
religious syncretism, or the blending of two different, dissimilar
beliefs.

   A federal grand jury in New Mexico indicted a nuclear engineer
on 59 counts of stealing highly classified nuclear data from secure
computers at the Los Alamos weapons lab where he worked. The
engineer, Wen Ho Lee, whose case has been furiously debated within
the cloistered worlds of counterintelligence, law enforcement and
nuclear energy, was not charged with espionage although
investigators have unsuccessfully tried to determine whether he
passed secrets to China. The crime Lee is charged with is
punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison.

accountable. After an odd four-week trial in a civil case brought
by King's family, the jury found that Loyd Jowers, 73, was liable
for the civil rights leader's wrongful death. The Kings' lawyer,
who once represented James Earl Ray, argued that Jowers acted as

   MIAMI _ It is a large predicament for such a small boy.
</P>
<P>
   For 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who survived for two days adrift
on an inner tube in the Atlantic Ocean, after a failed crossing
from Cuba drowned his mother and 10 others in late November, the
ordeal may be just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   His father in Cuba, and more important, Fidel Castro, want him
home. Relatives in Miami, and many in the politically powerful
exile community here, say he already is home, wrapped in the arms
of the Cuban-Americans who live in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which had once seemed content to let
Florida courts decide the case, now seems willing to consider
sending the boy home, this after a week of large demonstrations
outside the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Those demonstrations, coupled with threats from Castro that more
are to come, caused U.S. officials ``to tremble,'' bragged the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has refused to come to the
United States to try and reclaim his son in what he called a
corrupt state court.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers representing the boy filed a petition for
political asylum in the United States, which could extend his stay
with relatives here for at least 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not turn this into a political thing,'' said his
21-year-old cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has become the boy's
closest friend in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But with Elian's face on a billboard in Havana and on T-shirts
in Miami; with marchers chanting his name on either side of the
Florida Straits; and with the Republican presidential hopeful John
McCain taking up his cause during a campaign stop here Friday, that
is an impossible dream.

   Anonymous vs. Anonymous, Or Poor Little Rich Girl  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 75 years ago about trying to economize
in his magazine article, ``How to Live on Practically Nothing a
Year.'' A $100-a-month governess offered to work for $40 a month
``and do the baby's washing.'' Patricia Duff, the most recent
ex-wife of the billionaire Ronald Perelman, may be looking for such
a governess. Justice Franklin Weissberg of New York state Supreme
Court rejected her request for as much as $132,000 a month in child
support, ordering Perelman to pay $12,825 a month for the couple's
4-year-old daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In his 22-page decision, the judge, who takes a brown-bag lunch
to court every day and who showed signs of impatience with Ms. Duff
during hearings in September, dismissed Ms. Duff's demands for more
money with words like ``absurd'' and ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed intent on seeing that state child-support
guidelines were not used to redistribute wealth. Perelman's income
ranges from $40 million to $60 million yearly, the judge said,
while Ms. Duff's is about $2.4 million yearly. Her lawyers argued
that having a mere millionaire for a mother would hurt Caleigh
psychologically. ``There is not a shred of evidence in the record
to support these conclusions,'' the judge said. ``There are far
more important things in the life of a young child than private
jets, yachts, obsequious staffs and pandering guests. The reality
is that Caleigh will never suffer a shortage of material
comforts.''

   Peaceful Clash of Symbols &QL;

<P>
   While decorating a Christmas tree or lighting the candles of the
Hanukkah menorah are joyous activities in most households, many
interfaith couples find December holidays a source of angst.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, couples, especially Christians and Jews, would
forgo one holiday or display all the symbols together. But as the
rate of religious intermarriage increases in America _ today some
50 percent of Jews marry outside their faith, up sharply from
previous decades _ many families have developed an alternative:
religious syncretism, or the blending of two different, dissimilar
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace has responded by producing dual-faith
decorations: tree ornaments painted with menorahs or Kwanzaa
lights; angels with wings, halos and dreidel-print dresses; and
Christmas lights that have Stars of David.
</P>
<P>
   The devout deplore such melding. ``It is a terrible sign of

IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A SMOKING GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year, 28 cities have filed suits against firearms
manufacturers seeking monetary damages and changes in the ways guns
are sold in the United States. Two states, New York and
Connecticut, have threatened to sue, and last week federal
officials announced that they would help public housing authorities
nationwide file suit to force gun makers to sell safer firearms and
do more to keep them out of criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   To many, it appears the fight against guns is a sequel to the
tobacco war _ a struggle against products that kill, and against
industries that have dodged or defeated change in Congress. And now
gun makers, like tobacco producers who paid $246 billion and agreed
to change marketing practices to settle state lawsuits, are facing
a reckoning in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry, with about $1.5 billion in annual U.S. sales,
is tiny relative to the domestic tobacco business, with sales of
$45 billion. So money will not loom nearly so large as it has in
the tobacco settlements. Nonetheless, as with the anti-tobacco
campaign, gun control advocates are using the specter of ruinous
monetary awards to force the gun manufacturers to change the way
they do business. Specifically, they are being asked to place
additional safeguards on guns to prevent accidental shootings, and
to restrict sales to dealers whose guns frequently turn up in the
commission of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the parallels between guns and tobacco may be overdrawn, and
the success of the tobacco lawsuits may be harder to achieve in a
different industry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tobacco, which is harmful when used as intended, guns
have multiple safe and proper uses, from target practice to
collecting to hunting. As a result, legal experts say, the gun
lawsuits appear to be weaker than the anti-tobacco claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit want to be
reimbursed for expenses incurred treating gunshot victims. These
suits are modeled on the cigarette cases, in which states sought to
recover public funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses by
arguing that cigarette makers had not properly disclosed the risks
of smoking. That novel legal theory was never resolved because all
the cases were settled before verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University Law
School, said the cause-and-effect legal claim that underpins the
gun cases appears far weaker than in the tobacco lawsuits.
Manufacturers have little control over what owners do with their
guns. In addition, the expenses that public agencies might have the
right to recover are also unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Public housing authorities, for example, might claim they are
owed money because one person shot another on their premises. But,
Gillers said, ``There is an extra beat because an individual is
involved. The direct causation was more obvious in tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, that may not matter. Gillers and others note
that some manufacturers have already begun to seek compromise at
the bargaining table, faced with their opponents' strategy of legal
attrition. By contrast, it took years before tobacco makers entered
such talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the type of industry that is going to be able to
mount the type of long-term resistance that cigarette producers
were able to do,'' said Peter Schuck, a professor of law at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   While cigarette producers are multinational titans, the gun
industry includes only a few sizeable companies like Colt
Manufacturing and Smith &AMP; Wesson, and dozens of small ones.
Moreover, the industry is not unified; some producers have entered
settlement talks, others have shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, even if gun opponents falter in court, they may
still win their war. Already four smaller manufacturers, citing the
growing litigation, have filed for bankruptcy protection. Colt
Manufacturing, fearful of growing legal costs, has held initial
settlement talks, while other large manufacturers are working on
codes of conduct for dealers, hoping to slow indiscriminate sales.
</P>
<P>
   John Lott, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has
written about the value of guns as a crime deterrent, said that the
lawsuits are simply an effort by public officials to strong arm a
weak industry into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to maximize the legal costs on the industry so
it will fold,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are sympathetic to the lawsuits tend to agree.
``That is the way our legal system works,'' said Robert Rabin, a
law professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees that settlement talks will be
successful, even in the event of a broad agreement. That's because
the decentralized nature of the gun industry might frustrate its
effective implementation. Once again, the tobacco industry offers a
useful contrast. Tobacco sales are controlled by only a few
companies, but negotiators still had to carefully construct a deal
that prevented smaller companies or new ones from ignoring
settlement-imposed price hikes and marketing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry includes any number of small companies, some of
them based overseas, a large market in used guns, and a national
gun show circuit, all of which may be difficult to monitor and
control.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some gun supporters like Lott believe that
gun control efforts will prove effective, but only in those parts
of the market where guns don't pose a serious risk. Lott sees the
lawsuits as a well-meaning but misguided attempt at social
engineering, which will only make it harder for honest people,
particularly poor ones, to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only see bad things coming out of it,'' he said. ``There is
so much consciousness about the bad things that guns do that people
do not think about the defensive use of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Timothy Lytton, a professor at New York Law
School, said that the gun industry found itself on the defensive
because gun control advocates successfully changed the terms of the
debate from the right to bear arms to public health. And, just as
with tobacco, once the debate was reframed to emphasize the cost to
society, the roadblocks to industry regulation began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to solve all gun crimes,'' Lytton said.
``But if it is true that a significant number of guns are being
sold irresponsibly then changing the practices of manufacturers can
change that.''

   MIAMI _ It is a large predicament for such a small boy.
</P>
<P>
   For 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who survived for two days adrift
on an inner tube in the Atlantic Ocean, after a failed crossing
from Cuba drowned his mother and 10 others in late November, the
ordeal may be just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   His father in Cuba, and more important, Fidel Castro, want him
home. Relatives in Miami, and many in the politically powerful
exile community here, say he already is home, wrapped in the arms
of the Cuban-Americans who live in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which had once seemed content to let
Florida courts decide the case, now seems willing to consider
sending the boy home, this after a week of large demonstrations
outside the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Those demonstrations, coupled with threats from Castro that more
are to come, caused U.S. officials ``to tremble,'' bragged the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has refused to come to the
United States to try and reclaim his son in what he called a
corrupt state court.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers representing the boy filed a petition for
political asylum in the United States, which could extend his stay
with relatives here for at least 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not turn this into a political thing,'' said his
21-year-old cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has become the boy's
closest friend in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But with Elian's face on a billboard in Havana and on T-shirts
in Miami; with marchers chanting his name on either side of the
Florida Straits; and with the Republican presidential hopeful John
McCain taking up his cause during a campaign stop here Friday, that
is an impossible dream.

IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A SMOKING GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year, 28 cities have filed suits against firearms
manufacturers seeking monetary damages and changes in the ways guns
are sold in the United States. Two states, New York and
Connecticut, have threatened to sue, and last week federal
officials announced that they would help public housing authorities
nationwide file suit to force gun makers to sell safer firearms and
do more to keep them out of criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   To many, it appears the fight against guns is a sequel to the
tobacco war _ a struggle against products that kill, and against
industries that have dodged or defeated change in Congress. And now
gun makers, like tobacco producers who paid $246 billion and agreed
to change marketing practices to settle state lawsuits, are facing
a reckoning in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry, with about $1.5 billion in annual U.S. sales,
is tiny relative to the domestic tobacco business, with sales of
$45 billion. So money will not loom nearly so large as it has in
the tobacco settlements. Nonetheless, as with the anti-tobacco
campaign, gun control advocates are using the specter of ruinous
monetary awards to force the gun manufacturers to change the way
they do business. Specifically, they are being asked to place
additional safeguards on guns to prevent accidental shootings, and
to restrict sales to dealers whose guns frequently turn up in the
commission of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the parallels between guns and tobacco may be overdrawn, and
the success of the tobacco lawsuits may be harder to achieve in a
different industry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tobacco, which is harmful when used as intended, guns
have multiple safe and proper uses, from target practice to
collecting to hunting. As a result, legal experts say, the gun
lawsuits appear to be weaker than the anti-tobacco claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit want to be
reimbursed for expenses incurred treating gunshot victims. These
suits are modeled on the cigarette cases, in which states sought to
recover public funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses by
arguing that cigarette makers had not properly disclosed the risks
of smoking. That novel legal theory was never resolved because all
the cases were settled before verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University Law
School, said the cause-and-effect legal claim that underpins the
gun cases appears far weaker than in the tobacco lawsuits.
Manufacturers have little control over what owners do with their
guns. In addition, the expenses that public agencies might have the
right to recover are also unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Public housing authorities, for example, might claim they are
owed money because one person shot another on their premises. But,
Gillers said, ``There is an extra beat because an individual is
involved. The direct causation was more obvious in tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, that may not matter. Gillers and others note
that some manufacturers have already begun to seek compromise at
the bargaining table, faced with their opponents' strategy of legal
attrition. By contrast, it took years before tobacco makers entered
such talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the type of industry that is going to be able to
mount the type of long-term resistance that cigarette producers
were able to do,'' said Peter Schuck, a professor of law at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   While cigarette producers are multinational titans, the gun
industry includes only a few sizeable companies like Colt
Manufacturing and Smith &AMP; Wesson, and dozens of small ones.
Moreover, the industry is not unified; some producers have entered
settlement talks, others have shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, even if gun opponents falter in court, they may
still win their war. Already four smaller manufacturers, citing the
growing litigation, have filed for bankruptcy protection. Colt
Manufacturing, fearful of growing legal costs, has held initial
settlement talks, while other large manufacturers are working on
codes of conduct for dealers, hoping to slow indiscriminate sales.
</P>
<P>
   John Lott, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has
written about the value of guns as a crime deterrent, said that the
lawsuits are simply an effort by public officials to strong arm a
weak industry into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to maximize the legal costs on the industry so
it will fold,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are sympathetic to the lawsuits tend to agree.
``That is the way our legal system works,'' said Robert Rabin, a
law professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees that settlement talks will be
successful, even in the event of a broad agreement. That's because
the decentralized nature of the gun industry might frustrate its
effective implementation. Once again, the tobacco industry offers a
useful contrast. Tobacco sales are controlled by only a few
companies, but negotiators still had to carefully construct a deal
that prevented smaller companies or new ones from ignoring
settlement-imposed price hikes and marketing restrictions.
</P>
<P>

PREVENTING BULLYING: TIPS FOR A GENTLER SCHOOLYARD

   Recent school gun attacks _ there was another one last week in
Oklahoma in which several students were wounded _ have been carried
out largely by boys angry at being picked on by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   In response, educators are redoubling efforts to discourage
student aggression from an early age. And they are turning to tools
like ``Quit It! A Teacher's Guide on Teasing and Bullying for Use
with Students in Grades K-3.'' The manual was published last year
with Department of Education funding and is distributed by the
National Education Association's Professional Library, which
described it last week as a ``very good seller.''
</P>
<P>
   But some aren't impressed. Christina Hoff Sommers, a scholar at
the American Enterprise Institute who is working on a book called
``The War Against Boys,'' ridicules the guide's suggestion that a
game of tag _ yes, tag _ is too aggressive and psychologically
harmful for children.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, she cited ``Quit It!'' as prime evidence
that the United States is becoming the ``republic of feelings,'' in
which people are encouraged to feel victimized and entitled to
redress, and where values like competitiveness, stoicism and the
quest for excellence are shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from the guide.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The introduction outlines the problem of
bullying by citing studies by two of the manual's co-publishers:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Recent research conducted by Educational Equity Concepts and the
Wellesley College Center for Research on Women found that teasing
and bullying are a part of the fabric of daily life for students in
kindergarten through grade three. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Boys initiate most of the teasing and bullying incidents, but
both boys and girls are the recipients;
</P>
<P>
   _ Boys are more likely to respond physically, while girls are
more likely to respond verbally to incidents initiated against
them;
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers and other adults frequently do not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) A prime area of bullying behavior is the
playground, the manual says, where play is unstructured and
competitive games are a problem: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that aggressive playground behavior of
elementary school students is reduced when unstructured play or
competitive games (i.e. where there is a winner or a loser) are
replaced by organized noncompetitive games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) With such research in mind, the manual
recommends kinder, gentler forms of tag _ ``tag with a purpose'':
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In these versions of tag, the focus is shifted away from ``being
chased.'' It is central to all of these games that players are
never ``out.'' Either their roles change or they can be released
back into the game by other players. Sometimes players are on their
own in dodging and running to safety; at other times, they are
helped by one or more people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But first, teacher needs to get in touch
with the students' feelings: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Before going outside to play, talk about how students feel when
playing a game of tag. Do they like to be chased? Do they like to
do the chasing? How does it feel to be tagged out? Get their ideas
about other ways the game might be played. Then, tell them that
they are going to be playing different kinds of tag _ ones where
nobody is ever ``out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) That's right: Today we're playing
``sparrows in the trees.'' Sorry if it's a little more complicated
than plain old tag: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (The game) starts with one student being the ``tagger.'' She/he
stands in the middle of the yard/room/gym. As the other players
(the ``sparrows'') run from one end of the playing area to the
other, the tagger tries to touch them. If they are tagged, they
become ``trees.'' They cannot move their feet, but they can tag the
other players if they come close. When there are only one or two
runners left, the tagger also becomes a tree. When only a few
sparrows are left, it is important to give them the option of
continuing to run or not. Some students love the challenge of
having to go around everyone, but some can feel intimidated.

 &UR; UNDATED: feel intimidated. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Or how about a nice game of ``circle of
friends''? (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A number of students begin as ``taggers'' and can freeze other
students by tagging them on the shoulder. In this version, if a
frozen student calls for help, two students hold hands and form a
circle around her/him. This circle of friends unfreezes the student
so he or she can continue playing. Students can't be tagged while
making a circle.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) To teach conflict avoidance, the manual
recommends play-acting with puppets _ Punch 'n' Judy without the
punching: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Use the puppets to act out the problem up until the point of
conflict. You can show the problem escalating, but don't let the
puppets hit, punch or fight. Instead, simply tell what happened
next or stop the scene at this point.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Then it's time for students to ask the
puppets how they feel: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Encourage them to address the puppets directly _ and have the
puppets respond to them directly. Ask:
</P>
<P>
   What do you think is happening here? What is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   How are the puppets feeling? Can you show us how they are
feeling?
</P>
<P>
   What should the puppets do next? Tell them what you would like
them to do.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever had a problem like this one?
</P>
<P>
   What could the puppets do to keep this problem from happening
again? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Don't censor students' responses _ acknowledge them and have the
puppets explore the potential consequences.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) After an overstimulating time at recess,
daydreaming in school isn't such a bad thing if it's used as a form
of meditation to reduce stress: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Have each student think of a pleasant scene that he or she would
find calming. It might be a beach or a mountain that was visited
during vacation, or it might be a pure fantasy. Assure students
that the choice is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Ask students to think of their chosen scene and then count to 25
slowly. Practice the exercise a few times with the whole class and
then add it to the roster of calming activities that students can
use to relieve tension as a group or individually during the school
day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Above all, don't push the children too
hard, the manual says: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember that all people _ children and
adults _ have varying degrees of comfort with their bodies and in
relation to different types of physical activities. Students should
be encouraged to adapt any physical activity to their levels of
comfort and abilities. No student should be made to do an activity
if she or he is uncomfortable about it.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Americans have never quite figured out Syrian
President Hafez Assad. Most see him as a kind of tyrant, even a
terrorist _ a leader who supports extremists abroad and suppresses
opponents at home. As rendered on those oversized Soviet-style
posters, he can look the part of a dinosaur, a relic from a
pre-global, pre-millennial, pre-New Middle East past.
</P>
<P>
   There is truth to that image; Assad has a record of
ruthlessness, though most of it dates from more than a decade ago.
But he has also ruled with finesse, willing to forgive some foes
when the reward is stability.
</P>
<P>
   Until he took power in a 1969 coup, Syria was fractious; under
Assad, that problem was solved by imposing iron rule rather than
democracy; still, that brought the gift of stability.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Assad has long been seen as the Arab
neighbor with whom Israel most wants to make peace. The reason has
only a little to do with Syria's military strength, which is now
faded, and almost everything to do with Assad himself. More than
any of his Arab counterparts, he is seen as a man who understands
both power and survival. And he has a record of keeping what few
bargains he has struck with Israel. So he is viewed as someone who,
if he made a deal, would make one that sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has a great deal to say about what happens in
Lebanon, which ended its civil war in the 1980s only by turning to
Syria as a power broker and inviting in its army. Lebanon remains a
base for guerrilla attacks on Israel, which keeps control of a
tense buffer zone that is the scene of frequent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, for more than a decade, one of the biggest
questions in the Middle East has been when Assad might see
advantage in aggressively seeking a deal. With the surprise
announcement last week that he was ready to send his foreign
minister to Washington to meet with Israel's prime minister, a new
question looms: Might this really be the moment?
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to think so, and not just because of the
small shift in his stance that opened the way toward peace talks
when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Damascus early
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that shift lies a broader sense not only of new
opportunity, but of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Until early this year, Assad had always carried himself as if
time did not matter. He had prided himself on his refusal to
compromise; to win peace, Israel would have to withdraw from every
inch of the Golan Heights. In recent months, his government had
gone further, saying that even to restart talks, Israel would have
to publicly commit itself to borders that existed before the 1967
war, something Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, would not do.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad is 69 now and clearly ill. Since early this year, he
has seemed preoccupied by a need to cement the position of his son,
Bashar, 34, as his heir apparent, and his decision to return to the
talks without such a public Israeli commitment suggests a further
recognition that it would be foolhardy to wait too long.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Assad feels peace with Israel would guarantee his place
in history. But perhaps more important, it could transform Syria's
domestic environment to his son's advantage. The younger Assad is a
staff colonel, but he has little military experience and lacks the
confidence of the former Baath Party bosses and long-serving
generals. His strength is his close ties with Syria's business
community. So it seems logical that a Syria at peace, with an eye
on prosperity rather than security, would be a far easier place in
which to establish himself in power.
</P>
<P>
   To Syrian ears, another clock has begun to tick more loudly than
ever _ the one marking progress toward a final Israeli-Palestinian
peace. With the Israelis and Palestinians now pledging to wind up
their final peace talks by late next year, Assad does not want to
find himself shut completely out of the circle of peace _ including
decisions to be made on the fate of Palestinian refugees, more than
500,000 of whom now live in Syria or Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The winding down of President Clinton's last term is yet another
ticking clock, this one measuring how long the White House might be
willing to put pressure on Israel to cement Clinton's own legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, of course, has been here before. The talks in Washington
are to begin ``at the point where they left off'' nearly four years
ago, when Israel walked out after Islamic militants launched a
bus-bombing campaign in Israel, soon to be followed by an all-out
conflict in southern Lebanon between Israeli forces and the
Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   That history shows how easily peace can be sidetracked by
violence. But this time, as Assad clearly recognizes, changes in
the Middle East have presented Syria with better opportunities _
particularly in Lebanon _ to untangle itself from its conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-MIDEAST-SYRIA-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; BEIRUT: its conflicts. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As one price for peace, Israel has made clear its demand that
Syria rein in Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrillas whose attacks on
Israeli forces and towns have been used by Damascus to put pressure
on Israel. But doing that is not like turning off a tap.
</P>
<P>
   Armed by Iran and fueled by Iranian-inspired ardor, the
guerrillas are subject only to indirect Syrian control. Four years
ago, a Syrian attempt to shut them down almost surely would have
been met with open rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the Lebanon of four years ago, in part because
Iran, too, has changed. The Revolutionary Guards who once trained
militants in the art of terror in Lebanon's lawless Bekaa Valley
have long since departed. And since Mohammed Khatami assumed Iran's
presidency in 1997, he has been trying to put an end to Iran's
isolation, even though he still faces opposition on that score from
very powerful conservatives. That power struggle in Tehran
presumably gives Assad some room to maneuver if he wants to curb
the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Assad's government warned Palestinian militants
based in Syria that if peace were to come, it would be time to find
a new line of work. Through Bashar Assad, Syria later sent the same
message to Hezbollah. Among diplomats in Lebanon, the betting is
that if peace were to come soon, the message would be heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even if the new road leads to peace, the path is
unlikely to be straight. Syria and Israel have been enemies for 50
years, and much distrust still lies between them. Many skeptics in
Israel and the United States think Assad's opening was just a
sucker bid, intended to lure Israel into a big concession or,
perhaps, to persuade the United States to end sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's associates say he frowns on the theatrics that have come
to be associated with Middle East peacemaking. Still, simply by
dispatching Farouk al-Sharaa, his foreign minister and closest
adviser, to Washington this week, Assad knows that he is sending a
new signal; never before has so a high-ranking a Syrian official
held direct talks with an Israeli delegation.
</P>
<P>
   If Assad himself joins any talks, diplomats here guess, it will
not be until the final moments, when a deal is ready to be signed.
But for the first time in memory, the diplomats say, that prospect
now seems more real than fanciful.

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO
PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)    By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst
<TEXT>
Newspapers &LR;  &QC;  WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian
military officers won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping
as the millennium arrives at midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they
will be guarding against the end of the world. Their concern is the
ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches causing the launch of
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments
have been working to fix the potential Y2K glitches in their
missile systems and early warning defense equipment. And officials
from both countries stress that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K
missile launch is extremely remote. But to reassure a jittery world
public and further cut the risk of a Y2K accident, the governments
of the two nuclear superpowers have set up a joint command center
at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help
protect against such an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly
called Y2K, refers to the possibility that computers programmed to
read only the last two digits of a year might interpret the change
from 1999 to 2000 as going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the
computers to crash; interfering with utility services, banking,
aviation and any other sector that relies computers. While most
essential civilian and military computers in the United States have
been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries, including Russia,
are having difficulties. In fact, the State Department is so
worried about computer troubles there and in three former Soviet
republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of employees through the
New Year period. But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world. Their information will be
collected from a network of radars and satellites operated by the
nearby Cheyenne Moun

PUT THE WORLD IN SOMEONE'S HANDS WITH THESE HOLIDAY BOOKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
and LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's another reason to give books this holiday season: They're
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Give them with the confidence that they won't blow up on Jan. 1.
Of course, recipients may have to read them by candlelight, but
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this dot-com-crazy era, books remain among the most
appreciated of presents. But the bookstores are bulging. What to
buy?
</P>
<P>
   As we do every year, we have scouted the terrain and put
together some suggestions. Most of these books fall into the
category of oversized, coffee-table tomes. But in every case we've
sought out books that engage the mind as well as please the eye.
</P>
<P>
   We've also tried to cast a wide net. You'll find books here on a
score of subjects, from art and fashion to history and travel, to
sport, religion, science and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess the most common word on gift-book covers
this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Century in ...'' politics, photographs, sports. You get
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the best of these looking-back books, along with a list
of also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   Doorstop-of-the-season honors go to ``Century'' (Phaidon,
$49.95), a 1,120-page collection of photographs edited by Bruce
Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   This monster weighs in at 12.7 pounds, contains more than 1,100
photos and comes encased in a box with a handle. Don't give this
one to your uncle with the bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``100 Years of Human Progress, Regression, Suffering
and Hope, 1899-1999,'' this selection is arranged chronologically.
The emphasis is on politics and war _ the ``regression'' and
``suffering'' of the subtitle _ although entertainment and social
trends also receive attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard, a longtime photo editor for British newspapers, made a
deliberate decision to avoid photos we've seen over and over.
Together with its superb production values and reasonable price,
that sets this book apart.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Letters of the Century: America 1900-1999'' (Dial,
$35) may elicit yawns. But make no mistake, this 741-page
collection of letters from people famous and obscure, edited by
Lisa Grunwald and Stephen J. Adler, is a very entertaining book.
</P>
<P>
   Dip in at random and come across Groucho Marx's hilarious
missives describing the plot of ``A Night in Casablanca'' to a
suspicious Warner Bros. legal department, Gen. George Patton's 1940
letter to then-Maj. Dwight Eisenhower promising him a job (``Hoping
we are together in a long and BLOODY war''), and Janis Joplin's
letter to her parents announcing she'd run off to San Francisco to
be a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   In tone and subject, the letters range from the intimate to the
officious, from the foaming to the fawning, from the profound to
the puerile. This is history on a human scale.
</P>
<P>
   Many ``Century'' books suffer from bland, lackluster prose. Here
are two exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of the Century'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35), a joint
project of Time magazine and CBS News, profiles ``100 men and women
who shaped the last 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The selectees are the usual suspects. Fortunately, the profilers
are name writers and journalists who treat their subjects with
sympathy but, for the most part, without awe. You get Salman
Rushdie on Mohandas Gandhi; crime novelist Edna Buchanan on Mafia
don Lucky Luciano; Molly Ivins on Willis Carrier, the man who
invented air conditioning; and Henry Kissinger on soccer star Pele.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles are brief, three to four pages long, and
complemented with well-chosen photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN SportsCentury,`` edited by Michael MacCambridge
(Hyperion, $40), also assembles an all-star cast of contributors,
whose efforts are longer and more essayistic.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Carol Oates takes the measure of Muhammad Ali; Roy Blount
Jr. compares the achievements of Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams;
Thomas Boswell delivers a tough-minded assessment of Pete Rose's
success on the field and moral failings off the field; and Nelson
George writes about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter profiles of other sports figures are shoehorned around
these longer pieces, making for an attractive and satisfying book.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Century of Country: An Illustrated History of Country
Music,'' by Robert K. Oermann (TV Books, $39.95). This is the
companion volume to The Nashville Network's 13-hour documentary
series.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Life: Our Century in Pictures,'' edited by Richard B.
Stolley (Bullfinch, $60). If it wasn't pictured in Life magazine,
it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Times Century of Business,'' edited by Floyd
Norris and Christine Bockelmann (McGraw-Hill, $29.95). Reprinted
Times articles form the basis of this history.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``National Geographic Eyewitness to the 20th
Century''(National Geographic Books, $40). Nice design, with more
text than you find in many surveys.
</P>
<P>
   For the literary-minded, the season brings good tidings: a
wonderful new edition of ``The Oxford Book of English Verse.''
First published at the dawn of the century, ``The Oxford Book of
English Verse, 1250-1900,'' edited by Arthur Quiller-Couch, quickly
established itself as the most popular and influential such
anthology in the language, selling nearly a half million copies
over the next 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   By midcentury, a new edition was needed, and in 1972 Helen
Gardner's ``The New Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250-1950,''
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Now Christopher Ricks has brought the collection up to date with
``The Oxford Book of English Verse'' (Oxford, $39.95), which
includes such postwar figures as Philip Larkin, Ted Hughes and
Seamus Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks also has broadened the coverage somewhat, including more
women (such as Charlotte Bronte) and Scottish poets. He's added
nursery rhymes and a larger helping of dramatic verse. Altogether,
Ricks has assembled some 800 poems covering nearly eight centuries
of British literary history.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of anthologies and textbooks over the years
perhaps has made ``The Oxford Book'' less essential than it once
was. But it remains a richly rewarding assemblage and a handsome,
convenient volume.
</P>
<P>
   If American poetry holds more appeal, consider ``The Poems of
Emily Dickinson,'' edited by R.W. Franklin (Harvard University
Press, $29.95), or ``Walt Whitman: Selected Poems, 1855-1892,''
edited by Gary Schmidgall (St. Martin's Press, $32.50).
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson and Whitman are the godmother and godfather of
American poetry, and there's no shortage of collections of their
work. So what sets these apart?
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's book is the ``reading edition'' of the three-volume
Variorum Edition published in 1998, in which he sorted through the
multiple versions of Dickinson's poems and numerous manuscripts she
left at her death to come up with versions that represent her final
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The new book includes the largest number of Dickinson poems ever
assembled (1,789) and preserves her idiosyncratic spelling,
punctuation and capitalization. Well-printed and attractively
bound, this book is a good value.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his long career, Whitman kept revising the
poems that make up his masterpiece, ``Leaves of Grass.'' Scholars
have long argued that this tinkering marred rather than made the
work _ that the later versions were tamer and more ``refined,''
less vital and exuberant, and that the older Whitman engaged in
what amounted to self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   For this new edition, Schmidgall has assembled more than 200 of
Whitman's finest poems in their earliest published forms,
emphasizing works he wrote early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Two short-story collections would make great gifts. ``The Best
Short Stories of the Century,'' edited by John Updike (Houghton
Mifflin, $28), was published earlier this year but has a new,
festive red cover for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   For this 768-page anthology, Updike selected the ``best''
stories from the annual ``Best American Short Stories'' volumes.
Started in 1915, that series is still going strong today.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of a major American writer who isn't here,
beginning with Ring Lardner, Ernest Hemingway and Katherine Anne
Porter and concluding with Alice Munro, Thom Jones and E. Annie
Proulx. This is a meeting of the giants.
</P>
<P>
   If Updike's book seems a bit fusty and predictable in its
selections, pick up ``The Art of the Story: An International
Anthology of Contemporary Short Stories,'' edited by Daniel Halpern
(Viking, $40). Halpern limited himself to authors born between 1938
and 1970 but considers writers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So you'll find familiar names such as Margaret Atwood, Raymond
Carver and Salman Rushdie, along with fine writers who are hardly
household names in the U.S.: Renaldo Arenas from Cuba, Patrick
Chamoiseau from Martinique and Tatyana Tolstaya from Russia, to
name three of the 78 contributors from 35 countries.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good book for fiction readers who want to broaden
their horizons.
</P>
<P>
   If a picture is worth a thousand words, a map may be worth
10,000. Every household should have a good atlas. There are plenty
on the market. ``The Hammond World Atlas, Third Edition'' ($69.95)
is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This 11-by-14 1/4-inch book, with 312 pages, has large, crisply
rendered maps and a 100,000-entry master index. Complementing the
political maps are new digitized relief maps of the continents and
thematic maps on such topics as population growth, climate and
languages.
</P>
<P>
   This atlas gives us the world as it is today. To get a sense of
how we got here, nothing beats a good historical atlas. ``Atlas of
World History'' (Oxford University Press, $85) is pricey but
up-to-date and truly global in its treatment. The maps are not as
large as those in the ``Times Atlas of World History,'' for
example, but they are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the heavy dose of text, they make up a course in
world history.

<P>
   Three beautiful coffee-table books may fit the bill if you want
a Texas-flavored gift.
</P>
<P>
   First, from the University of Texas Press, there's the
spectacular ``Great Texas Birds,'' edited by Suzanne Winkler and
featuring 48 full-page, full-color paintings by artist John O'Neill
($34.95).
</P>
<P>
   Texas has some 600 species of birds, more than any other state.
O'Neill, who lives in Louisiana, here has limned some of our most
handsome, from the Harris's hawk to the roseate spoonbill to the
yellow-breasted chat. His paintings are highly detailed; the color
printing is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Writers and birders from around the state provide brief essays
to accompany the paintings. John Graves, Stephen Harrigan, and John
and Gloria Tveten are among the contributors. Some pieces emphasize
science, others personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Texas Birds'' is one of those books you pick up and
can't put down.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer nature below your feet to nature above your head,
consider Blair Pittman's ``Texas Caves'' (Texas A&AMP;M University
Press, $34.95).
</P>
<P>
   In color photographs and text, Pittman covers the basics of
Texas caves and cave formations. His goal, he writes, is to reveal
the glories both of ``show'' caves, which are open to the public,
and of ``wild'' caves, which are not.
</P>
<P>
   Third, photographer Peter Brown's award-winning ``On the
Plains'' (Norton, $39.95) captures with sympathy the American
Plains, that flat landscape stretching from Texas to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Brown turns his camera on people, cattle, buildings, the big
land, the bigger sky. His crisp, cleanly rendered color images
suggest less the harshness of the region than its quiet beauty.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Two remarkable books about Africa deserve note.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s ``Wonders of the African World'' (Knopf,
$40) was written to accompany a PBS television series, but it's
important in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who chairs Afro-American studies at Harvard University,
is one of the country's most insightful commentators on the black
American experience.
</P>
<P>
   His well-illustrated book is based on visits to five areas _
Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, northern Sudan and Egypt, East Africa and West
Africa _ to explore the little-understood and underappreciated
cultural achievements of Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Part history, part travelogue, ``Wonders of the African World''
is well-written and intellectually honest. While trumpeting
Africa's past greatness _ the Muslim scholars who gathered in
Timbuktu, the towers of Great Zimbabwe _ Gates doesn't engage in
mere cheerleading; for example, he wrestles throughout his visit
with the role Africans played in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent starting point for anyone who wants to
learn about Africa's past.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most massive new books of the holiday season is
``African Ceremonies,'' a two-volume slipcased set from Abrams
($150). It's much different from Gates' book, recording a world
more rural and traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher have spent 30
years traveling and shooting pictures in Africa. Their book
contains nearly 850 color photographs of ceremonies attached to key
moments in human life: birth and death, courtship and marriage,
royal coronations, seasonal rituals. Many of these ceremonies are
dying out.
</P>
<P>
   Another companion book to an acclaimed PBS series is Ric Burns'
``New York: An Illustrated History'' (Knopf, $60). This 578-page
book, filled with arresting photos, is popular history at its best.
</P>
<P>
   For lovers of science and nature on your list, consider these:
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake'' by Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95) is a gorgeous book.
Like many from this publisher, it combines imaginative design with
bite-size bits of text.
</P>
<P>
   Get up close with the boomslang of southern Africa (favorite
food: chameleon). Discover why snake charmers like the monocled
cobra. Learn your chances of survival if bitten by the West African
green mamba (not good).
</P>
<P>
   From the same publisher comes the ``DK Great Dinosaur Atlas''
($19.95) by William Lindsay, illustrated by Giuliano Fornari.
Readers _ intended to be kids ages 8 and up _ come away with a
vivid sense of the variety of dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   For older readers, there's ``The Simon &AMP; Schuster Encyclopedia
of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures: A Visual Who's Who of
Prehistoric Life,'' revised by Douglas Parker ($40).
</P>
<P>
   Originally published in 1988, this reference work for the
serious student combines succinct scientific descriptions with
superbly rendered color illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``John James Audubon: Writings and Drawings,'' edited by
Christoph Irmscher ($40), is a volume in the acclaimed Library of
America series. Audubon, the 19th-century artist-naturalist best
known for his ``The Birds of America'' lithographs, was also a
prolific writer. This 942-page book includes 45 sketches from his
massive ``Ornithological Biography'' and excerpts from his journals
and letters. Sixty-four color plates give a sampling of his
illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Both birds and machines are the subjects of ``The Miracle of
Flight'' (Firefly, $40). Author-photographer Stephen Dalton
explains in pictures and words exactly how it works.
</P>
<P>
   For real high flyers, there's ``The Planets'' by David McNab and
James Younger (Yale University Press, $35). The companion volume to
an A&AMP;E television series, it describes the birth and evolution of
each planet in our solar system and records efforts by astronomers
to learn more about them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Landmarks in Western Science: From Prehistory to the
Atomic Age'' by Peter Whitfield (Routledge, $35) is a useful survey
of the history of Western scientific developments. The book is
well-illustrated if somewhat dryly written.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press has given us an ``Oxford Companion'' to
many a human activity. The latest addition to the list: ``The
Oxford Companion to Food'' by Alan Davidson ($60).
</P>
<P>
   Not a cookbook but a reference work, this 892-page book has more
than 2,600 entries covering almost every conceivable topic, from
Bedouin diet to offal and octopus, to Spam and Spanish mackerel, to
why we call the Mexican dish ``refried beans'' when the beans are
fried only once. The connoisseur will find this tasty, ample fare.
</P>
<P>
   This book joins ``The Oxford Companion to Wine,'' edited by
Jancis Robinson ($65). Similar in format, it has just been released
in an updated second edition.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer impressive new art books seem to be in stores this year.
One notable exception is ``Victorian Painting'' by Lionel Lambourne
(Phaidon, $59.95).
</P>
<P>
   Long viewed with condescension, Victorian painting has been
attracting more attention in recent years. Lambourne, former head
of paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, aims to
defend it from the charge of sentimentality and to persuade us to
look at it with a fresh eye.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 color illustrations make this 512-page book
pleasing as well as educational.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian imagery filtered through a surrealist sensibility
animates the art of Philip C. Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Now 92, Curtis has a limited reputation outside Phoenix, where
he's lived since 1947. His strange, evocative paintings have been
described as surrealism ``without the snarl and terror'' of Max
Ernst and Salvador Dali.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Dreamer: The Art of Philip C. Curtis'' (Hudson Hills,
$45), a project of the Phoenix Art Museum, is the place to make his
acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of strange, the Getty Museum has combined the lyrics of
Bob Dylan's 1965 downer ``Desolation Row'' with details of Belgian
artist James Ensor's ``Christ's Entry Into Brussels in 1889'' to
create ``The Superhuman Crew'' (J. Paul Getty Museum Publications,
$24).
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't know quite what to make of this, but the book comes
with a CD of Dylan's song, which holds up very well after 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   For more charm, there's ``Fay'' (Hyperion, $26.95), in which
photographer William Wegman pays tribute to his Weimaraner Fay Ray,
who succeeded his first dog, Man Ray, as the subject of his funny,
deadpan photographs. Fay died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many photographs will be familiar to those who have followed
Wegman over the years, but the book is an endearing homage.
</P>
<P>
   An inordinate number of books this season deal with France,
yesterday and today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because France, especially Paris, captured that
midcentury longing for a return to romanticism after the harsh
reality of war. It is a longing that has never quite deserted the
American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Paris lays claim to even a tiny part of someone's heart,
Peter Miller's ``The First Time I Saw Paris'' (Times Books, $30) is
the perfect not-so-big book. When he made his first trip to the
City of Light in the summer of 1954, Miller was a
wet-behind-the-ears 20-year-old from Vermont acting as an assistant
to portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's involvement with photography was almost an accident;
he'd bought his first camera with an insurance check covering the
theft of his hunting rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller returned to Paris several years later as an Army Signal
Corps photographer. Over the next 2 1/2 years, during times he
could sneak away from his Army tasks, Miller took the photographs
that became the basis of this book _ photos on the Rue de la
Huchette in the Latin Quarter and on Rue Mouffetard, steps from
where Ernest Hemingway had lived.
</P>
<P>
   There are photos of pimps and prostitutes on Rue Saint-Denis,
Christian Dior models and homeless ``clochards'' showing off their
tattoos. This was a romantic time in Paris, after World War II,
when the French were still recovering from war and rebuilding their
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   These photos and Miller's picturesque words also trace the
coming of age of a man who would go on to become a reporter for
Life magazine, a respected journalist and author.
</P>
<P>
   A look at France today comes through the images of four
photographers and the words of Marie-France Boyer, Paris editor for
the World of Interiors magazine. In ``Village Voices: French
Country Life'' (Thames &AMP; Hudson, $24.95), Boyer takes us to small
towns in rural France, where there are televisions in the
barbershop and plenty of packaged foods at the grocers. But there
is also a charm strictly French, and Francophiles will relate to
this midsize book.
</P>
<P>
   Another thin-volume picture book is Don Krohn's ``In the South
of France'' (Godine, $45), in which he provides both photographs
and text. While Krohn has taught photography, lectured on law and
traveled extensively in Nepal, Ireland and France, this is his
first book. Color photographs range from grand vistas to the single
doorway, crowds to a cafe table of friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing series, James Bentley dishes up ``The Most
Beautiful Villages of Brittany'' (Thames &AMP; Hudson, $40). A
coffee-table compendium of 251 color photographs by Hugh Palmer,
this book delves into that northwestern peninsula of France that
was home to the Celts and the magical Merlin and the seat of the
Breton language.
</P>
<P>
   Complete with a traveler's guide, the book moves from the craggy
coast and seafood caches to the piety of local churches, to the
park at Chateau de Caradeuc, sometimes called the ``Versailles of
Brittany.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine connection is made here between French Brittany and
English Britain, and there is much to remind one of Ireland as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Desert: The Mojave and Death Valley'' (Abrams, $49.50),
photographer Jack Dykinga shows us a close-up of the drying blades
of a yucca in which one might see the whorls of a bird's-eye maple,
the rings of a cut redwood or the aridness of Mars. But it is only
a yucca.
</P>
<P>
   The image is representative of how Dykinga and writer Janice
Emily Bowers relate the need to preserve and protect the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after passage of the Desert Protection Act, 4 million
people live within 35,000 square miles surrounding the Mojave
Desert, a tough-looking but fragile ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   For an armchair traveler, ``Desert'' is a comfortable way to see
the legendary Joshua tree, the crystallized salt formations of
Death Valley and the carved-looking red sandstone of Red Rock
Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   And for the desert-bound, its stark, almost surreal photos are a
fine initiation to the harshness that is the desert's reality.
</P>
<P>
   For less arid holiday reading, consider the lushness of
``Equator'' (Taschen, $29.99). Milan-born Gian Paolo Barbieri made
his name with his 1960s fashion photographs for Italian Vogue and
has since been ranked among the world's best fashion photographers.
</P>
<P>
   In these images from the Seychelles, islands off the east coast
of Africa, Barbieri combines sex, shape, sea, sky and sun into a
sensual and sometimes erotic study.
</P>
<P>
   As in the cover image of a muscular young man, nude, hoisting a
freshly caught shark above his head, these photos combine nature
with a certain naivete. Nude studies are interspersed with juicy
fruits and fishes that make one think of Erica Jong's
fruits-and-vegetables poetry. Surely the half dozen entwined sea
creatures are merely displayed by the fishmonger, not having an
orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Another book of island observations is ``Archipelago: The
Islands of Indonesia'' (University of California Press, $45), by
Gavan Daws and Marty Fujita. Unlike Barbieri's titillating picture
book, this is a scholarly history of the islands from their
19th-century dissection by field biologist Alfred Russell Wallace
to the 21st-century fate of the area's forests and reefs.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published in cooperation with the Nature Conservancy,
includes maps, archival materials and more than 200 color
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The name Wallace may not ring a bell, overshadowed as he was by
Charles Darwin, but working independently, he also enunciated the
theory of evolution by natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, an explorer and a prodigious collector, was the first
to bring living birds of paradise to the West. From his first
tentative collections of beetles to his adventures in the wilds of
Borneo, his was a scholarly yet exciting life.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that the 17,500 or so Indonesian islands are home
to some 10,000 species of trees as well as one-sixth of all bird,
one-eighth of all mammal and about one-third of all fish species.
Can such biodiversity be preserved with a human population that
will reach 300 million in the next 50 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Penguin'' (Taschen, $24.99), Frans Lanting's land, sea and ice
brush with this most unusual of creatures, is a natural-science
book to treasure, almost as loving a look at these birds as the
children's book ``Mr. Popper's Penguins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchman Lanting has been hailed as one of the best nature
photographers of our time. For ``Penguin,'' he collaborated with
Christine Eckstrom.
</P>
<P>
   From the boisterous rockhoppers of the Falkland Islands to the
king penguins of South Georgia to the emperor penguins of
Antarctica, Lanting and Eckstrom got up close and personal with
their subjects, making this less a natural-history project than an
attempt at getting acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth From Above'' (Abrams, $65) is a big, millennium-perfect
coffee-table book. Aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand worked
for more than five years above 60 countries to record the state of
the world's environment at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   His 170 color photographs are accompanied by essays from
specialists in history, economics, sociology, environmental
science, geography, demography, zoology and anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   Arthus-Bertrand soars so high that the brown-and-white African
landscape looks like sugar frosting on a cinnamon bun, and he
swoops low enough to capture smiles. With the latitude and
longitude of each photograph provided, this is a wonderful keepsake
for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the Atlantic, ``The Houses of Old Cuba'' (Thames &AMP;
Hudson, $45) offers glimpses of a Cuban architectural heritage many
outsiders never see. Author Llilian Llanes, chief curator at the
Museo Wilfredo Lam in Havana, and Caribbean-based photographer
Jean-Luc de Laguarigue show us Cuba's homes, from cabins to
mansions.
</P>
<P>
   They look at the Creole oligarchy of the inland regions, the
dominance of Havana and the details of daily life, customs and
pastimes that surround both. There are no rusting hulks of vintage
cars among these 168 color photos, or diatribes against communism,
merely memories of what was and still is the grandeur of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mayfield and the editors of Southern Accents magazine are
the authors of ``Southern Style'' (Bulfinch Press, $45), a 208-page
book that looks not only at the charming interiors and architecture
of this U.S. region but also at its influence nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   While comfort and elegance may have been sacrificed elsewhere,
in the South they continue to reign with graciousness from the
gardens to the garrets.
</P>
<P>
   Southern style frequently borrows from other cultures _ Chinese
porcelain, French antiques, English-style gardens, and accents from
Latin America, Africa and the Far East _ but puts the pieces
together in a way that recalls an American history.
</P>
<P>
   John Loring, long known as the design director of Tiffany &AMP; Co.,
has published perhaps his best, most beautiful book. ``Tiffany
Jewels'' (Abrams, $60) is the first complete history of Tiffany's
renowned jewels.
</P>
<P>
   From its founding as a stationery and fancy-goods emporium in
1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany, the store has become one of the
world's premier jewelers. With 361 illustrations, most in color,
this book profiles the company's great designers, including Edward
C. Moore, Louis Comfort Tiffany (son of the founder) and Paulding
Farnham.
</P>
<P>
   It follows fine jewelry design through the store's 20th-century
stars _ Jean Schlumberger, Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. There
are newly discovered designs and anecdotes, first lady Eleanor
Roosevelt's Tiffany solitaire diamond engagement ring and Peretti's
``Diamonds-by-the-Yard'' necklace.
</P>
<P>
   This is a book for anyone who loves fine jewelry or likes to
window-shop and dream of dressing like a princess _ or at least
like Elizabeth Taylor.

   Serious observers of fashion will appreciate two new books, each
more words than pictures. ``A Dedicated Follower of Fashion''
(Phaidon, $29.95) is by Holly Brubach, former style editor of the
New York Times Magazine. Now working for Prada in Italy, Brubach
chronicles 20 years in the international fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   In 27 essays published in the '80s and '90s in the New Yorker,
the Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times Magazine, she ranges
from famous designers to designer sunglasses, the Chanel suit to
what she perceives as the recent decline of elegance. Brubach sees
herself as a fashion anthropologist, trying to make sense of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   So does Teri Agins, author of ``The End of Fashion: The Mass
Marketing of the Clothing Business'' (Morrow, $25). To Agins'
credit, she pursues a more businesslike route in investigating this
multibillion-dollar industry _ but then she has, for 10 years,
covered fashion as senior special writer for the Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   One of Agins' hard-hitting accusations is that the fashion press
is subsidized by the industry it covers, with magazines such as
Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and industry newspapers such as
Fairchild's WWD dependent on advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   She dishes the dirt on key players, including Giorgio Armani,
Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Bill Blass, Tommy Hilfiger
and Emanuel Ungaro.
</P>
<P>
   Then she looks at possibilities for the future _ the Gap, J.
Crew, Banana Republic and Zoran, the designer of luxury understated
clothing. (You must read the book to find out how journalist Cathy
Horyn, now fashion critic for The New York Times, ended up riding a
garbage truck back to her hotel _ as a birthday present.)
</P>
<P>
   A defining name of the 20th century is Andy Warhol, documentor
and icon of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   With and without his Dynel fright wig, Warhol stood behind and
in front of the camera, for portraitists or in cramped photo
booths, for Leicas owned by world-renowned photographers or for his
own Polaroid camera.
</P>
<P>
   As a gawky child, he had shunned photographs, but before his
death in 1987, he would become one of the world's most photographed
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Warhol Photography'' (Andy Warhol Museum and Hamburg
Kunsthalle, Edition Stemmle, $75) is the first book to look at the
whole of Warhol's photographic work. This is not a book for the
faint of heart or the casual consumer of culture, but it will be a
welcome edition to the library of any student of 20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Warhol's photography (including nudity and sexual
content), it contains photos of the artist by Richard Avedon,
Robert Mapplethorpe, Cecile Beaton and others, as well as
interviews with Warhol associates and essays by art historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixties'' (Random House, $75), an interesting history of
people who shaped one of the century's most formative decades, is
the product of a 30-year collaboration between photographer Richard
Avedon and writer/interviewer Doon Arbus.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects include John Lennon, Abbie Hoffman, Tennessee Williams,
Tom Hayden, Dr. Benjamin Spock, civil-rights lawyer Florynce
Kennedy, Janis Joplin, Buckminster Fuller, Vietnam War soldiers,
anti-war activists, politicians, people with Hansen's disease and
victims of napalm attacks.

   Annie Leibovitz, as honored in photography circles as Avedon, is
known for her decisive portraits in such magazines as Rolling
Stone, Vanity Fair and Vogue. In ``Women'' (Random House, $75) she
teams with writer Susan Sontag, who translates Leibovitz's images
into word pictures of women at the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Among their subjects are coal miners, dancers, athletes,
military officers, an astronaut, the Kilgore College Rangerettes
and even three Houston socialites _ Pat Breen, Lynn Wyatt and
Caroline Wiess Law.
</P>
<P>
   Sontag and Leibovitz conclude that all is not well with women;
they bemoan that there are countries ``where men have been
mobilized for a veritable war against women'' and where women
scarcely appear at all, in photographs or in public.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brandt (1904-1983) was among the most inventive
photographers of the 20th century. He grew up in Germany and
Switzerland, was an assistant to Man Ray at the height of his
surrealist period, and worked in Paris at the time of Brassai and
Andre Kertesz.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s and '40s, his photojournalistic essays covered the
plight of England's coal miners and industrial workers, then London
during the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   A portraitist for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, Brandt went
on to experiment with poetic images of the English landscape and
with nudes, photographing the human body as if in abstract.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Brandt: The Photography of Bill Brandt'' (Abrams, $75),
Bill Jay and Nigel Warburton gather and reproduce in duotone 378
photographs, grouping them by theme and pairing them with
quotations from Brandt. A survey of Brandt's career and a
discussion of his printing styles complete the book.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Edward Steichen: The Early Years'' (Princeton University
Press and Metropolitan Museum of Art, $60), Joel Smith examines the
career of the painterly photographer from the late 1890s to World
War I.
</P>
<P>
   Praised by Alfred Stieglitz and Auguste Rodin, Steichen at an
early age became a sought-after portraitist of the elite, both in
the United States and abroad. He is known to many for his twilight
views of New York's Flatiron Building and his sequence of moonlight
photographs of the Rodin's sculpture ``Balzac.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked are his erotic nudes and his energetic
portraits of figures such as Richard Strauss and J.P. Morgan. With
much of Steichen's early work, one will find it difficult to
believe that the shadowy, tinted results are indeed photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadlocks garner attention anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dreads'' (Artisan, $35), photographers Francesco Mastalia
and Alfonse Pagano display the modern diversity in this style of
knotted, ropelike locks dating back to the fifth century.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``dreadlocks'' refers not to a hairstyle but to a lack
of hairstyling. In the West, dreads gained popularity with the
Black Power movement, but most cultures recognize the adoption of
dreadlocks as a denunciation of vanity and a sign of the pursuit of
spiritualism.
</P>
<P>
   Mastalia and Pagano traveled to Jamaica, Japan, New Zealand,
Kenya, Namibia, Ethiopia, Angola, Senegal, India and the United
States. In words and photos, they explore the sacred rites of the
natural hair revolution by Rastafarians, Rasta-Buddhists, Maori
warriors, African-Americans, Sadhus, Sikhs and Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Walker, author of ``The Color Purple,'' writes in an
introduction that it was musician Bob Marley who taught her to
trust the universe enough to respect her hair.
</P>
<P>
   She saw Marley perform and wondered what it would be like to
have his ropes of hair or to make love with someone who had them.
Walker went 10 years without combing her hair and learned that,
left to itself, her hair would weave itself into a flat or rounded
pattern shortly after leaving her scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art of the Boot'' (Gibbs Smith, $39.95) is a book for anyone
who ever loved a pair of boots. Texan Tyler Beard, author of ``The
Cowboy Boot Book'' and ``100 Years of Western Wear,'' here examines
the boot as an art form, by no means dying.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in luxury goods and handcrafted leathers, including
boots, is running high. Boots, Beard writes, can be a narcotic for
cowboy wannabes, who see the footgear as the soul of the West,
regardless of whether it descended from Attila the Hun and Genghis
Khan.
</P>
<P>
   The first American cowboys probably wore Wellingtons or Hessian
boots. By 1870, John Cubine of Coffeyville, Kan., had combined the
Wellington and military-style boots for Texas cowboys, adding
leather pull straps, low Cuban heels and slightly rounded square
toes, although no example of a decorated boot in this style exists.
</P>
<P>
   Decorative stitching and high heels emerged in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art of the Boot'' takes off with the highly decorated boots of
the 1930s and '40s, soon standard wear for rhinestone cowboys and
cowgirls. Now artist-designed boots are made for entertainers,
presidents and kings. Learn the names of the great boot designers,
from the Blucher Boot Co. to Tres Outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Not often do you find a book designed primarily for adults that
is a riot of fun. The afternoon Gary Greenberg's ``The Pop-Up Book
of Phobias'' (Morrow, $24.95) arrived in our office, a half dozen
editors hooted, hollered, ughed and oh-nooooed over it like kids.
And we were kids again, remembering all the things that scared the
britches off us in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Take snakes, dentist visits, filthy public toilets ... please!
Ugh. Ick. Phooey. Greenberg takes his short chronicle of phobias
seriously _ as seriously as is possible for a stand-up comedian and
author of the book ``Self-Helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of illustrator Balvis Rubess, pop-up whiz Matthew
Reinhart makes your worst nightmares jump up and out of the book.
The dental drill of dentophobics. The pit of vipers that
ophidiophobics imagine with every step in the woods. Even the evil
clown of coulrophobics, who can usually trace their phobia to a bad
circus experience in early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Short, delightfully evil and oh-so-much fun, this big pop-up
book makes a great gag gift, or a serious one for the phobia-laced
relative whose estate you hope to inherit sooner rather than later.
Merry Christmas, Addams Family. &QL;

A GARDEN OF GOOD READING FOR THE HOLIDAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As garden books poured in from publishing houses these
past months, those by Texans and for Texans began to add up.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a short stack, compiled after reading through
dozens of 1999 first editions, home-grown and from across the
country, that might hold something to please the gardener on your
holiday list.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wild Orchids of Texas'' by Joe Liggio and Ann Orto Liggio
(University of Texas Press, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   We treasure our wildflowers and native plants. But what about
our orchids? They're natives, too. Chances are that few of us
realize that 54 types of orchids grow in various habitats in Texas.
These orchids are terrestrials; their roots grow right in the
various soils of this diverse state. They're not epiphytes like the
majority of orchids in the tropics. Ours may not be as showy, but
they're as beautiful. They possess fascinating forms _ acquired to
attract pollinators. And most come with easy-to-remember common
names so they're less intimidating. The chatterbox orchid, for
example, has a hinged lip that flaps in a breeze. It's found on the
Edwards Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pleasure being introduced to our native orchids through
Ann Orto Liggio's text and Joe Liggio's outstanding photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Their book, apparently a first on the subject, fills a gap in
our plant library. Not all Texas orchid habitats are as plentiful
as they once were, and the authors encourage preservation of orchid
habitats to ensure the survival of these treasures. The impressive
Southern lady's slipper (Cypripedium kentuckiense), with its pale
yellow, pouchlike lip; three birds orchid (Triphora trianthophora);
and green adder's mouth (Malaxis unifolia), all found in the moist
pine-hardwood forests of East Texas, are much rarer now.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering these orchids in the Liggios' book is a treat that
could only be overshadowed by spotting one in its natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Texas Wildscapes: Gardening for Wildlife'' by Noreen Damude
and Kelly Conrad Bender (Texas Parks and Wildlife Press, $24.95,
distributed by University of Texas Press).
</P>
<P>
   More gardeners are transforming traditional landscapes into
wildscapes that will provide a habitat for wildlife squeezed out by
urban development. In doing so, they also enjoy a livelier garden
filled with flowers and berries.
</P>
<P>
   This guide is useful to those who would like to offer wildlife
food, cover and water. Its thorough approach includes design
illustrations, a wealth of information on plants native to Texas'
10 ecological regions, chapters on Texas birds and other critters,
a glossary and a list of resources.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would like recognition for creating a wildscape
that attracts and supports wildlife, there's an application form to
become an Official Texas Wildscape Site, a program offered by Texas
Parks and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The American Lawn,'' edited by Georges Teyssot, Princeton
Architectural Press, $52.95.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're bent on creating a wildscape, this collection of
essays on the American lawn, that great patch of green that lies at
the heart of our culture, is thoughtful, carefully researched and
entertaining. In this below-the-surface presentation, architects,
historians and theorists clue us in to the political, historical,
psychological, literary and artistic significances of our turf.
</P>
<P>
   We learn of our mowing ancestors and how the lawn came to
symbolize the self-sufficient American's dream of control. How the
lawn, the green plot that connects individual to community, became
the great equalizer. There are governmental lawns, palace lawns,
suburban lawns.
</P>
<P>
   We read how we have used the lawn not only as a domesticized
extension of our home _ our outdoor carpet _ but as an element of
pastoral romanticism in parks, and, thanks to renowned landscape
architect Frederick Law Olmsted, as therapeutic grassy surfaces. We
use green, velvety surfaces in cemeteries and outdoor theaters and
on tennis courts, bowling greens, polo fields, football fields and
golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, one essayist tells us, the front lawn was
the face of the nation _ keeping up the front lawn meant keeping up
the morale of those at home and in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the image of the American male pouring his heart and soul
into the greening of his lawn may be fading as we raise the flag of
low-maintenance gardening. But the lawn is a living key to our
collective psyche.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe it, check out the failure-to-cut-the-grass
court cases, along with a pair of 3-D glasses, in the back of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Gardens of the Imagination: A Literary Anthology,'' edited
by Sophie Biriotti and illustrated by Peter Malone (Chronicle
Books, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   In this collection of prose and poetry, with some of the most
fascinating illustrations out there today, we find Lewis Carroll's
Alice talking to Tiger-lily, Daisy and Rose in the Garden of Live
Flowers. In most gardens, we learn, ``they make the beds too soft,
so that the flowers are always asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   We hear Mary Lennox's voice breaking the years-old stillness in
an excerpt from Frances Hodgson Burnett's ``The Secret Garden.'' We
see Vita Sackville-West visualizing a garden of white pansies,
peonies and irises.
</P>
<P>
   We disappear into the mystical images of the hanging Gardens of
Babylon and Kubla Khan's Xanadu as we wander through gardens of
paradise, love and temptation.
</P>
<P>
   This exquisite book is a gift for either literary or gardening
types.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Beautiful American Rose Gardens'' by Mary Tonetti Dorra
(Clarkson Potter/Publishers, $40).
</P>
<P>
   Two Texans are included among the 24 rose enthusiasts in this
coast-to-coast look at rose gardens. Houston artist David Caton has
a thing for Texas natives _ and old roses. The fragrant, persistent
bloomers are beautiful elements in his paintings and complementary
partners to the graceful grasses and succulents that grow in this
rose rustler's atypical, colorful and abundant suburban garden.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth philanthropist Anne Bass' intense interest in
horticulture is reflected in her sumptuous landscape, which was
designed by the late Russell Page. The vast grounds were his only
Texas creation. Bass was not initially interested in roses, but
once she discovered the blooms, she worked with Page to gather a
great collection of roses that could withstand the Texas climate.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to these vastly different Texas rose gardens; to a Los
Angeles garden created by Dan Kiley, the ``dean of American
landscape architecture''; to those of the South, is an inspiration
to any gardener. The authors include design plans, gardeners' tips
and a source list to reinforce that inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Clutius Botanical Watercolors: Plants and Flowers of the
Renaissance'' by Claudia Swan, (Harry N. Abrams, Inc. Publishers,
$45).
</P>
<P>
   The botanical watercolors reproduced in this book offer a
stunning short course in botany. Such late-16th-century paintings
were not just pretty pictures but teaching aids in the medical
field. Plants were used to soothe headaches, colds and more serious
ailments, and visual identification was crucial. Renderings of
roots, foliage, flowers and seeds are presented in exquisite
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The images include plants found in a pleasure garden, the
kitchen garden and in the wild and are selected from some 1,800
watercolors included in a multivolume account of the plant world,
``Libri picturati,'' used by Netherlands pharmacist Theodorus
Clutius while employed at Leiden University during the last decade
of the 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   The opening pages are a written account of Clutius' painted
herbarium. Those that follow are so pretty you'll be tempted to
tear them out and frame them.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Tranquil Garden: Creating Peaceful Spaces Outdoors,''
from the editors of County Living Gardener, text by Kay Fairfax,
photography by Clive Nichols (Hearst Books, $30).
</P>
<P>
   Just looking at the cover of this book is calming.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners have a long list of choices in creating a refuge _ a
formal garden, a romantic garden, perhaps a water garden. This book
helps assess spaces and needs, then guides the gardener through
such aspects of gardening as composition, color and balance to
successfully create that choice. The third section of the book is a
look at the details of a garden _ arbors, walls, statuary, lighting
and containers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better Homes and Gardens ``New Junior Garden Book'' by Felder
Rushing (Meredith Books, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   Felder Rushing is known to many adult gardeners through his
books and lectures. He also gardens with his two children in
Mississippi, and many of the cool projects in this
not-for-kids-only book are found on the Rushing home front. The
Jurassic Jungle _ a garden in a sweater box complete with moss,
ferns and toy dinosaurs _ is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Soil, tools, safety, a plant-related glossary, worms and other
critters, recycling and all the fun things about gardening keep
this book jumping.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Other notable Texas-based garden books published this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ The paperback edition of ``Edible and Useful Plants of Texas
and the Southwest'' by Delena Tull (University of Texas Press,
$24.95) is a good choice as well. Give the book and a jar of
prickly pear or persimmon jelly _ just follow the recipes in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lowe's ``Texas Gardening Handbook'' by Dale Groom (Integra
Color Press, $19.95). The year-round guide is available at Lowe's
Home Improvement Warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Great Garden Sources for Texans'' by Nan Booth Simpson and
Patricia Scott McHargue (Eakin Press, $17.95). This is a useful
compilation of sources _ from inspiration to tools to plants to
public gardens.

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A cornucopia of other people's stuff
 &HT;    (For release Dec. 15, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that to have a memento from a famous or infamous
person was to have something rare; a conversation piece. In this
last decade of the 1900s, however, it is rare that someone isn't
collecting mementos _ either for prestige, nostalgia or money.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, more than 350 people turned out in San Diego to
bid for the possessions of the members of the Heaven's Gate cult
whose 39 in-house fanatics did away with themselves in a mass
suicide. The most alluring relic: the bedframes from the beds in
which the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the Las Vegas Elvis auction in October in which
someone paid $8,000 for Presley's sixth-grade report card. Why do
you figure Elvis saved that card _ D's in math and geography, A in
music?
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, neither me nor my closest friends salted away the
baseball cards that came inside a pack of bubble gum. Instead, we
swapped and/or gambled them. But to put them into a protective
plastic sleeve with the thought of future sales never dawned on us.
</P>
<P>
   What's that old Honus Wagner baseball card worth today? About a
quarter-million dollars to collectors who would, upon getting it,
hide it in some safe deposit box until such time as it is sold to
another investor for even more money and put in someone else's
safety deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   I once had a business-sized card signed by Babe Ruth; have no
idea what happened to it. I also wonder what my Goose Goslin
first-ever fielder's glove would fetch today, if still it existed.
Likely little because few can recall the old Washington
Senators/Detroit Tigers outfielder who played his last major-league
game in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   When WWII ended, a returning relative bestowed upon me a German
officer's bayonet and helmet. My mother had no reverence for
mementos or anything else lying around the house. While I was in
the service, she got rid of them as horrible reminders of Nazi
atrocity. In doing that, she also dumped my 1891 Spalding Baseball
Guide; arghh!
</P>
<P>
   In New York tomorrow (Thursday) night, some of Princess Diana's
jewelry is to be auctioned. Who it is that put the jewels _ a
necklace and matching earrings _ up for sale is unknown to me but
there is an interesting footnote to an advertisement for the event:
``Proceeds in part to support UNICEF.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same with the Elvis auction. Proceeds from that were
to go toward building housing for Memphis's homeless. And the
proceeds from the Heaven's Gate auction were designated to repay
the families of the cult members for their burial expenses.
</P>
<P>
   One can investigate which percentages actually went to the
designees but that's not what I'm into right now. What intrigues me
is our penchant to pay for, to possess, to frame or otherwise
display, mementos of people we've never met.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around my den at home, everything on the walls _ and
there is much there _ is something I associate with: A 1948 Boston
Braves banner (I'm a longtime Braves fan), two military discharges,
caps of my favorite sports teams, a couple of awards I won and a
framed poster of the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, which I
attended.
</P>
<P>
   There is no room for Elvis's sixth-grade report card on my
walls, or a Heaven's Gate bed in my guest bedroom. And there isn't
money enough to buy Diana's necklace for my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of prints of great and not-so-great paintings, our
hallway walls are covered with photos of our children, our
grandchildren, our parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, I'm into collecting, but only as the nostalgia is
directed inward.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder about the guy who bought the Heaven's Gate bed frame.
He told the media he would put it in his guest bedroom. When he was
asked if ever he would sleep in it, he answered: ``Absolutely
not!''
</P>
<P>
   How do you think he'll handle the guest? Will he tell him that
the bed he's going to sleep in was one in which a Heaven's Gate
member committed suicide, or will he keep it to himself as he
sardonically chuckles off to his own bed, maybe one in which an
aging George Washington might have had a continence problem?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A man, a plan, a canal _ communists!
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chinese communists are coming! The Chinese communists are
coming!
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long dry spell, but finally there's a juicy new
lunatic right-wing conspiracy theory to entertain us, and just in
time to add to the general hilarity and joy kicked up by the sundry
agitated millennial hysterias.
</P>
<P>
   The chicoms, it seems, are about to take over the Panama Canal.
Once there, they will, of course, install nuclear missiles and
attack us. Indeed, there are already reports _ Reports! no less _
that Chinese military personnel have been sneaked into the
Panamanian population. Panamanians apparently are unable to tell
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   All this goes back to the decision by that traitor, President
Jimmy Carter, to give the canal away. Never mind that our overt
colonialism in the canal zone had become untenable in a sharply
changed world, that the concession to Panama was a graceful
substitute for the otherwise inevitable turmoil that would have had
the same outcome or that by making the gesture, Carter vitalized
our deteriorating relations with much of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The harumphing opponents of the treaty have never reconciled to
Panamanian control of the canal and now are running about and
shouting ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   The excuse for these antics is the contract Panama awarded a
Hong Kong company, Hutchinson-Whampoa Ltd., to operate the canal's
port facilities. The John Birch Society, which has been seeing
communists under the bed since the four-poster was invented, a few
retired military throwbacks and a handful of off-the-chart
Republicans in Congress say the company is cover for the Chinese
government, which you can tell just by looking at billionaire Li
Ka-shing, who heads the company and is actually Chinese, so there
you are.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Hutchinson-Whampoa is a well-established international
company, publicly traded, with operations in 24 countries,
including contracts to run Britain's three largest ports. It won
the Panama contract in competitive bidding. Its top manager in
Panama is British, his No. 2 is American and none of the 500
employees is Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Into the bargain, Panamanians, not Hutchinson, will be running
the canal, as for all practical purposes they have for the past 10
years. And thanks to Carter's foresight, Washington retains the
right to act militarily to protect the canal, a grant that probably
would have been denied if we had had to cede control under
political siege conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, proving the left yields nothing to the right in
paranoia, a Memphis jury wasted no time, just three hours after a
loosey-goosey civil trial, in deciding that because he opposed the
Vietnam War, Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by a conspiracy
involving a bunch of local marginals, some Memphis cops, the FBI,
the Mafia and the U.S. military. And maybe the Tooth Fairy.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but let's just bank that one for now. We can pull it out for
comfort when the next shortage of loopiness hits.

TOBEY MAGUIRE HAS BECOME AN ACTOR TO WATCH 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Who is this Tobey Maguire?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hollywood will roll out several big, expensive,
prestigious holiday films, and two of them star a 24-year-old actor
many moviegoers don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules,'' a warm and thoughtful adaptation of
John Irving's best seller directed by Lasse Hallstrom (``My Life as
a Dog''), stars Maguire as Homer Wells, a naive young man who
leaves the orphanage of his youth to discover joy and pain in the
outside world. Maguire gets support from co-stars such as Michael
Caine, Kate Nelligan and Jane Alexander. He even gets to romance
Charlize Theron.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Ride With the Devil,'' a Civil War epic told from a
youthful perspective, stars Maguire as Jake Roedel, a Southern teen
who joins a guerrilla band for four cruel years of fighting. Ang
Lee (``Sense and Sensibility'') directed a cast that includes Skeet
Ulrich, Jeffrey Wright, James Caviezel, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and
Jonathan Brandis. The leading lady in this one is singer Jewel, in
her feature-film debut.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expensive productions built around Maguire's
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, a native of Santa Monica, Calif., is not a newcomer. He
started acting when he was 13, and his long list of films includes
Lee's ``The Ice Storm'' and Woody Allen's ``Deconstructing Harry.''
Last year he had a breakout lead in ``Pleasantville,'' playing a
modern teen transported into a black-and-white 1950s TV-sitcom
world.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire showed up for Toronto International Film Festival
interviews dressed in a black T-shirt, black jeans and sneakers,
yawning and looking like a kid who'd been up all night. Maybe he
had: He certainly had reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' and ``Ride With the Devil'' are films
of the kind young actors pray for: big productions with good casts
and top directors.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, Maguire has a low-key presence. But he also
conveys perception, even wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   He's much the same in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great insight into human psychology,'' Hallstrom said
of his ``Cider House'' star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost intimidating, the way he sees through you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire is also, at times, reticent. When asked what
characteristic or talent made important directors want him in their
films, his answer was simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged to elaborate, Maguire interrupted, not impolitely but
firmly: ``Look, really, I'm just not going to answer that question,
because I don't know and I wouldn't want to speculate on that. Who
knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobey has this combination of childish innocence and a very
old soul,'' the director said during a recent visit to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Pleasantville,'' ``The Cider House Rules'' and ``Ride
With the Devil'' are vastly different from one another, Maguire's
characters in them show important similarities. All are
inexperienced young men thrust into new worlds whose events they
observe and absorb rather than shape.
</P>
<P>
   When a Maguire character does take control of a situation _ as
in ``Ride With the Devil'' when Roedel stops his fellow guerrillas
from murdering innocent citizens _ it comes as a surprise and a
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what the part requires,'' Maguire said. ``It would make
sense to say that, but it's much more complicated in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   If Maguire is reluctant to talk about his screen persona,
Hallstrom is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobey's main interest is the understated performance, which is
something I really appreciate,'' Hallstrom said. ``As an actor, he
works on being emotionally present, so he can respond. He really
works hard on experiencing the proper emotion of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't manipulate what kind of expression comes from that.
He trusts that if he is emotionally present in the moment, that
will convey enough for him to make the right choices in the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he portrays Homer (in ''The Cider House Rules``), he's
lived an isolated life in the orphanage. When he goes out into the
world, it's like a new planet for him, but he doesn't want to
reveal what kind of wonderment he is feeling and experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the restraint seen in these films, and in this interview, a
matter of acting choices or just the way he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see,'' Maguire said, as though he had a secret. ``I
don't want to put any limitations on myself. I look forward to
challenges in my life and career and want to do my best to surprise
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing he had been less than forthcoming, Maguire smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to challenge you,'' he teased. ``It's strange for me,
talking to journalists. I think there tends to be so many labels
for things, and I don't think that way, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire was more talkative about his attitude toward work. He
likes acting ... sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm a kid, and half of me doesn't want to be working
anyway. What young person really wants to go to work every day? And
it's really a lot of responsibility. You have to show up. I've been
dead sick where, if it was some other kind of job, I would take the
day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Ride With the Devil,' there was this day where they would
yell `Cut' and I would jump off the horse, lay with my face in the
dirt,'' he said, adding a convincing moan. ``And they'd say, `Mount
up.' People would help me up and get me on the horse and
`Yahaahhh!' for days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me would prefer to be just hanging out, doing other
things. I'm a single guy, I don't have children to support, I don't
have a high cost of living. So now's the time to take my time and
choose wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to work, particularly early in my career, I want
to work with people I am going to learn from. I want to be involved
in movies that really make me want to show up for work.''
</P>
<P>
   He cringed at the suggestion that his choices have been
calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat calculated, but I hate to create that
perception. I think about it. I want longevity. I want to work with
great people. I want to be regarded as, you know, at least a decent
actor with a decent body of work 20 or 30 years from now. But most
of all I want to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   In making ``Ride With the Devil,'' much of what Maguire learned
was how miserable it would have been to be a Civil War guerrilla.
It was a long, rough shoot, much of it spent in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out there,'' he said. ``There were no trailers. We
were in the mud, on horses. We were all dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were better than the real (Civil War) guys. I
mean, I still went back to a house at the end of the night and ate
some food. But it's a great thing to get as close to something as
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   What he really liked was learning to ride. At first he was
intimidated by horses, but he soon learned to love them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about acting _ you get to learn about
things and experience things. Like learn how to pick apples and how
to make cider for ''The Cider House Rules.`` Learn a little bit
about the psychology of hand-to-hand combat (for ''Ride With the
Devil``).''
</P>
<P>
   Another bonus is getting screen romances with Jewel and Theron.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that way,'' he said. ``I get to experience the
perception that I made love to Charlize Theron.''
</P>

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

TEXAS PARKS PLAN A NATURAL LEGACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ From Caddo Lake to the Guadalupe Mountains, Texas' 122
marvelously diverse state parks and 50 wildlife management areas
are envied nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And yet during the past decade, even as millions of visitors
enjoyed a wealth of outdoor pursuits and historical treasures,
Texas Parks and Wildlife Executive Director Andrew Sansom says,
``We've barely been able to keep up with what we've got. We've
spent much of our efforts fixing toilets and sewer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to figures that show Texas ranks 49th among the 50
states in public spending to operate parks ($1.79 per person
compared with a national average of $4.81), Sansom says, ``It's a
credit to Texas that it can produce the kind of resources and
venues it does from that amount of support. But as proud as we are,
it shouldn't be interpreted that we don't need help. We do. Our
people are desperately stretched. Some parks are underfunded.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BLUEPRINT FOR MILLENNIUM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the inspiration for Lone Star Legacy _ a blueprint for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest program we've ever undertaken,'' Sansom says
of an endeavor _ begun last year and now taking firm shape _ that
combines public and private funds and spreads to every corner of
the state. The initial campaign (a partnership between Texas Parks
and Wildlife and the private, nonprofit Parks and Wildlife
Foundation of Texas) hopes to raise $25 million on behalf of more
than 200 parks, wildlife management areas, fish hatcheries and
educational facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Legislature has led the way with recent
appropriations,'' Sansom says. ``Now it's time to reach out to
Texans who care about preserving and enhancing our natural and
cultural resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond providing assistance to existing sites, the program
focuses on five new projects, including Austin's Woods Habitat
Area, steeped in history and a primary stopover for migratory birds
in Brazoria County.
</P>
<P>
   Also planned:
</P>
<P>
   _ The World Birding Center in the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Texas Rivers Center in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government Canyon State Natural Area near San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   _ Re-establishment of the Texas State Bison Herd _ now numbering
only about 30 animals _ at Caprock Canyons State Park near
Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAVING AUSTIN'S WOODS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prototype is the George Bush Gallery of the National Museum
of the Pacific War, which opened in June as part of the Admiral
Nimitz Museum and Historical Center in Fredericksburg. ``It's the
perfect model,'' Sansom says, ``in that public and private funding
were combined to develop an outstanding facility.''
</P>
<P>
   At Austin's Woods _ so named because Stephen F. Austin founded
his colony there in 1820 _ the restoration of a cabin built from
native cedar in 1826 already is under way. ``It's probably the
oldest Anglo structure in the state,'' Sansom says.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Austin's Woods will combine the Nannie M.
Stringfellow Wildlife Management Area (along County Road 316 south
of Sweeney) and Peach Point Wildlife Management Area (south of
Texas 6 and east of Freeport) and encompass 6,745 acres of
bottomland hardwood forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dense, old-growth forest that occurs nowhere else
but Wharton, Matagorda, Brazoria and Fort Bend counties,'' Sansom
says. ``And, of course, that's where most of this area's population
growth is concentrated. Of all the (endangered) habitat in Texas,
I'm most alarmed by the Austin's Woods area.''
</P>
<P>
   Preservation measures are ongoing, and Sansom says, ``We are
also creating a living history and interpretation program there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that 460 million individual birds fly through this
region every year. I'd like to see us build aerial boardwalks where
visitors can walk at tree-top level and best see the birds. Texas
has nothing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ambitious project, the World Birding Center, is touted
as the first of its kind in the nation and dedicated to providing
world-class viewing, innovative environmental education, habitat
conservation and regional economic development of sustainable
nature tourism.
</P>
<P>
   A 15,000- to 20,000-square-foot visitors facility adjacent to
Bentsen-Rio Grande State Park near Mission is scheduled to open in
2002. Also planned are interpretive centers at Brownsville and
Weslaco; welcome centers in Edinburg and Harlingen; and at least
five satellite locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, we anticipate satellite locations operating on both
sides of the (U.S.-Mexico) border,'' Sansom says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what we are calling satellites may be as simple as a
beautiful wetland and kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other aspect of nature or outdoor travel has expanded as
much in the last decade as birding. Texas is now the largest
birding destination in the world. We've got the greatest bird
diversity, and it's easily accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Birding's economic impact on some of Texas' poorest counties
can't be understated either, Sansom says. For each 10,000 visitors
attracted to the region through the World Birding Center, an
estimated $8.5 million boost to the local economy is projected.
</P>
<P>
   A prime goal, too, is generating more interest in outdoor
activities among the predominantly Hispanic residents of this
region and among Hispanics, African-Americans and other minorities
throughout Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see studies that show Texas diversifying so
much in the next century,'' Sansom says. ``Our concern is that
Hispanics and African-Americans tend to be among the lowest
segments of the population in participation in outdoor activities,
and we need to work hard to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansom cites urbanization and economics among factors but says,
``We need to do a better job of interpreting Hispanic and
African-American history at our sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct minority involvement also is being stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the leadership in the World Birding Center is
Hispanic,'' Sansom says. ``And by its economic impact, the birding
center will attract the attention of people who wouldn't otherwise
be involved.''

TESTS ON POINSETTIAS SHOW PLANTS ARE SAFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Is the poinsettia poisonous? Can I cut the flowers
and use in a vase? How do I stop the stem from bleeding?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to many toxicity tests, there is no evidence that
ingestion of any part of the poinsettia causes death or even
serious injury, and in 1975 the Consumer Product Safety Commission
declared the plant nontoxic.
</P>
<P>
   The poinsettia, of course, is not grown for food, and being a
nonfood product, it may cause minor discomfort if eaten, according
to the Society of American Florists, a group that has launched its
own study of possible poinsettia toxicity. The group refers to the
Poinsindex Information Service, used by poison control centers
nationwide, a 50-pound child would have to ingest 500 poinsettia
bracts to surpass experimental doses, which were not toxic at those
levels.
</P>
<P>
   You can cut the ``flowers'' and use them in a vase, but most
have found the colorful bracts won't last much longer than a day or
two.
</P>
<P>
   You can stop the milky sap from oozing from the end of a freshly
cut poinsettia stem by touching it with a flame or inserting it
into fine sand.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please help me out on a bird of paradise. This plant was
given to me, and I know nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not sure which bird of paradise you have, and since two
other gardeners have recently asked about bird of paradise, here's
a little information on plants commonly called bird of paradise:
</P>
<P>
   ``Strelitzia reginae'' is a tropical plant with bananalike
foliage and exotic orange, blue and white flowers that resemble
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caesalpinia gilliesii'' is a shrub or small tree that grows
quickly to about 10 feet and has light-yellow flowers with 3- to
5-inch red stamens and feathery blue-green foliage. Butterflies
love this plant, and I understand the stamens have been used as a
saffron substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``S. reginae'' is native to South Africa, grows to 4 or 5 feet
in height and prefers a well-draining, fertile soil. It likes
moisture during the growing season but drier conditions while
dormant. Give it sun to light shade.
</P>
<P>
   This bird of paradise will not bloom until it's mature and has
formed a large clump, which may take a few years. To encourage
flowering when the plant is more mature, regularly apply a
fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus and potassium.
Cool winter temperatures are said to help flowering once a plant is
mature. Dense, crowded plants bloom best, and container plants
flower best if somewhat root-bound. While ``S. reginae'' may
survive a dip to the mid-20s, it's best to protect it during
freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The less commonly seen ``S. nicolai'' is the giant or
white bird of paradise and may reach 30 feet. The 5- to 10-foot
bananalike leaves are displayed fanwise on the trunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. gilliesii'' is easy to grow and likes sun and a
well-draining soil. You might apply a little fertilizer twice
during the growing season, but otherwise this plant needs little
care. If problems arise, it's likely the plant is receiving too
much shade or moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Native to Argentina, it has now made parts of Texas and Mexico
home. Mulch heavily, and the tender ``C. gilliesii'' is likely to
return from the roots after a cold winter.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking a source for ``C. gilliesii'' might ask a local
nursery that carries native plants when supplies will be available.
Seed can be ordered from J.L. Hudson, Seedsman, Star Route 2, Box
337, La Honda, Calif. 94020. The catalog is $1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought gardenias bloomed only once a year, but mine has
new buds. Isn't this unusual?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are many gardenia selections, and while some bloom in
late spring, others flower in summer, some spring to fall, even
during a mild winter.
</P>
<P>
   I recently saw potted ``Gardenia jasminoides'' `Veitchii,' a 3-
to 4-foot compact shrub, in bloom. The double flowers are 1 to 2
inches across. G. jasminoides radicans `Daisy' is another compact
repeat bloomer. It's highly fragrant.

MORE DEBATE EXPOSURE COULD HELP BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the game of lowered expectations that we call
presidential ``debates,'' Gov. George W. Bush survived his first
two challenges, and his supporters breathed huge sighs of relief.
</P>
<P>
   His performances would have earned him a ``C-minus'' or worse
from many high school speech teachers, but his White House campaign
is still alive and well because he didn't say or do anything
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for building confidence in the process by which
Americans will select the next leader of the Free World?
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, none of the Republican contenders have been
oratorical superstars in their joint appearances _ except for Alan
Keyes, a professional radio talk show host and professional
presidential candidate, whose campaign is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight was on Bush, the perceived front-runner who
had skipped three earlier forums with his five Republican opponents
before finally joining them in recent days for two nationally
televised appearances from New Hampshire and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A third forum that also will include Bush is scheduled this week
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers took advantage of the Texas governor's
strong leads in public opinion polls and fund raising to skip the
earlier events.
</P>
<P>
   They obviously wanted to avoid, as long as possible, a
high-profile setting in which Bush could be flustered or duped by
one of his opponents into committing a campaign-crippling gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   And a second reason may have been to avoid or postpone exactly
what has happened in the wake of the governor's first two debate
appearances, a spate of speculation in the media that Bush isn't
experienced enough or intellectual enough to be president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation, fanned by Bush's opponents, spun off from the
governor's lackluster debate performances, including his moments of
discomfort in the spontaneous setting and his tendency to recite
well-worn passages from his campaign stump speech as if he were
afraid _ or unable _ to depart from his basic script.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates mostly stuck to their basic messages as well,
but expectations were higher for the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush generally kept his poise as he parried numerous challenges
from his opponents, but he definitely needs more practice as a
debater.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching his presidential campaign, he had participated
in only two political debates, one each in his 1994 and 1998
gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   It it not entirely fair to judge a presidential candidate's
intellect and leadership abilities by his performance on the debate
stage. But presidents must be able to make sound decisions under
pressure, and voters deserve an opportunity to view and hear
would-be presidents facing off in a setting that is more-or-less
spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   It is as close to spontaneous as we're going to get, anyway,
even though any real debate among major contenders is disrupted by
a restricted format and the inclusion of minor candidates who don't
have a chance of winning election to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have been better off participating in the debates from
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   That would have given him more practice and maybe reduced some
of the anticipation _ and expectations _ that seemed to build each
time the governor was a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, who is giving Bush a tough fight for the Feb.
1 New Hampshire primary, was pretty flat in the first joint
appearance of the Republican candidates in the Granite State in
late October. Bush missed that forum, which was televised only in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Three debates later, McCain was much more relaxed and confident.
And he performed much better than Bush, who was making his first
joint appearance with his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally with Bush's first two debate appearances, new
polls showed McCain overtaking Bush among Republican voters in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's debate performances may not be the main reason he has
lost ground in that key nominating state, because McCain also has
been campaigning harder than Bush there. Bush is trying to run a
national campaign, while McCain has been more selectively picking
his targets.
</P>
<P>
   But the debates most likely were a factor in Bush's slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still clearly the candidate to beat for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He still leads in financial resources and national polls, and
McCain has all but ceded Iowa, another key, early nominating state,
to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the post-debate fallout could be a wake-up call for Bush, if
he needs one.

   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the worldill

that would alert them to missile launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.

   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center foely to
be culled from Russia's strategic rocket force, an elite branch of

   The center also has a certain public relations mission.

COSMETIC SURGERY SPEEDS THE EMOTIONAL HEALING IN BREAST
RECONSTRUCTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo and graphic available on NYT database) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kathy Park and her daughter were drinking a glass of
wine at a restaurant recently while waiting for a table. A man
struck up a conversation with Park and mentioned that he'd recently
lost his brother to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Park confided that she had been diagnosed with cancer as well.
In 1998, she told him, she had a double mastectomy, followed by
breast reconstruction. Park saw the man's gaze shift down to her
sweater, and then he said, ``I know you don't know me, and I don't
know you, but if I can say one thing _ they did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   In different circumstances, Park, 47, might have been offended,
but in this case, she just laughed. ``Cancer makes you appreciate
life a lot more,'' she says. ``When you find out you have the
disease, you feel like your life might be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the mastectomy and you come out looking close to
what you looked like before, it makes you very thankful that
medical technology is what it is today. A long time ago, women
didn't have this choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, women devastated by a cancer diagnosis came out
of surgery feeling even more discouraged, with one breast or both
replaced by a jagged scar.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more and more women go into the operating room for a
mastectomy and wake up with the beginnings of a new breast,
fashioned entirely from their own tissue or with implants. An
increasing number of surgeons are becoming comfortable with
immediate reconstruction. In the past, reconstruction was completed
only after chemotherapy and radiation. Breast cancer survivors say
reconstructive surgery is a major step forward in the healing
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get there faster if you look normal,'' says
Carrie Wood, 41, a breast cancer survivor who volunteers at
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
``That's what the reconstructive surgeons do. They give you back
what you lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Several breast-reconstruction procedures are commonly offered by
plastic surgeons. In Texas, health insurance companies have been
required to pay for breast reconstruction for mastectomy patients
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Park had what is known as a ``free TRAM flap.'' This is a highly
technical procedure in which a football-shaped section of skin, fat
and muscle is taken from the lower abdomen and relocated to the
breast area. (TRAM stands for Transverse Rectus Abdominus
Musculocutaneous.) In Park's case, the tissue was augmented by
implants to match her former size.
</P>
<P>
   Flaps also may be taken from the buttock or the back. When taken
from the back or abdomen, the surgeon can leave the flap attached
to its blood supply and create a passageway beneath the skin to
allow the tissue to be passed to its new location. Or, as in Park's
case, the flap can be detached, then reattached to a new blood
supply through microsurgery.
</P>
<P>
   One M.D. Anderson nurse calls this free flap operation ``the
Cadillac of breast reconstruction,'' providing a softer, more
realistic breast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our most common technique. We're really committed to it.
For most patients, it provides the most natural result,'' says M.D.
Anderson plastic surgeon and researcher Dr. Michael Miller.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman doesn't have enough tissue to spare for a TRAM
flap, as in Wood's case, a balloon-like tissue expander is placed
under the pectoral muscle where the breast is to be reconstructed.
Over a period of several weeks, it is gradually filled with saline,
or salt water, through an injection port until the breast is the
correct size. In most patients, the expander is removed and
replaced by a silicone-gel or saline implant.
</P>
<P>
   Although silicone-gel implants have been at the center of highly
publicized lawsuits, with women claiming the implants have caused a
range of health problems, most doctors consider the implants safe.
In June, a panel of 13 scientists, convened by the Institute of
Medicine at the request of Congress, released a report in which it
concluded that silicone breast implants do not cause lupus,
rheumatoid arthritis or any other systemic disease.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the biggest drawback of all implants is that, as
medical devices, they have a limited lifespan and may need to be
replaced in 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after reconstruction, doctors add the final
touches. A new nipple is made from skin on the surface of the
reconstructed breast, sutured to simulate a nipple once it heals.
Tattooing adds realistic skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   Although numbers vary, the tissue flap technique accounts for
almost half of breast reconstructions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, a plastic surgeon with Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston, said that for many years, doctors were
reluctant to reconstruct patients' breasts for fear of not being
able to detect a recurrence of cancer. They also were concerned
that if the reconstructed area didn't heal quickly, chemotherapy
might have to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   However, studies have shown that if cancer recurs, it is nearly
always detectable, even if the patient has had breast
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complication rate of reconstructions are no different than
the mastectomies themselves,'' Friedman says. ``It's a very
reliable technique that doesn't create more problems that will
inhibit patient treatment. People look good, they do well, so it's
becoming more common.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction is still postponed for patients who need
radiation to treat their disease. Reconstruction makes it more
difficult to deliver the right dose of radiation to the skin and
chest wall.
</P>
<P>
   The procedures are not without risks and downsides. Women who
get the TRAM flap may get a tummy tuck as a bonus, but as with
other abdominal surgeries, recovery is painful and takes several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although women have some feeling in the reconstructed breast,
``the sensation you get back is never like it was before the
surgery,'' Miller says. In addition, there is a small risk that
some of the transferred tissue and fat won't survive in its new
location, making further surgery necessary. Areas of scarring also
can form.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, one of Miller's patients, is affectionately known as a
``flasher.'' She talks to women scheduled for mastectomies and
reconstruction and answers questions like, ``Will it hurt?'' ``What
does it feel like?'' and ``What will I look like?''
</P>
<P>
   After shooing the husband from the room, Wood lifts her blouse.
Most women are expecting the worst and invariably, they say, ``Oh!
Wow!'', amazed at how natural Wood's reconstruction looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're inducted in this cruel sorority, we're all in this
together,'' Wood says, explaining why she sets aside her usual
modesty for her role as educator. ``You want to help people over
the hump, if you can. If it helps them to know they're going to
look OK, they feel better.''

LITTLE BY LITTLE, MAN ATTEMPTS TO LAY CLAIM TO PARTS OF MARS _ AND

   HEMPHILL, Texas _ It might be unfair to pick on NASA when it's
down, but here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Besides last week's disappointing failure at making contact with
its Mars Polar Lander, the space agency also could be trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how Thomas Budnick sees things.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old former social worker from Ludlow, Mass., has
spent the past two decades in relative obscurity, mailing his
official claims to land and mineral rights on Mars and elsewhere in
outer space to the Sabine County Clerk's Office in this quiet East
Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   Complete with star charts and maps where X marks the spot,
Budnick's filings claim specific portions, spelled out in longitude
and latitude, of Mars, Jupiter and its moons, Galaxies NGC5194 and
NGC5195 and the asteroid Nereus, to name some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do it to continue America's manifest destiny, which is
now space exploration,'' said Budnick. ``Other people spend their
money on beer or whatever. Every time I get a little extra money, I
file a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the claims, reserving mineral rights, ``unlimited air
rights to the stars'' and ``astrofuel,'' are named in honor of such
Texas icons as the Alamo, the Battle of San Jacinto, even Sam
Houston, not to mention ``the good and fair people of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the claims have been named for Budnick or in memory
of his deceased father, who spent his career working for the
telephone company. Others are dedicated to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., and several are meant to honor the Kennedys, especially
John F. Kennedy, since the president's pledge was responsible for
putting a man on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Budnick, who was given the nickname Sputnik in the sixth grade,
has always been interested in space and tries to follow all
missions of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. When
Mars exploration took center stage as the Sojourner robot crept
across the red plains in 1997, Budnick bought a red suit for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA isn't too keen on my activities,'' he admitted. ``They
rejected my application for astronaut training. If I could, though,
I'd go to Mars. I'd go to Jupiter. I'd love to explore the
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, or at least around the domino table under the cedar
tree on the Sabine County Courthouse square, some think he's
already in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be nuts,'' said one old-timer who declined to give his
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlin,' use your head,'' said another. ``Would you file a
claim like that? Do you know anyone in their right mind who
would?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody up here thinks I'm nuts too, but I don't think I
am,'' sighed Budnick, who said he bases his claims on mining laws
dating back to 1872, which he says are still on the books. ``They
laughed at Christopher Columbus, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Budnick first tried to file his claims in his home state of
Massachusetts. When clerks in land offices around the state refused
to accept them, he moved down the coast, unsuccessfully attempting
to file in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed that even Florida wouldn't take them
when they are home to the space program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks responded with ridicule, he said, and eventually his
activities got him fired from his state job helping people file
Medicare and Medicaid claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Spokane County Auditor's Office in Washington state finally
accepted his mining claims to Mars in the early 1980s, but once the
attorney general's office in that state found out, Budnick was
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a little local yokel publicity,'' he said, ``and, you
know, with `space claiming,' the word gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Budnick has never been to Texas, but his claims have found a
home here since at least 1984, making the Lone Star State his
favorite in the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the only people who will still take them,'' he said.
``When I wasn't getting anywhere on the East Coast, just like
Horace Greeley, I said, `Go west, young man, go west.' I guess
Texans, with their western attitude, are a little more
open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabine County Clerk Janice McDaniel said the claims had been
accepted here long before she took office, so she allowed Budnick
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerk at that time said it had everything on it and it was
proper and we would accept it,'' she said. ``Really, we're just
acknowledging that his signature has been notarized on the form.
It's signed and the fee is enclosed and that's all we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Budnick sends the clerks an alien-themed Christmas
card in appreciation. McDaniel keeps the cards, saying she finds
Budnick harmless; he considers the clerks his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But do the claims really mean anything? Could they ever hold up
if humans actually walk on the Red Planet one day as planned?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, NASA says no.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisition in outer space is prohibited under the United
Nations Treaty on Outer Space signed in 1967. It says outer space,
including the moon and other celestial bodies, are free to be
explored and used by all states. Planting a flag on the moon was
therefore only a symbolic gesture by U.S. astronauts. It doesn't
mean they claimed the moon as American territory.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel won't even speculate as to the value of Budnick's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' she said. ``I've seen `Star Wars' and I like
the movie, but I don't fathom (space mining) will happen in my
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing for sure,'' the clerk added. ``I'm not going
up there to check out the dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Budnick said that since he is already in his 50s, is single and
has no heirs, his family likely will never profit from the claims,
but that's not really the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're valid,'' he said. ``But just having the
American flag flying up there is what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, his claims only cost $10 or $12 apiece, he's
having fun and he's not bothering anyone except his sister, who
wishes he would stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to accomplish something in my life,'' he said.
``There are all types of fantastic ideas coming for the future, so
maybe I'm crazy, or maybe I'm just a little ahead of my time.''

PANAMA READY FOR A NEW ERA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Canizales) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Near the banks of the Panama Canal, a huge
digital clock counts the hours, minutes and seconds remaining
before what could be called this nation's true independence day.
</P>
<P>
   At noon on Dec. 31, the United States will surrender control of
the 85-year-old canal to Panama, marking the final stage of the
U.S. withdrawal from the isthmus. Because of scheduling conflicts
and concerns about the Y2K computer problem, a symbolic hand-over
ceremony will be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the start of a new era for Panamanians, who at long
last will run the waterway and control every inch of their national
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important moment in Panama's history,'' said
former Panamanian President Nicolas Ardito Barletta.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ceremony will be held at Miraflores Locks, near the
Pacific entrance to the canal. Former President Carter, who signed
the Panama Canal treaties in 1977, will head the U.S. delegation. A
second ceremony, a mostly Panamanian affair, will be held on Dec.
31, when the actual transfer takes place.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, the Panama Canal Commission, the U.S. government
agency that ran the canal, will be dissolved. It will be replaced
by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous Panamanian board made
up of business executives and canal veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover of the waterway, which connects the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans, ``represents a big historic change,'' said Peter
Romero, the acting assistant secretary of state for Western
hemisphere affairs. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Even so, there are few indications in Panama City or Washington
that something momentous is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, top U.S. officials are largely ignoring the
event. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had been
scheduled to attend Tuesday's ceremony, canceled her Panama trip
because of peace talks between Israel and Syria that will be held
in Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
   Neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore will attend
the Panama ceremony. Analysts say they worry that Republicans
during the 2000 campaign will accuse Democrats of ``giving away''
the canal and damage Gore's run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in such calculations is that the canal treaties were an
important break from the ``big stick'' policies of the past and did
much to improve U.S.-Latin American relations, according to Adam
Isacson of the Center for International Policy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Returning the canal to Panama ``was the right policy, but it was
never popular'' in the United States, Isacson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has tried to do the sales job lately on why it was
necessary to give the canal back,'' he said. ``People forget, and
they wonder why we are giving away this canal to this little
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanians are also taking a low-key approach, but for
different reasons: To them, the hand-over is largely a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   The transition to Panamanian control has been going on for 20
years. The process has helped reduce the fervent nationalism that
U.S. dominance of the canal once provoked.
</P>
<P>
   The 1977 canal treaties, for example, eliminated the Canal Zone,
a 10-mile-wide, U.S.-controlled strip of land straddling the
waterway that had an American governor and police force. Parts of
the zone were fenced off from the rest of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Omar Torrijos, the Panamanian military ruler who signed the
treaties with Carter, often referred to the zone as a ``colonialist
tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaties also mandated the gradual withdrawal of 10,000 U.S.
troops and the closure of all American military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only about 120 U.S. soldiers remain in Panama, and they
will be gone by the end of the year. Panamanians now make up 97
percent of the canal's 9,000-member work force. A Panamanian has
served as the canal's top manager for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Many Panamanians are too young to remember the anti-American
riots that broke out in 1964 at the beginning of their tiny
nation's struggle to gain control over its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   Panama won independence from Colombia in 1903 through a
U.S.-backed uprising. Immediately afterward, Panama signed a treaty
authorizing the United States to build and operate a canal
connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. The treaty granted the United
States the use, occupation and control of the Canal Zone in
perpetuity. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The great cause of dissatisfaction no longer exists,'' said
Fernando Manfredo, a former Canal Commission administrator. ``It's
like if you watch a baseball game knowing ahead of time who won.
There is no longer much emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Panamanian teen-agers, the main attraction this Dec. 31
will be the free New Year's Eve concert by salsa star Ruben Blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hardly any historic memory here,'' said Raul Leis of
CEASPA, a Panamanian research center. ``But nationalism is no
longer the main objective. We are now in an era of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials already are negotiating contracts with
dozens of foreign businesses to set up factories, assembly plants,
hotels and shopping malls on about 500 square miles of former Canal
Zone properties.
</P>
<P>
   Development is essential to make up for the U.S. pullout. The
American bases pumped about $300 million annually into the
country's economy and provided thousands of well-paying jobs to
Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   Economic concerns are the main reason why many people here are
sad to see the Americans leave. Newspaper polls have consistently
shown that a majority of Panamanians prefer some kind of U.S.
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries talked for years about setting up a regional
anti-drug center in Panama, but the negotiations broke down.
President Mireya Moscoso, who took office in August, said she has
no plans to reopen talks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also concerns about whether Panama is up to the task
of running the canal. Some fear that the new administrators will
cut corners in an effort to squeeze larger profits from the canal.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat on a bench overlooking the canal last week, Teresa
Canizales compared the American exit to the breakup of a long
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a divorce. You feel a little disoriented,'' she
said. ``It's not the same thing as having a supportive spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jaime Bocanegra, who heads the Canal Commission's Transition
Management Office, points out that the canal has been under mostly
Panamanian control for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic has risen steadily. Last year, 14,244 ships passed
through the canal, paying $525 million in tolls. Bocanegra said
that alternative routes, such as ship-to-rail land bridges, mean
that the canal must run smoothly and safely to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to destroy what generates so much riches for
the country. That would be shooting ourselves in the foot,'' he
said. ``The Panama Canal doesn't just respond to Panama's reality.
It responds to the international reality, so there is pressure to
provide good service and prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The canal's two-lane locks raise vessels 85 feet, allowing them
to cross the narrowest section of Panama across an artificial lake,
then lower them back down to sea level. Because of growing traffic,
a third lane may have to be added to the locks within the next
decade, Bocanegra said.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of the hand-over date has rekindled passions in the
United States about the waterway, which opened in 1914 and remains
a powerful icon of progress and American know-how.
</P>
<P>
   During two days of hearings last week, Republican members of
Congress reiterated many of the warnings issued when the canal
treaties were ratified by the Senate in a narrow 1978 vote.
</P>
<P>
   They accused the Panamanian government of corruption and warned
that as the Americans leave, leftist rebels in neighboring Colombia
could sabotage the canal. They also claimed that China could wrest
control of the waterway from Panama through a Hong Kong-based
company that won a contract to administer ports at both ends of the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials point out that the firm, Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., is one of the biggest shipping companies in the world and won
a competitive bid. They add that the Panama Canal Authority will
control ship traffic and that the treaties guarantee neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, the assistant secretary of state, said that the
hand-over of the canal does not mean Washington intends to ``turn
off the lights and shut the door and forget about Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite to the contrary,'' he said, ``we've established a very
good basis with this new government for cooperation.''

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO
PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)    By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst
<TEXT>
Newspapers &LR;  &QC;  WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian
military officers won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping
as the millennium arrives at midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they
will be guarding against the end of the world. Their concern is the
ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches causing the launch of
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments
have been working to fix the potential Y2K glitches in their
missile systems and early warning defense equipment. And officials
from both countries stress that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K
missile launch is extremely remote. But to reassure a jittery world
public and further cut the risk of a Y2K accident, the governments
of the two nuclear superpowers have set up a joint command center
at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help
protect against such an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly
called Y2K, refers to the possibility that computers programmed to
read only the last two digits of a year might interpret the change
from 1999 to 2000 as going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the
computers to crash; interfering with utility services, banking,
aviation and any other sector that relies computers. While most
essential civilian and military computers in the United States have
been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries, including Russia,
are having difficulties. In fact, the State Department is so
worried about computer troubles there and in three former Soviet
republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of employees through the
New Year period. But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world. Their information will be
collected from a network of radars and satellites operated by the
nearby Cheyenne mL!(

BLACK FARMERS' DISCRIMINATION SETTLEMENT MAY NOT EASE YEARS OF
PAIN 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELZONI, Miss. _ A fat check for $50,000. For the nation's
dwindling number of black farmers, the check in the mail hinted at
possible salvation, like a lottery win but potentially more
satisfying because of the wrongs it might wipe clean and the way of
life it might preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The money was the fruit of a class-action settlement this year
intended to amend decades of discrimination in the federal farm
lending program.
</P>
<P>
   But many are finding that it provides little to ensure their
survival, fails to compensate for their bitterness and lost
opportunity, and comes at a time when the U.S. Department of
Agriculture may soon phase out its lending programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't wash away the sin and it doesn't cover up the abuse
that they did to the black farmer,'' said Rodalton Hart, who farms
near Lexington, Miss., in Holmes County.
</P>
<P>
   Under the April 14 class-action settlement, farmers will receive
$50,000 each. An additional $12,000 will be paid directly to the
Internal Revenue Service to cover the taxes on the payment. Also,
any farmer whose claim involved an outstanding or defaulted loan
from the USDA will get that debt written off.
</P>
<P>
   To some, little is better than nothing. To others, no amount is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Davis, 71, standing under a gaping hole in the ceiling
over her dining table, said her $50,000, cash-free payment was
already spent before it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we pay the bills, there won't be anything,'' said
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was intended &UR;  &LR; to remedy discrimination against
black farmers who for decades had been turned down for farm loans
or received loans too late to plant a profitable crop. The
discrimination led to foreclosures and the loss of a way of life
that had existed for generations.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer than 19,000 black farmers in the United States.
There were 925,000 in 1920. Less than 1 percent of U.S. farmers are
black, and they are abandoning farming at three times the rate of
whites, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers say the USDA's Farm Service Agency has been more
foe than friend. They recall having loan applications stowed away
in desk drawers for months and FSA officials telling them to remove
their hats upon entering FSA offices to show respect.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents are particularly damning considering that for
black farmers turned away by commercial banks and other lending
institutions, the USDA was the lender of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 28, 1997, policy statement, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said that discrimination would not be tolerated. The
comment came shortly after a civil rights action team report
concluded that minority farmers lost their farms and potential farm
income as a result of discrimination by FSA programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed 92 recommendations to be implemented within
six months. Priority was given to ensure accountability at the
county level by converting nonfederal county positions to federal
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In the predominantly black Mississippi Delta counties far
removed from the lofty rhetoric of Washington, D.C., black farmers
claim they still must contend with predominantly white Farm Service
Agency committees that decide who gets farm loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeastern United States, blacks account for 1.1
percent of all county committees and office employees. The
committees and employees are 97.5 percent white, according to 1996
USDA figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of these members of county committees, they don't work
for the USDA, they're not county employees, so there's no
enforcement mechanism. You can't penalize them, you can't fire
them, so a lot of them do what they want to do,'' said Mike Espy,
former secretary of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   For Sarah Davis, the settlement will ease the burden of her
debt, nothing more. Fellow Belzoni farmer Edmond Clark, after
having been denied a share of the settlement, clings to a shred of
hope that his appeal will save his farm.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Ross, a plaintiff in the discrimination lawsuit, sees his
school-age daughter's future guaranteed by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he could count on one hand the number of black
farmers still farming around Belzoni. In his eyes, black farmers,
including himself, in rural Mississippi are systematically being
forced into extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to lose the land eventually; unless some miracle
happens I'm gonna lose the land,'' Clark said. ``And when I lose
the land I know where it's going. It's going away from a black
farmer and never to return again.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a black farmer who is an exception to the crisis, it
is Eddie Ross, a Warren County cotton farmer who led a
demonstration outside the White House on Dec. 12, 1996, protesting
unfair loan treatment.
</P>
<P>
   His family had farmed outside Vicksburg, Miss., since the 1940s
when his grandfather, Robert Wyatt, bought 120 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Ross applied for his first government loan in 1988 to lease 50
acres of cotton. He applied for three additional loans from 1991 to
1993 to lease more than 700 acres. In those three years, he was
given a loan too late to plant, was turned down for another and
received one on time only to have funding stopped in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   He filed discrimination complaints that received favorable
rulings, but was never compensated for his losses. After obtaining
a copy of the USDA civil rights report, he and five other farmers
sued the USDA in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At a pretrial hearing, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the argument
to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that farmers could not sue
the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he said that, all of us, we all just applauded in the
courtroom. We all were so excited,'' Ross said. ``From that point
on we felt confident we were going to get this thing settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross would only say his settlement was a seven-figure award that
included his government loan debt payoff. His settlement was
separate from the class-action award.
</P>
<P>
   He said the the class-action award gives farmers a clean slate
by clearing their debt and obtaining new credit to buy equipment
and land.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that money will do, it will give them an opportunity to
compete in their local market. It will give them a chance to go get
quality feed. It will give them a chance to upgrade their farm
equipment,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers have never held an edge. In 1920, there were about
925,000 black farms, mainly in the South, representing 14 percent
of all farms. The number has dropped to 18,451, according to the
1997 census figures.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanization and black migration to northern factories cut
deeply into black farming, historically small operations big enough
to sustain families, but too small to generate profitable yields.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at black farmers today as a subset of small
farmers and small farmers as a subset of all farmers, it's clear
that as we move into the new century that the small-family farmer
is dying away,'' Espy said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. farms fell to 1.93 million in 1992 from 2.24
million in 1982, a 14 percent drop. The number of black-operated
farms dropped 44 percent during the same period, from 33,300 in
1982 to 18,800 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, less than 1 percent of all U.S. farms were owned by
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence in the dramatic decline in black farm
operations is the disparity in FSA loans to black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1999 ending Sept. 30, white farmers received 18,687,
or 85 percent, of the 21,900 loans issued by the FSA. Black farmers
received 893 loans, or 4 percent. Of the $1.3 billion loan total,
white farmers received $1.1 billion compared with $32.4 million for
black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The black farmer also is getting older: Their average age was
58.7 in 1992. Younger generations, witnessing firsthand the
struggle and hard work of keeping a farm alive, have chosen
different careers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for some, options are a luxury they cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people live at the poverty level. I know because I was
one of them,'' said Ross. ``These people can't afford an education.
These people that come right out of high school have to work to
help support their families, help their mothers and fathers support
their families and can't go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they had the grades to go they couldn't go, they had
to go work. That's the life of the Mississippi Delta,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Edmond Clark was throwing water on a
smoldering module of cotton as a friend picked through the burnt
fibers with a broken broomstick. The module, valued at about
$6,000, was one of two Clark had scheduled for pickup that morning.
It also was the second in as many weeks intentionally set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clark speculated the fire was set by a competitor. A handful of
people who lived nearby looked on as Clark and a friend worked to
salvage the module. But in the group was a &UR;  &LR; teen-ager who confessed
to starting the fire out of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a good year for Clark. He planted his cotton
late this year and was among the last in a three-county region to
harvest, guaranteeing low prices for his yield.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark understands hardship. His family was reared on a
49-acre farm bought by his father in the early 1940s. Clark
remembers the family sustaining itself on what was raised and
canned on the farm. When he and his three brothers began farming,
the four had to share their father's tractor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark brothers still live on the land, but the family may
soon lose the farm, which was used as loan collateral.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at that point now,'' said Clark, whose land is still
owned by the FSA. ``We're in the process of trying to get the debt
written off so it can go back to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 22, a court adjudicator rejected Clark's settlement
claim, saying he had not suffered racial discrimination and had
received emergency or operating loans every year from 1981 through
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clark argued that he could not get loans to buy equipment, and
that when he managed to obtain a loan to lease land and pay
planting costs, it always came too late to harvest a profitable
yield. Other than his father's tractor, the only equipment on hand
was an ordinary garden tiller.
</P>
<P>
   He also was humiliated by county FSA officials who tried to
persuade him to abandon his farm, the only work he had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Clark hasn't received a loan since 1996, and with the government
debt hanging over him, he doesn't plan on getting any help from
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These four years, actually when I look back and see how I made
it, I really don't know. It's just been with the grace of God that
I've done made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I get up every day not knowing what I'm going to have
to deal with, not knowing how I'm going to be able to buy my seed,
not knowing how I'm going to be able to buy fertilizer, not knowing
how I'm going to pay these notes on this equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Poorman Douglas, the firm contracted to process
settlement claims, announced that 2,412 farmers were mailed checks
from the settlement. Since Sept. 15, the firm has received 19,191
claims from 20 states. The majority of the claims, however, are
from Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee. The firm expects
to finish processing all claims in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the class-action settlement, farmers must prove that they
were victims of racial discrimination in a USDA credit or benefit
program between Jan. 1, 1981, and Dec. 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 1, court adjudicators had decided 4,969 claims. Of
those, 3,083, or 62 percent, favored of the claimant and 1,886 were
denied. Attorneys for the farmers expect a large percentage of the
denials will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pires, a lead attorney in the lawsuit, said the
settlement payments are expected to total about $1 billion, making
it the largest class-action civil rights settlement in U.S.
history. In addition to the $50,000 cash payments, debt write-offs
are averaging $30,000 to $40,000 per claimant.
</P>
<P>
   Pires said a lot of farmers are upset because the claims have
taken so long to process or have been denied. He said fingers are
being pointed everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're suspicious,'' he said, ``not only of the government,
they're suspicious of their own lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Sweet, a Jackson, Miss., attorney, said a lot of the
frustration comes from farmers learning that their claims were
denied because they improperly outlined their charges of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   He said many farmers did not document their problems with the
FSA or were not advised on how to prepare their affidavits. Also,
some attorneys claimed 40 percent of a claimant's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the settlement is done and done the way they said it will
be done, it will save a lot of farmers,'' Sweet said.
</P>
<P>
   However, former Agriculture Secretary Espy believes little hope
exists for the small farmer if he continues as he has for decades,
plowing away a meager living on small operations. The surviving
farms are the large operations and corporate farms. He said the
black farmer lacks the capital and technical expertise to survive.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, time is running out for the small farmer who
depends on government loans to stay afloat from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Under a farm bill passed in 1996 that ends farm subsidies by
2002, USDA announced its plans to get out of the lending business
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For reasons of generational disenchantment, for reasons of the
economies of scale, for reasons of just the risk of the occupation
itself and now the government not providing a helping hand, I think
farmers are wasting away. Black farmers are going to be nonexistent
in the near future,'' Espy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodalton Hart has known the hard years. He remembers growing up
during the Depression in Holmes County when black farmers pooled
their cotton to earn 5 cents a pound. That amount fed their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said he has never regretted his decision to continue the
family farm, although it has meant a life full of inconvenience and
hardships. He owned land, but he enjoyed few of the luxuries that
came with land ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had the opportunity to enjoy life, take vacations
or have extra spending money to do things that other people do.
That's the only downside, that we have to work all the time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the money, he said, went back into the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Sweet said it is farmers such as Hart and Ross who will
survive and are the source of his faith in the black farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have survived in the face of the worst obstacles,'' Sweet
said. ``The sad part of it is that people just want to work. Every
black farmer is not going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the crisis, he said, is the land, some of which has
remained in black hands since the post-Civil War period of
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the settlement will save a lot of black farmers. You
can take the black farmer and give him some debt forgiveness and he
will survive. Most of these farmers are not trying to get rich from
the settlement, just debt relief. All they're asking for is a
little debt relief and a promise they'll be treated fairly in the
future,'' Sweet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get treated fair, the serious black farmers, they'll
stay around.''

 &HT;    A couple of my friends could use some `nanners'
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Many years ago when my son Kristofor was
still a short shadow in the sandbox, I overheard him telling his
best buddy Chuck that he had good ``nanners'' in his house. Chuck
assumed he meant bananas and said that was cool _ could he have
one.
</P>
<P>
   It took a bit of doing but we straightened it out. As I handed
each of them a banana, Kristofor tried to explain to another
confused 3-year-old. ``I said `nanners' not `nanas'.'' Chuck,
caring little for semantics, nodded and munched on.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, ``nanners'' became a byword around our house. I
remember shoving clean socks into his backpack for a sleepover at
Chuck's house and instructing him to mind his ``nanners.'' When he
grew tall and acquired his first set of car keys and a date all in
the same year, I would follow him to the door, reminding him to be
polite.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to say it worked. The kid, now 32, married, and quite
tall, hasn't forgotten his pleases and thank yous, and always
remembers to pull out my chair at dinner. Of course, he also finds
it amusing to haul me around under one arm like a 40-pound sack of
birdseed _ but that's a tale for another day.
</P>
<P>
   This gross story is about two friends I ran into the other day
in the cafe uptown. Cal and Amos are somewhere in their mid-70s and
I like them a lot. We often bump into each other for morning coffee
but today they're in for lunch because their wives are Christmas
shopping. They asked me to join them, and that's how I came to be
sitting between two guys _ one loudly slurping the dregs of his
soda through a straw, and the other blowing his nose in a napkin
(at least it was paper).
</P>
<P>
   My eyes widened, I'm sure, but I politely avoided an instinctive
response which would have been to jump up, flail my arms like an
infuriated palm tree, and screech at the top of my lungs:
``Yaaaack!'' (local slang for ``You guys are enough to gag a
grub!'') But I minded my ``nanners.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the racket had died down, and my gorge had slunk back where
it belonged, the boys and I got down to some good conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Cal's all mad at first lady Hillary. ``I never thought I'd live
to see the day when a president's wife moved out of the White House
a year ahead of her husband,'' he's huffing like this has been on
his mind a while. Cal couldn't imagine living anywhere without his
wife. ``I'll tell you what,'' he says, ``Bess Truman was my
favorite first lady and I sure can't picture her ever leaving Harry
on his own while she went off to `find' herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos nods and admits he's been wondering about that too, only
his concern comes with dollar signs. ``I want to know who's paying
for those extra Secret Service guys.'' He tells us in no uncertain
terms that it is not his intention to contribute to Clinton's
wife's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cal allows he can understand why Hillary would want to get out
of the house and cut herself loose from her philandering husband's
crummy coattails, but he thinks the mess she's getting herself into
with her run for the Senate could be nastier than Monicagate.
``That Giuliani is going to chew her up and spit her out,'' he says
looking not too unhappy at the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   I accuse them both of being chauvinists. Cal gives me his best
impish grin and tells me I'm just jealous because I don't have a
husband as wonderful as either one of them. I assure them that's
it. Amos says his wife is all the time saying what a handsome devil
he is.
</P>
<P>
   This happy foolishness lasts through coffee, homemade apple pie,
and on into toothpicks. That's when it gets messy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta' go now,'' I mutter as I reach for my check, ``before I
have to watch you guys eat your lunch twice.'' Cal just grins and
studies a piece of meatloaf he's liberated from behind his bridge.
Amos plays like I've hurt his feelings, but I know I haven't. We
have this ``nanners'' conversation at least once a week. They say
they miss it when I'm gone.

 &HT;    Sneak in some Santana when the kids ask what you want from Santa
 &HT;    Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Give your teens a shock this Christmas. When
they ask you what gift you would like, don't give them the stock,
``All I want is for us to be together and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell 'em you want ``The Best of Santana'' CD. Then watch 'em
keel over in shock.
</P>
<P>
   If you stopped listening to Casey Kasem decades ago, you might
not know that Carlos Santana, one of the masters of Jurassic Rock,
otherwise known as our music of the '60s and '70s, has the current
No. 1 song on the charts.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``Smooth'' and the kids love it. What they most
likely don't know is that we, their parents, have loved Santana for
almost 30 years. I bought the ``Hits'' CD last week, passing up the
new one because I know the kids will buy it. I'm here to tell you
that the benefits of the old album go beyond just hearing some
terrific music.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Santana is a hit with today's young people gives
me hope. See, my kids and their friends might think I'm just a
little bit cool because I know who he is. Not only that, I saw him
in concert with several other groups like ZZ Top in a memorable
event at what was then Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids won't know the group even made music before this
current hit. They will be forced to admit we know at least one
thing they don't. For that, you may want to purchase the album
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also thinking that for effect, we parents could drive around
listening to the ``Greatest Hits'' CD. Maybe make a drag on the
Loop and crank up ``Soul Sacrifice.'' On spotting a car full of
teens, turn up the bass all the way, roll down the windows and just
jam. That is, if you remember how and are careful not to strain
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how cool you will be, not only knowing the artist but
the words, to such classics as ``Evil Ways'' and ``Black Magic
Woman.'' It's true. My daughters and their cousin were shocked when
my younger sister took them to see ``Wayne's World,'' the movie,
and knew all the words to ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' by Queen. Oh, was
Aunt Patty cool after that.
</P>
<P>
   Those parents who want to stay home with Santana but who still
feel adventuresome could drag out the black lights and the Hendrix
poster. What would the young 'uns think then? It should be fun to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not up for all that effort, just plug ``Samba Pa Ti''
into the CD player and slow dance with your main squeeze in the
living room. That's guaranteed to send the resident teens through
the roof, or maybe just out of the room. Ah, but you will be
``Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't work, turn up the volume and let Santana
keep playing. You can depend on hearing words you thought you never
would out of the mouths of your babes: ``Could you turn that
down?''
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A Christmas lament
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ This year, retailers had the plastic Christmas
trees out next to the Halloween jack-o-lanterns. Thanksgiving,
after all, isn't very consumer-oriented (other than in the grocery
store), so let's not waste too much time on this no-profit holiday.
Let's just forgo the thanks and get straight to the giving.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like to rush through autumn, though. It is my last deep,
cleansing breath of the season before Christmas mania begins. As I
think ahead to another season of gift-giving and gift receiving, I
take stock of how we have taught our children to experience
Christmas. It's one thing I wish I could ``do over'' as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I realize we trained them _ more carefully than we
ever taught them to say ``thank you'' or to chew food with their
mouths closed _ to experience Christmas almost soley as a time of
``getting.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Thanksgiving turkey was off the table, we would
ask our children what they wanted for Christmas. If they couldn't
think of anything, we had them watch Saturday morning cartoons,
filled as they were with commercials for every conceivable toy in
the world. Or we'd look through toy catalogs. ``Make us a list,''
we urged.
</P>
<P>
   We hung Christmas stockings, built up the excitement about Santa
coming and, in every other imaginable way, filled them with
anticipation about the plethora of goodies they would awaken to on
Christmas morning.
</P>
<P>
   My wisdom has come late, but I offer it to other mothers of
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mountains of Fisher-Price and Tonka and Nintendo and
Hilfiger, give your children gifts that will hold their interest
much longer than just the two weeks of Christmas vacation. Teach
them to think more about what they can give than what they might
receive. Begin a tradition of saving nickels and dimes all through
the year to buy toys to give to others. Teach them to take time and
patience and thought to make gifts for others that truly will be
treasured for decades to come. Go each year to serve dinner to
homeless people, or make blankets to donate to the Salvation Army,
or simply go door to door in your neighborhood caroling the Good
News. Yes, in our family we did a sprinkling of such things
throughout the years, but it was always a tacked-on event, never
the main event.
</P>
<P>
   With the best of intentions, and in the finest traditions of how
we ourselves were reared, we passed onto our children a legacy of
materialism. Witness the early Christmas morning call to friends:
``What did you get?''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, we taught our children to think primarily of themselves
and their own desires. For the most part, they learned their lesson
well. I'm not sure you can just ``un-train'' them. Our instruction
and indoctrination was too thorough.
</P>
<P>
   We gave lip service to the ``real meaning'' of Christmas, but it
did not translate into meaningful action, a serious shift of
priorities or the establishment of new traditions. And I'm not sure
we're all that different from many families
</P>
<P>
   My hope is that it's still not too late to teach them that ``to
whom much is given, much is expected.'' It would be the best gift
we could ever give them.

 &HT;    Celebrating Y2K with a Y1.8K story
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ There's always an implied sneer when
critics talk about cult movies, cult rock bands and most of all
cult fiction. It is media that doesn't get to sit at the big
people's table. Putting the adjective ``cult'' in front of a noun
is a way of saying, ``get a load of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet cult movies are played at midnight on college campuses to a
front row that has memorized the best lines. The touring schedules
of cult bands are passed eagerly from hard-drive to hard-drive all
along the Internet. And cult fiction has a community of readers who
confound the expectations of marketing departments, defy
tastemakers and generally aren't supposed to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Brian creates cult fiction. Like with many cult works,
critics are either contemptuously baffled or get all mushy.
Disclaimer: I am a cult member.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian writes about something we can all identify with _ life
on smaller British warships in the Napoleonic wars. He has written
a series of 20 novels. The latest one has just appeared on
bookstore shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Although each book purports to be a complete novel, none of them
truly stand alone. They are one very long, 20-volume novel. Serial
fiction with a new installment every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The author is now 85, writes in longhand, and says when prodded
into a rare interview that his health is not the best. That a new
volume in the series appeared at all this year is a gift to his
readers. And I would urge you not to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue at the Mizzen'' is a new reason to go back to book one,
``Master and Commander.'' (The title is not as grandiose as it
sounds. It is the rank of someone who commands a ship too small to
be run by a full captain.) To start with the new book would be like
tuning into the last 15 minutes of the program. Don't be tempted.
</P>
<P>
   So why as we head into Y2K would a narrative that begins at
Y1.8K gain cult status?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not because they throw any light on our time.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of the novels, John ``Lucky Jack'' Aubrey, Post
Captain, R.N., is not coping too well with the onset of 19th
century, much less providing us any help understanding the 21st. He
knows only the sea and resents the first stirrings of everything
that would come
</P>
<P>
   to define the world 200 years later. He is a disaster in
business and legal dealings. He distrusts industrialism,
businessmen, the stock market, lawyers, Whigs, utilitarians,
small-d democrats, political reformers, naval modernization,
Methodists, tea-sippers
</P>
<P>
   and Frenchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Historical fiction is overpopulated with 20th century types
stranded in other worlds. Capt. Aubrey is not among them. He is
overadapted to the 19th century sailing ship and a problem
everywhere else he goes. His particular friend (a charming, antique
phrase resurrected by O'Brian in place of our bland ``best friend''
or overly '70s ``main man''), Stephen Maturin, is also solidly a
person of his own time, although more comfortable on its
intellectual fringes. Maturin is the ship's surgeon, natural
philosopher, spy, Catholic among Anglicans, duelist, cellist and
ornithologist. He can trephine a seaman's skull on a swaying main
deck, joke in Latin or plug a Frenchman at 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   More plausible, subtle and researched than the Horatio
Hornblower books to which they are thoughtlessly compared,
O'Brian's books recreate the Napoleonic era as a complete
alternative universe. Not, like so many other historical novels, as
people with 20th century attitudes unaccountably costumed in Jane
Austin drag.
</P>
<P>
   Are these mere guy-books? Do they cross the line from cult
fiction to full-fledged nerd fiction? The critics are divided. ``A
sort of Hardy Boys for smart, literate men'' condescended the Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is ready-the-carronades-and-strike-the-stuns'l
writing. But it's the best
ready-the-carronades-and-strike-the-stuns'ls writing around. Each
book packed with the vocabulary, objects, sights, smells, tastes
(spotted dog tonight!) and sounds of 200 years ago. Not because
these things teach us anything at all about our own pallid age, but
because they have some value in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy Boys, indeed. Amazingly, for one more volume, the cult
lives.

 &HT;    Law resources on the Net
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We swear to show you legal sites, a whole bunch
of legal sites and nothing but the legal sites in this week's
e-traveler. See what we've found in this list of law and
lawyer-related sites:
</P>
<P>
   www.law.com _ A clearinghouse of information about the legal
world for law professionals and the people who love them. (You
don't love lawyers? So sue us.) Law.com includes legal news,
information for law students, resources and an interesting service
where you can get a free e-mail address with the (at)law.com
domain. Want to scare someone with the threat of legal action? Send
it to them from that e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   www.nolo.com _ Just like doctors at parties, lawyers hate to be
bugged for free advice. So Nolo, the publisher of many self-help
legal books, has a Web site designed ``for the little guy.'' You
can ask Auntie Nolo for common-sense answers to legal questions or
browse frequently asked questions about more than 500 legal
dilemmas. wwlia.org/hist.htm _ If you want to bone up on your legal
history, the World Wide Legal Information Association has compiled
a list dating from 2350 B.C.'s Urukagina's Code to the 1948 General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Think of it as Cliffs Notes for the
history of law.
</P>
<P>
   www.stanford.edu/group/WLHP _Before there were ``L.A. Law's''
Grace Van Owen and Ally McBeal on TV, there were Betty Reynolds
Cobb and Dorothy Kenyon, pioneering women in the field of law.
Stanford Law School's Women's Legal History Biography Project lists
female lawyers through history and includes biographies, research
leads and articles. Inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   www.personal.usyd. edu.au/(tilde)atan/jokes/canonicallawyer.html
_ And of course, where would we be without jokes about lawyers? The
Canonical List of Lawyer Humor includes riddles, courtroom humor
and all manner of jibes on the legal front. If you're ever in need
of a good lawyer joke, this is the place to go.

 &HT;    Our cup warmeth over
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When making that grand list of annoying gadgets,
you have to include the cup warmer. Who thought of this ingenious
device? If you're not familiar with the cup warmer, it could best
be described as a disc that heats up and, in theory, keeps your cup
warm. Believe me, this is only in theory. This death disc does
nothing except heat the bottom of your cup to such an intense heat
that its only practical use is ritualistic burning of the flesh
(or, if you're on the creative side of things, you can use it to
fuse glass beads and make pretty sculptures). This gadget actually
has the ability to transcend ``annoying'' and enter the hallowed
realm of ``hyper-annoying.'' To attain this, all you have to do is
plug in the cup warmer next to a colleague's computer, let it heat
up and don't put a cup on it. The howls and screams will tell it
all.

 &HT;    Gamers get ready: The toys are back in town
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the marching out of ``Toy Story 2,'' kids
everywhere are waiting with bated breath for the game. Wait no
longer! Activision's Toy Story 2 ($50 for Playstation and $60 for
Nintendo, www.activision.com) is on the shelf and is sure to be a
hot one for the holiday season. The game follows the movie in that
Woody, the cowboy doll, is stolen, and Buzz Lightyear and friends
take on the task to find him. In the game, you can earn rocket
boots, grappling hooks and other accessories to help in your quest.
If you're more into the sinister battle of new toys vs. old toys,
then Sega's Toy Commander ($50, www.sega.com) is for you. In this
game, you take on the role of Andrew, whose older toys have
rebelled against the newer ones. You must prove yourself a Toy
Commander and bring the toys under your control. Fantastic graphics
are the high point of this one.
</P>
<P>
   CALL ME LI'L BWANA
</P>
<P>
   Grolier Interactive's Virtual Serengeti ($30,
www.gi.grolier.com, for PC and Mac) is as loaded as an elephant gun
with enough live-action video to turn even the most sedentary young
joystick jockey into a big-game hunter. Players take on the persona
of a research assistant for a nature documentary, sent to Africa to
study animal behavior and collect video. Virtual explorers navigate
more than 50 360-degree panoramic environments and seven virtual
Serengeti locations, storing information in an interactive journal.
Along the way, players use the collected information and Grolier
Multimedia Encyclopedia online articles to answer questions about
animals they've spotted. Installation is a snap, and on-screen
video of Nature TV host George Page is available to help wee
adventurers who get stuck. The documentation says the game is for
ages 9 and up, but our test 7-year-old installed and played for
hours on his own. Virtual Serengeti is not your father's Sunday
afternoon nature film.

 &HT;    A multitalented mini

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We all want to make a ``Blair Witch Project.''
After all, the garage movie made $200 million _ and that would be a
nice chunk of change in anyone's pocket. Likewise, it would be nice
to have a digital camera that could record family events on video
and also take still photos. That's why you should pick up the
palm-sized Canon Elura MiniDV Camcorder ($1,800, www.canondv.com).
This bad boy offers high-resolution video, a still-photo mode and a
digital motor drive (which takes high-resolution pictures at 30
frames a second). The Elura boasts 380k pixels so the user can get
premium quality video and stills. The camera is also equipped with
a 48x digital zoom, a variety of digital effects and a color LCD
viewing screen. And for the budding auteur, Canon was nice enough
to bundle a trial version of Digital Origin's EditDV, digital
editing software.

 &HT;    Tech breakthroughs evoke memories of holidays past
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shopping for the holidays used to be something I
complained about, but _ like finding just the right Christmas tree
and drinking eggnog _ turns out that it was an important part of
the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how memory repaints some of my old Christmas
adventures. The hassles seem good now, even the memories of the
year that I got caught in a dense fog in Oregon and called home to
say I might not find my way back until New Year's Eve. Looking
back, I remember how the fog painted little rainbow halos around
the Christmas lights. And it was cold, hard work dragging a
Christmas tree out of the woods, towing it on cross-country skis.
But, when I think of Christmas now, I remember how the dry snow
squeaked under my skis.
</P>
<P>
   The skis are in the basement now. I'm pretty sure the next time
I ski it'll be with the aid of a joystick, not my old-fashioned
bamboo poles.
</P>
<P>
   I miss Christmas this time of the year. I wonder if, 30 years
from now, people will reminisce about a terrific holiday Web page
they found, or a nifty electronic Christmas card they got. Probably
so. Times change. Maybe your family will remember this as the year
you got a digital camera, or a faster processor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe like me, you shopped in a different way this year, too.
</P>
<P>
   I've finished my Christmas shopping and I avoided the crowds,
didn't hear the corny department store recordings of carols. I
shopped online. It was efficient and easy and colder emotionally
than a February morning in North Dakota. It reminded me that for
everything technology gives us, it takes something away.
</P>
<P>
   I won't need any wrapping paper or ribbon this year. No one will
make fun of my clumsy attempts to tie a bow, and my cat won't have
the pleasure of sitting smack dab in the middle of the gift I'm
trying to wrap. Instead, someone else _ someone I've never seen _
will wrap up the present, pack it securely away and mail it for me.
So I won't be standing in line at the post office this year either.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I miss Christmas. But I think we've automated and
computerized it to the point where my grandparents wouldn't
recognize it. There won't be carolers in my neighborhood, but I
have a string of Christmas tree lights that play ``Silent Night''
with a plinky electronic sound.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the really bad part. I am as seduced by the convenience
of a high-tech Christmas as the next person. I sure had a choice
about where to spend my gift money, and I made it. That's the real
trouble with the changes technology makes in our lives: It's not
something _ unless you plan to move to a cabin out in the woods _
that you can tune out or ignore. It becomes part of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Probably I'm giving this advice to me as much as to you, but I
keep thinking that it may still be possible to turn off some of the
technology this holiday season. Think of it as a way of having a
Y2K-proof Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   If your Christmas tree crashes, it'll be the cat, not a fluke in
programming. So instead of gathering around the computer to read
holiday cards that arrived at the speed of of 43k bps, you could go
out and buy some of the paper ones and address them. And if you sat
at the kitchen table and hummed a Christmas song while you did it,
that would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but all that sounds good. I'm going to
go home tonight and take off that strand of computerized tree
lights. ``Silent Night'' is too beautiful a song to sound like it
is being played by elves who need a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this year, on Christmas Eve, you and your family will
gather around the light from a fireplace instead of a flickering
computer monitor.

 &HT;    Accessing of groups can ease info hunt
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What image comes to mind when someone says Internet?
Nowadays, for most people, it's the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Web has become (other than e-mail) the most
popular way to use that giant pipeline for information called the
Internet, it's not always the best way to get information.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was a Web, there were newsgroups. Unlike the
highly graphical Web, these are basically message areas. You post a
message, usually a question or a comment, and all the other members
of that newsgroup can see it and comment.
</P>
<P>
   Using the newsgroups is easy with the right software, and you'll
find out today how to get the news reader programs you need. For
highly specialized topics, newsgroups are still the place to find
the real expertise on the Web. Newsgroups are organized according
to topics and _ no matter what your interest _ you'll probably find
it there. Parents, however, should be warned. The newsgroups also
include some topic areas that would be offensively sexual or
obscene, even for the most liberal.
</P>
<P>
   While your Web browser offers the ability to read and create
newsgroup postings, a dedicated news reader works best. The best
place to find that reader is www.tucows.com. Whether you use a PC
running Windows or favor the Macintosh, or even an Amiga or a
machine running Linux, you'll find a reader here.
</P>
<P>
   Simply select the operating system using the pull-down menus and
then type in the search word ``newsgroups'' ... without the quote
marks. You'll be zapped to a page describing the news readers for
your particular operating system. There's a description of how each
works so you can select the one that suits your fancy. Keep in mind
that the listing usually will have both shareware readers (which
means that you are supposed to pay for it if you decide to keep it
and that some features may be disabled until you do pay) and
freeware readers (no payment is ever made).
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to newsgroups, you may have a difficult time
finding the ones you're most interested in. Things are still sort
of nerdlike out there. All newsgroup readers will _ the first time
you use them _ load in the names of the newsgroups available to
you. You can then use search terms to find the groups that you care
about.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to get an exact hit to find the right newsgroup
this way. For instance, if you want to find a newsgroup that sells
amateur radio equipment and you use the term ``ham'' ... as in ham
radio ... you won't get a hit if the newsgroup's proper name uses
the word ``amateur'' instead of ``ham.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a way around this. And we'll get back to the Web for
that. A search engine called Deja.com (www.deja.com/) does an
excellent job of searching the newsgroups. Just like the search
engines you use to find Web sites, you type in the search term and
Deja will ferret out the newsgroups where that topic is discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Using the search engine is an excellent way to find the sort of
newsgroups you'd enjoy. Just type in search words, make note of the
newsgroups where the term appears and try them out. You can click
on the links that Deja brings up to check them out, too.
</P>
<P>
   One last newsgroup tip: Be aware that if you do post a message,
your e-mail address appears. Some people choose to use one of the
free e-mail services such as Hot Mail or Yahoo to avoid getting
both junk mail to your main account and revealing your main e-mail
address to the casual newsgroup browser.

 &HT;    Amazon.com applying lessons of '98
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeff Bezos is a happy guy.
</P>
<P>
   In person, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com laughs
a lot, drinks a lot of coffee and talks excitedly about the bright
future of his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is one of the most successful online retailers, selling
everything from best-selling books to power tools and nearly
everything in between. In the race for holiday shoppers and their
dollars, Amazon is turning up at the top of nearly every list of
most-visited shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   The great online shopping stampede of 1998 taught Amazon a few
lessons, and this year it is ready with not only a one-click
ordering system but gift-wrapping services and wish lists shoppers
can fill out and mail to prospective gift-givers.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says one secret to his success is thinking of ways to make
the online shopping experience more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers should not and do not spend time in the shower
thinking up new technologies for Amazon,'' he said during a visit
to Atlanta last week, laughing the kind of laugh you can only have
when the world is spinning just the way you want it to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead into the 21st century, Bezos sees nothing but
fleets of UPS trucks speeding CDs, DVD players and power saws to
happy shoppers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos started out selling books, but not because of his love of
the printed word. ``We made a list of 20 products you could sell
online that you could not sell from mail-order companies,'' he says
of Amazon's humble beginnings. ``There weren't many mail-order book
companies, because if you tried to create a print catalog, it would
be the size of several Manhattan phone books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization I had was that one of the great things about
the Web is that you can build something online that you cannot do
in a physical store. We didn't know if it would work,'' he says.
``Frankly, I'm the most surprised person in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says that's one of the great things about the Web: It's
possible to use the Internet to sell as many books as you can keep
in warehouses. To make the process even easier for power shoppers,
the Web can add search functions and gift registries and recommend
other products in order to eliminate aimless browsing. You want a
book? Type in the title and order it. Simple. Easy. Profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Or it would be if Amazon didn't keep expanding to one product
category after another. ``We are a famously unprofitable company,''
Bezos says, flashing a ``What, me worry?'' smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says Amazon is making money on the products it sells, but
that those profits are going to marketing and adding new product
categories like electronics and home improvement items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build a place where customers can come to buy
anything online,'' he says. But to do that he'll need the help of
third-party product providers, many of which are already on board
in the Web site's ZShops area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a good job in one area,'' he says, ``your customers
will ask you to do more. One of our challenges is to let people
know we sell all these different things.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to do that is through Amazon's series of TV ads
featuring a chorus harmonizing about the many products available on
Amazon.com and how many tons of toys Amazon has. ``Every ton weighs
2,000 pounds,'' they sing. ``That's a lot of toys.'' Some find the
campaign kitschy and cute; others say it's just annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Are the ads working? Bezos isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody famous once quipped, `I know half my advertising is
working, I just don't know which half.''' He laughs that big,
booming laugh before getting serious again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to heavy up during the holiday season. There
are lots of shoppers and lots of first-time shoppers. We have to
try and motivate people to shop online for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are going to drive even more people to an already
enormously popular site, you had better make sure that if you
promise a book in three to seven working days, it turns up in that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows this better than Bezos, who admits he just scraped
by last Christmas and isn't about to let any kind of fulfillment
disaster ruin his holidays. He knows there's way too much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to invest in the back end of your business,'' he says
simply. ``We think it's important to ship things to people. In real
estate they say it's location, location, location. In the online
world it's technology, technology, technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tarnish your online reputation with bad customer
service,'' he says. ``The Internet is unforgiving for companies who
don't fulfill customer expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's no laughing matter for Bezos _ or any of his
competitors.

 &HT;    Before hitting the Web for toys, check the ratings
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We're thick into the holidays. By now, you've seen the
commercials. You've read the magazine and newspaper ads. Most of us
have been deluged with ads about companies wanting to sell you
things from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's called e-commerce because Web shopping doesn't sound too
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But which companies are worth your time and money?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, an online industry consultant based in
Massachusetts, ranks Web shopping sites by how easy they are to
use, how secure customers feel, how much the products cost and what
resources are available from the Web site. The results are
available at Gomez's Web site, www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez ranks the sites depending on the type of shopper as well.
For toy shoppers, Gomez considers those shopping for a gift, for an
educational toy, a trendy toy or a bargain toy.
</P>
<P>
   The top five toy-buying sites, as far as overall rankings were
concerned, were www.etoys.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com, www.kbkids
</P>
<P>
   .com, www.smarterkids
</P>
<P>
   .com and www.zanybrainy
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for the best price on toys, www
</P>
<P>
   .kbkids.com, www.etoys.com, www.servicemerchandise.com,
www.amazon.com and www
</P>
<P>
   .acetoys.com ranked highest.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez also ranks Web shopping sites for a variety of things,
including clothes, books, music, sporting goods, videos, cars,
computers, furniture, groceries and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boom is beginning to bust. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Early results of a study by a sociology professor at London's
Brunel University found that American teens don't seem to be as
interested in the Web as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, presented at Britain's Westminster Media Forum
earlier this month, found that the number of former teen Web users
outnumbered current teen Web regulars.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Steve Woolgar, attributed the early findings to
``boredom'' with the fad, according to an article on
www.techweb.com, an online technology magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But another London industry analyst, Fletcher Research, studied
the Internet habits of Britain's teens. Fletcher's most recent
British Internet User Monitor survey asked 50,000 Internet users.
The study found that those under the age of 18 made up 5 percent of
Britain's population, but 9 percent of Britain's online population.
</P>
<P>
   SITE HONORED
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta Web site developer won a Webby for building the best
cultural Web site. The site, www.tsinoy.com, is geared toward
people with Chinese-Filipino heritage. Tsinoy.com was one of more
than 1,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   Dux Raymond Sy works for Innovative-e.com. The Atlanta-based
company develops Web sites for companies that do business in the
domestic and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Tsinoy.com offers news, information and links to Tsinoys, people
of Chinese and Filipino heritage.

 &HT;    Graphire program more refined than mere drawing with a mouse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am no different from the average user in my
resistance to change. Whatever I'm accustomed to, regardless of how
antediluvian it may be, is almost always going to be better than
anything else, no matter how new and wonderful it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I believe I have become smitten with a new input
system.
</P>
<P>
   Wacom has long been in the business of making computer drawing
tablets for graphic artists. Being no artist, I never bothered to
try one until the company came out with its Graphire system.
</P>
<P>
   This consists of a stiff tablet about the size ofinary
mouse pad, a mouse and a pen, or pencil, as you wish. The pen and
the mouse are cordless; the cord is connected to the tablet.
</P>
<P>
   The one I'm using plugs into the USB port for Windows 98
systems. There is a serial port version for Windows 95 interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   I'm enjoying this outfit a great deal; it's an excellent system
for those who must have a mouse, but occasionally get involved in
graphics programs in which something more exact would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   I was somewhat put off initially by the lack of heft in the
mouse. However, it is a rollerless type and, once it is applied to
its tablet, this feeling goes away. The shape is only slightly
different from the standard Microsoft mouse and, like that standby,
it has two buttons divided by a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for me, just as comfortable to use.
</P>
<P>
   The pen takes some getting used to, of course. It is a simple
plastic tool, shaped like a pen, with an oblong button near the
tip. There is a blue protrusion on the back end which looks like an
eraser and indeed, in some applications, serves as an eraser.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the Graphire system is quite good.
The mouse and pen are customizable, both for your entire system or
for individual applications. Even the mouse buttons and the wheel
can be reprogrammed, although it's hard to imagine anyone wanting
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The harder you press with the pen, the stronger and darker the
line. The pressure needed to get the sort of line you ordinarily
want can be set up through the control software. Clicking on
whatever needs to be clicked is accomplished by tapping with the
tip of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a penholder at the top of the pad to keep the
instrument and prevent damage to its tip. There is a clear plastic
overlay on top of the working portion of the pad. You can slip a
drawing or whatever under the overlay, and then trace it out into
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Outlined on the main section of the pad is a rectangle that
represents the computer screen. You can set up the pen so that
where it works on the pad corresponds exactly to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you open up a graphics program, take the pen
and make squiggles on the upper left corner of the tablet
rectangle, that's where you'll make them on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse can be made to work this way, too, but that gets very
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Using the pen comfortably takes practice, but, if you'll recall,
so did using the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The pen ordinarily won't work in a word processor, but there's
an accompanying program that will allow you to use the pen to mark
up copy. There's also a nice paint program, although a drawing
program would seem more useful.
</P>
<P>
   The printed manual is very skimpy, but the online manual is
outstanding. For $99.95, Graphire is very hard to resist. More
information is available at www.wacom.com.

SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO DECK THE HALLS
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photos of a rosemary topiary and the designer) 
 By AMY SCHLEIN 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever feel like you don't want to bother with decorating an
8-foot evergreen tree _ but you don't want to be a Scrooge, either?
</P>
<P>
   There are other Christmas tree options, some easier, others more
stylistic, says Jerry Bolduan of Green Valley Growers in
Sebastopol, Calif. Bolduan, who frequently contributes to Martha
Stewart Living magazine, offers some alternatives. ''The basic
thing is that you don't have to have the basic conical shaped
tree,'' he says, ''although it can be achieved using other
materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of his ideas for holiday decorating:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Oak: Using the branches of classic native oak trees that
have lichen or moss growing in them can be really beautiful with
tiny white lights, says Bolduan.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Topiaries: Bolduan says topiaries are a bit sensitive,
but make a beautiful presentation. ''Rosemary topiaries can be used
as a good alternative to a classic Christmas tree. Not only are
they fragrant, like a Christmas tree, but they can be grown in a
pot or in the ground and used from year to year, both for
decoration and cooking,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Topiaries can range in size from a a pretty little 2-foot-tall
tree made of ivy to sheared evergreens as tall as 6 feet, Bolduan
notes. One of the benefits of using these is that they can become a
decoration for the front entry of your home when the holiday season
is over.
</P>
<P>
   Topiaries typically are not happy indoors. If you want a topiary
as part of your permanent decorating scheme, you really need to
have three of them to rotate, Bolduan explains. Two can remain
outside for two weeks, while one spends the week inside with you.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Make your own artificial tree: Get a conical shaped
wire frame used for a topiary, put it directly , then mount it on
top of a pot set on a table or on the floor. Make a natural
garland, or use artificial garland, and wind it around the frame in
coil-like fashion to give it that Christmas-tree look, Bolduan
says.
</P>
<P>
   When using cut and wired fresh materials in a garland, remember
they're no longer in water, Bolduan says. He suggests choosing
materials that, once they're cut, will hold their shape and color
and won't fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best red berry that will not shrivel is called nandina, or
heavenly bamboo. A blue berry that will not shrivel is a vibernum
berry. The drier the berry is when put it in your decoration, the
longer it will last. For example, the nandina berry is a beautiful
red berry, and one year later, that berry will look just like it
did when you used it.''
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Magnolia: Bolduan recommends a variety that has a brown
velvet surface on the back of the leaf. ''That magnolia works
extremely well for wreath making,'' he says. ''I did a book with
Martha Stewart about the wreaths of every state in the union, and
we did a magnolia wreath, using brown ribbon as an accent that
matched the reverse of the leaf perfectly. It's probably one of the
most popular in the whole book.''
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Japanese maple: ''Japanese maple is especially
beautiful,'' he says. He suggests that you always buy this as a
plant, never as a cutting. ''At Christmastime, it will no longer
have any leaves, but the delicate nature of it going up umbrella
fashion, and coming down, with very fine branching structure, could
make a really dramatic decoration, especially on a table. And it
would hold ornaments extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The double advantage is after you use it for the holidays, you
can plant it outdoors either in the ground or in a container.''
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Display items: Finally, Bolduan says remember that many
things beyond plants and trees will work as a focal point for a
display, especially if it particularly evokes memories and feelings
of the holidays for you.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't have to be a tree. I used to use an old sled and
old metal truck from when I was a boy, one of the ones that you
actually got inside and pedaled,'' he says. Anything that reminds
you of the holidays, especially ones past, offers great
possibilities for decorating, he says.

HERBS THAT CLASH WITH MEDICATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLES DOWNEY

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A congestive heart failure patient had been doing well on
prescription medications for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a regular checkup, her physician noticed the health of
her heart seemed to be heading downhill. The puzzled doctor was on
the verge of doing a biopsy when he learned the woman was taking
the herb hawthorne, said to help with some circulatory disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hawthorne was canceling the woman's heart medications in
ways that are still not quite clear,'' says Steven B. Karch, M.D.,
toxicologist, expert on narcotic abuse and author of ''The
Consumer's Guide to Herbal Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But as soon as the woman stopped taking hawthorne, the health
of her heart improved and remained stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and other health experts are now learning that other
herbs taken with prescription and over-the-counter drugs can be a
bad mix, according to Dr. Karch, who is also the assistant medical
examiner for the city of San Francisco, and other experts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular herbs _ echinacea, ginkgo biloba,
ginseng, St. John's wort and valerian _ can present the most
dangers when combined with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know of five deaths when a person on a prescribed
blood-thinning medication like Coumadin also took ginkgo,'' Dr.
Karch says. ''The ginkgo works as yet another blood thinner. The
combination can cause internal bleeding. One death was caused when
a person taking daily doses of aspirin also took ginkgo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo is said to help memory, endurance and, in some men,
erectile dysfunction. Your health can be safeguarded by always
telling your physician what herbal preparations or vitamin
megadoses you may be taking. Unlike prescription drugs, herbal
products are not regulated by the federal government and do not
have to undergo testing to make sure they are safe or that they
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be mislead by the word 'natural,''' Dr. Karch says.
''Too many people think natural also means 'non-toxic' and that is
not always the case.''

professor of nutritional physiology at St. Mary's University in San
Antonio, Texas, concurs: ''Don't take ginkgo if you are taking
vitamin E, flax oil or fish oil. Any of those, plus the herb, can
thin your blood too much and lead to internal bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   And that can lead to blindness or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea, the top selling herb in the United States, ostensibly
works by bolstering your immune system. But there are many cases in
which the immune system is already far too active.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have an immune system disorder like arthritis or lupus,
you do not want to stimulate your immune system any more,'' Dr.
Karch says. ''Those diseases are caused by an overactive immune
function.'' Transplant patients _ who must take prescription drugs
to ensure their bodies do not reject the donated organ _ should
also forsake echinacea.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Professor Trankina: ''Echinacea is not meant to be taken
indefinitely. I advise patients to go off it after six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's wort, sometimes known as the herbal Prozac, is often
taken to relieve depression. However, if you are already taking a
mood elevator, skip the St. John's wort. The two can interact and
led to adverse side affects like mania, extreme fatigue and
incoherency.
</P>
<P>
   A class of prescription medications known as ''psoralens,'' used
to treat some skin diseases like vitiligio and psoriasis, can also
interact with St. John's wort. Taking both can lead to serious
sunburns because both cause sensitivity to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Kava is a herbal sedative often used for its calming effects and
its ability to relieve anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if you are already taking a prescribed sleeping pill, and
you add in kava, you can easily be over-sedated,'' says Professor
Trankina.
</P>
<P>
   Pass on the kava if you are taking drugs for Parkinson's disease
or antipsychotic medications or if you've had alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I advise women to skip ginseng if they are taking estrogen
supplements,'' says Professor Trankina. ''Some forms of ginseng
contain weak forms of estrogen. Too much estrogen promotes the
growth of breast and uterine tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerian is often used as a sleep aid so experts say you should
not take that herb with alcohol, sedatives or sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Trankina advises, ''Of all the popular herbs on the
market, I recommend staying away from at least one: ma huang. It is
basically a herbal form of amphetamine, because it contains a drug
known as ephedra, which has been banned at one time or another.
Most people who take it will be OK, but many will develop a
heartbeat that races so fast, it can actually stop the heart.''

 &HT;    Tech breakthroughs evoke memories of holidays past
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shopping for the holidays used to be something I
complained about, but _ like finding just the right Christmas tree
and drinking eggnog _ turns out that it was an important part of
the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how memory repaints some of my old Christmas
adventures. The hassles seem good now, even the memories of the
year that I got caught in a dense fog in Oregon and called home to
say I might not find my way back until New Year's Eve. Looking
back, I remember how the fog painted little rainbow halos around
the Christmas lights. And it was cold, hard work dragging a
Christmas tree out of the woods, towing it on cross-country skis.
But, when I think of Christmas now, I remember how the dry snow
squeaked under my skis.
</P>
<P>
   The skis are in the basement now. I'm pretty sure the next time
I ski it'll be with the aid of a joystick, not my old-fashioned
bamboo poles.
</P>
<P>
   I miss Christmas this time of the year. I wonder if, 30 years
from now, people will reminisce about a terrific holiday Web page
they found, or a nifty electronic Christmas card they got. Probably
so. Times change. Maybe your family will remember this as the year
you got a digital camera, or a faster processor.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe like me, you shopped in a different way this year, too.
</P>
<P>
   I've finished my Christmas shopping and I avoided the crowds,
didn't hear the corny department store recordings of carols. I
shopped online. It was efficient and easy and colder emotionally
than a February morning in North Dakota. It reminded me that for
everything technology gives us, it takes something away.
</P>
<P>
   I won't need any wrapping paper or ribbon this year. No one will
make fun of my clumsy attempts to tie a bow, and my cat won't have
the pleasure of sitting smack dab in the middle of the gift I'm
trying to wrap. Instead, someone else _ someone I've never seen _
will wrap up the present, pack it securely away and mail it for me.
So I won't be standing in line at the post office this year either.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I miss Christmas. But I think we've automated and
computerized it to the point where my grandparents wouldn't
recognize it. There won't be carolers in my neighborhood, but I
have a string of Christmas tree lights that play ``Silent Night''
with a plinky electronic sound.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the really bad part. I am as seduced by the convenience
of a high-tech Christmas as the next person. I sure had a choice
about where to spend my gift money, and I made it. That's the real
trouble with the changes technology makes in our lives: It's not
something _ unless you plan to move to a cabin out in the woods _
that you can tune out or ignore. It becomes part of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Probably I'm giving this advice to me as much as to you, but I
keep thinking that it may still be possible to turn off some of the
technology this holiday season. Think of it as a way of having a
Y2K-proof Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   If your Christmas tree crashes, it'll be the cat, not a fluke in
programming. So instead of gathering around the computer to read
holiday cards that arrived at the speed of of 43k bps, you could go
out and buy some of the paper ones and address them. And if you sat
at the kitchen table and hummed a Christmas song while you did it,
that would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but all that sounds good. I'm going to
go home tonight and take off that strand of computerized tree
lights. ``Silent Night'' is too beautiful a song to sound like it
is being played by elves who need a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this year, on Christmas Eve, you and your family will
gather around the light from a fireplace instead of a flickering
computer monitor.

 &HT;    Our cup warmeth over
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When making that grand list of annoying gadgets,
you have to include the cup warmer. Who thought of this ingenious
device? If you're not familiar with the cup warmer, it could best
be described as a disc that heats up and, in theory, keeps your cup
warm. Believe me, this is only in theory. This death disc does
nothing except heat the bottom of your cup to such an intense heat
that its only practical use is ritualistic burning of the flesh
(or, if you're on the creative side of things, you can use it to
fuse glass beads and make pretty sculptures). This gadget actually
has the ability to transcend ``annoying'' and enter the hallowed
realm of ``hyper-annoying.'' To attain this, all you have to do is
plug in the cup warmer next to a colleague's computer, let it heat
up and don't put a cup on it. The howls and screams will tell it
all.

 &HT;    Amazon.com applying lessons of '98
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeff Bezos is a happy guy.
</P>
<P>
   In person, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com laughs
a lot, drinks a lot of coffee and talks excitedly about the bright
future of his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is one of the most successful online retailers, selling
everything from best-selling books to power tools and nearly
everything in between. In the race for holiday shoppers and their
dollars, Amazon is turning up at the top of nearly every list of
most-visited shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   The great online shopping stampede of 1998 taught Amazon a few
lessons, and this year it is ready with not only a one-click
ordering system but gift-wrapping services and wish lists shoppers
can fill out and mail to prospective gift-givers.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says one secret to his success is thinking of ways to make
the online shopping experience more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers should not and do not spend time in the shower
thinking up new technologies for Amazon,'' he said during a visit
to Atlanta last week, laughing the kind of laugh you can only have
when the world is spinning just the way you want it to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead into the 21st century, Bezos sees nothing but
fleets of UPS trucks speeding CDs, DVD players and power saws to
happy shoppers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos started out selling books, but not because of his love of
the printed word. ``We made a list of 20 products you could sell
online that you could not sell from mail-order companies,'' he says
of Amazon's humble beginnings. ``There weren't many mail-order book
companies, because if you tried to create a print catalog, it would
be the size of several Manhattan phone books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization I had was that one of the great things about
the Web is that you can build something online that you cannot do
in a physical store. We didn't know if it would work,'' he says.
``Frankly, I'm the most surprised person in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says that's one of the great things about the Web: It's
possible to use the Internet to sell as many books as you can keep
in warehouses. To make the process even easier for power shoppers,
the Web can add search functions and gift registries and recommend
other products in order to eliminate aimless browsing. You want a
book? Type in the title and order it. Simple. Easy. Profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Or it would be if Amazon didn't keep expanding to one product
category after another. ``We are a famously unprofitable company,''
Bezos says, flashing a ``What, me worry?'' smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says Amazon is making money on the products it sells, but
that those profits are going to marketing and adding new product
categories like electronics and home improvement items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build a place where customers can come to buy
anything online,'' he says. But to do that he'll need the help of
third-party product providers, many of which are already on board
in the Web site's ZShops area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a good job in one area,'' he says, ``your customers
will ask you to do more. One of our challenges is to let people
know we sell all these different things.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to do that is through Amazon's series of TV ads
featuring a chorus harmonizing about the many products available on
Amazon.com and how many tons of toys Amazon has. ``Every ton weighs
2,000 pounds,'' they sing. ``That's a lot of toys.'' Some find the
campaign kitschy and cute; others say it's just annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Are the ads working? Bezos isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody famous once quipped, `I know half my advertising is
working, I just don't know which half.''' He laughs that big,
booming laugh before getting serious again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to heavy up during the holiday season. There
are lots of shoppers and lots of first-time shoppers. We have to
try and motivate people to shop online for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are going to drive even more people to an already
enormously popular site, you had better make sure that if you
promise a book in three to seven working days, it turns up in that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows this better than Bezos, who admits he just scraped
by last Christmas and isn't about to let any kind of fulfillment
disaster ruin his holidays. He knows there's way too much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to invest in the back end of your business,'' he says
simply. ``We think it's important to ship things to people. In real
estate they say it's location, location, location. In the online
world it's technology, technology, technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tarnish your online reputation with bad customer
service,'' he says. ``The Internet is unforgiving for companies who
don't fulfill customer expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's no laughing matter for Bezos _ or any of his
competitors.

 &HT;    Accessing of groups can ease info hunt
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What image comes to mind when someone says Internet?
Nowadays, for most people, it's the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Web has become (other than e-mail) the most
popular way to use that giant pipeline for information called the
Internet, it's not always the best way to get information.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was a Web, there were newsgroups. Unlike the
highly graphical Web, these are basically message areas. You post a
message, usually a question or a comment, and all the other members
of that newsgroup can see it and comment.
</P>
<P>
   Using the newsgroups is easy with the right software, and you'll
find out today how to get the news reader programs you need. For
highly specialized topics, newsgroups are still the place to find
the real expertise on the Web. Newsgroups are organized according
to topics and _ no matter what your interest _ you'll probably find
it there. Parents, however, should be warned. The newsgroups also
include some topic areas that would be offensively sexual or
obscene, even for the most liberal.
</P>
<P>
   While your Web browser offers the ability to read and create
newsgroup postings, a dedicated news reader works best. The best
place to find that reader is www.tucows.com. Whether you use a PC
running Windows or favor the Macintosh, or even an Amiga or a
machine running Linux, you'll find a reader here.
</P>
<P>
   Simply select the operating system using the pull-down menus and
then type in the search word ``newsgroups'' ... without the quote
marks. You'll be zapped to a page describing the news readers for
your particular operating system. There's a description of how each
works so you can select the one that suits your fancy. Keep in mind
that the listing usually will have both shareware readers (which
means that you are supposed to pay for it if you decide to keep it
and that some features may be disabled until you do pay) and
freeware readers (no payment is ever made).
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to newsgroups, you may have a difficult time
finding the ones you're most interested in. Things are still sort
of nerdlike out there. All newsgroup readers will _ the first time
you use them _ load in the names of the newsgroups available to
you. You can then use search terms to find the groups that you care
about.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to get an exact hit to find the right newsgroup
this way. For instance, if you want to find a newsgroup that sells
amateur radio equipment and you use the term ``ham'' ... as in ham
radio ... you won't get a hit if the newsgroup's proper name uses
the word ``amateur'' instead of ``ham.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a way around this. And we'll get back to the Web for
that. A search engine called Deja.com (www.deja.com/) does an
excellent job of searching the newsgroups. Just like the search
engines you use to find Web sites, you type in the search term and
Deja will ferret out the newsgroups where that topic is discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Using the search engine is an excellent way to find the sort of
newsgroups you'd enjoy. Just type in search words, make note of the
newsgroups where the term appears and try them out. You can click
on the links that Deja brings up to check them out, too.
</P>
<P>
   One last newsgroup tip: Be aware that if you do post a message,
your e-mail address appears. Some people choose to use one of the
free e-mail services such as Hot Mail or Yahoo to avoid getting
both junk mail to your main account and revealing your main e-mail
address to the casual newsgroup browser.

 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the marching out of ``Toy Story 2,'' kids
everywhere are waiting with bated breath for the game. Wait no
longer! Activision's Toy Story 2 ($50 for Playstation and $60 for
Nintendo, www.activision.com) is on the shelf and is sure to be a
hot one for the holiday season. The game follows the movie in that
Woody, the cowboy doll, is stolen, and Buzz Lightyear and friends
take on the task to find him. In the game, you can earn rocket
boots, grappling hooks and other accessories to help in your quest.
If you're more into the sinister battle of new toys vs. old toys,
then Sega's Toy Commander ($50, www.sega.com) is for you. In this
game, you take on the role of Andrew, whose older toys have
rebelled against the newer ones. You must prove yourself a Toy
Commander and bring the toys under your control. Fantastic graphics
are the high point of this one.

   Grolier Interactive's Virtual Serengeti ($30,
www.gi.grolier.com, for PC and Mac) is as loaded as an elephant gun
with enough live-action video to turn even the most sedentary young
joystick jockey into a big-game hunter. Players take on the persona
of a research assistant for a nature documentary, sent to Africa to
study animal behavior and collect video. Virtual explorers navigate
more than 50 360-degree panoramic environments and seven virtual
Serengeti locations, storing information in an interactive journal.
Along the way, players use the collected information and Grolier
Multimedia Encyclopedia online articles to answer questions about
animals they've spotted. Installation is a snap, and on-screen
video of Nature TV host George Page is available to help wee
adventurers who get stuck. The documentation says the game is for
ages 9 and up, but our test 7-year-old installed and played for
hours on his own. Virtual Serengeti is not your father's Sunday
afternoon nature film.

 &HT;    A multitalented mini
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We all want to make a ``Blair Witch Project.''
After all, the garage movie made $200 million _ and that would be a
nice chunk of change in anyone's pocket. Likewise, it would be nice
to have a digital camera that could record family events on video
and also take still photos. That's why you should pick up the
palm-sized Canon Elura MiniDV Camcorder ($1,800, www.canondv.com).
This bad boy offers high-resolution video, a still-photo mode and a
digital motor drive (which takes high-resolution pictures at 30
frames a second). The Elura boasts 380k pixels so the user can get
premium quality video and stills. The camera is also equipped with
a 48x digital zoom, a variety of digital effects and a color LCD
viewing screen. And for the budding auteur, Canon was nice enough
to bundle a trial version of Digital Origin's EditDV, digital
editing software.

 &HT;    Before hitting the Web for toys, check the ratings

   ATLANTA _ We're thick into the holidays. By now, you've seen the
commercials. You've read the magazine and newspaper ads. Most of us
have been deluged with ads about companies wanting to sell you
things from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's called e-commerce because Web shopping doesn't sound too
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But which companies are worth your time and money?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, an online industry consultant based in
Massachusetts, ranks Web shopping sites by how easy they are to
use, how secure customers feel, how much the products cost and what
resources are available from the Web site. The results are
available at Gomez's Web site, www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez ranks the sites depending on the type of shopper as well.
For toy shoppers, Gomez considers those shopping for a gift, for an
educational toy, a trendy toy or a bargain toy.
</P>
<P>
   The top five toy-buying sites, as far as overall rankings were
concerned, were www.etoys.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com, www.kbkids
</P>
<P>
   .com, www.smarterkids
</P>
<P>
   .com and www.zanybrainy
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for the best price on toys, www
</P>
<P>
   .kbkids.com, www.etoys.com, www.servicemerchandise.com,
www.amazon.com and www
</P>
<P>
   .acetoys.com ranked highest.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez also ranks Web shopping sites for a variety of things,
including clothes, books, music, sporting goods, videos, cars,
computers, furniture, groceries and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boom is beginning to bust. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Early results of a study by a sociology professor at London's
Brunel University found that American teens don't seem to be as
interested in the Web as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, presented at Britain's Westminster Media Forum
earlier this month, found that the number of former teen Web users
outnumbered current teen Web regulars.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Steve Woolgar, attributed the early findings to
``boredom'' with the fad, according to an article on
www.techweb.com, an online technology magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But another London industry analyst, Fletcher Research, studied
the Internet habits of Britain's teens. Fletcher's most recent
British Internet User Monitor survey asked 50,000 Internet users.
The study found that those under the age of 18 made up 5 percent of
Britain's population, but 9 percent of Britain's online population.

   SITE HONORED
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta Web site developer won a Webby for building the best
cultural Web site. The site, www.tsinoy.com, is geared toward
people with Chinese-Filipino heritage. Tsinoy.com was one of more
than 1,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   Dux Raymond Sy works for Innovative-e.com. The Atlanta-based
company develops Web sites for companies that do business in the
domestic and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Tsinoy.com offers news, information and links to Tsinoys, people
of Chinese and Filipino heritage.

 &HT;    Graphire program more refined than mere drawing with a mouse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am no different from the average user in my
resistance to change. Whatever I'm accustomed to, regardless of how
antediluvian it may be, is almost always going to be better than
anything else, no matter how new and wonderful it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I believe I have become smitten with a new input
system.
</P>
<P>
   Wacom has long been in the business of making computer drawing
tablets for graphic artists. Being no artist, I never bothered to
try one until the company came out with its Graphire system.
</P>
<P>
   This consists of a stiff tablet about the size of an ordinary
mouse pad, a mouse and a pen, or pencil, as you wish. The pen and
the mouse are cordless; the cord is connected to the tablet.
</P>
<P>
   The one I'm using plugs into the USB port for Windows 98
systems. There is a serial port version for Windows 95 interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   I'm enjoying this outfit a great deal; it's an excellent system
for those who must have a mouse, but occasionally get involved in
graphics programs in which something more exact would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   I was somewhat put off initially by the lack of heft in the
mouse. However, it is a rollerless type and, once it is applied to
its tablet, this feeling goes away. The shape is only slightly
different from the standard Microsoft mouse and, like that standby,
it has two buttons divided by a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for me, just as comfortable to use.
</P>
<P>
   The pen takes some getting used to, of course. It is a simple
plastic tool, shaped like a pen, with an oblong button near the
tip. There is a blue protrusion on the back end which looks like an
eraser and indeed, in some applications, serves as an eraser.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the Graphire system is quite good.
The mouse and pen are customizable, both for your entire system or
for individual applications. Even the mouse buttons and the wheel
can be reprogrammed, although it's hard to imagine anyone wanting
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The harder you press with the pen, the stronger and darker the
line. The pressure needed to get the sort of line you ordinarily
want can be set up through the control software. Clicking on
whatever needs to be clicked is accomplished by tapping with the
tip of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a penholder at the top of the pad to keep the
instrument and prevent damage to its tip. There is a clear plastic
overlay on top of the working portion of the pad. You can slip a
drawing or whatever under the overlay, and then trace it out into
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Outlined on the main section of the pad is a rectangle that
represents the computer screen. You can set up the pen so that
where it works on the pad corresponds exactly to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you open up a graphics program, take the pen
and make squiggles on the upper left corner of the tablet
rectangle, that's where you'll make them on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse can be made to work this way, too, but that gets very
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Using the pen comfortably takes practice, but, if you'll recall,
so did using the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The pen ordinarily won't work in a word processor, but there's
an accompanying program that will allow you to use the pen to mark
up copy. There's also a nice paint program, although a drawing
program would seem more useful.
</P>
<P>
   The printed manual is very skimpy, but the online manual is
outstanding. For $99.95, Graphire is very hard to resist. More
information is available at www.wacom.com.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Could you print the current cost of items in
``The Twelve Days of Christmas'' song?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Wright
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad the folks at PNC Bank do the calculations every year.
Does your true love have a high Visa limit? The total for all the
gifts listed in the song (364 separate items because each
dayrepeats the prior days' gifts) is $59,719.33. Economizing?
Purchase each item once, lowering the total to $14,940.17. So which
items rose in cost? Pear tree prices were affected by a drought.
Labor costs for the drummers and lords rose. Want the full
breakdown? Visit www.pncbank.com./12days/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have found feathers on our property. I would like to know
how to sanitize them. _ John Oliver
</P>
<P>
   A: Better leave those feathers on the ground. ``Collecting any
feathers from nongame birds such as bluebirds and cardinals is a
violation of the National Migratory Bird Treaty Act,'' says Paul
Sunby, of SWCA, an environmental consulting firm. Collecting
feathers from threatened or endangered birds (e.g., bald eagles)
violates the Endangered Species Act. Yikes! Why? No way for the
authorities to tell if you found the feather or killed the bird to
get it. But you probably have duck feathers from birds you were
licensed to shoot, correct? In that case, the advice of Martinez
Brothers Taxidermists' Alex Martinez applies: Wash the feathers in
dishwashing soap and water. Rinse in clear water, then soak in
Coleman fuel (yes, as in lantern) while wearing a mask in a
well-ventilated area. Blow-dry. Next, dust with a mixture of half
cornmeal and half borax. Toss until dry. Remove the dusting
solution with a hair dryer and soft cloth, and arrange the
feather's barbs.
</P>
<P>
   This process rids the feathers of blood, dirt and fat. To
protect from bugs and other critters, Martinez uses a powdered
insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several co-workers and I received an electronic message about
an ill girl, Amy Bruce, and Make-A-Wish Foundation. I thought it
was a scam. Others swear this is an honest message. Who is right? _
M.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are right. This bogus electronic chain letter has
prompted inquiries to various Make-A-Wish offices, which are not
connected to the plea. The Make-A-Wish Foundation has identified
the person who started the chain letter and has contacted the
individual's Internet service provider to pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I found what looks like WWII ammunition while cleaning out a
shed behind my grandparent's farmhouse in East Texas. (My late
uncle served combat duty in WWII.) The ammunition is in a metal box
painted army green. Inside there are about 10-12 small cardboard
boxes labeled ``50 cartridges, Carbine, Caliber .30 M1, Ammunition
Lot PG26258, Kings Mills Ordnance Plant.'' Is it legal to possess
this? Does it have value in a collectors market? How do I sell it
or dispose of it safely? _ M.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is legal and no, there is no collectors market I
could find. As for the hunter's market? There is no way to know if
the ammunition has been properly stored all these years. Did it
ever get wet and stay wet? It may not be in any condition to be
fired safely. Please do not toss the ammunition in the trash or
bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently purchased a car and were charged $50 for a
vehicle inventory tax although the car will not be on the dealer's
lot when the annual inventory is taken. Is this legal? If every car
sold during the year is charged this tax, how does that figure for
the amount of tax paid to the state by the dealer? Who gets the
excess cash?
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy Ulland
</P>
<P>
   A: The automobile inventory tax officially changed January 1994
to a property tax _ even though some dealers still refer to it as
the vehicle inventory tax. Dealers are charged property tax on
their vehicles based on a complex mathematical formula, says Sheila
Clancy of the State Comptroller's office. So yes, the charge is
legal. All collected tax goes to local property tax jurisdictions _
the county, AISD, ACC, etc. Clancy reminds consumers this is a
property tax paid by the dealer so you might try negotiating it out
of your car deal. More questions? Call the comptroller's office at
(800) 252-9121.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter wet the mattress recently and it doesn't have any
type of protective covering. How can I clean the mattress? It is
soaked. _ L.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Turn the mattress on its side and position a towel beneath
the stain. Sponge the spot with a mixture of one part vinegar and
one part water. If you have a wet vacuum, use it. Blot excess with
clean towels. Final sponging should be with clean water. Repeat as
necessary. Dry with a hair dryer or, if possible, in the sun. Use a
disinfectant spray. And buy a protective cover so you do not have
to repeat the process. Q: I have always wondered about Santa's
reindeer. Are they males or females? _ M.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Females _ one and all. Both male and female reindeer sport
antlers. According to John Dinon of Michigan's Binder Park Zoo,
male reindeer shed their antlers at the end of November or the
beginning of December; females keep them until spring. So Santa's
Dec. 25th antlered reindeer must all be females. The females keep
the antlers to compete successfully with the larger males for food
during the winter and, after giving birth, to protect the fawns.
</P>
<P>
   Dinon adds that the clicking of the reindeer hooves heard ``up
on the housetop'' is accurate. Reindeer walking on any surface make
a clicking sound. Remember the names of the reindeer that Rudolph
led? Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder and
Blitzen. You read that right _ Donder, not Donner, is what Clement
Moore wrote in ``A Visit from St. Nicholas.'' Donder is Dutch for
thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have visited the Elisabet Ney Museum. They have a corner
stone that says, ``sursum 1892 _ 1902.'' I suppose that's Latin.
What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   _ James G.
</P>
<P>
   A: The studio was built in 1892, and the tower as well as the
east wing were added in 1902. ``Sursum corda'' is a term that
German-born sculptor Elisabet Ney embraced, which means ``uplift
your heart'' _ to yearn, to aspire, to seek. ``Sursum'' (upwards)
is the title of a Ney sculpture. ``That cornerstone refers to Ney's
ideals _ to aspire with unfaltering zeal,'' says Mary Collins
Blackmon, museum curator. The Elisabet Ney Museum, 304 E. 44th St.,
houses her marble and plaster statuary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a very special friend that is a big Chicago Cubs fan.
I would like to get her a button down jersey with her name on the
back. Any suggestions? Perhaps a phone number for the Pro Shop at
their baseball park (Wrigley Field?). _ G.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact Chicago Cubs Souvenirs at (800) 248-9467 to place an
order. But you are too late to have the jersey monogrammed if this
is a Christmas present. A custom job takes 3-6 weeks. Order a plain
jersey and have her name put on locally.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail

 &HT;    A field trip to learn about Atlanta's pandas
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few weeks ago, News for Kids asked you to call in
with your best question about Zoo Atlanta's giant pandas. NFK took
the best five questioners out of nearly 300 to the zoo to see the
rare bears and to meet the head panda keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what 6-year-old Morgan Bonham of Madison, Ga., 8-year old
Anna Perling of Dunwoody, Ga., 9-year-old Kendall Harris of
Sharpsburg, Ga., 10-year-old Kyle Mancini of Alpharetta, Ga., and
12-year-old Billy Townsend of Ben Hill, Ga., learned:
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's hottest new couple start their day around 7 a.m., but
it takes more than a clock radio to rouse Lun Lun and Yang Yang. It
takes the zoo keepers, a bamboo appetizer and the promise of a bowl
of high-protein porridge.
</P>
<P>
   While they're eating, the keepers ``check their poop,'' get a
urine sample and weigh the ``little'' critters to make sure they're
healthy. The pair sit on platform scales while they eat, says
assistant curator for large mammals Rich Sartor.
</P>
<P>
   The male, Yang Yang, is the lightweight for now, tipping the
scales at about 185 pounds. His female buddy, Lun Lun, weighs in
around 205 pounds. Sartor says Yang Yang will most likely end up
the heavyweight. Yang Yang lost weight last summer in China when he
was sick.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, the pandas head out to their day rooms or to
their caves to play, sleep, wrestle, explore and, as our five
winners observed, scratch. All the while, researchers study the
animals' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   So what did NFK's winners really want to know? Here's a sample:
</P>
<P>
   Anna: We read in this animal book that pandas were members of
the raccoon family and they weren't really bears.
</P>
<P>
   Rich (the panda keeper): People weren't really sure what to do
with them when they were trying to put them in a taxonomic family.
Some people thought the best place to put them was the raccoon
family. But they've been doing biochemistry work, and the
biochemistry work puts them in the bear group. (So you can say
panda bear now.)
</P>
<P>
   Billy: I saw on TV when the pandas were in China that the
veterinarians and staff were speaking to the pandas in Chinese. Is
the staff in Atlanta going to communicate with the pandas in
English or Chinese?
</P>
<P>
   Rich: We'll be talking to them in English because we don't speak
Chinese. So the pandas will be learning a new language. They can
pick it up pretty quickly as they get to know their keepers; they
see their keepers every day. Their keepers are the source of good
things, so they like their keepers and pay attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle: Do the keepers have contact with them?
</P>
<P>
   Rich: We don't go into the habitat with our pandas, we don't
actually step in there. But we can touch them through the bars,
particularly if they lean up against it with their backside. We can
get a good scratch in as long as everyone's being careful. As
placid, as calm as they seem to be ... nobody wants to be a panda
toy. You could get hurt or even killed, and they may not even mean
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan: How do they play?
</P>
<P>
   Rich: Rough and tumble. They like to wrestle, roll around on
each other, do somersaults. They like to climb and drape themselves
over the logs. They're pretty silly actually.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall: How do they communicate with each other?
</P>
<P>
   Rich: They can see each other, so they can read each other's
behavior. ... And they make some sounds. They growl; they huff;
they bleat like a sheep. That's something to hear, and it really
does sound like a sheep or a goat. ... They can kind of bark like a
dog. That's an angry one. And they can roar like a bear.

   ATLANTA _ A 6-year-old boy is the focus of a United States-Cuba
tug of war over who should have custody of him. Elian Gonzalez
crossed the ocean between Cuba and Florida in a boat with his
mother, stepfather and others. They were trying to reach the United
States. Many Cubans feel they would have a better life in America.
However, his mother, stepfather and nine others died when their
boat sank. The boy was found floating in an inner tube off the
coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now his father, who lives in Cuba, wants Elian returned to the
island nation, which is about 90 miles south of Key West, Fla. His
great-aunt and great-uncle want to raise him in Miami.

   JURY FINDS MLK JR. KILLED BY CONSPIRACY
</P>
<P>
   A Memphis, Tenn., jury decided last week that more than one
person conspired, or worked together, to kill the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader was shot in 1968 standing outside a
Memphis hotel. About a year later, the accused white assassin,
James Earl Ray, pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to
99 years in prison. Ray later said he didn't do it and tried for 30
years to prove his innocence. He died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The King family felt that Ray was innocent. The family sued Loyd
Jowers because, six years ago, he claimed he paid someone other
than Ray to kill King. The Kings' lawyer said Jowers was part of a
big conspiracy involving the Mafia and agents of the federal
government. He said King was targeted because of his opposition to
the Vietnam War and plans for a huge ``poor people's march'' on
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed there was a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY PULLS VILLAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. has agreed to change a sombrero-wearing
character in the ``Toy Story 2'' video game because it offended
some Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   One level of the game features a villain with a mustache and a
sombrero (a large hat), which Hispanic activists said was a Mexican
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's degrading, it's dehumanizing. It stereotypes
Mexicans as villains,'' said Oscar de la Torre, a counselor at
Santa Monica High School in California.
</P>
<P>
   The character does not appear in the ``Toy Story 2'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that a portion of the game was offensive,'' a Disney
spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Could you print the current cost of items in
``The Twelve Days of Christmas'' song?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Wright
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad the folks at PNC Bank do the calculations every year.
Does your true love have a high Visa limit? The total for all the
gifts listed in the song (364 separate items because each
dayrepeats the prior days' gifts) is $59,719.33. Economizing?
Purchase each item once, lowering the total to $14,940.17. So which
items rose in cost? Pear tree prices were affected by a drought.
Labor costs for the drummers and lords rose. Want the full
breakdown? Visit www.pncbank.com./12days/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have found feathers on our property. I would like to know
how to sanitize them. _ John Oliver
</P>
<P>
   A: Better leave those feathers on the ground. ``Collecting any
feathers from nongame birds such as bluebirds and cardinals is a
violation of the National Migratory Bird Treaty Act,'' says Paul
Sunby, of SWCA, an environmental consulting firm. Collecting
feathers from threatened or endangered birds (e.g., bald eagles)
violates the Endangered Species Act. Yikes! Why? No way for the
authorities to tell if you found the feather or killed the bird to
get it. But you probably have duck feathers from birds you were
licensed to shoot, correct? In that case, the advice of Martinez
Brothers Taxidermists' Alex Martinez applies: Wash the feathers in
dishwashing soap and water. Rinse in clear water, then soak in
Coleman fuel (yes, as in lantern) while wearing a mask in a
well-ventilated area. Blow-dry. Next, dust with a mixture of half
cornmeal and half borax. Toss until dry. Remove the dusting
solution with a hair dryer and soft cloth, and arrange the
feather's barbs.
</P>
<P>
   This process rids the feathers of blood, dirt and fat. To
protect from bugs and other critters, Martinez uses a powdered
insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several co-workers and I received an electronic message about
an ill girl, Amy Bruce, and Make-A-Wish Foundation. I thought it
was a scam. Others swear this is an honest message. Who is right? _
M.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are right. This bogus electronic chain letter has
prompted inquiries to various Make-A-Wish offices, which are not
connected to the plea. The Make-A-Wish Foundation has identified
the person who started the chain letter and has contacted the
individual's Internet service provider to pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I found what looks like WWII ammunition while cleaning out a
shed behind my grandparent's farmhouse in East Texas. (My late
uncle served combat duty in WWII.) The ammunition is in a metal box
painted army green. Inside there are about 10-12 small cardboard
boxes labeled ``50 cartridges, Carbine, Caliber .30 M1, Ammunition
Lot PG26258, Kings Mills Ordnance Plant.'' Is it legal to possess
this? Does it have value in a collectors market? How do I sell it
or dispose of it safely? _ M.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is legal and no, there is no collectors market I
could find. As for the hunter's market? There is no way to know if
the ammunition has been properly stored all these years. Did it
ever get wet and stay wet? It may not be in any condition to be
fired safely. Please do not toss the ammunition in the trash or
bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently purchased a car and were charged $50 for a
vehicle inventory tax although the car will not be on the dealer's
lot when the annual inventory is taken. Is this legal? If every car
sold during the year is charged this tax, how does that figure for
the amount of tax paid to the state by the dealer? Who gets the
excess cash?
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy Ulland
</P>
<P>
   A: The automobile inventory tax officially changed January 1994
to a property tax _ even though some dealers still refer to it as
the vehicle inventory tax. Dealers are charged property tax on
their vehicles based on a complex mathematical formula, says Sheila
Clancy of the State Comptroller's office. So yes, the charge is
legal. All collected tax goes to local property tax jurisdictions _
the county, AISD, ACC, etc. Clancy reminds consumers this is a
property tax paid by the dealer so you might try negotiating it out
of your car deal. More questions? Call the comptroller's office at
(800) 252-9121.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter wet the mattress recently and it doesn't have any
type of protective covering. How can I clean the mattress? It is
soaked. _ L.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Turn the mattress on its side and position a towel beneath
the stain. Sponge the spot with a mixture of one part vinegar and
one part water. If you have a wet vacuum, use it. Blot excess with
clean towels. Final sponging should be with clean water. Repeat as
necessary. Dry with a hair dryer or, if possible, in the sun. Use a
disinfectant spray. And buy a protective cover so you do not have
to repeat the process. Q: I have always wondered about Santa's
reindeer. Are they males or females? _ M.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Females _ one and all. Both male and female reindeer sport
antlers. According to John Dinon of Michigan's Binder Park Zoo,
male reindeer shed their antlers at the end of November or the
beginning of December; females keep them until spring. So Santa's
Dec. 25th antlered reindeer must all be females. The females keep
the antlers to compete successfully with the larger males for food
during the winter and, after giving birth, to protect the fawns.
</P>
<P>
   Dinon adds that the clicking of the reindeer hooves heard ``up
on the housetop'' is accurate. Reindeer walking on any surface make
a clicking sound. Remember the names of the reindeer that Rudolph
led? Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder and
Blitzen. You read that right _ Donder, not Donner, is what Clement
Moore wrote in ``A Visit from St. Nicholas.'' Donder is Dutch for
thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have visited the Elisabet Ney Museum. They have a corner
stone that says, ``sursum 1892 _ 1902.'' I suppose that's Latin.
What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   _ James G.
</P>
<P>
   A: The studio was built in 1892, and the tower as well as the
east wing were added in 1902. ``Sursum corda'' is a term that
German-born sculptor Elisabet Ney embraced, which means ``uplift
your heart'' _ to yearn, to aspire, to seek. ``Sursum'' (upwards)
is the title of a Ney sculpture. ``That cornerstone refers to Ney's
ideals _ to aspire with unfaltering zeal,'' says Mary Collins
Blackmon, museum curator. The Elisabet Ney Museum, 304 E. 44th St.,
houses her marble and plaster statuary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a very special friend that is a big Chicago Cubs fan.
I would like to get her a button down jersey with her name on the
back. Any suggestions? Perhaps a phone number for the Pro Shop at
their baseball park (Wrigley Field?). _ G.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact Chicago Cubs Souvenirs at (800) 248-9467 to place an
order. But you are too late to have the jersey monogrammed if this
is a Christmas present. A custom job takes 3-6 weeks. Order a plain
jersey and have her name put on locally.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box

 &HT;    Trust me, a list makes shopping easier
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, I'll admit it. One of the things I find most stressful about
the holidays is having to shop. I think that most men will admit
that shopping is fairly low on their list of preferred activities.
At least shopping for things like Christmas presents in places like
crowded malls. The following are problems for most men:
</P>
<P>
   _ Being body-to-body without the payoff of finally being able to
watch a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being overpowered by noise in enclosed places, when it's not
for the purpose of cheering for your favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Standing in long lines without the end result of obtaining
nachos and your favorite beverage at half time.
</P>
<P>
   Most men would opt for a root canal if given the choice between
the dentist's chair and a Saturday spent shopping before the
holidays. I don't believe the issue is spending the money but
instead facing the prospect of so many choices and having to sort
through the options.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago my wife and daughter dragged me into a small
specialty shop one Saturday to look for a present, and I discovered
that for me, at least, not all shopping had to be excruciatingly
painful. It was quiet, easy to get into, not crowded, smelled good
and contained choices without leaving me with the feeling of being
in an expensive flea market. To this day, I'm still not sure why
it's called the Paper Bear, but next to buying off the Internet, it
makes shopping tolerable for me.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions for men who hate to shop may include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have your spouse or other family member (who we assume likes
to shop) pick out gifts at a number of different stores and give
you a list. You can then choose from this list and with relative
ease make your purchases. With a long-enough list, the element of
surprise is maintained.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget the wonderful combo of the catalog, a credit card
and a 1-800 number.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have a daughter who is old enough to drive, let her
pick out things that she thinks will please your spouse. (This is
assuming she likes to shop.)
</P>
<P>
   _ When all else fails, if you can afford it, go out and buy your
spouse a new car, an expensive piece of jewelry or a vacation in an
exotic location (note: in most cases, you must include yourself in
this for it to be meaningful.)
</P>
<P>
   Men, good luck to you and remember, Christmas only comes once a
year.

 &HT;    The booster advantage
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and David A. Milliron
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ When Westside High School opened three years ago,
the view from the back showed acres of barren fields. This fall,
those fields are adorned with athletics facilities befitting a
small college campus. They are appraised at more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is the work of wildly energetic, well-meaning boosters. They
have built baseball and football stadiums for their sons and
renovated a country house to function as the supporters'
headquarters on 52 acres adjoining school property, all owned by
the private, nonprofit Westside Boosters Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The generosity might have placed the school afoul of a federal
gender-equity law, which principal Pat Coxsey knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I believe under Title IX we're supposed to have the same
facilities (for boys and girls),'' Coxsey said, weighing her words.
``It concerns the parents of softball girls. Those parents are,
like, `We don't have bathrooms over here, and we don't have the
same things the guys do.' They're absolutely right. I can't say
they do, because they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   School administrators throughout Georgia walk a precarious line
in dealing with booster clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX law requires schools to afford equitable treatment of
male and female athletes. That means if somebody donates to the
boys program, it is the school's responsibility either to provide
or find a donor for comparable facilities for the girls, federal
officials say. Administrators cannot get off with, ``Oh, the
booster club did it; we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many public high schools rely on booster groups _ often geared
toward football _ to build stadiums, augment the salaries of
coaches and secure vehicles and other perks for them.
</P>
<P>
   Westside football coach and athletics director Robert Davis
serves on the executive committee of the Georgia High School
Association, which governs extracurricular activities at member
public and private schools. Westside boosters provide Davis with a
Ford pickup, outfitted in the school's garnet and gold colors. They
also pay to send his Seminoles to preseason camp on Jekyll Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all illegal (on the part of the school),'' said lawyer
Kristen Galles, a Title IX specialist, because the same benefits
are not showered on girls coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs often go unregulated by schools, even as many generate
thousands of dollars annually. The U.S. Department of Education's
Office for Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination
complaints, has not paid much attention, because it focuses on
colleges, with their scholarships and immense athletics budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an issue here (at Westside), it's going to be an issue
at every high school,'' said Coxsey, principal at the Macon high
school. ``It really is a state problem. No one monitors it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because few districts can spare funds for athletics, partly by
law, a booster club subculture has been created that induces
parents to hustle for money. It accentuates the disparity between
schools attended by children from affluent families and those
attended by children of less affluent families.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs also complicate efforts to bring schools into
compliance with federal gender-equity laws.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE SOURCES PAY WHEN STATE DOESN'T
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it being part of a problem,'' said Lamar Daniel, a
former investigator for the U.S. Department of Education's Office
for Civil Rights. ``If you had state funds involved, then maybe
you'd be closer to state monitoring (for compliance). By not having
state funds, the state says, `Well, we have no interest in how you
raise the money or how your booster club pays for these sports.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, other sources are cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   At Lassiter High in east Cobb, the football stadium has three
cell-phone towers _ the steel monoliths for wireless communication
_ rising above banks of lights. The lease agreement has brought the
school about $100,000 during the past three years, according to
principal Charles Lea, with half of it helping to pay down the
stadium debt and the other half going to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter has received additional funding from the Cobb Electric
Membership Corp. It donated $1.6 million to the county school board
in June, with the understanding that $600,000 be used for a
football field house at the school. The corporation directed that
the rest go to pay stadium debts at Pope and Harrison high schools
and assist in stadium construction at two new schools.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation's chief executive officer, Dwight Brown, is
president of Lassiter's football booster club.
</P>
<P>
   The school district formed a tax-exempt charitable body, the
Cobb County Schools Education Foundation, to handle that and other
donations. It is directed by Stan Wise, chairman of the state
Public Service Commission _ and leader of the Lassiter baseball
booster club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally want to make sure that this goes beyond just
athletics,'' Wise said. ``You say, `Well, yeah, right, but $1.6
million just went to athletics.' I say it went to programs where
kids, moms and dads are going to be active in football and
baseball, and we're going to have to come up with that money one
way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Cobb foundation also will fund girls
programs. Its officials say more funding is being sought for other
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the responsibility of the district administration to
ensure that the girls do not receive second-class treatment,
period,'' said Mary Francis O'Shea, Title IX coordinator of the
Office for Civil Rights, ``that you provide equitable opportunities
in athletics for your girls as well as for your boys, no matter
where you get the money. That is really not complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   `A FACILITY PROBLEM'
</P>
<P>
   When Coxsey opened Westside, she was greeted by the booster club
from heaven. The school was in need of everything, and there was no
turning the boosters down. Last year, they raised $980,000 toward
paying off debt on their Sports and Fine Arts Complex.
</P>
<P>
   No principal would reject them, Coxsey said. Besides, the Bibb
County School District, not her, had final say over booster
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The potential gender-equity violation is most graphically
illustrated with comparisons between the softball and baseball
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball field is a mini-stadium, spectacularly manicured,
with a Wrigley Field-like brick backstop behind home plate. The
softball site is a bare-bones field, enclosed by chain-link
fencing.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball field has 50 box seats behind home plate and 550
bleacher seats. The softball field has six rows of temporary
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball field has brick dugouts with lights and brick
concession stands and offices. The softball field has open dugouts
topped with Fiberglas sheets and a former football ticket booth for
a concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball field has lights. The softball field does not.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball field has permanent restrooms. The softball field
has two foul-smelling portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, the former OCR investigator, said, ``It sounds like
they've got a facility problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Coxsey said that worries her. In one breath, the principal can
say that at least Westside has a field, which isn't true of other
Bibb County schools. But if a complaint should bring federal
investigators on campus, the school district would be hard-pressed
to explain away the disparities in its treatment of boys and girls
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're supposed to have (equity),'' Coxsey said. ``At
the same time, if the system says we don't have (the money), I
don't know where you go from that point except to try and get your
boosters to help. I think eventually they will help the softball
girls, but I don't know where it is on the list of their
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I assume if (OCR) pushes it, something is going to have to
be done. They don't really care if you have the money or not.
You're going to cut instruction or cut something, if they put you
under the gun to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Pruett, booster club director, said his group isn't to
blame, because the softball field is on school property and the
baseball stadium is on private grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to help (the softball team) as much as we can, but
we're waiting for the school board to do something,'' he said. ``We
can't go on school property and build buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett said the club has helped girls sports at Westside, such
as paying for a storage shed and portable toilets on the softball
site.
</P>
<P>
   Coxsey said that the two-tiered treatment of girls and boys
sports long has been accepted in Georgia education and that
districts have managed to get by, as long as no one raised a
ruckus. If boosters kicked in money for football, rarely has equal
funding been sought for softball or volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Coxsey said, ``It does send out a message, absolutely _ (girls),
you're kind of second-class here.'''

 &HT;    Legislators find ways to get state funds to school sports
despite laws against it
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and David A. Milliron
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEZUMA, Ga. _ As the afternoon sun reflects off the metal
bleachers, George Hooks surveys the work needed to spruce up the
Macon County High School football stadium. The South Georgia native
is talking championships, Friday night football, entertainment for
an entire town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real need here,'' Hooks says.
</P>
<P>
   Money is on its way, he promises. And it is, a state check for
$100,000, thanks to the Democratic senator from Americus, who is
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, it is illegal for school districts in
Georgia to spend state tax dollars on athletics, but every year
legislators skirt the law by practicing old-fashioned pork-barrel
politics to move teams into larger stadiums or fancier uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Since fiscal 1996, lawmakers have doled out $2.8 million for
high school football stadiums, field houses, stadium lighting and
sports equipment, according to a computer analysis by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution of grants dispersed by the state Department of
Community Affairs. Less than 10 percent has been awarded by the
governor's office, with the remainder handed out by the General
Assembly in the form of local assistance grants.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, money for legislators' pet projects was
included in the Department of Education budget, even though it was
not requested by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stadium things come through Community Affairs because
they're not supposed to be funded, period,'' state school
Superintendent Linda Schrenko said. ``Somebody of influence like a
George Hooks gets extra money in the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office said the practice is
suspicious, but it has not been asked an opinion of whether the
grants violate state law. ``Those kind of expenses would certainly
raise questions,'' deputy counsel Daryl Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lawmakers seem to violate the spirit, if not the letter,
of the federal Title IX law by allocating more than 85 percent of
grants to projects aiding boys sports.
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislature appropriated $15,000 last session for Bryan
County High School in Pembroke, the bulk went to purchase football
uniforms. Cheerleading _ which the federal government does not
recognize as a sport under Title IX _ got $2,000 for outfits.
</P>
<P>
   The pork-barrel projects reach to junior high schools, with
North Clayton Middle School receiving $5,000 last year, mostly for
boys sports.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators trade their votes on the budget for inclusion of
sports projects that benefit their districts. Some say they act on
the neediest of requests from back home. Hooks said he pushed for
$100,000 for Macon County because, with the 1996 state champions
moving up in classification to Class AA, seating capacity would
have to be doubled to 4,000 for the school to host playoff games.
The school is in the midst of a $225,000 expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Macon County High School ranks among the worst schools in the
state for complying with Title IX, according to a
Journal-Constitution analysis. Boys make up 70 percent of its
athletes. The school sponsors eight boys sports and six girls
sports, excluding cheerleading. The school pays supplements of
$40,850 to its 13 coaches of boys sports and $13,850 to the six
coaches of girls sports. Yet, the disparity widened when the grant
money was spent on football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real need, in an absolute sense,'' Hooks said. ``It
helps athletics, gets kids to school and encourages them to stay in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks also helped Lee County High in Leesburg get a $25,000
grant to install a sprinkler system on its baseball and
football/soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   Hooks is hardly the only lawmaker playing the game. The practice
reaches to the top of the ladder at the state Capitol, with Speaker
Tom Murphy (D-Bremen) assisting athletics in his district. Even the
governor chips in.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget, the Legislature annually sets aside money for the
governor's emergency fund, which totaled $3 million this year.
Local groups apply for grants, and the governor decides which
requests to fund.
</P>
<P>
   State documents from 1996 show that then-Gov. Zell Miller helped
booster clubs pay three stadium debts in Gwinnett _ Meadowcreek
($20,000), South Gwinnett ($15,000) and Collins Hill ($10,000). In
1998, Miller approved $5,000 for weight-lifting equipment at East
Paulding High School.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, then a state representative in the middle of
his 1998 gubernatorial campaign, helped secure a $75,000 grant to
build a football field house at his alma mater, South Cobb High,
which his three children also attended. In 1994, South Cobb
received $40,000 for athletics facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting that your tax money is being spent like
this,'' said Betty Jo Williams, who retired last year after 20
years in the Legislature. ``If the state is going to give so much
money ... for the state's athletic programs, then it should be done
out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, $850,000 found its way into the budget for high
school sports from the Legislature and the governor. Schools and
sports teams get rewarded for no specific reasons, other than
because of connections to powerful lawmakers or legislators willing
to trade votes on the budget for some pork, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criteria is how much influence you have,'' said
Williams, a former House Appropriations Committee member. ``Urban
school districts tend to be left out, either because their
representatives are not positioned to deal or they're focused on
other community needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state School Superintendent Werner Rogers distanced
himself from the process when his department was being used,
contrary to state law, to dispense funds for athletics. Rogers
asked that the governor find another department to dole them out.
Community Affairs was assigned the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were being put in the education budget that we were
just passing through to local school systems that we had not
requested,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooks defended the practice of selectively sharing the wealth
with athletics programs even though his rural district, which spans
from Albany to the Alabama line, seemingly has more immediate
needs. The district contains almost 400 miles of dirt roads and
lacks the tax base of metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Educators lobbied him after Douglas High consolidated with Macon
County, increasing the school's enrollment to Class AA size. They
sought money to expand the football stadium. In Montezuma and many
other small towns, it is considered a pressing need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football serves as a sense of community pride, bringing people
together,'' said Tommy Moore, the school's athletics director and
assistant principal. ``Macon County football has been
ultra-successful in the '90s, the most successful in the state. We
wouldn't appeal to these gentlemen (in the Legislature) if we
didn't have a need. Understand, there'd be no playoff games at
home.''

 &HT;    More Christians seeing religion in a different light
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cheryl Wahlgren rises early and by 5 a.m. is
quietly settled in front of a windowsill adorned with stones,
crystals, flowers, plants, oils and feathers _ a personal altar
she's created in her Sunset Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband and children sleep, she balances her female
and male sides through the Chinese meditation practice Qui Gong.
She honors God by turning to the four directions of the Earth, and
she burns sage, a Native American cleansing practice. The pieces on
her altar are reminders of the natural bounty given by God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of gets you ready for the day,'' said Wahlgren, 48, a
cardiac nurse at Seton Medical Center. ``The other thing I do is
ask God to show me how to make his presence known in everything I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised as a Lutheran and Catholic, Wahlgren also prays the
rosary each evening.
</P>
<P>
   David George, 48, was brought up in the Church of Christ and
goes to services whenever he visits his parents near Marble Falls.
On Wednesday nights, he studies with a yoga master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty eclectic in my belief system,'' he said. ``I take
the gold wherever I find it.''
</P>
<P>
   From fundamentalist to mainline Christians, the words
``religion'' and ``religious,'' which many believe synonymous with
a church institution, are being cast aside in favor of personalized
spirituality. It's a dramatic shift, one of the biggest of the
millennium, according to some theologians and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   What has evolved, mostly in recent decades, is a new perspective
on how faith can be practiced, leading to declining membership in
mainline denominations, religion hopping and a freestyle approach
to faith that shows no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   The search for spiritual growth has reached an all-time high in
the United States. A recent Gallup Poll reports that 82 percent of
the people in the United States (88 percent in the South, which
includes Texas) feel the need to experience spiritual growth. In a
1994 survey, Newsweek reported that 58 percent of the population
wanted to grow spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup Organization, a leading source for statistical
information on America's religious beliefs, will release a book
today that chronicles how the practice of faith has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spiritual frontier for this country has expanded and
incorporated diverse foreign ideologies and philosophies throughout
the 20th century,'' according to the book, ``Surveying the
Religious Landscape: Trends in U.S. Beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the U.S. favor a faith that meets numerous spiritual
beliefs and tenets.''
</P>
<P>
   In their search for a customized faith, it is not unusual to
hear people describe themselves as being on a ``faith journey'' or
``spiritual path'' or seeking a ``personal relationship with Jesus
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Their thirst to understand and relate to the personal spiritual
journeys of others has books by both the Dalai Llama and the Rev.
Billy Graham flying off bookstore shelves and onto The New York
Times' best-sellers list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of studies that show in the past decade
some 30 to 40 percent of Americans are switching their faith,''
said the Rev. Scotty McClennan, chaplain at Tufts University and
author of the new book ``Finding Your Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find many students say: `I'm spiritual but not religious,'
meaning they are not looking for a religious home but mixing and
matching different religions.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERFAITH MARRIAGES
</P>
<P>
   A millennium ago, there was one dominant Christian faith: Roman
Catholicism. An Orthodox schism in 1054 and the Protestant
Reformation in 1517 splintered Christianity into numerous sects.
People were born, raised and expected to marry in the same
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, some people from different Protestant faiths
began marrying. Then Protestants began marrying Catholics. Later,
it became common for Jews and Christians to marry, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of fragmentation and a lot of new
development of individual consciousness rather than collective
consciousness,'' notes A.J. ``Chip'' Conyers, a theology professor
at Baylor University's Truett Seminary. ``The philosophical grounds
for religion being a private individual matter were laid in the
17th century, but there has been a great leap in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers credits philosophers John Locke, an Anglican from
England, and Pierre Bayle, a Huguenot _ a French Calvinist _ with
introducing the concepts of religious tolerance and private
theology.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, those ideas were manifested in the
constitutional separation of church and state. Yet America remained
almost exclusively a Christian nation. The Christian faith
permeated the public domain _ requiring Christian prayers in many
public schools, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   America's changing religious landscape has led to an increase in
legal changes, said Terry Muck, a professor of comparative religion
at Austin Presbyterian Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1940, only six cases dealing with religious liberty went
before the Supreme Court, which at the time was the only court that
could hear such cases, according to the First Liberty Institute.
Since then, hundreds of cases have popped up in state and federal
courts, and more than 90 opinions have come down.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars agree the man most responsible for the surge in the
country's religious diversity was President Lyndon B. Johnson, who
signed the Immigration Act of 1965 that led to a wave of
non-Christian immigrants, including Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims.
The Vietnam War and baby boomers' rejection of ``the
establishment'' or anything connected with institutionalism _
including religious denominations _ along with the sexual
revolution sparked many Americans to re-examine their religious
beliefs and drop out of congregational life.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, ``the age of Aquarius dawned on us,'' Conyers
said. ``Religion becomes ... privately chosen and no longer the
realm of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Membership in mainline denominations also began to dive during
the 1970s feminist movement, as some women began to reject what
they perceived as patriarchal religious institutions. They also
entered the work force in droves _ out of financial necessity or to
pursue careers.
</P>
<P>
   Long work hours, hectic schedules and competing interests _
sports, entertainment, leisure activities _ meant that churchmoved
down on some people's list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gallup pollsters, 14 percent of Americans
identified themselves as Methodist in 1967. Three decades later,
that number slipped to 9 percent. The number of people who claimed
their denomination as Presbyterian fell by half from 1967 to 1998,
from 6 percent to 3 percent, while Lutherans dropped from 7 percent
to 5 percent and Episcopalians from 3 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many Americans, church moved from the mainline to the
sideline,'' said D. Michael Lindsay, Gallup's consultant for
theology, religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several decades ago, the majority of church affiliation in the
United States involved mainline Protestant denominations. Today,
the religious landscape is much more diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in four American adults have switched denominations
since their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who used to affiliate with mainline denominations
have moved toward evangelical or nondenominational churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are also seeing an emergence of nontraditional churches
that have dual-alignment or are aligned with more than one
denomination, as well as you have the emergence of churches that
have loosened their denominational allegiances,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   ON THEIR OWN TERMS
</P>
<P>
   Religion is far from out of the American psyche; 95 percent
reported to Gallup that they believe in God or a universal spirit,
a number that has remained relatively unchanged in 50 years. Today,
many just want to practice their beliefs a new way.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, who co-authored the book with George Gallup Jr., said
it shows how people also are seeking out small groups as spiritual
support systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 100 million Americans involved in small groups, and
over half are spiritual small groups that range from prayer groups
to support groups for single parents to Alcoholics Anonymous, and
they are all meeting in church,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one scholar noted, some Christians also are busily
mixing religious ideologies. ``Even if you are raised in those
(mainstream) faiths, that is not an encompassing reality anymore.
It's just one part of your life,'' said Ray Pickett, a New
Testament professor at the Lutheran Seminary in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is eclectically creating their own faith or
theology,'' he added. ``It's almost comical.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in spirituality comes from the baby boomers who earlier
stopped practicing their faith. As they grow older, they begin
searching for life's meaning beyond their careers, triggering a
spiritual awakening that brings them back to family and religion.
They adopt a more holistic approach, including trying relaxation
techniques, such as yoga, that are rooted in Eastern religious
philosophies. They also parlay environmental concerns into a
spiritual tenet, borrowed from Native American and pagan faiths,
that the Earth is sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put this together theologically,'' Muck said. But
the average person doesn't see it that way, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``People measure religion and religious truth differently these
days,'' he said. ``They measure it by pragmatism.'' In other words,
they simply ask: ``Does this work for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Even among Roman Catholics, whose numbers have held steady as a
quarter of the nation's population for more than 30 years, there is
room for other religious traditions to feed the spirit. Buddhist
practices have taken off in Roman Catholicism. Two nuns run a Zen
meditation center near Baltimore, Md., and the popularity of
Buddhist traditions among Catholics was a cover story this month in
the National Catholic Reporter newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Rose McPhee, executive director of Seton Cove in
Austin, offers yoga as part of the Catholic spirituality center's
stress reduction classes. The center, which attracts people of all
faiths, teaches a holistic approach that incorporates the human
experience and personal spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is beautiful about it being integrated in a program with
a spiritual focus is they can appreciate the whole connection of
mind, body and spirit in this era of high-tech,'' she said. ``Our
interest is really trying to make a difference in people's whole
perspective of themselves. ... They have to have that connection of
that inner spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   BECOMING BORN-AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The holistic approach has not been lost on fundamentalist and
conservative Christians, who are buying books on how to incorporate
Scripture into everything, including weight loss, personal
finances, healing, parenting and education. The CBA, formerly known
as the Christian Booksellers Association, reported this year that
Christian retailers are doing more than $3 billion in sales, three
times what they were in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentalism is a strange mixture of individualism and
retrenchment,'' Pickett said.
</P>
<P>
   It is completely Bible-based, but it's a religious experience
people seek for themselves. Fundamentalism and Pentecostalism are
anchored in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, giving
higher priority to that relationship than a particular dogma or
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical leaders such as Graham, who emphasize Christian
conversion as the pivotal faith experience, have drawn followers
from traditional faiths that stress doctrine and dogma as central
to religious practice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two of five Americans claim they are born-again
Christians, Lindsay said. ``You see Methodists, Baptists ...
Catholics who say they are born-again,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   People who are born again believe they are transformed by
knowing Jesus Christ as their personal savior.
</P>
<P>
   While people are choosing a litany of different ways to practice
their faith today, Lindsay, the Gallup consultant, said the
majority are committed to organized religion, even though they
might not be a member of the church they claim as their religious
preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approach the millennium event, people have a new
commitment to exploring their faith,'' he said. ``The entire 20th
century has been spent exploring the extent of human progress. We
have been pushing ourselves to outer space, and the data seems to
suggest people are now turned to exploring inner space.''

issues a report urging better treatment policies for mental

</P>
<P>
   MENTAL-CONSUMER _ Why is it that patients can rack up hundreds
of thousands of dollars in insurance coverage for illnesses such as
AIDS or cancer, but coverage for mental health problems _ which can
be just as debilitating _ is usually capped? And why do some
insurance companies not even cover counseling and drugs for mental

   NEW-FAITH _ AUSTIN, Texas _ From fundamentalist to mainline
Christians, the words ``religion'' and ``religious,'' which many
believe synonymous with a church institution, are being cast aside
in favor of personalized spirituality. It's a dramatic shift, one
of the biggest of the millennium, according to some theologians and
scholars. What has evolved, mostly in recent decades, is a new
perspective on how faith can be practiced, leading to declining
membership in mainline denominations, religion-hopping and a
freestyle approach to faith that shows no signs of letting up.

   NEW-BREASTS (Houston) _ More and more women go into the
operating room for a mastectomy and wake up with the beginnings of
a new breast fashioned entirely from their own tissue or with
implants. An increasing number of surgeons are becoming comfortable
with immediate reconstruction, and breast cancer survivors say
reconstructive surgery is a major step forward in the healing
process. By LEIGH HOPPER.(Photo and graphic available on NYT

<P>
   S.F.-MAYORAL (San Francisco) _ If Mayor Willie Brown wins
reelection in Tuesday's runoff here, it will end a long spell of
one-term mayors in San Francisco and signal a major change. Brown,
who couldn't run again because of voter-approved term limits, could
take a damn-the-people attitude in a second term. Or, he could
concentrate on his legacy without worrying about going back before
the voters. By RACHEL GORDON.
</P>
<P>
   MARS-MAN (Hemphill, Texas) _ Besides NASA's disappointing
failure in getting its Mars Polar Lander to phone home last week,
the space agency also could be trespassing. At least that's how
Thomas Budnick sees things. The 52-year-old former social worker
from Ludlow, Mass., has spent the past two decades in relative
obscurity, mailing his official claims to land and mineral rights
on Mars and elsewhere in outer space to the Sabine County Clerk's
Office in this quiet East Texas town. By PATTY REINERT.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-FARMERS (Belzoni, Miss.) _ When the federal government
caved in the face of a class-action lawsuit and agreed to pay cash
to amend decades of discrimination in the farm lending program,
black farmers envisioned salvation. But many are finding that the
settlement provides little to ensure their survival, has failed to
compensate for their feelings of bitterness and comes at a time
when the Agriculture Department may soon phase out its farm lending
programs. By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA. (Photo available on NYT

</P>
<P>
   NICARAGUANS-RESIDENCY (San Francisco) _ Like a salesman,
Nicaraguan Ambassador Francisco X. Aguiree Sacasa is trying to sway
those from his homeland not to miss an opportunity of a lifetime.
With phrases like ``time is running out,'' he is preaching to
natives from his country about a law that allows Nicaraguan
nationals to apply for permanent residency in the United States. By

Canal. By JOHN OTIS.

political culture of the nation's capital and the ``potential
greatness'' of the American people. By CLAY ROBISON.

<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Houston) _ Even as it operated what many consider

was so strapped for cash during the `90s that the main priority was
keeping bathrooms clean. Now, a major step forward: Through Lone

Seattle losses. New England losses. Kansas City losses. The Raiders
pray for losses all around. Which tells you something about the
Raiders' current predicament. By BRIAN MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER-WOMEN (San Jose, Calif.) _ The U.S. Women's World Cup
team made a Victory Tour stop here last weekend, but much of the
talk after the match against a World Stars team was about a loss
that is now looming out there in the land of the international
soccer hierarchy. The sport's governing body announced a few days
ago that it planned to move the next Women's World Cup from 2003 to
2002, the same year that the men's World Cup will be contested. To
a woman, the members of the U.S. team think that's a bad idea. By
DWIGHT CHAPIN.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ San Franciscans are facing two

on strong as symbols. The first question voters should ask
themselves before Tuesday's election is who do they want as mayor
if there's an earthquake? By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ In the game of lowered
expectations that we call presidential ``debates,'' Gov. George W.
Bush survived his first two challenges, and his supporters breathed
huge sighs of relief. His performances would have earned him a
``C-minus'' or worse from many high school speech teachers, but his
White House campaign is still alive and well because he didn't say
or do anything stupid. By CLAY ROBISON.

KEEPING IT SURREAL: JIM CARREY VISITS ANDY KAUFMAN'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Jim Carrey with Danny DeVito in a scene
from ``Man on the Moon.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    His name is Jim Carrey, and this is his press conference.
 &HT;    Or is it?
 &HT;    Time: Dec. 4, 1999 _ afternoon.
 &HT;    Place: The ballroom of Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel.
 &HT;    Cast of characters: Jim Carrey, star of Milos Forman's ``Man on
the Moon'' _ an Andy Kaufman biopic opening Dec. 22 _ and more than
75 journalists.
 &HT;    Theme: You don't have to know Andy Kaufman to like ``Man on the
Moon.''
 &HT;    ``The reaction has been kind of cool,'' Carrey says. ``A lot of
people, especially the European press _ who have no idea who
Kaufman is _ screened the film and seem wild about it. Maybe you're
better off.
 &HT;    ``It's (appealing) just on the basis of a very interesting
artist, a person who challenges people's beliefs,'' the comedian
says. ``I think there's enough of that to make it a good movie and
a good story.''
 &HT;    Kaufman, if you've forgotten _ or never knew _ was a stand-up
comic who dared to not tell jokes and deliberately antagonize
audiences. The sitcom ``Taxi'' made Kaufman a star, and he played
it to the hilt, wrestling women, clashing with a male wrestler on
``Letterman'' and unleashing Tony Clifton, an arrogant, talentless
lounge singer _ played by his friend and writing partner, Bob Zmuda
_ who would heckle Kaufman at live appearances.
 &HT;    By the time Kaufman died of cancer in 1984, the public was so
used to his stunts that some people didn't buy it. In fact,
Kaufmaniacs think he's alive and planning a comeback in the wake of
``Man in the Moon.''
 &HT;    Bad news: He's really dead.
 &HT;    On the other hand, Carrey _ once best known for talking through
his butt cheeks _ provides so uncanny an impersonation that pundits
are predicting an Oscar nomination.
 &HT;    ``The experience itself was so incredible,'' Carrey says softly.
``To this day I sit up and go, `This is never going to happen again
in that way.'
 &HT;    ``It was an odyssey for everybody,'' he says. ``It was like Andy
was around and Andy was directing. Every decision was made on that
basis.''
 &HT;    As for his Oscar chances, he claims to be indifferent.
 &HT;    ``The whole project was such a thrill that, if something like
that happened on top of it, I'd have a heart attack,'' he says.
``It would be ungrateful to sit here and expect something else to
come my way from this.''
 &HT;    Carrey pauses.
 &HT;    ``It would be a wonderful thing,'' he adds, smiling. ``No
question about it.''
 &HT;    Playing Kaufman consumed him, says Carrey _ who, like Kaufman,
was born on Jan. 17 _ to the extent that he lived in character on
and off camera, only twice showing up on the set as Jim Carrey.
 &HT;    ``I really didn't exist,'' he says. ``I went to bed as Andy, and
it was strange and wonderful. I'd wake up in the morning and jump
into his shoes.''
 &HT;    Further obscuring the line between fact and fiction, several
figures from Kaufman's life appear in the film. The ``Taxi'' cast
pretty much play themselves, for example, while ``Taxi'' co-star
Danny DeVito portrays Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro. And the
real Shapiro cameos as the first club owner to fire Kaufman.
 &HT;    A typical press-conference question follows: Would today's
audiences better appreciate Kaufman than people did back then?
 &HT;    ``That's interesting,'' Carrey says. ``I think he'd probably ...
Oh, God. Oh, my God.''
 &HT;    Carrey's eyes open wide as he looks to the back of the ballroom.
There stands Bob Zmuda _ or, rather, Tony Clifton, a homely man in
a devastatingly ugly tuxedo, with a bimbo on each arm and puffing
on a cigarette.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you, ladies and gentleman, I am Tony Clifton, the
star of this motion picture,'' he rants. ``These people from
Universal tried to keep me out of here, and I know why. Because the
gentleman sitting up here, who has a lot of power, doesn't want me
here. His name _ and I'm going to point him out _ is Drew Carey.''
 &HT;    Apparently thrown off-balance, Carrey interrupts.
 &HT;    ``Let me just say I worked very hard on this character, OK,'' he
says. ``This is a guy who was very jealous, very envious of Andy.
Andy tried to help him.''
 &HT;    Clifton doesn't seem to like that idea.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' he shouts. ``He's in shock! He didn't
know this was going to happen. He's trying to figure this out right
now, and he's not doing a very good job at it.
 &HT;    ``He does not want me here for one reason and one reason
alone,'' he adds. ``It's called the Oscar. It is so obvious I blow
his a-- off that screen.''
 &HT;    ``The Oscar is not everything,'' Carrey shoots back.
 &HT;    ``Don't make it sound like you don't want that Oscar,'' Clifton
yells. ``You've got Oscar-wannabe all over your face.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, come on,'' Carrey says. ``You're desperate, you're
desperate.''
 &HT;    ``Don't get me started, man,'' Clifton warns.
 &HT;    ``And you're a drunk,'' Carrey adds.
 &HT;    Clifton pulls out a can of spray paint and proceeds to write the
words ``Man on the Moon'' on the ballroom door, as the assembled
journalists laugh and try to figure out what's going on. Carrey
feigns an inability to make out Clifton's handwriting.
 &HT;    ``Mandingo?'' he hazards, drawing another chuckle from the
reporters.
 &HT;    Clifton seems to snap, lunging at Carrey and hollering ``I'll
spray you!'' The two men grapple. Carrey dumps a pitcher of water
on Clifton and then storms out, but not before swiping his arm
across the table that holds the journalists' tape recorders.
 &HT;    The recorders crash to the ground, as the paint drips down the
door and Clifton's cigarette burns a hole in the carpeting.
 &HT;    ``OK, I did my dirt,'' Clifton says smugly. ``I just want to
say, folks, it's been a pleasure talking to you. Vote for me. If I
made one person happy, it's all been worth it.
 &HT;    ``Thank you. Good night.''
 &HT;    And out the door he goes.
 &HT;    It's half an hour before Universal publicists, scrambling for
damage control, can get Carrey back. In the meantime, the
journalists retrieve their recorders, some broken beyond repair,
and hotel employees do their best to clean up the mess.
 &HT;    ``You kind of get sucked into this thing,'' Carrey says, ``and
it's hard to know what's real and what isn't anymore. Bob Zmuda,
who was playing Tony, has been writing books and doing the
character everywhere.
 &HT;    ``I was not approving,'' he says, seeming a bit disoriented. ``I
think the press should be handled within the confines of the movie.
He seems to want to step out and ... be Andy, I don't know. This
whole thing is so blurred.''
 &HT;    Carrey, who insists the episode wasn't a put-up job, offers to
pay for the broken recorders.
 &HT;    ``We're all working toward the same end here, and Zmuda ... ''
he pauses. ``I just think it's time for him to move on.''
 &HT;    Carrey himself is moving on, to new films that include the
Farrelly brothers' ``Me, Myself and Irene'' and Ron Howard's
live-action version of ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas.''
 &HT;    As for Andy Kaufman, Carrey thinks that ``Man in the Moon''
sheds light on the talented, troubled comic, but it's not the final
word.
 &HT;    ``I don't think he needs an explanation,'' Carrey says. ``If you
explain Andy, you've killed him.
 &HT;    ``That's the triumph of his life _ he beat death, because he
can't be explained,'' he concludes. ``Nobody knows if it's for real
or not, and in that way he's immortal.
 &HT;    ``If I ever did win an Oscar, I wish he'd come up and grab it
out of my hands.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jodie Foster in a scene from ``Anna and
the King.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Getting to Know You'' has never been her theme song.
 &HT;    But Jodie Foster, one of Hollywood's most notoriously private
actresses, is finally talking about what goes on behind the palace
doors _ at least as far as it relates to her pride and joy,
16-month-old Charles Foster.
 &HT;    Foster makes her postpregnancy return to the screen in the
holiday film ``Anna and the King,'' but everything else about her
life has changed.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a big fan of TV, but I love the Teletubbies now,''
confesses the Yale grad and two-time Oscar winner who, despite her
rep as the smartest woman in Hollywood, now spends her afternoons
with Tinky Winky and Po.
 &HT;    ``Teletubbies are very serene, not too overstimulating and
almost hypnotic,'' she says thoughtfully _ and then giggles like
any new mother. ``OK, so they're also adorable.''
 &HT;    If that doesn't sound like the sharp-as-a-tack Foster Hollywood
knows and loves, it's no wonder.
 &HT;    ``Motherhood has really affected my ambition _ I have none of my
ambition left,'' the 37-year-old actress says over breakfast at
Beverly Hills' chic L'Ermitage hotel. ``I already didn't have a
competitive streak in me in the few years before my son was born.
With the baby, I have absolutely no competitive streak left in me
at all.''
 &HT;    Dressed down in black jeans, a T-shirt and a worn leather
jacket, Foster still has the porcelain skin and shiny blonde hair _
currently in a pageboy _ that made her the luminous star of 33
films in 34 years, but she doesn't feel like that woman these days.
 &HT;    ``My identity is not wrapped up in the movie business anymore,''
she says matter-of-factly. ``Let's face it, I've already
accomplished so many of the abstract goals in my career. So it's
not, `Will I make money anymore? Will people like me?'
 &HT;    ``I have only one pure question left when it comes to work,
which is `Do I feel passionate enough to tell this story?'''
 &HT;    Andy Tennant, who directed ``Anna and the King'' _ a nonmusical
version of the book that inspired ``The King and I'' _ has
predicted that Foster may retire from the screen in not too long.
The actress begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine giving up acting,'' she says. ``I love making
movies.''
 &HT;    Those expecting to see Foster sing or dance in her latest movie
will be disappointed. ``Anna and the King,'' which will open Dec.
17 nationwide, may tell the story first recounted by real-life
royal governess Anna Leonowens in ``Anna and the King of Siam,''
but it tells it much differently than Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein did.
 &HT;    ``First of all, I've loved the musical my entire life,'' she
says. ``But I wanted to say something completely different. I
wanted to talk about Asia from the Asian perspective.''
 &HT;    Making the film involved spending weeks on a set in Malaysia
with temperatures lingering around 120 degrees, only six months
after she'd given birth _ but Foster says it wasn't really that
bad.
 &HT;    ``I never sweat,'' she says, ``which is one reason the makeup
people loved me. I mean, I'm standing there in a hoop skirt, a
bonnet, crinolines, leather boots and gloves, looking pretty
cool.''
 &HT;    Better yet, little Charlie also kept his cool.
 &HT;    ``He was only 6 months, and I had him on a flight that lasted 23
1/2 hours,'' the proud mother marvels. ``He was really a trouper.
He talked to the other passengers. He crawled up and down the
aisles. He smiled at people. He took food off their plates.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``What I couldn't believe,'' she adds, ``is that, after the
movie wrapped, I took him on a two-hour flight and I was like, `Oh
my God!' He was a different child. Everything was, `No, no, no!'
People were staring at me like, `Get this kid away from me!'''
 &HT;    So, will little Charlie be getting any brothers or sisters
anytime soon?
 &HT;    ``Suuurre,'' Foster says slowly, smiling wearily. ``Just not
right this week.''
 &HT;    Just don't ask her why she decided on single motherhood in the
first place.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' she says warmly but firmly, ``I try not to coment
on that stuff. Everybody's decision to have a child is personal.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says, it's not so hard if you're banking some of
the biggest paychecks of any Hollywood actress.
 &HT;    ``I mean, my mom had four kids,'' she says. ``With no money. I
don't know how she did it.''
 &HT;    Well, Foster herself helped a little. At age 3 she was a
Coppertone tot in a print ad. She went on to become one of the most
successful child stars ever, supporting her mother, sisters and
brother by the time she was 10. And then, to almost everyone's
surprise, she did the near-impossible by reinventing herself as a
top adult star, beginning with her Oscar-winning turn as a rape
victim in ``The Accused'' (1988).
 &HT;    And, yes, it's true that only moments before winning the award,
Foster called it ``one of the worst performances of my life.''
 &HT;    ``Yes, I said at the time I thought it was absolutely one of the
worst performances I had ever given,'' she admits. ``Basically, I
was so uncomfortable because this performance came completely from
instinct. And when I saw it, I thought, `Wow, she's brash. She's
tough. Uneducated. And she's not nice at all.'
 &HT;    ``Now I think she's a hero.''
 &HT;    Actually, Foster says, she never enjoys seeing her own movies.
 &HT;    ``This is my moviegoing experience,'' she says: ```We could have
had a sunset shot, but it clouded over at the last minute.' `Oh,
that's where one of the actors couldn't remember his lines.'
 &HT;    ``Even years later,'' she admits with a laugh, ``I'm looking at
a movie and screaming, `We shouldn't have cut from here to there.'
I see the mistakes.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' she adds, ``it's not a negative thing. It's just
the perfectionist in me.''
 &HT;    Foster pulled out of ``Double Jeopardy'' when she found out she
was pregnant. The movie went on to make Ashley Judd into a
bona-fide movie star, but Foster says she has no regrets.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, I don't regret that it was a huge hit,'' she says.
``I'm happy for them.''
 &HT;    Foster has had some huge hits of her own, of course, most
notably the multiple-Oscar-winning ``The Silence of the Lambs''
(1991).
 &HT;    Rumor has it that she's been offered $20 million to reprise her
role as Clarice Starling in a movie version of ``Hannibal,'' Thomas
Harris' best-selling sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' and
though she won't confirm the rumors, Foster won't deny them either.
 &HT;    ``I would love to do it,'' she says, ``but first I have to see a
script.''
 &HT;    If she were to nix the sequel script, though, she admits that it
would bother her to see someone else play Agent Starling of the
FBI.
 &HT;    ``I don't feel like I own her, but I do feel possessive of
her,'' Foster says. ``I feel like I know what Clarice would do and
not do. I know everything about her _ she is the most specific
character I've ever played.''
 &HT;    But that's one character little Charlie won't meet for some
time. He hasn't seen any of his mother's movies, and won't for a
while yet.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'll show him `Bugsy Malone' (1976),'' she says after a
moment's thought. ``It's one big fantasy, which I think is an
important part of childhood.''

THE `V.I.P.' TREATMENT: PAMELA ANDERSON LEE BOUNCES BACK

 (Includes a color slide of Pamela Anderson Lee with Leah Lail,
Molly Culver, Natalie Raitano and Shaun Baker in a scene from
``V.I.P.'') 
 By BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 Not for release in Canada until Dec. 19. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chatting with Pamela Anderson Lee during a break from filming
her hit action series ``V.I.P.,'' one thing is clear: She doesn't
mind being candid, even outspoken on the record.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising, given the reams of bad press she's received
about her life, her, ahem, physical attributes, that infamous home
video and her on-again-off-again relationship, now on again, with
her ex-husband and current fiance, rocker Tommy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, many people would shy away from anyone
with a camera or a notebook, but Anderson Lee never has.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a sense of humor about yourself,'' she says,
``and also you have to realize that you're not really in control of
what the press writes about you. You can only live your life in a
positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to build you up and tear you down,'' she adds.
``You get a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals award, and
then someone writes that they saw you eating chicken fingers in the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually very funny, very amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good that she thinks so, because everything the 33-year-old
native of Victoria, British Columbia, does _ whether in front of or
behind the camera _ seems fair game for the tabloids. But instead
of shunning the attention, Anderson Lee has capitalized on it _
most notably in the year-old syndicated series ``V.I.P.,'' which
parallels her own life in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot episode opens with a dumb-luck incident in which her
character, Vallery Irons, accidentally saves an actor from an
attacker. Caught on camera, the bit of derring-do makes Vallery an
overnight sensation and leads a Los Angeles bodyguard agency to
sign her on as a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life story of Pamela Denise Anderson Lee is almost as
whimsical. Her rise to fame started when she was captured on a
giant Jumbotron television screen at a 1989 Canadian Football,
cheering on her team and wearing not much more than a Labatt's
T-shirt and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   From that brief glimpse came a beer-commercial contract, a
Playboy spread and a regular role on Tim Allen's comedy series
``Home Improvement,'' where she spent four seasons as the comely
Tool Time Girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a bit of myself and my experience on this
show,'' says Anderson Lee, who also executive-produces ``V.I.P.''
``The whole concept came from what I've gone through in my life to
get here _ a girl comes from a small town and is thrown into this
Hollywood life and goes through things a little naively, but she
finds her way through and things come out good in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Her life contains enough material for two or three series, at
most. There's her 1995 marriage to heavy-metal drummer Lee, their
sordid _ and stolen _ sex video and the births of their children,
Dillon and Brandon. There was the violent incident with Lee which
led to their divorce, the much-publicized removal of her breast
implants and, recently, a reconciliation with her ex-husband and
plans for a second wedding.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being an actress, producer, celebrity, wife and
mother, Anderson Lee says, but as she goes along it gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' she says, ``but I've really learned how to
structure my life for my family, which is my priority, and my
extended family, and it seems to be running pretty smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I wish there were 10 of me, but I'm figuring it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, one or both of her boys can be found on the
set. But don't expect her to push them in front of a camera:
Anderson Lee disapproves of children _ hers or anyone else's _
getting involved in acting until they're old enough to make their
own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even say that about children working on the set,'' she says.
``If you can't choose to be in the business, then I don't think
it's right. So I don't allow children to work on the show. I don't
believe in parents making that decision for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping keep the family together, Anderson Lee has arranged for
two recent guest shots by Tommy Lee. The actress/producer says she
looked forward to his days on the set, because of the chance it
offered for him to understand her work better.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she admits, she enjoyed watching the usually
ultraconfident musician flounder around, out of his element.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really funny,'' she recalls, ``because he's never done
anything like that. He was saying `Where do I pick up the gun?
Where do I put down my cigarette? When do I say the line?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally he said, `This is way too difficult, somebody give me
a drum!'''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, in her husband's defense, Anderson Lee admits that
he had it particularly difficult, because his wife was serving not
only as producer and star but also, on these episodes, as director
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool,'' she says, ``but it was horrible because I was
being the total director ... I was way too controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Lee takes her role as executive producer seriously. She
insisted on it before agreeing to sign on for ``V.I.P.,'' and has a
hand in everything from casting to performing regular production
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do it any other way now,'' she says. ``I don't
think I would do another project if I couldn't be a producer. I
have a lot of input in everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress has no illusions that she's doing Shakespeare here,
but as a producer she takes pride in the fact that the audience is
not, as most observers had predicted, made up entirely of teen-age
boys and football-loving men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio really thought `V.I.P.' would appeal to a huge male
demographic,'' Anderson Lee says. ``But when the numbers came in,
they discovered that the audience was 40 percent women. So ... girl
power! But I've always known that a lot of my fans were women and
young girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``V.I.P.'' is an unquestioned hit _ it's the No. 1 weekly
syndicated, hour-long show in the world, and has already been
renewed through 2002 _ and Anderson Lee realizes that she's
something as a role model to young women around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine with her, actually, but only up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every actor, everyone in the public eye should be
a role model of some kind,'' she says. ``But, you know, people
shouldn't really base their positions in life on what people do in
the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Good advice, coming from someone who's been there.

 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    During the opening moments of their new album, ``Looking
Forward,'' a harmonizing Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young sing _
perhaps to each other as much as to the listener _ ``We do belong
together ... and it's going to last forever.''
 &HT;    Those are pretty optimistic words for four musicians who,
despite their 30-year association, have managed only three studio
albums and haven't toured together since 1974.
 &HT;    But, all four contend, these are better times. Past arguments
and ego battles have been set aside, replaced by warmer feelings
for each other and a greater appreciation for the music they make
together. The results: ``Looking Forward,'' their first album
together since 1988, and the ``CSNY2K'' tour, which will kick off
Jan. 24 in suburban Detroit.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of unfinished business,'' Neil Young says. ``I
don't think we really reached our potential, and so we have a lot
of things to show and a lot of things to do. There are things that
we started doing on the record that show us the future.''
 &HT;    David Crosby agrees.
 &HT;    ``I think Neil's right,'' he says. ``There's almost no limit to
what this band can do when we get out there and start playing. All
of us are better at what we do than we ever have been _ I caught
glimpses of it when we were playing and singing in the studio. I'm
dying to explore the potential.''
 &HT;    The creative promise seemed enormous when CSN&AMP;Y first came
together in 1969. Each of the members had established himself in
highly regarded bands _ Crosby with the Byrds, Young and Stephen
Stills in Buffalo Springfield, Graham Nash with the Hollies.
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash had already come together and released
``Crosby, Stills and Nash,'' an album widely considered the
launching pad for the 1970s singer/songwriter movement, combining
pointed social and political commentary with a sound marked by rich
harmonies.
 &HT;    Young, who had begun a successful solo career, was recruited to
flesh out the live sound. The quartet's second performance was at
the original Woodstock festival, and by that time, Nash says, CSN&AMP;Y
had cheerfully embraced its supergroup billing.
 &HT;    ``We knew who we were,'' the 58-year-old Nash recalls. ``We knew
nobody in the world was doing what we were doing. No one had four
guys writing those kind of songs that were also that good as
musicians, all at the same time _ there was nobody like us.
 &HT;    ``So we were a little punkish about it,'' he says. ``We thought
we were kings of the world, so it was exciting to us.''
 &HT;    ``Deja Vu'' (1970), the quartet's first album, delivered on that
potential, yielding songs that became immediately popular and _ in
the case of ``Teach Your Children'' and ``Our House'' _ graduated
to musical immortality as campfire singalongs.
 &HT;    CSN&AMP;Y, it seemed, was a band for the ages.
 &HT;    But this was an admittedly volatile group of creative
personalities, stoked by ambition, arguments and drugs. The
58-year-old Crosby likens the partnership to ``juggling four
bottles of nitroglycerin,'' and they exploded more than a few times
in the intervening decades, during which CSN&AMP;Y performed in varying
incarnations but seldom as a single unit.
 &HT;    ``We're more than friends,'' says Nash, who spent nearly three
months in a wheelchair after breaking both legs in a Hawaii boating
accident shortly before the new album's release. ``We're brothers.
And, unfortunately, brothers fight occasionally. But it's been 30
years _ something's going on.''
 &HT;    The 55-year-old Stills credits the band with increased maturity.
 &HT;    ``Some of the ridiculous little kid games we used to play with
each other ... were really ridiculous and just beyond belief,'' he
says. ``This time there was a lot more listening going on than
ever, since the first record. No agendas, no tricks.''
 &HT;    It was Young, who has had the most high-profile and commercially
successful solo career of the four, who nonetheless brought the
group back together. He'd done so once before, in fact, spurring
``American Dream'' (1988) with a promise that he'd record with the
other three again if Crosby would kick the debilitating drug habit
that had landed him in a Texas prison during the mid-1980s.
 &HT;    Young had been working on a Buffalo Springfield box set, and
reached a point at which he needed Stills to come to his
northern-California ranch to hear what he'd compiled.
 &HT;    The two old friends ``laughed, cried and hugged each other,''
Young says, and their visits culminated with Stills playing a new
song that Young not only liked but agreed to record with Crosby,
Stills &AMP; Nash.
 &HT;    And when he drove down to Los Angeles, he was impressed to find
that his compatriots had left their longtime label, Atlantic
Records, and were financing their new album themselves.
 &HT;    ``It was just a good feeling again _ it was three guys who have
been making music for 30 years together, and they still want to do
it enough to go in and do it out of their own pockets,'' the
54-year-old Young says. ``That's a fantastic testimony right there
to why someone would want to be involved in that energy. It was all
positive, and the music was really great.''
 &HT;    After recording some of the other musicians' songs, Young then
offered up a few he'd written for his own album _ an
acoustic-oriented effort called ``Silver and Gold'' _ telling them
to ``take the best ones you think we can do the best job on.''
 &HT;    But throughout the process, Crosby says, the four refused to
acknowledge that they were making an album, instead taking a ``one
tune at a time'' approach.
 &HT;    ``We just didn't talk about what was going to happen or where it
was going,'' Crosby says. ``We didn't have expectations, which are
real dangerous things. What felt good was to just do the music that
was on our plate at that second and stay focused on that, and it
kept the right vibe going.''
 &HT;    They've fought to sustain that vibe even after the album's
release. The group insisted that a piano and guitar be available
even during promotional interviews for ``Looking Forward,'' and
during breaks they'd drift there to show each other new ideas.
 &HT;    And then there's ``CSNY2K,'' a three-month tour _ though it
could easily be extended _ that will feature songs from ``Looking
Forward,'' other CSN&AMP;Y favorites and music from their previous
bands, as well as new songs.
 &HT;    After that? Well, despite their history of stop-and-go dynamics,
all four band members speak hopefully of continuing their
collaboration with more consistency than they have in the past.
 &HT;    All have ongoing individual projects they're working on, ranging
from Crosby's upcoming film about music activism, ``Stand and Be
Counted,'' to Young's ``Silver and Gold'' and his continued
archival project. Those projects will inescapably make demands on
their time.
 &HT;    But the four are also conscious of how much time they've wasted
along the way, and have made a conscious commitment to what they
clearly feel is a good thing to have going.
 &HT;    ``None of the other stuff stops,'' Nash says, ``but the emphasis
shifts to what we feel right now is most important and what we
believe is most important, which _ you can ask the other guys _ is
this present piece of music that we have created, and the tour.
That takes precedence over anything.''
 &HT;    ``We have an occasion here,'' Young adds, ``and an opportunity.
We just have to keep the doors open.''

KEEPING IT SURREAL: JIM CARREY VISITS ANDY KAUFMAN'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Jim Carrey with Danny DeVito in a scene
from ``Man on the Moon.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    His name is Jim Carrey, and this is his press conference.
 &HT;    Or is it?
 &HT;    Time: Dec. 4, 1999 _ afternoon.
 &HT;    Place: The ballroom of Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel.
 &HT;    Cast of characters: Jim Carrey, star of Milos Forman's ``Man on
the Moon'' _ an Andy Kaufman biopic opening Dec. 22 _ and more than
75 journalists.
 &HT;    Theme: You don't have to know Andy Kaufman to like ``Man on the
Moon.''
 &HT;    ``The reaction has been kind of cool,'' Carrey says. ``A lot of
people, especially the European press _ who have no idea who
Kaufman is _ screened the film and seem wild about it. Maybe you're
better off.
 &HT;    ``It's (appealing) just on the basis of a very interesting
artist, a person who challenges people's beliefs,'' the comedian
says. ``I think there's enough of that to make it a good movie and
a good story.''
 &HT;    Kaufman, if you've forgotten _ or never knew _ was a stand-up
comic who dared to not tell jokes and deliberately antagonize
audiences. The sitcom ``Taxi'' made Kaufman a star, and he played
it to the hilt, wrestling women, clashing with a male wrestler on
``Letterman'' and unleashing Tony Clifton, an arrogant, talentless
lounge singer _ played by his friend and writing partner, Bob Zmuda
_ who would heckle Kaufman at live appearances.
 &HT;    By the time Kaufman died of cancer in 1984, the public was so
used to his stunts that some people didn't buy it. In fact,
Kaufmaniacs think he's alive and planning a comeback in the wake of
``Man in the Moon.''
 &HT;    Bad news: He's really dead.
 &HT;    On the other hand, Carrey _ once best known for talking through
his butt cheeks _ provides so uncanny an impersonation that pundits
are predicting an Oscar nomination.
 &HT;    ``The experience itself was so incredible,'' Carrey says softly.
``To this day I sit up and go, `This is never going to happen again
in that way.'
 &HT;    ``It was an odyssey for everybody,'' he says. ``It was like Andy
was around and Andy was directing. Every decision was made on that
basis.''
 &HT;    As for his Oscar chances, he claims to be indifferent.
 &HT;    ``The whole project was such a thrill that, if something like
that happened on top of it, I'd have a heart attack,'' he says.
``It would be ungrateful to sit here and expect something else to
come my way from this.''
 &HT;    Carrey pauses.
 &HT;    ``It would be a wonderful thing,'' he adds, smiling. ``No
question about it.''
 &HT;    Playing Kaufman consumed him, says Carrey _ who, like Kaufman,
was born on Jan. 17 _ to the extent that he lived in character on
and off camera, only twice showing up on the set as Jim Carrey.
 &HT;    ``I really didn't exist,'' he says. ``I went to bed as Andy, and
it was strange and wonderful. I'd wake up in the morning and jump
into his shoes.''
 &HT;    Further obscuring the line between fact and fiction, several
figures from Kaufman's life appear in the film. The ``Taxi'' cast
pretty much play themselves, for example, while ``Taxi'' co-star
Danny DeVito portrays Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro. And the
real Shapiro cameos as the first club owner to fire Kaufman.
 &HT;    A typical press-conference question follows: Would today's
audiences better appreciate Kaufman than people did back then?
 &HT;    ``That's interesting,'' Carrey says. ``I think he'd probably ...
Oh, God. Oh, my God.''
 &HT;    Carrey's eyes open wide as he looks to the back of the ballroom.
There stands Bob Zmuda _ or, rather, Tony Clifton, a homely man in
a devastatingly ugly tuxedo, with a bimbo on each arm and puffing
on a cigarette.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you, ladies and gentleman, I am Tony Clifton, the
star of this motion picture,'' he rants. ``These people from
Universal tried to keep me out of here, and I know why. Because the
gentleman sitting up here, who has a lot of power, doesn't want me
here. His name _ and I'm going to point him out _ is Drew Carey.''
 &HT;    Apparently thrown off-balance, Carrey interrupts.
 &HT;    ``Let me just say I worked very hard on this character, OK,'' he
says. ``This is a guy who was very jealous, very envious of Andy.
Andy tried to help him.''
 &HT;    Clifton doesn't seem to like that idea.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' he shouts. ``He's in shock! He didn't
know this was going to happen. He's trying to figure this out right
now, and he's not doing a very good job at it.
 &HT;    ``He does not want me here for one reason and one reason
alone,'' he adds. ``It's called the Oscar. It is so obvious I blow
his a-- off that screen.''
 &HT;    ``The Oscar is not everything,'' Carrey shoots back.
 &HT;    ``Don't make it sound like you don't want that Oscar,'' Clifton
yells. ``You've got Oscar-wannabe all over your face.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, come on,'' Carrey says. ``You're desperate, you're
desperate.''
 &HT;    ``Don't get me started, man,'' Clifton warns.
 &HT;    ``And you're a drunk,'' Carrey adds.
 &HT;    Clifton pulls out a can of spray paint and proceeds to write the
words ``Man on the Moon'' on the ballroom door, as the assembled
journalists laugh and try to figure out what's going on. Carrey
feigns an inability to make out Clifton's handwriting.
 &HT;    ``Mandingo?'' he hazards, drawing another chuckle from the
reporters.
 &HT;    Clifton seems to snap, lunging at Carrey and hollering ``I'll
spray you!'' The two men grapple. Carrey dumps a pitcher of water
on Clifton and then storms out, but not before swiping his arm
across the table that holds the journalists' tape recorders.
 &HT;    The recorders crash to the ground, as the paint drips down the
door and Clifton's cigarette burns a hole in the carpeting.
 &HT;    ``OK, I did my dirt,'' Clifton says smugly. ``I just want to
say, folks, it's been a pleasure talking to you. Vote for me. If I
made one person happy, it's all been worth it.
 &HT;    ``Thank you. Good night.''
 &HT;    And out the door he goes.
 &HT;    It's half an hour before Universal publicists, scrambling for
damage control, can get Carrey back. In the meantime, the
journalists retrieve their recorders, some broken beyond repair,
and hotel employees do their best to clean up the mess.
 &HT;    ``You kind of get sucked into this thing,'' Carrey says, ``and
it's hard to know what's real and what isn't anymore. Bob Zmuda,
who was playing Tony, has been writing books and doing the
character everywhere.
 &HT;    ``I was not approving,'' he says, seeming a bit disoriented. ``I
think the press should be handled within the confines of the movie.
He seems to want to step out and ... be Andy, I don't know. This
whole thing is so blurred.''
 &HT;    Carrey, who insists the episode wasn't a put-up job, offers to
pay for the broken recorders.
 &HT;    ``We're all working toward the same end here, and Zmuda ... ''
he pauses. ``I just think it's time for him to move on.''
 &HT;    Carrey himself is moving on, to new films that include the
Farrelly brothers' ``Me, Myself and Irene'' and Ron Howard's
live-action version of ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas.''
 &HT;    As for Andy Kaufman, Carrey thinks that ``Man in the Moon''
sheds light on the talented, troubled comic, but it's not the final
word.
 &HT;    ``I don't think he needs an explanation,'' Carrey says. ``If you
explain Andy, you've killed him.
 &HT;    ``That's the triumph of his life _ he beat death, because he
can't be explained,'' he concludes. ``Nobody knows if it's for real
or not, and in that way he's immortal.
 &HT;    ``If I ever did win an Oscar, I wish he'd come up and grab it
out of my hands.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jodie Foster in a scene from ``Anna and
the King.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Getting to Know You'' has never been her theme song.
 &HT;    But Jodie Foster, one of Hollywood's most notoriously private
actresses, is finally talking about what goes on behind the palace
doors _ at least as far as it relates to her pride and joy,
16-month-old Charles Foster.
 &HT;    Foster makes her postpregnancy return to the screen in the
holiday film ``Anna and the King,'' but everything else about her
life has changed.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a big fan of TV, but I love the Teletubbies now,''
confesses the Yale grad and two-time Oscar winner who, despite her
rep as the smartest woman in Hollywood, now spends her afternoons
with Tinky Winky and Po.
 &HT;    ``Teletubbies are very serene, not too overstimulating and
almost hypnotic,'' she says thoughtfully _ and then giggles like
any new mother. ``OK, so they're also adorable.''
 &HT;    If that doesn't sound like the sharp-as-a-tack Foster Hollywood
knows and loves, it's no wonder.
 &HT;    ``Motherhood has really affected my ambition _ I have none of my
ambition left,'' the 37-year-old actress says over breakfast at
Beverly Hills' chic L'Ermitage hotel. ``I already didn't have a
competitive streak in me in the few years before my son was born.
With the baby, I have absolutely no competitive streak left in me
at all.''
 &HT;    Dressed down in black jeans, a T-shirt and a worn leather
jacket, Foster still has the porcelain skin and shiny blonde hair _
currently in a pageboy _ that made her the luminous star of 33
films in 34 years, but she doesn't feel like that woman these days.
 &HT;    ``My identity is not wrapped up in the movie business anymore,''
she says matter-of-factly. ``Let's face it, I've already
accomplished so many of the abstract goals in my career. So it's
not, `Will I make money anymore? Will people like me?'
 &HT;    ``I have only one pure question left when it comes to work,
which is `Do I feel passionate enough to tell this story?'''
 &HT;    Andy Tennant, who directed ``Anna and the King'' _ a nonmusical
version of the book that inspired ``The King and I'' _ has
predicted that Foster may retire from the screen in not too long.
The actress begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine giving up acting,'' she says. ``I love making
movies.''
 &HT;    Those expecting to see Foster sing or dance in her latest movie
will be disappointed. ``Anna and the King,'' which will open Dec.
17 nationwide, may tell the story first recounted by real-life
royal governess Anna Leonowens in ``Anna and the King of Siam,''
but it tells it much differently than Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein did.
 &HT;    ``First of all, I've loved the musical my entire life,'' she
says. ``But I wanted to say something completely different. I
wanted to talk about Asia from the Asian perspective.''
 &HT;    Making the film involved spending weeks on a set in Malaysia
with temperatures lingering around 120 degrees, only six months
after she'd given birth _ but Foster says it wasn't really that
bad.
 &HT;    ``I never sweat,'' she says, ``which is one reason the makeup
people loved me. I mean, I'm standing there in a hoop skirt, a
bonnet, crinolines, leather boots and gloves, looking pretty
cool.''
 &HT;    Better yet, little Charlie also kept his cool.
 &HT;    ``He was only 6 months, and I had him on a flight that lasted 23
1/2 hours,'' the proud mother marvels. ``He was really a trouper.
He talked to the other passengers. He crawled up and down the
aisles. He smiled at people. He took food off their plates.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``What I couldn't believe,'' she adds, ``is that, after the
movie wrapped, I took him on a two-hour flight and I was like, `Oh
my God!' He was a different child. Everything was, `No, no, no!'
People were staring at me like, `Get this kid away from me!'''
 &HT;    So, will little Charlie be getting any brothers or sisters
anytime soon?
 &HT;    ``Suuurre,'' Foster says slowly, smiling wearily. ``Just not
right this week.''
 &HT;    Just don't ask her why she decided on single motherhood in the
first place.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' she says warmly but firmly, ``I try not to comment
on that stuff. Everybody's decision to have a child is personal.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says, it's not so hard if you're banking some of
the biggest paychecks of any Hollywood actress.
 &HT;    ``I mean, my mom had four kids,'' she says. ``With no money. I
don't know how she did it.''
 &HT;    Well, Foster herself helped a little. At age 3 she was a
Coppertone tot in a print ad. She went on to become one of the most
successful child stars ever, supporting her mother, sisters and
brother by the time she was 10. And then, to almost everyone's
surprise, she did the near-impossible by reinventing herself as a
top adult star, beginning with her Oscar-winning turn as a rape
victim in ``The Accused'' (1988).
 &HT;    And, yes, it's true that only moments before winning the award,
Foster called it ``one of the worst performances of my life.''
 &HT;    ``Yes, I said at the time I thought it was absolutely one of the
worst performances I had ever given,'' she admits. ``Basically, I
was so uncomfortable because this performance came completely from
instinct. And when I saw it, I thought, `Wow, she's brash. She's
tough. Uneducated. And she's not nice at all.'
 &HT;    ``Now I think she's a hero.''
 &HT;    Actually, Foster says, she never enjoys seeing her own movies.
 &HT;    ``This is my moviegoing experience,'' she says: ```We could have
had a sunset shot, but it clouded over at the last minute.' `Oh,
that's where one of the actors couldn't remember his lines.'
 &HT;    ``Even years later,'' she admits with a laugh, ``I'm looking at
a movie and screaming, `We shouldn't have cut from here to there.'
I see the mistakes.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' she adds, ``it's not a negative thing. It's just
the perfectionist in me.''
 &HT;    Foster pulled out of ``Double Jeopardy'' when she found out she
was pregnant. The movie went on to make Ashley Judd into a
bona-fide movie star, but Foster says she has no regrets.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, I don't regret that it was a huge hit,'' she says.
``I'm happy for them.''
 &HT;    Foster has had some huge hits of her own, of course, most
notably the multiple-Oscar-winning ``The Silence of the Lambs''
(1991).
 &HT;    Rumor has it that she's been offered $20 million to reprise her
role as Clarice Starling in a movie version of ``Hannibal,'' Thomas
Harris' best-selling sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' and
though she won't confirm the rumors, Foster won't deny them either.
 &HT;    ``I would love to do it,'' she says, ``but first I have to see a
script.''
 &HT;    If she were to nix the sequel script, though, she admits that it
would bother her to see someone else play Agent Starling of the
FBI.
 &HT;    ``I don't feel like I own her, but I do feel possessive of
her,'' Foster says. ``I feel like I know what Clarice would do and
not do. I know everything about her _ she is the most specific
character I've ever played.''
 &HT;    But that's one character little Charlie won't meet for some
time. He hasn't seen any of his mother's movies, and won't for a
while yet.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'll show him `Bugsy Malone' (1976),'' she says after a
moment's thought. ``It's one big fantasy, which I think is an
important part of childhood.''

 By BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 Not for release in Canada until Dec. 19. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chatting with Pamela Anderson Lee during a break from filming
her hit action series ``V.I.P.,'' one thing is clear: She doesn't
mind being candid, even outspoken on the record.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising, given the reams of bad press she's received
about her life, her, ahem, physical attributes, that infamous home
video and her on-again-off-again relationship, now on again, with
her ex-husband and current fiance, rocker Tommy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, many people would shy away from anyone
with a camera or a notebook, but Anderson Lee never has.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a sense of humor about yourself,'' she says,
``and also you have to realize that you're not really in control of
what the press writes about you. You can only live your life in a
positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to build you up and tear you down,'' she adds.
``You get a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals award, and
then someone writes that they saw you eating chicken fingers in the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually very funny, very amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good that she thinks so, because everything the 33-year-old
native of Victoria, British Columbia, does _ whether in front of or
behind the camera _ seems fair game for the tabloids. But instead
of shunning the attention, Anderson Lee has capitalized on it _
most notably in the year-old syndicated series ``V.I.P.,'' which
parallels her own life in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot episode opens with a dumb-luck incident in which her
character, Vallery Irons, accidentally saves an actor from an
attacker. Caught on camera, the bit of derring-do makes Vallery an
overnight sensation and leads a Los Angeles bodyguard agency to
sign her on as a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life story of Pamela Denise Anderson Lee is almost as
whimsical. Her rise to fame started when she was captured on a
giant Jumbotron television screen at a 1989 Canadian Football,
cheering on her team and wearing not much more than a Labatt's
T-shirt and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   From that brief glimpse came a beer-commercial contract, a
Playboy spread and a regular role on Tim Allen's comedy series
``Home Improvement,'' where she spent four seasons as the comely
Tool Time Girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a bit of myself and my experience on this
show,'' says Anderson Lee, who also executive-produces ``V.I.P.''
``The whole concept came from what I've gone through in my life to
get here _ a girl comes from a small town and is thrown into this
Hollywood life and goes through things a little naively, but she
finds her way through and things come out good in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Her life contains enough material for two or three series, at
most. There's her 1995 marriage to heavy-metal drummer Lee, their
sordid _ and stolen _ sex video and the births of their children,
Dillon and Brandon. There was the violent incident with Lee which
led to their divorce, the much-publicized removal of her breast
implants and, recently, a reconciliation with her ex-husband and
plans for a second wedding.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being an actress, producer, celebrity, wife and
mother, Anderson Lee says, but as she goes along it gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' she says, ``but I've really learned how to
structure my life for my family, which is my priority, and my
extended family, and it seems to be running pretty smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I wish there were 10 of me, but I'm figuring it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, one or both of her boys can be found on the
set. But don't expect her to push them in front of a camera:
Anderson Lee disapproves of children _ hers or anyone else's _
getting involved in acting until they're old enough to make their
own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even say that about children working on the set,'' she says.
``If you can't choose to be in the business, then I don't think
it's right. So I don't allow children to work on the show. I don't
believe in parents making that decision for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping keep the family together, Anderson Lee has arranged for
two recent guest shots by Tommy Lee. The actress/producer says she
looked forward to his days on the set, because of the chance it
offered for him to understand her work better.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she admits, she enjoyed watching the usually
ultraconfident musician flounder around, out of his element.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really funny,'' she recalls, ``because he's never done
anything like that. He was saying `Where do I pick up the gun?
Where do I put down my cigarette? When do I say the line?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally he said, `This is way too difficult, somebody give me
a drum!'''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, in her husband's defense, Anderson Lee admits that
he had it particularly difficult, because his wife was serving not
only as producer and star but also, on these episodes, as director
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool,'' she says, ``but it was horrible because I was
being the total director ... I was way too controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Lee takes her role as executive producer seriously. She
insisted on it before agreeing to sign on for ``V.I.P.,'' and has a
hand in everything from casting to performing regular production
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do it any other way now,'' she says. ``I don't
think I would do another project if I couldn't be a producer. I
have a lot of input in everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress has no illusions that she's doing Shakespeare here,
but as a producer she takes pride in the fact that the audience is
not, as most observers had predicted, made up entirely of teen-age
boys and football-loving men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio really thought `V.I.P.' would appeal to a huge male
demographic,'' Anderson Lee says. ``But when the numbers came in,
they discovered that the audience was 40 percent women. So ... girl
power! But I've always known that a lot of my fans were women and
young girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``V.I.P.'' is an unquestioned hit _ it's the No. 1 weekly
syndicated, hour-long show in the world, and has already been
renewed through 2002 _ and Anderson Lee realizes that she's
something as a role model to young women around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine with her, actually, but only up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every actor, everyone in the public eye should be
a role model of some kind,'' she says. ``But, you know, people
shouldn't really base their positions in life on what people do in
the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Good advice, coming from someone who's been there.
</P>

THE MUSIC IS BACK FOR CROSBY, STILLS, NASH &AMP; YOUNG

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham
Nash and Neal Young.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    During the opening moments of their new album, ``Looking
Forward,'' a harmonizing Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young sing _
perhaps to each other as much as to the listener _ ``We do belong
together ... and it's going to last forever.''
 &HT;    Those are pretty optimistic words for four musicians who,
despite their 30-year association, have managed only three studio
albums and haven't toured together since 1974.
 &HT;    But, all four contend, these are better times. Past arguments
and ego battles have been set aside, replaced by warmer feelings
for each other and a greater appreciation for the music they make
together. The results: ``Looking Forward,'' their first album
together since 1988, and the ``CSNY2K'' tour, which will kick off
Jan. 24 in suburban Detroit.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of unfinished business,'' Neil Young says. ``I
don't think we really reached our potential, and so we have a lot
of things to show and a lot of things to do. There are things that
we started doing on the record that show us the future.''
 &HT;    David Crosby agrees.
 &HT;    ``I think Neil's right,'' he says. ``There's almost no limit to
what this band can do when we get out there and start playing. All
of us are better at what we do than we ever have been _ I caught
glimpses of it when we were playing and singing in the studio. I'm
dying to explore the potential.''
 &HT;    The creative promise seemed enormous when CSN&AMP;Y first came
together in 1969. Each of the members had established himself in
highly regarded bands _ Crosby with the Byrds, Young and Stephen
Stills in Buffalo Springfield, Graham Nash with the Hollies.
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash had already come together and released
``Crosby, Stills and Nash,'' an album widely considered the
launching pad for the 1970s singer/songwriter movement, combining
pointed social and political commentary with a sound marked by rich
harmonies.
 &HT;    Young, who had begun a successful solo career, was recruited to
flesh out the live sound. The quartet's second performance was at
the original Woodstock festival, and by that time, Nash says, CSN&AMP;Y
had cheerfully embraced its supergroup billing.
 &HT;    ``We knew who we were,'' the 58-year-old Nash recalls. ``We knew
nobody in the world was doing what we were doing. No one had four
guys writing those kind of songs that were also that good as
musicians, all at the same time _ there was nobody like us.
 &HT;    ``So we were a little punkish about it,'' he says. ``We thought
we were kings of the world, so it was exciting to us.''
 &HT;    ``Deja Vu'' (1970), the quartet's first album, delivered on that
potential, yielding songs that became immediately popular and _ in
the case of ``Teach Your Children'' and ``Our House'' _ graduated
to musical immortality as campfire singalongs.
 &HT;    CSN&AMP;Y, it seemed, was a band for the ages.
 &HT;    But this was an admittedly volatile group of creative
personalities, stoked by ambition, arguments and drugs. The
58-year-old Crosby likens the partnership to ``juggling four
bottles of nitroglycerin,'' and they exploded more than a few times
in the intervening decades, during which CSN&AMP;Y performed in varying
incarnations but seldom as a single unit.
 &HT;    ``We're more than friends,'' says Nash, who spent nearly three
months in a wheelchair after breaking both legs in a Hawaii boating
accident shortly before the new album's release. ``We're brothers.
And, unfortunately, brothers fight occasionally. But it's been 30
years _ something's going on.''
 &HT;    The 55-year-old Stills credits the band with increased maturity.
 &HT;    ``Some of the ridiculous little kid games we used to play with
each other ... were really ridiculous and just beyond belief,'' he
says. ``This time there was a lot more listening going on than
ever, since the first record. No agendas, no tricks.''
 &HT;    It was Young, who has had the most high-profile and commercially
successful solo career of the four, who nonetheless brought the
group back together. He'd done so once before, in fact, spurring
``American Dream'' (1988) with a promise that he'd record with the
other three again if Crosby would kick the debilitating drug habit
that had landed him in a Texas prison during the mid-1980s.
 &HT;    Young had been working on a Buffalo Springfield box set, and
reached a point at which he needed Stills to come to his
northern-California ranch to hear what he'd compiled.
 &HT;    The two old friends ``laughed, cried and hugged each other,''
Young says, and their visits culminated with Stills playing a new
song that Young not only liked but agreed to record with Crosby,
Stills &AMP; Nash.
 &HT;    And when he drove down to Los Angeles, he was impressed to find
that his compatriots had left their longtime label, Atlantic
Records, and were financing their new album themselves.
 &HT;    ``It was just a good feeling again _ it was three guys who have
been making music for 30 years together, and they still want to do
it enough to go in and do it out of their own pockets,'' the
54-year-old Young says. ``That's a fantastic testimony right there
to why someone would want to be involved in that energy. It was all
positive, and the music was really great.''
 &HT;    After recording some of the other musicians' songs, Young then
offered up a few he'd written for his own album _ an
acoustic-oriented effort called ``Silver and Gold'' _ telling them
to ``take the best ones you think we can do the best job on.''
 &HT;    But throughout the process, Crosby says, the four refused to
acknowledge that they were making an album, instead taking a ``one
tune at a time'' approach.
 &HT;    ``We just didn't talk about what was going to happen or where it
was going,'' Crosby says. ``We didn't have expectations, which are
real dangerous things. What felt good was to just do the music that
was on our plate at that second and stay focused on that, and it
kept the right vibe going.''
 &HT;    They've fought to sustain that vibe even after the album's
release. The group insisted that a piano and guitar be available
even during promotional interviews for ``Looking Forward,'' and
during breaks they'd drift there to show each other new ideas.
 &HT;    And then there's ``CSNY2K,'' a three-month tour _ though it
could easily be extended _ that will feature songs from ``Looking
Forward,'' other CSN&AMP;Y favorites and music from their previous
bands, as well as new songs.
 &HT;    After that? Well, despite their history of stop-and-go dynamics,
all four band members speak hopefully of continuing their
collaboration with more consistency than they have in the past.
 &HT;    All have ongoing individual projects they're working on, ranging
from Crosby's upcoming film about music activism, ``Stand and Be
Counted,'' to Young's ``Silver and Gold'' and his continued
archival project. Those projects will inescapably make demands on
their time.
 &HT;    But the four are also conscious of how much time they've wasted
along the way, and have made a conscious commitment to what they
clearly feel is a good thing to have going.
 &HT;    ``None of the other stuff stops,'' Nash says, ``but the emphasis
shifts to what we feel right now is most important and what we
believe is most important, which _ you can ask the other guys _ is
this present piece of music that we have created, and the tour.
That takes precedence over anything.''
 &HT;    ``We have an occasion here,'' Young adds, ``and an opportunity.
We just have to keep the doors open.''

<P>
   Deep in the bellies of two science museums in Los Angeles,
Calif., lurk mountains of treasures full of old tales. They dangle
in darkened warehouses, huddle in basements, chill in industrial
freezers.
</P>
<P>
   These are the hidden wonders museum visitors rarely see: trays
of dried butterflies (some tattered, others perfectly intact),
telescopes missing lenses, ivory dolls, mounted moose heads reeking
of pesticide, space suits lacking gloves, delicate toe bones of Ice
Age mice.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts seem to bide their times, waiting for the fanciful
day that moves them front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Most, of course, will never glimpse a paying customer.
Real-estate realities work against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, for example,
has a collection of 33 million items, but only enough space to
display 1 percent of the booty, just the tip of the curatorial
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of this alternative universe has been liberated, on
film at least, by Richard Ross. He recently poked his lens into the
cubbyholes of two museums, recording a realm where staffers toil as
relics encroach upon their work space. Here balding grizzly bears
guard water fountains, miniature suits of armor crowd desktops and
everyone takes this secret world of museum misfits for granted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISPLACED MENAGERIE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taxidermist Tim Bovard must skirt an alligator, a Komodo dragon
and a Galapagos tortoise to reach his office each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County dutifully
adopts donated trophy heads and mounted animals and usually
relegates the pieces to storage.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often the animals do a stint in temporary exhibits but,
for the most part, Bovard is their only company.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an annual dusting, he rarely gives his roommates a
thought: ``I walk right past them because I see them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CANCELED FLIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center keeps Armory Hall closed to the
public because it's not earthquake-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The vast main hall houses file cabinets, office furniture and
aerospace artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The biplane is a full-scale replica of a 1911 Model B Wright
Flyer, the first aircraft ever contracted by the U.S. government
from Orville and Wilbur Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Other hangers-on include and ultralight aircraft, a 1/10-scale
Titan rocket, an experimental aircraft with a rear propeller and a
full-scale Air Force Agena spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLITARY CONFINEMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This prototype of a Mercury mission training suit, like those
donned by the first U.S. astronauts, was designed by the BF
Goodrich Company.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, California Science Center aerospace curator
Kenneth Phillips trots it out for classes with area schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually let them come up and touch it,'' he says. ``It's
cool and smooth, like it has a metallic coating.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit had a brief brush with fame in 1997, when Tom Hanks'
production company borrowed it for the HBO film ``From the Earth to
the Moon.'' And it will see more action in 2001, when it will go on
permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   The boots are not authentic Mercury footgear; Phillips plans to
replace them with the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STOREROOM STOOGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backstage lunacy prevails in wax sculptor David Robert
Cellitti's studio at the Natural History Museum, where figures from
exhibits that never came to fruition have taken up permanent
residence.
</P>
<P>
   An Aztec shaman schmoozes with Larry, Moe and Curly while Jean
Harlow's headless body slinks in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti budgets two to three months and about $5,000 to craft a
single figure. All flesh-colored parts are poured from a mixture of
beeswax, cerisin and carnauba wax and affixed to fiberglass bodies.
</P>
<P>
   To give Curly his signature near-bald buzz-cut, Cellitti spent
three days implanting human hair into the figure's skull, then
shaved it all off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKROOM BUSTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti doesn't understand why his profession inspires such
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think its mysterious, like Argentinean nuns off in a
cave making this stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces are first shaped from clay, cast as fiberglass prototypes
and poured in wax. Finally, Cellitti decorates them with makeup,
using techniques he practices on smaller fiberglass heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the same process as making a boat,'' the wax
sculptor says. ``Only in the end, I have Jean Harlow, not a
skiff.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKELETAL STALKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is that? A spider monkey? An alley cat?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what they're seeing without the skin,'' says
Natural History Museum taxidermist Tim Bovard.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a bobcat, but it will take about two weeks of
work before that becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Bovard first removes the skin and the underlying muscle, sculpts
clay over the resulting skeleton _ as shown here _ and takes a cast
of his sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fabricates a mannequin, onto which he glues the tanned
hide. the original bones, sans clay, are stored separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the highest level,'' Bovard boasts, ``this is an art.''

<P>
   Deep in the bellies of two science museums in Los Angeles,
Calif., lurk mountains of treasures full of old tales. They dangle
in darkened warehouses, huddle in basements, chill in industrial
freezers.
</P>
<P>
   These are the hidden wonders museum visitors rarely see: trays
of dried butterflies (some tattered, others perfectly intact),
telescopes missing lenses, ivory dolls, mounted moose heads reeking
of pesticide, space suits lacking gloves, delicate toe bones of Ice
Age mice.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts seem to bide their times, waiting for the fanciful
day that moves them front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Most, of course, will never glimpse a paying customer.
Real-estate realities work against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, for example,
has a collection of 33 million items, but only enough space to
display 1 percent of the booty, just the tip of the curatorial
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of this alternative universe has been liberated, on
film at least, by Richard Ross. He recently poked his lens into the
cubbyholes of two museums, recording a realm where staffers toil as
relics encroach upon their work space. Here balding grizzly bears
guard water fountains, miniature suits of armor crowd desktops and
everyone takes this secret world of museum misfits for granted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISPLACED MENAGERIE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taxidermist Tim Bovard must skirt an alligator, a Komodo dragon
and a Galapagos tortoise to reach his office each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County dutifully
adopts donated trophy heads and mounted animals and usually
relegates the pieces to storage.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often the animals do a stint in temporary exhibits but,
for the most part, Bovard is their only company.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an annual dusting, he rarely gives his roommates a
thought: ``I walk right past them because I see them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CANCELED FLIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center keeps Armory Hall closed to the
public because it's not earthquake-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The vast main hall houses file cabinets, office furniture and
aerospace artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The biplane is a full-scale replica of a 1911 Model B Wright
Flyer, the first aircraft ever contracted by the U.S. government
from Orville and Wilbur Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Other hangers-on include and ultralight aircraft, a 1/10-scale
Titan rocket, an experimental aircraft with a rear propeller and a
full-scale Air Force Agena spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLITARY CONFINEMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This prototype of a Mercury mission training suit, like those
donned by the first U.S. astronauts, was designed by the BF
Goodrich Company.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, California Science Center aerospace curator
Kenneth Phillips trots it out for classes with area schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually let them come up and touch it,'' he says. ``It's
cool and smooth, like it has a metallic coating.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit had a brief brush with fame in 1997, when Tom Hanks'
production company borrowed it for the HBO film ``From the Earth to
the Moon.'' And it will see more action in 2001, when it will go on
permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   The boots are not authentic Mercury footgear; Phillips plans to
replace them with the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STOREROOM STOOGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backstage lunacy prevails in wax sculptor David Robert
Cellitti's studio at the Natural History Museum, where figures from
exhibits that never came to fruition have taken up permanent
residence.
</P>
<P>
   An Aztec shaman schmoozes with Larry, Moe and Curly while Jean
Harlow's headless body slinks in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti budgets two to three months and about $5,000 to craft a
single figure. All flesh-colored parts are poured from a mixture of
beeswax, cerisin and carnauba wax and affixed to fiberglass bodies.
</P>
<P>
   To give Curly his signature near-bald buzz-cut, Cellitti spent
three days implanting human hair into the figure's skull, then
shaved it all off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKROOM BUSTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti doesn't understand why his profession inspires such
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think its mysterious, like Argentinean nuns off in a
cave making this stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces are first shaped from clay, cast as fiberglass prototypes
and poured in wax. Finally, Cellitti decorates them with makeup,
using techniques he practices on smaller fiberglass heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the same process as making a boat,'' the wax
sculptor says. ``Only in the end, I have Jean Harlow, not a
skiff.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKELETAL STALKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is that? A spider monkey? An alley cat?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what they're seeing without the skin,'' says
Natural History Museum taxidermist Tim Bovard.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a bobcat, but it will take about two weeks of
work before that becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Bovard first removes the skin and the underlying muscle, sculpts
clay over the resulting skeleton _ as shown here _ and takes a cast
of his sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fabricates a mannequin, onto which he glues the tanned
hide. the original bones, sans clay, are stored separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the highest level,'' Bovard boasts, ``this is an art.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Sept. 1, 1970, a 9-month-old boy was brought to a hospital in
Basankusu, a small town in what is now called the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was covered with a horrible rash _ large, painful
pustules that radiated out toward the face and the extremities. It
looked just like smallpox, a virus that had supposedly been all but
eradicated from the face of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors in Basankusu took samples, which eventually ended up
in the hands of renowned Soviet virologist Svetlana Marrenikova.
She grew the virus and inoculated it into a rabbit skin, where it
produced a lesion she'd seen before, but never on a human.
</P>
<P>
   This was not smallpox but monkeypox, a disease first identified
in 1958, when it was found spreading among Asian and African
monkeys that had been captured for laboratory research.
</P>
<P>
   Four cases in Liberia soon followed, and other reports of the
disease began trickling in.
</P>
<P>
   Because smallpox was so rare, doctors could more easily diagnose
monkeypox, which had apparently infected forest-dwelling Africans
for centuries but was completely unknown to most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smallpox, one of the most virulent and highly contagious
human diseases, monkeypox did not easily spread from person to
person. Most victims were children who had caught and eaten small
animals from the forest, including monkeys, squirrels and rats.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators learned from outbreaks during the next 20
years, African monkeypox, like smallpox, could kill as many as one
out of every 10 persons infected.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Health Organization study carried out from 1981 to
1986, investigators identified 338 monkeypox cases in Zaire (now
the Congo) but concluded that it wasn't a major problem. For one
thing, the disease had relatively few victims in a country haunted
by malaria, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness and AIDS. It also did
not spread very quickly and was rarely transmitted through human
contact.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before anyone thought much about the monkeypox
virus changing. New outbreaks of the disease indicate that it could
be breaking free of its natural confines and spreading from person
to person ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, civil unrest engulfed the Congo. A rebel army seized
power and installed Laurent Kabila as head of state. In the
province of Kasai Oriental, forest-dwelling Batetela peoples were
forced to rely more on hunting and gathering for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   The Batetela lived in leaf-roofed huts built on the edge of the
forest. Their children foraged there for squirrels, rats and voles.
When they were lucky, they caught the occasional monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, some of the local children became very ill _
monkeypox again. But this time, a new and troubling characteristic
had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Two traits are crucial to determining the severity of infectious
threats: virulence and transmissibility. The virulence of this
outbreak of monkeypox, the percentage of its victims dying, didn't
seem to be increasing. But transmissibility, how the virus spreads,
was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   In previous outbreaks, human contact appeared to have spread
only about one-fourth of the cases of monkeypox. Most cases came
from trapping and skinning an infected animal. Reports from three
separate missions conducted by the World Health Organization over
the past three years indicate that the overwhelming majority _ at
least two-thirds _ of the cases are now orignating from
person-to-person contact.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 511 cases had been diagnosed since the 1996
outbreak. But the disease continues to spread, and no one can be
certain at what rate, given the state of the war-ravaged Congolese
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately some scientists fear that monkeypox could kill a lot
more people than more horrifying viruses like Ebola or Marburg or
hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the emerging diseases that attract media attention _
Ebola, hantavirus and the like _ probably pose little threat of
causing epidemics,'' says evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald of
Amherst College, in Mass. ``They don't have the necessary mix of
virulence and transmission characteristics. Not so with monkeypox.
It causes damaging infections, grows productively in humans, is
transmissible from person to person and is durable in the external
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox, like smallpox, belongs to the family of orthopox
viruses. They are both encoded in DNA, and DNA viruses _ unlike RNA
viruses such as HIV and influenza _ are not noted for their rapid
mutability.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't evolve. Under the right
conditions, natural selection may allow survival of those strains
best suited to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no scientific consensus on whether and how much
monkeypox is changing, John W. Huggins of the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is worried about the
increase in transmissibility. And he's been working on finding a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was on the third team the World Health Organization sent
out to study the present outbreak in the Congo. The team headed off
to the Congo partly to complete the work of preceding World Health
Organization research teams, collecting serum samples from active
cases of monkeypox and attempting a close study of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they, like their predecessors, could not complete the work
because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins says the samples he gathered reveal two new traits not
present in the monkeypox strain of 1976. The first is syncytia, in
which infected cells tend to fuse together into cells with many
nuclei. He also found differences in monoclonal antibody-binding
patterns, a clue that the strains he found are distinct from the
samples taken in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says virologist Joseph Esposito of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huggins' observations don't
tell us whether the disease is growing more transmissible or more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   CDC virologist John Stewart, a member of an expedition to the
Congo in 1997, is not familiar with Huggins' analyses but, like
Esposito, he is not worried about monkeypox: ``I don't think that
our studies show anything to indicate that monkeypox is changing
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increased incidence of the disease to the
greater vulnerability of a younger, non-vaccinated population:
Smallpox vaccinations, halted in the region in 1982, confer at
least 85 percent immunity to monkeypox, although that immunity
wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from monkeypox is also in dispute. Esposito says
the death rate for those infected in recent outbreaks is much lower
than 10 percent. Huggins insists that there are pockets of
infection where monkeypox is killing 10 percent of those it
infects.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the question of whether monkeypox could become
more virulent.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests conducted at the CDC, Huggins found that
cidofovir, a drug originally developed to treat a viral infection
in AIDS patients, appears to inhibit the replication of both
monkeypox and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can assume for now is that as long as monkeypox stays
in the rain-forest villages of the Congo or Sierra Leone and
Liberia, where it has also been seen, it won't develop into a major
threat. But all of these areas are war zones. Soldiers, from rebel
and government factions alike, have cut a brutal path through the
infected zone in the Congo. Both soldiers and refugees are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to think about what could happen to monkeypox in
the large, crowded city of Kinshasa.

   Deep in the bellies of two science museums in Los Angeles,
Calif., lurk mountains of treasures full of old tales. They dangle
in darkened warehouses, huddle in basements, chill in industrial
freezers.

   These are the hidden wonders museum visitors rarely see: trays
of dried butterflies (some tattered, others perfectly intact),

   The artifacts seem to bide their times, waiting for the fanciful

   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, for example,
has a collection of 33 million items, but only enough space to
display 1 percent of the booty, just the tip of the curatorial

<P>
   A small part of this alternative universe has been liberated, on
film at least, by Richard Ross. He recently poked his lens into the
cubbyholes of two museums, recording a realm where staffers toil as

guard water fountains, miniature suits of armor crowd desktops and
everyone takes this secret world of museum misfits for granted.

<P>
   On Sept. 1, 1970, a 9-month-old boy was brought to a hospital in
Basankusu, a small town in what is now called the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was covered with a horrible rash _ large, painful
pustules that radiated out toward the face and the extremities. It
looked just like smallpox, a virus that had supposedly been all but
eradicated from the face of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors in Basankusu took samples, which eventually ended up
in the hands of renowned Soviet virologist Svetlana Marrenikova.
She grew the virus and inoculated it into a rabbit skin, where it
produced a lesion she'd seen before, but never on a human.
</P>
<P>
   This was not smallpox but monkeypox, a disease first identified
in 1958, when it was found spreading among Asian and African
monkeys that had been captured for laboratory research.
</P>
<P>
   Four cases in Liberia soon followed, and other reports of the
disease began trickling in.
</P>
<P>
   Because smallpox was so rare, doctors could more easily diagnose
monkeypox, which had apparently infected forest-dwelling Africans
for centuries but was completely unknown to most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smallpox, one of the most virulent and highly contagious
human diseases, monkeypox did not easily spread from person to
person. Most victims were children who had caught and eaten small
animals from the forest, including monkeys, squirrels and rats.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators learned from outbreaks during the next 20
years, African monkeypox, like smallpox, could kill as many as one
out of every 10 persons infected.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Health Organization study carried out from 1981 to
1986, investigators identified 338 monkeypox cases in Zaire (now
the Congo) but concluded that it wasn't a major problem. For one
thing, the disease had relatively few victims in a country haunted
by malaria, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness and AIDS. It also did
not spread very quickly and was rarely transmitted through human
contact.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before anyone thought much about the monkeypox
virus changing. New outbreaks of the disease indicate that it could
be breaking free of its natural confines and spreading from person
to person ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, civil unrest engulfed the Congo. A rebel army seized
power and installed Laurent Kabila as head of state. In the
province of Kasai Oriental, forest-dwelling Batetela peoples were
forced to rely more on hunting and gathering for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   The Batetela lived in leaf-roofed huts built on the edge of the
forest. Their children foraged there for squirrels, rats and voles.
When they were lucky, they caught the occasional monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, some of the local children became very ill _
monkeypox again. But this time, a new and troubling characteristic
had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Two traits are crucial to determining the severity of infectious
threats: virulence and transmissibility. The virulence of this
outbreak of monkeypox, the percentage of its victims dying, didn't
seem to be increasing. But transmissibility, how the virus spreads,
was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   In previous outbreaks, human contact appeared to have spread
only about one-fourth of the cases of monkeypox. Most cases came
from trapping and skinning an infected animal. Reports from three
separate missions conducted by the World Health Organization over
the past three years indicate that the overwhelming majority _ at
least two-thirds _ of the cases are now originating from
person-to-person contact.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 511 cases had been diagnosed since the 1996
outbreak. But the disease continues to spread, and no one can be
certain at what rate, given the state of the war-ravaged Congolese
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately some scientists fear that monkeypox could kill a lot
more people than more horrifying viruses like Ebola or Marburg or
hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the emerging diseases that attract media attention _
Ebola, hantavirus and the like _ probably pose little threat of
causing epidemics,'' says evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald of
Amherst College, in Mass. ``They don't have the necessary mix of
virulence and transmission characteristics. Not so with monkeypox.
It causes damaging infections, grows productively in humans, is
transmissible from person to person and is durable in the external
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox, like smallpox, belongs to the family of orthopox
viruses. They are both encoded in DNA, and DNA viruses _ unlike RNA
viruses such as HIV and influenza _ are not noted for their rapid
mutability.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't evolve. Under the right
conditions, natural selection may allow survival of those strains
best suited to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no scientific consensus on whether and how much
monkeypox is changing, John W. Huggins of the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is worried about the
increase in transmissibility. And he's been working on finding a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was on the third team the World Health Organization sent
out to study the present outbreak in the Congo. The team headed off
to the Congo partly to complete the work of preceding World Health
Organization research teams, collecting serum samples from active
cases of monkeypox and attempting a close study of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they, like their predecessors, could not complete the work
because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins says the samples he gathered reveal two new traits not
present in the monkeypox strain of 1976. The first is syncytia, in
which infected cells tend to fuse together into cells with many
nuclei. He also found differences in monoclonal antibody-binding
patterns, a clue that the strains he found are distinct from the
samples taken in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says virologist Joseph Esposito of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huggins' observations don't
tell us whether the disease is growing more transmissible or more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   CDC virologist John Stewart, a member of an expedition to the
Congo in 1997, is not familiar with Huggins' analyses but, like
Esposito, he is not worried about monkeypox: ``I don't think that
our studies show anything to indicate that monkeypox is changing
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increased incidence of the disease to the
greater vulnerability of a younger, non-vaccinated population:
Smallpox vaccinations, halted in the region in 1982, confer at
least 85 percent immunity to monkeypox, although that immunity
wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from monkeypox is also in dispute. Esposito says
the death rate for those infected in recent outbreaks is much lower
than 10 percent. Huggins insists that there are pockets of
infection where monkeypox is killing 10 percent of those it
infects.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the question of whether monkeypox could become
more virulent.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests conducted at the CDC, Huggins found that
cidofovir, a drug originally developed to treat a viral infection
in AIDS patients, appears to inhibit the replication of both
monkeypox and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can assume for now is that as long as monkeypox stays
in the rain-forest villages of the Congo or Sierra Leone and
Liberia, where it has also been seen, it won't develop into a major
threat. But all of these areas are war zones. Soldiers, from rebel
and government factions alike, have cut a brutal path through the
infected zone in the Congo. Both soldiers and refugees are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to think about what could happen to monkeypox in
the large, crowded city of Kinshasa.

had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Two traits are crucial to determining the severity of infectious
threats: virulence and transmissibility. The virulence of this
outbreak of monkeypox, the percentage of its victims dying, didn't
seem to be increasing. But transmissibility, how the virus spreads,
was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   In previous outbreaks, human contact appeared to have spread
only about one-fourth of the cases of monkeypox. Most cases came
from trapping and skinning an infected animal. Reports from three
separate missions conducted by the World Health Organization over
the past three years indicate that the overwhelming majority _ at
least two-thirds _ of the cases are now originating from
person-to-person contact.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 511 cases had been diagnosed since the 1996
outbreak. But the disease continues to spread, and no one can be
certain at what rate, given the state of the war-ravaged Congolese
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately some scientists fear that monkeypox could kill a lot
more people than more horrifying viruses like Ebola or Marburg or
hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the emerging diseases that attract media attention _
Ebola, hantavirus and the like _ probably pose little threat of
causing epidemics,'' says evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald of
Amherst College, in Mass. ``They don't have the necessary mix of
virulence and transmission characteristics. Not so with monkeypox.
It causes damaging infections, grows productively in humans, is
transmissible from person to person and is durable in the external
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox, like smallpox, belongs to the family of orthopox
viruses. They are both encoded in DNA, and DNA viruses _ unlike RNA
viruses such as HIV and influenza _ are not noted for their rapid
mutability.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't evolve. Under the right
conditions, natural selection may allow survival of those strains
best suited to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no scientific consensus on whether and how much
monkeypox is changing, John W. Huggins of the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is worried about the
increase in transmissibility. And he's been working on finding a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was on the third team the World Health Organization sent
out to study the present outbreak in the Congo. The team headed off
to the Congo partly to complete the work of preceding World Health
Organization research teams, collecting serum samples from active
cases of monkeypox and attempting a close study of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they, like their predecessors, could not complete the work
because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins says the samples he gathered reveal two new traits not
present in the monkeypox strain of 1976. The first is syncytia, in
which infected cells tend to fuse together into cells with many
nuclei. He also found differences in monoclonal antibody-binding
patterns, a clue that the strains he found are distinct from the
samples taken in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says virologist Joseph Esposito of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huggins' observations don't
tell us whether the disease is growing more transmissible or more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   CDC virologist John Stewart, a member of an expedition to the
Congo in 1997, is not familiar with Huggins' analyses but, like
Esposito, he is not worried about monkeypox: ``I don't think that
our studies show anything to indicate that monkeypox is changing
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increased incidence of the disease to the
greater vulnerability of a younger, non-vaccinated population:
Smallpox vaccinations, halted in the region in 1982, confer at
least 85 percent immunity to monkeypox, although that immunity
wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from monkeypox is also in dispute. Esposito says
the death rate for those infected in recent outbreaks is much lower
than 10 percent. Huggins insists that there are pockets of
infection where monkeypox is killing 10 percent of those it
infects.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the question of whether monkeypox could become
more virulent.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests conducted at the CDC, Huggins found that
cidofovir, a drug originally developed to treat a viral infection
in AIDS patients, appears to inhibit the replication of both
monkeypox and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can assume for now is that as long as monkeypox stays
in the rain-forest villages of the Congo or Sierra Leone and
Liberia, where it has also been seen, it won't develop into a major
threat. But all of these areas are war zones. Soldiers, from rebel
and government factions alike, have cut a brutal path through the
infected zone in the Congo. Both soldiers and refugees are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to think about what could happen to monkeypox in
the large, crowded city of Kinshasa.

ANDERSON GOES BACK TO THE VALLEY WITH `MAGNOLIA'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I unashamedly wanted to make the epic, the
all-time great San Fernando Valley movie,'' Paul Thomas Anderson
exuberantly proclaims; then adds with characteristic, mordant
honesty, ``The competition was not hard, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the greatest film set in the Valley, for better or for
worse, is ``Boogie Nights,'' native-son Anderson's own 1997 study
of the porno industry.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's three-hour emotional epic ``Magnolia'' is the most
artistically ambitious and uncompromising movie of the year. Though
hardly as incendiary, subject-wise, as ``Boogie Nights,'' this look
at a day in the life of a dozen-odd, loosely related Valley
residents is already more controversial. Declared everything from a
visionary masterpiece to an indulgent endurance test, the film,
which opens Friday in L.A. (though not the Valley), has left
various viewers exhilarated, devastated, angry, exhausted or
scratching their heads _ or some combination thereof.
</P>
<P>
   With an ensemble cast that ranges from an astonishingly
obnoxious Tom Cruise and a semi-comatose Jason Robards to Anderson
regulars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore (both of whom just
won the National Board of Review's 1999 supporting actor awards, as
did the whole cast for ensemble work), John C. Reilly, William H.
Macy and Philip Baker Hall, the film explores the mistakes and
regrets of imperfect lives and the strange circumstances that
connect them.
</P>
<P>
   While set and filmed almost entirely in the San Fernando Valley,
with a few specific exceptions ``Magnolia'' deals with universal
human concerns. There's a game-show producer (that's local) who's
dying of cancer, and whose much younger trophy wife (happens
everywhere, despite what those who think Hollywood is dominated by
dirty old men say) and empathetic home health-care giver must come
to grips with his inevitable loss. There's a child quiz-show genius
and an adult screw-up who used to be one (more-or-less local). We
meet a lonely North Hollywood cop (precinct's specific) and the
self-destructive young woman he tries to save (since time
immemorial ...). And then there's the, um, motivational speaker, a
character one might hope doesn't really exist anywhere on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a street in the Valley and it's a flower,'' Anderson, 29,
concedes, ``but I'll tell you what: I always had the title of
'Magnolia' in my head, even before I wrote this. Then a couple of
weird things started to happen that verified the title for me. I
started to do research on the magnolia tree, and there was a
concept that if you eat the tree's bark it can help cure cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, there was this this thing that I discovered
called the Magonia,'' he continues. ``Of course, there's a
recognizable similarity to the word magnolia, and the Magonia is
this mythical place above the firmament where stuff just goes and
hangs out before it falls from the sky. In other words, when you
hear those stories about an anchor suddenly dropping on a farmer's
barn, they explain that it came from the Magonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to mention that Magnolia is a great street in the Valley
and a great place to film.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot comes down, literally and metaphorically, in
``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   As you may have gathered by now, Anderson does not think in what
you'd call conventional terms. And his movies reflect that.
``Magnolia'' unfolds more like a symphony of emotion than a
traditional three-act movie plot, with all kinds of smaller,
music-based flourishes within it. At one point, an assortment of
characters in different settings sings along to verses of the Aimee
Mann song ``Wise Up'' (singer-songwriter Mann's tunes provided
inspiration for much of ``Magnolia's'' script, and are heard
throughout the film; Anderson says that his girlfriend, Fiona
Apple, is not jealous in the least). An entire 40-minute montage,
built around an episode of the astoundingly difficult game show
``What Do Kids Know,'' is held together by Jon Brion's non-stop
musical score. And some characters, like Moore's guilt-ridden
spouse and Macy's lightning-struck ex-genius, don't so much speak
dialogue as recite profane arias of unbearable pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is sort of structured like `A Day in the Life,' the
Beatles' song,'' Anderson explains. ``It kind of builds up, note by
note, then drops or recedes, then builds again. A movie that's this
long needs something like a propeller, an undercurrent that's
always just washing, especially when emotions are going from way
over here to way over here. I get frustrated when people say that
this is a vignette movie, because it's not, really. It's nine
plots, maybe, but it's one story. And I felt like the only way to
do that was to connect it all musically. It helped everything make
sense in concert with the other pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Magnolia's'' actors, Anderson's unusual approach presented
outstanding challenges and incalcuable rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the scenes were so hard,'' admits the widely admired
Moore, who earned an Oscar nomination for her ``Boogie Nights''
performance. ``The difficulty I had as an actor in locating this
woman's center is the experience that she has as a character: She
doesn't know what she's feeling, doesn't know what's going on and
is reacting to it in a hysterical kind of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Paul has such an amazing worldview and is such a great
writer,'' she adds. ``There is such a wonderful rhythm to his
language, and the way his people speak is not artificial at all.
And he's a tremendous humanitarian; he's got great compassion for
the human condition. You see that again and again in his films; he
knows how to take an ordinary life and magnify it so that we can
see ourselves in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a veteran of both previous Anderson features ``Hard
Eight'' and ``Boogie,'' appreciates the director's ability to link
random weirdness with the common life traumas we all face at some
time, but can never bring our hearts to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the themes of the movie is random ridiculousness,''
says Reilly, who plays ``Magnolia's'' inept but desperately
well-meaning LAPD officer. ``Why did, all of a sudden, that guy get
hit by lightning? But I recently lost one of my family members to
cancer, and that is the same feeling that I had. Why? What is this?
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is just as mysterious, as hard to process in your
mind, as getting hit by lightning,'' Reilly continues. ``Strange
phenomena, crazy things happen every day, and everyone is trying to
find some way to understand it and come to grips with it in their
life, whether it's something that we think of as mundane or
something we think of as extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Magnolia's'' scenario, Macy's messed-up former child-genius
has been lightning-struck both physically and emotionally: His
parents stole his game-show winnings, leaving him unable to trust
anyone despite a consuming need for affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the line `I have a lot of love, I just don't know
where to put it' sums up the character and, perhaps, sums up the
movie,'' says Macy, a respected member of both Anderson's loose
repertory company and that of playwright/filmmaker David Mamet as
well. ``He's a guy with a lot of smarts, a lot of information in
his head, but dumb as a bag of hair. I just know people like that,
real smart but have the weirdest automobile accidents, the
worst-managed lives.''
</P>
<P>
   These and many other needy characters shuffle and wail their
ways memorably through ``Magnolia.'' But if one performance is
going to stand out among the group effort, it's likely to be Tom
Cruise's outlandish portrayal of a seduction guru, a piggish
manipulator who's made a small media empire out of teaching angry
men how to get what they want from women with minimum emotional
investment.
</P>
<P>
   It's the wildest thing Cruise has ever done, and certainly the
most unflattering role he's ever taken. Anderson says that the
superstar approached him after he saw ``Boogie Nights,'' and
expressed no reservations about the nasty character later written
specifically for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, Tom Cruise is not a prude, I'll tell you that,''
Anderson says with a laugh. ``I guess there was a certain sort of
naughtiness that writing for him brought out in me, just wanting to
see him do something kind of insane and a little bit different. And
I think that he was really anxious to do that because he'd been
making `Eyes Wide Shut' for two years. After playing the repressed
character in that movie, to get something this outlandish and
bigger-than-life, I think, thrilled him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knows show-biz personalities intimately. His father,
Ernie Anderson, was Ghoulardi, a Cleveland TV horror-movie host who
became a voiceover specialist after moving to Studio City. Paul
grew up with a deep attachment to the Valley _ so deep that he
still feels guilty about having had to replace a street sign on
Sherman Way with a Magnolia/Laurel Canyon corner marker for a shot
in the new film, as though he's betrayed some major truth about the
place.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the deepest regret of the artist's young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing: I was looking and looking and looking for a
house,'' he sheepishly reveals. ``I finally found this really great
house in the Hollywood Hills and I bought it. And I am ...
miserable! It's a great house and everything else, but we are now
planning to move because Art's Deli is far too far away. Honestly,
I'm not kissing back up to the Valley, because I totally abandoned
it. I thought it would actually, maybe, be healthy for me to try to
live someplace else. But I'm a homebody and I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what ``Magnolia'' may say about life here, ``I hope that
it's not entirely specific to the Valley,'' Anderson says. ``The
characters are easily found here, but hopefully the themes don't
parallel anything that is happening in the Valley. But who knows?
There's certainly an interesting sort of grid effect to the Valley
that, maybe, structurally, means something to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. Now I'm the Valley filmmaker. I don't want to do a
movie about the Valley next only so it doesn't become an obnoxious
thing. I want to save it and leave it more precious as a place
where I really do want to make movies for the rest of my life. I've
just got to make sure that I don't do it every time _ even though
that would be my instinct.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Fashion may have been all over the map at the recent spring
shows, but one trend was clear on both sides of the Atlantic: The
Cher-hair revival of the last several seasons has finally started
to lose its grip on our fascination.
</P>
<P>
   (Think of Helen Hunt's extensions at the Academy Awards this
year for a look that's quickly passing its expiration date.)
</P>
<P>
   In its place was a parade of shaggy, homespun hairdos and _ get
this _ bangs. Even Naomi Campbell opted to walk the catwalk with a
modern shag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair has been long and straight for so long that it was just
begging for a new look,'' says Garren, the hair master responsible
for Maggie Rizer's new bleached blond, choppy 'do. ``That haircut
is amazing on her. It really transformed her,'' he says, throwing
the model an admiring glance backstage at the Anna Sui show.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, a new haircut is the easiest way for a restless
model to find her way back into the spotlight. Gamine Trish Goff,
who last season sported one of the most luxurious manes around _
thick, jet black and hovering low beneath her shoulders _ this
season flaunted a shaggy, disheveled haircut that barely grazed her
neck. She looked so startlingly different that photographers
practically tripped over their tripods to get a shot of her.
</P>
<P>
   In Goff's case, the cut's homemade air was authentic: The model
did the snipping herself, albeit under the watchful eye of
hairstylist Rick Haylor.
</P>
<P>
   For mere mortals, the thought of bringing a pair of scissors in
contact with one's own hair might incite a panic attack, but for
seasoned veterans of fashion's smoke and mirrors, it's just a
matter of confident practicality.
</P>
<P>
   Take Stella Tennant's nonchalant explanation for her
self-inflicted crop: ``I know what I like, and I like to be in
control,'' she says with a shrug. Plus, she adds, ``I hate going to
salons.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gordon, the owner of New York's Bumble and bumble salon,
is understandably thrilled over the return of the ``haircut'' and
declares that if he had his way, he'd do away with all long hair.
``A true haircut is much more interesting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, see the cropped look as just a fun diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer is a good season for short hair,'' says Orlando Pita
backstage at Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   But Pita says while long tresses have a versatility and a
universal sex appeal, short hair has its limits. ``You can only be
trendy with short hair,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Pita's sentiments is Brazilian bombshell Gisele. Much
has been said about her voluptuous figure, but Gisele's abundant
auburn mane is clearly the icing on her cake. The mere mention of a
new coif causes the model to shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not cutting it!'' she gasps, throwing herself a reassuring
look in the mirror backstage at Ralph Lauren. ``I just think women
look more feminine with long hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was hair the shortest it's been since the waif rage of
the early '90s, but many of the styles sported something that
hasn't been seen for a long time: bangs. And editorial hairstylist
Ward couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's homage to this stalwart, however, is an offbeat,
asymmetric version that covers one eye and dips below the ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bangs that are cut in the same old way,'' he says, ``just
don't turn heads, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, isn't that what hair's all about?

<P>
   Fashion may have been all over the map at the recent spring
shows, but one trend was clear on both sides of the Atlantic: The
Cher-hair revival of the last several seasons has finally started
to lose its grip on our fascination.
</P>
<P>
   (Think of Helen Hunt's extensions at the Academy Awards this
year for a look that's quickly passing its expiration date.)
</P>
<P>
   In its place was a parade of shaggy, homespun hairdos and _ get
this _ bangs. Even Naomi Campbell opted to walk the catwalk with a
modern shag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair has been long and straight for so long that it was just
begging for a new look,'' says Garren, the hair master responsible
for Maggie Rizer's new bleached blond, choppy 'do. ``That haircut
is amazing on her. It really transformed her,'' he says, throwing
the model an admiring glance backstage at the Anna Sui show.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, a new haircut is the easiest way for a restless
model to find her way back into the spotlight. Gamine Trish Goff,
who last season sported one of the most luxurious manes around _
thick, jet black and hovering low beneath her shoulders _ this
season flaunted a shaggy, disheveled haircut that barely grazed her
neck. She looked so startlingly different that photographers
practically tripped over their tripods to get a shot of her.
</P>
<P>
   In Goff's case, the cut's homemade air was authentic: The model
did the snipping herself, albeit under the watchful eye of
hairstylist Rick Haylor.
</P>
<P>
   For mere mortals, the thought of bringing a pair of scissors in
contact with one's own hair might incite a panic attack, but for
seasoned veterans of fashion's smoke and mirrors, it's just a
matter of confident practicality.
</P>
<P>
   Take Stella Tennant's nonchalant explanation for her
self-inflicted crop: ``I know what I like, and I like to be in
control,'' she says with a shrug. Plus, she adds, ``I hate going to
salons.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gordon, the owner of New York's Bumble and bumble salon,
is understandably thrilled over the return of the ``haircut'' and
declares that if he had his way, he'd do away with all long hair.
``A true haircut is much more interesting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, see the cropped look as just a fun diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer is a good season for short hair,'' says Orlando Pita
backstage at Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   But Pita says while long tresses have a versatility and a
universal sex appeal, short hair has its limits. ``You can only be
trendy with short hair,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Pita's sentiments is Brazilian bombshell Gisele. Much
has been said about her voluptuous figure, but Gisele's abundant
auburn mane is clearly the icing on her cake. The mere mention of a
new coif causes the model to shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not cutting it!'' she gasps, throwing herself a reassuring
look in the mirror backstage at Ralph Lauren. ``I just think women
look more feminine with long hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was hair the shortest it's been since the waif rage of
the early '90s, but many of the styles sported something that
hasn't been seen for a long time: bangs. And editorial hairstylist
Ward couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's homage to this stalwart, however, is an offbeat,
asymmetric version that covers one eye and dips below the ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bangs that are cut in the same old way,'' he says, ``just
don't turn heads, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, isn't that what hair's all about?

<P>
   Believe it or not, when Leonardo DiCaprio gets on his soap box
about saving the planet, he's not just blowing hot air. DiCaprio,
along with Cameron Diaz, Aidan Quinn and Alanis Morissettamong the socially and environmentally enlightened entertainers who
are putting their money where their conscience is.
</P>
<P>
   They, like many investors, have created portfolios filled with
the stocks of companies with sound environmental policies, fair
employment practices and other traits beyond profit and loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they've discovered that it's possible to do well
while also doing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a huge difference by checking to see where
their money is going,'' affirms actress Susan Sarandon, while the
designer Diane Von Furstenberg, who avoids companies dealing in
arms, adds, ``It's a good thing to invest in products and services
that help. That's the elevating side of the American capitalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Long seen as the purview of the Birkenstock set, such so-called
PC investing has been gaining mainstream acceptance. And now, if
picking stocks isn't your thing, there are certain mutual funds and
indexes that avoid ``sin'' industries such as tobacco, alcohol and
gaming and that screen for ethical concerns like union busting and
workplace discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical investing is taking off in part because the army of
newly minted dot-com millionaires, who were in junior high school
when a greed-is-good philosophy swept over the '80s, don't want to
manage their money the way their parents did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum of unethical behavior swung so far during the
Michael Milken era,'' says Patrick McVeigh of financial management
firm Trillium. ``People are saying, `We don't want to invest that
way.'''
</P>
<P>
   And legal restrictions governing pension funds are no longer an
obstacle since the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration
ruled that selection of socially conscious investments is not
inconsistent with fiduciary standards governing such plans.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most compelling is the fact that the performance of
some PC mutual funds and indexes has been good enough to make evil
capitalists green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outperforming most other funds in our category,
regardless of whether they are socially responsible or not,'' says
Chris Brown, co-portfolio manager of the socially and
environmentally conscious Pax World balance fund, which invests in
stocks, bonds, cash and equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar, the Consumer Reports of the mutual-fund world,
identifies over 60 funds that specifically target social concerns,
including Dreyfus Third Century, Calvert Social Equity, Citizens
Emerging Growth, Green Century Equity, Meyers Sheppard Pride and
Women's Equity Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are many definitions of socially responsible
investing _ and plenty of loopholes and rationales should an
investor wish to include a questionable company in his or her
portfolio. After all, good deeds are no guarantee of good returns _
although performance was more of an issue when people were avoiding
South African investments to protest apartheid and tobacco and
firearms companies were driving the Standard &AMP; Poors 500.
</P>
<P>
   Today, performance and ethics seem more closely interwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the companies that are proactive in doing good are
performing better,'' says Dana Giacchetto, president of Cassandra
Group, the trendy financial management company that counts DiCaprio
and Diaz among its youthful Hollywood clients. ``General Electric
has shed a lot of defense and chemical units, while companies like
Philip Morris have been hurt. There are not a lot of people who
want to start pounding the table about why cigarettes are good for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many ethically enlightened firms are now doing well,
some investors still want to goose their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People put together a portfolio they consider to be socially
or environmentally responsible and enhance their returns by using
futures on the market itself _ S&AMP;P futures,'' says Andrew Malloy, a
partner in Tag Associates, which managed the money of the late Time
Warner chairman Steve Ross. ``To the extent that the market pushes
well ahead of the companies in the portfolio, you have a side door
exposure to the market itself. There are a lot of sneaky ways to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, PC investing offers protesters a voice where it
really counts: in the boardroom. Two cases in point: The Domini
Social Equity Fund has been urging Johnson &AMP; Johnson to improve
standards at its Mexican factories while Trillium believes its
vocal objection to Home Depot's practice of buying timber from old
growth forests persuaded the company to change its position.

   CHANGERS OF OUR WORLD _ Not a week passes that most of us do not
encounter some attempt by the media to determine the most important
person, group or event of the 20th century, writes columnist Bill
Maxwell. ``While studying change in the 20th century, I realized,
obviously, that change has been the most important phenomenon
throughout history,'' he writes. ``Which group, then, has been
responsible for the world's most significant changes?'' His answer:
Young people. In this timely commentary, Maxwell offers a selection
of extraordinary individuals from several epochs who, while still
in their youth, contributed to the evolution of society.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S WAR OF HYPOCRISY. Twenty years ago, columnist James
Garcia and his girlfriend were decorating their Christmas tree in a
rented farmhouse in rural Indiana when they heard a knock at the
door. It was the police. Garcia was arrested for selling five grams
of cocaine to a friend-turned-police-informant and went to prison.
``I tell you all this because I want to talk about the hypocrisy of
America's `War on Drugs,''' Garcia writes. ``Over the course of the
past 20 years I have concluded that the government's escalating
battle to keep people from consuming illegal drugs has been a
miserable failure.'' Why? For one thing, America's ``War on Drugs''
demonizes an activity that our society also glorifies. ``Alcohol is
a drug,'' Garcia writes. '' ... Sell someone a beer and they'll
make a television sitcom glorifying your profession. Remember
`Cheers'? But sell someone a joint and you'll go to prison.''

   PUERTO RICO: THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. From the New World's oldest
Spanish landmarks to water sports, natural attractions, luxury
accommodations, delicious dining and nightlife in the best Latin
tradition, Puerto Rico offers an exciting vacation choice for
Hispanic executives, writes Barbara Beckley in this feature from
Hispanic Business. For history buffs, the capital city of San Juan
is the story of Spain in the New World from beginning to end _ from
Christopher Columbus' landfall in 1493 through 1898, when Spain's
flag came down at the end of the Spanish-American War. Beckley
lists must-see tourist sights as well as the most popular nighttime
haunts. One color slide of The Castillo de San Cristobal, which is
mentioned in the story, is available electronically.

<P>
   EDUCATION NEEDED TO COMBAT ILLEGAL USE OF PEYOTE. Columnist
Karen Lincoln Michel is a member of the Native American Church of
Wisconsin. As part of her religious belief, she uses the peyote
cactus _ classified as a hallucinogenic drug in this country _ in
the manner that Catholics use sacramental wine. Mainstream America
misunderstands this way of worship. But there is another kind of
disregard toward Michel's beliefs. This time it is Native-Americans
themselves who are the perpetrators. Nonbelievers, mainly Navajo
teens, reportedly have been using peyote in the way some people
take recreational drugs. Many church leaders and their followers
blame themselves for failing to educate their own people about the
significance of peyote as a holy medicine.
</P>
<P>
   THE TROUBLE WITH STEREOTYPING. Columnist Akilah Monifa discuses
the race-based tipping incident that occurred on Oct. 23 in the
Thai Toni restaurant in Miami. An African-American couple had a
15-percent gratuity added to their bill, while a white couple did
not. The only posted notice of automatic gratuity applied to
parties of five or more. When the couple inquired about the bill,
the owner, Hiromi ``Toni'' Takarada, said it was added because
``blacks don't tip well.'' Bob Butterworth, Florida's attorney
general, filed a lawsuit against Takarada, which was settled for a
$15,000 fine. Takarada also agreed to sensitivity training for
himself and his staff. ``This was a case of differential treatment.
And for all who do not like the so-called `race card' being played,
I would query them as to what they think the reason was for the
differential treatment,'' Monifa writes.

15-percent gratuity added to their bill, while a white couple did
not. The only posted notice of automatic gratuity applied to
parties of five or more. When the couple inquired about the bill,
the owner, Hiromi ``Toni'' Takarada, said it was added because
``blacks don't tip well.'' Bob Butterworth, Florida's attorney
general, filed a lawsuit against Takarada, which was settled for a
$15,000 fine. Takarada also agreed to sensitivity training for
himself and his staff. ``This was a case of differential treatment.
And for all who do not like the so-called `race card' being played,
I would query them as to what they think the reason was for the
differential treatment,'' Monifa writes.

   CHANGERS OF OUR WORLD _ Not a week passes that most of us do not
encounter some attempt by the media to determine the most important
person, group or event of the 20th century, writes columnist Bill
Maxwell. ``While studying change in the 20th century, I realized,
obviously, that change has been the most important phenomenon
throughout history,'' he writes. ``Which group, then, has been
responsible for the world's most significant changes?'' His answer:
Young people. In this timely commentary, Maxwell offers a selection
of extraordinary individuals from several epochs who, while still
in their youth, contributed to the evolution of society.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S WAR OF HYPOCRISY. Twenty years ago, columnist James
Garcia and his girlfriend were decorating their Christmas tree in a
rented farmhouse in rural Indiana when they heard a knock at the
door. It was the police. Garcia was arrested for selling five grams
of cocaine to a friend-turned-police-informant and went to prison.
``I tell you all this because I want to talk about the hypocrisy of
America's `War on Drugs,''' Garcia writes. ``Over the course of the
past 20 years I have concluded that the government's escalating
battle to keep people from consuming illegal drugs has been a
miserable failure.'' Why? For one thing, America's ``War on Drugs''
demonizes an activity that our society also glorifies. ``Alcohol is
a drug,'' Garcia writes. '' ... Sell someone a beer and they'll
make a television sitcom glorifying your profession. Remember
`Cheers'? But sell someone a joint and you'll go to prison.''

   PUERTO RICO: THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. From the New World's oldest
Spanish landmarks to water sports, natural attractions, luxury
accommodations, delicious dining and nightlife in the best Latin
tradition, Puerto Rico offers an exciting vacation choice for
Hispanic executives, writes Barbara Beckley in this feature from
Hispanic Business. For history buffs, the capital city of San Juan
is the story of Spain in the New World from beginning to end _ from
Christopher Columbus' landfall in 1493 through 1898, when Spain's
flag came down at the end of the Spanish-American War. Beckley
lists must-see tourist sights as well as the most popular nighttime
haunts. One color slide of The Castillo de San Cristobal, which is

   EDUCATION NEEDED TO COMBAT ILLEGAL USE OF PEYOTE. Columnist
Karen Lincoln Michel is a member of the Native American Church of
Wisconsin. As part of her religious belief, she uses the peyote
cactus _ classified as a hallucinogenic drug in this country _ in
the manner that Catholics use sacramental wine. Mainstream America
misunderstands this way of worship. But there is another kind of
disregard toward Michel's beliefs. This time it is Native-Americans
themselves who are the perpetrators. Nonbelievers, mainly Navajo
teens, reportedly have been using peyote in the way some people
take recreational drugs. Many church leaders and their followers
blame themselves for failing to educate their own people about the
significance of peyote as a holy medicine.

   THE TROUBLE WITH STEREOTYPING. Columnist Akilah Monifa discuses
the race-based tipping incident that occurred on Oct. 23 in the
Thai Toni restaurant in Miami. An African-American couple had a
15-percent gratuity added to their bill, while a white couple did
not. The only posted notice of automatic gratuity applied to

TRIM YOUR TREE LIKE THE PROS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some tips that should help as you branch out into
Christmas tree decorating like the pros:
</P>
<P>
   Before choosing a tree, measure the height and width of the
space where it'll stand, figuring a tree topper or angel will take
up an additional 12 inches. Also check to make sure there's an
electrical outlet nearby.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to set up your tree weeks ahead of Christmas, an
artificial tree _ which won't dry out and pose a fire danger _ is a
good choice. If you choose a live tree, use pruning shears or heavy
scissors to make it into the shape you like. Trim a few branches
off the bottom near the back to make it easier to add water to the
tree stand.
</P>
<P>
   Set up your tree, then decorate it in layers, depending on the
look you want. Start with lights, then add fake snow, ribbons,
specialty decorations, garland, ornaments, bows and sprays of
greenery, pine cones, fruit or flowers, in that order. Un-decorate
it in reverse order.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using ribbon, let the ribbon guide you in its
placement, advises Dr. Christmas partner Bob Pranga. ''People are
afraid to let it flow and turn the way it naturally would,'' he
said. ''They pull it too tight, tie it too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Artificial trees generally require more lights to look as lush
as a live tree. Dr. Christmas' rule of thumb for either is
generally to use three strings of 100 lights for each foot of tree
height. To decide if they're place properly, ''Step back and look
at the tree with your eyes crossed, Christmas partner Debi Staron.
Wherever you see a dark spot, you could use more lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Plug in lights before putting them on the tree so you can make
sure they work and see which bulbs need replacing. Before hooking
strings of lights together, check the label on the box for limits
on how many it's safe to link. Don't wrap the tree with lights like
a maypole; instead decorate in triangles, from top to bottom,
making light removal easier. Lights should be placed deep within
the branches, as well as at the tips, to give the tree a
three-dimensional look. To keep lights from tangling from year to
year, roll them into a ball (starting with the non-plug end) to
store, then unroll them like rolling out a yo-yo next year.
</P>
<P>
   Place unbreakable ornaments low on the tree to safeguard small
children or pets. And if you're worried that a rambunctious child
or inquisitive pet might topple the tree, use nearly invisible
fishline wound high up around the trunk or sturdy branches and
anchored to a couple of nails hammered into an inconspicuous spot
to keep the tree upright.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, if you're using an artificial tree, you can
remove other decorations, but leave the lights in place, and store
the tree _ protected with old bedsheets or plastic trash bags _ in
a protected spot.
</P>
<P>
   For a 75-minute tape of tree decorating how-tos, call Dr.
Christmas at (310) 854-0886. Tapes cost $14.95.

DR. CHRISTMAS FIXES YULETIDE FOR THE WELL-HEELED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(eds: see sidebar DR-CHRISTMAS-TIPS) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Garland, ribbons, strings of beads, fake snow.
Just what the doctor ordered _ Dr. Christmas, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the doctor is the yuletide decorator to the rich and
famous, or just the busy and overworked who are willing to pay more
than most families spend on their entire Christmas gift list to
have a crew of ``elves'' add a Christmasy touch to the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will hire us to do everything but the tree,'' said
Debi Staron, 41, half of the Sherman Oaks-based Dr. Christmas team.
``They really like to do the tree themselves, usually with their
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there are people who would rather sit and drink cappucino
and _ poof! It's all up. And we come back and take it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The taking-it-down part is really important to some people,''
said Bob Pranga, 38, who founded Dr. Christmas in 1984. ``As long
as they don't have to untangle the lights or put away the
ornaments, they're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And happy is what the season _ and the decorating _ is all
about. Walk into a home after Dr. Christmas' crew has worked its
magic and you'd swear Santa himself had paid a visit. Mirrors
reflect bowls of shiny ornaments, lights bounce off polished
floors, mantles are swathed in greenery and ribbon, and Christmas
trees _ sometimes three or four to a household _ sparkle with
everything from faux diamonds and pearls to the most cherished of
family-heirloom ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christmas' trees are usually swathed in wide ribbon _
Pranga's own special touch _ and often feature some pretty pricey
stuff on the branches. But while the decorating team has its own
ideas, what you feel comfortable with is the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People show us their ornaments and say, `Do you like this?'''
said Staron. ``My answer is always, `Do you like it? If you like
it, we like it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christmas has decorated trees for dozens of Hollywood stars,
including Bob Hope, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Goldie Hawn and
Diane Keaton, plus studio executives, corporations, stores and
politicians like former President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But while business is booming now, the firm got started more or
less by accident.
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing an acting career in New York in the 1980s, Pranga
got a part-time job helping to put up holiday decorations at Macy's
department store. Soon shoppers were commenting on his yuletide
finery.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was actress Mia Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she wished somebody would do that (decorating) at her
home, so I thought, `Why not?''' said Pranga, who's had no
professional training as a decorator. Farrow's friends began to ask
him to decorate their homes for the holidays, and after meeting
Debi Staron in an acting class, the two formed the business that
continued to grow by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really have a name,'' Pranga said. ``I was just
called the Christmas guy, as in, `The lights won't go on; call the
Christmas guy.' Then one of my clients said, `You're like Dr.
Christmas; you come and fix things.'''
</P>
<P>
   When they moved to California in 1989 to seek acting work, the
business partners' Hollywood contacts _ plus people who had seen
their decorating work in New York _ helped them build a client base
here.
</P>
<P>
   While Staron still is a working actress _ she often appears in
small parts in soap operas and in other TV roles _ Pranga pours
most of his drive into being Dr. Christmas, spending nine months of
the year planning, purchasing and decorating. While Pranga is the
designer, Staron is the business manager, and both decorate, aided
by about 10 paid workers. They also have three how-to videos for
people who can't afford a personal visit from Dr. Christmas, and
two more videos are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The Dr. Christmas team begins decorating in earnest in
mid-November, building to a frenzy in the last few weeks before the
holiday, delighting in the use of non-traditional colors and
materials. ``You can change a few things, go for a whole new look,
new colors, put it all together, and say, `Wow, that's
incredible,''' said Pranga.
</P>
<P>
   But a ``wow'' tree can be a pricey tree. Pranga estimates the
finest 7- foot artificial tree with showstopper lights and
ornaments costs about $1,500. One client hires Dr. Christmas not
only inside her house but to landscape the entire outside of her
mansion in lights.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the budget, Pranga and Staron say they'll work to
create a unique look that fits not only a family's home color
scheme, but to showcase a client's character, hobbies or work.
</P>
<P>
   Most female clients who hire Dr. Christmas expect to spend a
pretty penny on sprucing up their homes for the holidays. But their
husbands often suffer sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go into somebody's home to decorate a gorgeous tree, and
the husband will say something like, `Why do we need more than
three strings of lights?' and I just put 46 strings on it,'' Staron
said. ``Clients often say, `Use what you need, but hide the boxes.'
They're afraid their husbands will have a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, the stars love a little _ or a lot of _
glitter at holiday time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Hope has every ornament he has ever had, and he wants them
all on the tree,'' Staron said. ``It's a very homey tree ... with
the grandkids' handprints and Styrofoam balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Andy Garcia is also traditional and hires Dr. Christmas to
do all the decorating except the tree. ``He's very family-oriented
and likes to do the tree with his wife and daughters,'' said
Staron.
</P>
<P>
   Soap-opera star Kristian Alfonso has a tree with a Renaissance
feel, all pearls and velvet, and Candice Bergen has Christmas trees
in both front and back yards, as well as inside the house. And
Carrie Fisher, a year-after-year client, will go along with
whatever ideas Dr. Christmas comes up with, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Once all the decorating is done, about Dec. 20, Pranga continues
to be on 24-hour call to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get home from work or a party at midnight and want to
have a drink and sit and look at the Christmas tree,'' Pranga said,
``and I'll get this call, `The tree won't light.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stars Dr. Christmas has decorated for have signed
boxes of ornaments Christmas lovers can bid on through Dec. 18 on
the Internet at www.unific.com; proceeds go to the stars' favorite
charities. &QL;

NO EASY ANSWERS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayors have a tough job. They have to set a tone
for a city at the same time they set parking fines. They have to
symbolize a city while they make sure the streets are swept.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly hard in San Francisco, a city where nowadays
some leave their hearts but more leave their waste.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors have to represent all the people, no matter their
politics, while sitting in an office where petty political types
constantly arrive wanting something. Mayors have to take unending
guff from everyone.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 U.S. Mayor's Conference demonstrators chanting
for higher workfare pay surrounded Mayor Willie Brown. Mayor Thomas
Menino of Boston turned to me and said, ``Congressmen don't have
this. Senators don't have this. We have this.''
</P>
<P>
   We, in turn, have to live with mayors, ride their buses and step
over their failed social policies in the streets. That's why we're
so picky about mayors.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans are facing two less than perfect choices for
mayor, even though they come on strong as symbols. The following
are a few questions to focus voters' minds before Tuesday's
election.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who do you want as mayor if there's an earthquake? There's
going to be an earthquake. It's just a matter of when.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who he wanted as mayor when the Earth moves, a friend
said, ``Er, Dianne Feinstein?''
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Art Agnos attending to the nouveaux homeless at the
Marina Middle School. The 1989 earthquake was Agnos' finest moment
as mayor. San Francisco wasn't well prepared for the quake, but
afterward Agnos and his wife, Sherry, were all over town pitching
in. Later Agnos successfully twisted the arm of the Red Cross to
hand over the millions it collected in the name of San Francisco
but stashed in its general fund.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating either Willie Brown or Tom Ammiano, the
president of the governing Board of Supervisors, as the better
choice for earthquake preparedness, as if they were different
brands of batteries. I'm just saying think about it, because no
poll will tell you when the Big One will hit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who do you want as mayor when the recession hits?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dot-commers probably aren't old enough to remember
recessions, but we had one way back when Windows 3 was challenging
the Macintosh SE and Bill Clinton was a governor of a backwater
state.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a recession, kids. Stocks do not eternally go up,
e-commerce is just a big Sears catalog and San Francisco is not
always flush with money.
</P>
<P>
   The big issue in the 1991 run-off election between Agnos and
Frank Jordan was the city's budget deficit and what Agnos was going
to do about it. Recall that Agnos was the one who took a bath in
that election.
</P>
<P>
   Is Willie Brown or Tom Ammiano the man to have in City Hall when
programs, jobs and pay have to be cut? That's a tough question. Is
either the man to raise taxes? That's a somewhat easier question.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown administration has been blessed with budget surpluses,
much of which went into new city employees who'll have to be paid
when San Francisco goes broke _ or has a ``budget shortfall,'' as
mayors in free fall call them.
</P>
<P>
   It might be fun to see Brown do some unspending. Otherwise
recessions are no fun. You may lose your job. You get fewer
services. And even with a slumped economy the price of San
Francisco housing doesn't go down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's your choice of symbol? Sure, we shouldn't care about
mayors as symbols. They're in the pothole business. But they are
symbols, and this election is loaded with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's workers are calling new voters and asking them if they
want to make history. There's a feeling of crusade to Ammiano's
campaign that's invigorating in a city where bohemians are being
pushed out by newcomers in cars from Bavaria, and the demand for
social change has been replaced by a demand for spare change.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a living symbol of a certain stylish San Francisco,
whether you love him or hate him. And the farther away you get, the
better he looks. When he heard that Brown had been forced into a
runoff, my dad back East said, ``You're not getting rid of your
mayor, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   You have to answer those questions yourself, while you sort
though all those well-chewed questions about housing, leadership
and cronyism, and ask your pocketbook the obvious question of
whether Ammiano or Brown will do it the least damage.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the election will come down to the economic issues
of jobs, pay, rents and taxes. This election may be between two men
the rest of the nation would consider Bolsheviks, but the old
Reagan question still applies. Are you better off now than you were
four years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano and Brown have added one more question to Reagan's,
though: Do you fear what will happen to you in the next four years?
</P>
<P>

COPING WITH HOLIDAY GRIEF
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: this is a sidebar to SURVIVING-GRIEF-FEATURE) 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holidays can be especially hard on people grappling with the
loss of a loved one. Here are a few suggestions to ease the burden:
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel guilty. Grief is natural.
</P>
<P>
   Share memories about the person who died. Tell the stories
behind Christmas ornaments and the role the deceased played in
making those memories.
</P>
<P>
   Make a photo album or memory book about the loved one and share
it.
</P>
<P>
   If a family tradition is too painful, change it. If the
tradition is comforting, keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Take time for yourself. A little solitude is a good time to
renew strength.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to tell others what you want. Friends and
relatives may not know what to do or say, so it's best to let them
know what makes you most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Encourage children to draw pictures and create gifts inspired by
their memories of the deceased to give to others.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the loved one's favorite food to a meal. Mention their
name in the blessing, or propose a toast to their memory. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ This Christmas will be tough for Lindsey Nakatani.
While other kids at her elementary school are making holiday crafts
for their parents, Lindsey is wrestling with powerful emotions that
can even paralyze adults _ the first Christmas since the death of
her father.
</P>
<P>
   George Makoto Nakatani was only 36 when he died on Jan. 11,
1999. The loss hit his wife, Lalida, 36, hard, and their daughter
Lindsey, 6, even harder. She is the only child among the 350
students at her Santa Monica elementary school who has lost a
parent to death. At an age where fitting in is crucial, Lindsey had
no one to relate to _ until her mom found Our House.
</P>
<P>
   Our House offers grief counseling for children and adults. For
Lindsey, the nonprofit counseling center provides a place to meet
with other kids who lost a close relative and to learn to live with
the pain of losing her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss you so much and Merry Christmas,'' Lindsey writes to
her father in an arts and crafts exercise that helps her express
the feelings. It's a lot easier to talk about ``Toy Story 2'' or
horseback riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first session was terrible,'' admits her mother. ``I had
to practically drag her in there. She came running out and and
said, `Every kid in there lost a father!' Now she runs right back
there. She loves Our House.''
</P>
<P>
   Our House co-founder Hilary Cohen, a licensed clinical social
worker, had kids like Lindsey in mind when she opened the first
center in West Los Angeles six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people tend to think that children don't understand at
that age, that they don't need to talk about it,'' Cohen said.
``It's hard working with that age group. But when you listen to
them talk, you know they are deeply affected by it. They do grieve
at that age.''
</P>
<P>
   Our House offers an alternative to one-on-one therapy, a chance
to bond with others who are struggling with the same flood of
grief. Clients range from seniors struggling with the loss of a
life partner to 3-year-olds coping with the loss of a sibling.
Sessions, broken down into age groups, typically cost $20, though
people who can't afford that can pay as little as $1. About 150
people a month attend counseling sessions. Each group is led by a
social worker or licensed therapist, who is assisted by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough demand for this type of counseling that Our
House opened an office in Woodland Hills on Dec. 2. The second
office was paid for with a grant from the June Ebensteiner Hospice
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other groups that meet in institutional settings (even
funeral homes), Our House strives to create an atmosphere that
feels more like a living room, comfy chairs, warm lighting, teddy
bears and plenty of tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted people to feel comfortable,'' Cohen said. ``We're
not doing therapy here, it's a support center. We like to make that
distinction, because just because you're grieving doesn't mean you
need therapy. We talk to people about the fact this isn't something
you get over, it's something you incorporate into your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sessions aren't for everyone, though. While Lalida Nakatani
thinks the world of what Our House has done for her daughter, she
found the adult sessions too depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't help me as much,'' said Nakatani, who found comfort
in a support network of friends. ``I didn't feel comfortable with
my group. It's different for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people _ especially kids _ find it helpful to spend
time with people who can relate. They often come back to help
counsel others.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions are not always touchy feely. There are boxing
gloves in the playroom so angry children can take out their
frustrations on bean bags. And much of the artwork on the walls
reveals raw emotion and real pain.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl writes about the jealousy she feels at seeing kids
with two parents. A teen boy uses magazine headlines to express his
feelings _ ``pain, I am very, very angry, life is harsh.'' A little
girl cuts out a bright red felt heart, then fills the middle with
blackness. Another girl describes grief like a ``knife stabbing
into my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with a lot of emotions through art _ that's where a
lot of it comes out,'' Cohen said. One child, asked to describe the
funeral of her father, put a felt cutout of a car in the coffin
with her daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked her, 'Why is there a car in the coffin?' and she
said, 'When my daddy died, we had to sell his car, and in his car
was my car seat, and I miss riding in the car seat with him,'''
Cohen said. ``To an adult, that would be no big deal. But to a kid,
this was their world, this was important to them. A kid would never
just be able to sit down and say, 'I really miss riding in the car
with my dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holidays and death anniversaries are always toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time when everybody's together,'' Cohen said. ``The
first time people go into a holiday without a loved one, we talk to
them about how they are going to handle it. We try to get people
not to ignore it, to do something to acknowledge it's not just like
any other day.'' &QL;

Our House maintains offices at 22030 Clarendon St. in Woodland
Hills and 1964 Westwood Blvd. in West Los Angeles, but it's best to
call before dropping in. Call (818) 592-4080 for the San Fernando
Valley office or (310) 475-0299 for West Los Angeles. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ To Eastern European peasants arriving at Ellis
Island, America seemed the land of milk and honey, a country so
sweetly succulent you might dream of breaking off a piece and
scarfing it down whole.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, of course, was that for most of the wretched
refuse, those goodies were effectively off-limits: In money-hungry
turn-of-the-century America, newcomers were as likely to be eaten
as to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Director James Robinson has taken this idea as the backdrop and
subtext for his exceptionally clever, if inconsistently served
production of Engelbert Humperdinck's ``Hansel und Gretel,'' an
opera that braces its sugary folk melodies with several good jolts
of Wagnerian moodiness. While the power of the bilingual singing
(German and English) falls measurably short of Robinson's
directorial boldness, the cumulative effect of this cinematically
fluid co-production with New York City Opera is exhilarating, like
a glucose rush to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the action in Manhattan, circa 1890, Robinson turns
Gretel (Australian soprano Clare Gormley in her Los Angeles Opera
debut) and her brother (mezzo-soprano Paula Rasmussen) into a pair
of Lower East Side tenement-dwellers eager to taste the good life
in their adopted home.
</P>
<P>
   Smartly condensed into two acts, the production opens in the
children's cramped hovel, cropped to claustrophobic proportions by
John Conklin's set design. Later it expands to encompass the wilds
of Central Park and the Witch's home, envisioned here as a
monstrous Victorian mansion eerily lined with Lewis Hine-style
photographs of ``missing'' children. The spectacle, which is given
an old-fangled, stereopticon cast by lighting designer Paul
Palazzo, grows bigger as the siblings' imaginative quest enlarges
from naturalism to fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Though vocally less full-bodied than might be hoped for, at
least on opening night, both Gormley and Rasmussen are singers with
distinct personalities and strong actors to boot. Gormley, looking
feral and gaunt, slightly oversells Gretel's twitchy eccentricity
but successfully gets across her vulnerability, while the more
relaxed Rasmussen demonstrates an impressively wide if vocally
understated emotional range.
</P>
<P>
   They unite in affecting harmony in their duet that precedes the
famous Dream Pantomime. Robinson re-imagines this lovely orchestral
sequence's 14 angels as genteel middle-class Anglo-Saxon New
Yorkers, attired all in white benevolent spirits who nonetheless
stay aloof from the grubby Old World arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   The production also transforms the Sandman into a raggedy
street-lamp lighter (Megan Dey-Toth delivers the graceful aria)
while preserving the Dew Fairy (Catherine Ireland) more or less as
written.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given its imaginative pluck, the production misses
some chances to engage its audience emotionally. While baritone
John Atkins and soprano Lesley Leighton bring domestic-comedy gusto
to their roles as the children's parents, Judith Christin
underplays the Witch's creepy-campy possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   More distracting, when Hansel and Gretel turn the tables on the
Witch, the triumphant serenade of newly liberated children,
performed by the Los Angeles Children's Chorus, was faint to the
point of being inaudible, leaving at least this viewer's
heartstrings unplucked.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor William Vendice and his orchestra impart some
appropriately mongrelized shadings to the score's pastoral Teutonic
colors. For all its sophistication, the production stays admirably
true to the fairy-tale heart of the matter, while conveying the
holiday reminder that, even in fat times, there are plenty of lean
among us. &QL;

THERE'S TIME TO CATCH UP AFTER A LATE INVESTING START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I started my investing late in life. I am a 49-year-old woman
who sells real estate and my income can vary quite a bit from year
to year. My net income usually falls between $80,000 and $110,000
at this point in my career. I now have a savings program that
includes $200 a month to Fidelity Asset Manager fund, where I have
$19,461, and $200 a month to Fidelity Fund, where the balance is
$6,084. I have SEP-IRAs of $6,782 in Fidelity Equity Income and
$8,049 in Fidelity Spartan Market Index. I add $5,000 a year to the
SEP-IRAs. I don't necessarily picture myself retiring at age 65,
but I would like to have the financial resources to slow down if I
so chose. In some articles, you seem to lean toward Vanguard funds.
As you can see, I am invested in Fidelity funds. Should I diversify
into different funds, or do all the companies offer similar
packages? I honestly don't know what you mean by large-cap and
mid-cap etc., but would like to have an evaluation of my financial
status. I like to keep liquid funds in an asset-manager-type fund
for easy access since my income fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Lake Oswego, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since you started investing le, you need to concentrate more
intensely on building these accounts, which will probably b the
bedrock of your financial stability whenever you retire.
</P>
<P>
   At your current savings rate (and presuming there are no
withdrawals from the Asset Manager account) you would have an
accumulation of $553,990 at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Without even factoring in the effects of inflation on that pool,
it will clearly be inadequate to support a comfortable retirement,
given your current income levels. The main thing you need to do is
save more.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion that frequently works for people such as yourself
who hve variable income streams is to set a certain point as your
expected annual earnings, and then contribute a heavier percentage
of your income to savings during the years when you pass that
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, you budgeted yourself so you could live on
$90,000 a year, including the current $9,800 that goes into
savings. You might then decide that a certain percentage _ or all _
of the earnings that you make in excess of that level go into
savings.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have any particular argument with your fund choices,
although the portfolio could certainly be more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   First, I suggest that since you are using the Asset Manager
account more or less as an emergency pool, I would move to a more
conservative sibling of this fund, which is the Asset Manager
Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   Like Asset Manager, this fund spreads its investments among
stocks, bonds, and cash, but Asset Manager Income puts about 80
percent of its assets in cash and bonds, compared with about 47
percent for Asset Manager.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I sugest you look at your historical earnings trend and
decide what might be a prudent level at which this account could be
topped out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the level is $25,000, I'd continue with the
current contributions util you reach that level, and then transfer
the $200 monthly contributions to the Fidelity Fund account, or
another mutual fund holding. If a bad sales season subsequently
causes the Asset Manager Income balance to fall below $25,000 or
whatever target you have set, you could then resume contributions
until you get back to the benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   The terms large-cap, mid-cap, and so forth refer to he size of
the companies that dominate a funds portfolio. For example, all of
the funds you hold have large-cap portfolios. Cap here refers to
market capitalization, which is the value of all of the shares of a
company's stock that are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   If this value exceeds $5 billion, it's considered a large-cap
company; if the market value of all of a company's shares fall
between $1 billion and $5 billion, it's considered a mid-cap
company; if the total value of all shares is below $1 billion, it's
a small-cap company.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the large-cap market has been the place to be.
But the stock markets go through various cycles, and the common
wisdom is that the mid- and small-cap categories will have their
day and catch up, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a well-diversified portfolio is usually dominated by the
relatively stable large-cap companies, but also holds smaller
positions in the mid- and small-cap sectors. Staying within
Fidelity, for example, you might look at Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock
fund or Fidelity OTC fund to give y some exposure to that sector.
The first is solid and more cautions; the second more aggessive,
and thus far has rewarded its owners more lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   In the small-cap arena, Fidelity isn't particularly attractive.
Two nice funds, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock and Fidelity Small-Cap
Stock, are closed to new investors. Fidelity Small Cap Selector
seems to be proving little but that the small-cap arena does not
lend itself well to computer-aided stock picking.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I do tend to favor Vanguard funds, but that is basically
a reflection of my cautious approach to investing. Vanguard's
strong points are very low expenses and plain-vanilla approaches to
building portfolios, most clearly demonstrated in its wide array of
index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, on the other hand, prides itself on the
stock-selecting prowess of its many talented portfolio managers.
Recent years have been kind to the index approach, but many believe
that as markets get choppier the most talented and prescient fund
managers will return to the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to believe that with Fidelity you are going
any waybut first class _ and the same can be said for many other
fund families.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are 63 and 64 years old and retired. We have $55,557
invested in these American mutual funds _ New Perspective, American
Mutual, Capital World Growth and Income, and Washington Mutual. We
also have $10,000 in a Nuveen fund, $50,000 in n annuity, and
$20,000 in deferred compensation that will be paid out next year.
We recently sold a property in Colorado and need to invest
approximately $30,000. My husband wants to add to the American
Funds portfolio. I think we need to try another fund. Our bank
account has more than $100,000 in it, so we are in a hurry to t it
down. Can you help us make a decision? We also own our own home,
with a $40,00 mortgage balance. Our combined monthly income is
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Carlsbad, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I tend to agree with your husband. You certainly could do a
lot worse than adding to the American Funds portfolio, which is
entirely made up of solid, fairly conservatively managed funds with
good long-term records.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to diversify, you might consider two American
offerings that are much riskier than the funds you hold. They are
American Century Heritage and American Century Vista.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have quite poor records over most ofthe last half
of this decade, new managers have posted very strong 1999 results.
Heritage is up 34.29 percent year to date, while Vista has produced
an eye-popping 81.22 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Both seem attractive candidates at this point, although if you
were to add $30,000 to the American Funds portfolio, I'd put no
more than $5,000 of it in one or both of these.
</P>
<P>
   With all of that cash loafing at the bank, why not pay off your
mortgage? With such a cash surplus, your income probably exceeds
your expenses. By prepaying the mortgage, you could then take the
amount you were formerly paying to the bank and begin a
dollar-cost-averaging program into the American Funds portfolio,
building it still further to protect you against inflation in the
later years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 42-year-old woman. Last year I opened a 403(b)
account, which now is worth $1,400, all invested in Fidelity Blue
Chip Growth fund. I contribute $150 biweekly. I would like to
retire at age 65. Is ving all of my money in one fund a good idea?
Should I diversify? Is my contribution eough?
</P>
<P>
   H.I., Randolph, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fidelity Blue Chip Growth is certainly a first-rate fund,
with a long and enviable track record. But you should diversify so
that you have small percentages of your money in other market
sectors. If you send me a list of the options open to you through
the 403(b), I'll be happy to make some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to calculate whether you are saving enough. Your
retirement savings represent 9.75 percent of your earnings, which
is a pretty typical level. If your investments earned 10 percent
average annual returns for the next 23 years and you continued
contributing at the current level, you would have $336,982 by age
65.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to combine that with your husband's retirement
assets to determine if you will have a satisfactory level of
savings at that point.

   11 1/2 ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' ``Saturday Night Live''
alum Rob Schneider stars as a hapless, mild-mannered fish-tank
cleaner whom fate forces to moonlight as a gigolo. A smorgasbord of
bizarre dates and gross-out humor ensues _ a web of bathroom jokes
and stock antics along the lines of executive-producer Adam
Sandler's usual fare. But thanks to sprint-like pacing and
Schneider's likability, this 85-minute film is as short and sweet
as it is stupid. (R) (Joan Anderman) &QL; 
 &QL; 
111 ``The Green Mile'' ``Shawshank Redemption'' writer-director
Frank Darabont goes back to prison with Stephen King and scores
again with an involving story about supernatural happenings shaking
up the grisly routine on a Louisiana prison death row in 1935. Tom
Hanks's humane guard reacts with increasing awe to Michael Clarke
Duncan's saintly giant, whom Hanks just can't believe is a killer.
(R)

   (FR) 111 ``Liberty Heights'' As he did in ``Diner,'' ``Tin
Men,'' and ``Avalon,'' Barry Levinson returns to the 1950s
Baltimore of his youth, this time with more focus on societal
context and currents. The characters thus seem more like historical
markers and in some ways less idiosyncratic than in his earlier
films, but Levinson's canvas is broader and more deeply evocative
of time and place than ever, which is the most moving thing about
the film. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
111 1/2 ``Tumbleweeds'' A fresh, exhilarating mother-daughter story
starring Janet McTeer as a mom whose reflexive coquettishness keeps
getting her in trouble, but never so much so that she leaves her
daughter feeling unloved; a spunky performance by Kimberly J. Brown
creates a daughter who believably wonders when they're going to
stop fleeing her mom's soured romances. (PG-13)

PASHMINA'S STARTING TO GET HER GOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is ashmina all it's cracked up to be, the rarest of rare
fabrics, harvested only from the chins and bellies of a particular
kind of scarce Himalayan goat that lives at very high altitudes? Or
is pashmina merely cashmere by another name?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that's been keeping me up nights, wondering and
worrying. I don't move in pashmina circles, but I just hate it when
anybody tries to pull the wool, or whatever, over the eyes of the
cashmere class.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the pashmina controversy end?
</P>
<P>
   That was a rhetorical question, but I wouldn't be surprised to
pick up a shopping circular one of these Sundays and read: ``Who
Wants to Look Like a Millionaire? Warm and Fashionable Pashmina 80
Percent Off Upscale Store Prices . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Pashmina is cashmere, period. That's the official word from the
Boston-based Cashmre and Camel Hair Manufacturer's Institute. That
organization has issued a press release stating that pashmina isn't
``necessarily finer than other types of cashmere, nor does it have
any distinguishing characteristics other than those normally
associated with cashmere.''
</P>
<P>
   Pashmina, the release continued, is a term derived from an
Indian word for cashmere. Pashmina is not a legally recognized term
for describing fabric content. ``In its current usage, this is
marketing terminology intended apparently to capitalize on a fad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fad or not, pashmina marches on, into American closets. It
emerged as a fashion status symbol last Christmas. Pashmina shawls
were harder to score than a Furby. Pash-mania was rampant in
Europe. Fashion magazines were full of beautiful people wrapped in
cash-mina, as some called it. The fabric was touted as finer,
softer, and warmer than cashmere, and also rarer, presumably
because of all the hairs from those goats' chinny-chin-chins, thus
pricier.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, fashion fans on this side of the Atlantic coveted
pashmina shawls, two or three of them in various colors. Money was
no object, and a good thing, too, because pashmina shawls were
going for as much as $1,000, if you could find any.
</P>
<P>
   This season, pashmina seems to have peaked as a status symbol.
It's now available to the masses, those who can afford to shell out
$200 to $800 for a shawl, and in these economically robust times
there are masses of those masses. Pashmina is everywhere,
advertised in magazines and catalogs and Internet shopping sites,
over the counter in Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Filene's, and
other stores greatnd small.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much pashmina now that I've been worrying about the
welfare of those bare-chinned, bald-bellied goats wandering around
in their chilly Himalayan pastures. Karl Spilhaus, president of the
cashmere institute, put my fears to rest. Cashmere is harvested
from the soft undercoat of the cashmere goat, the whole goat, he
said. The pashmina story _ the special goats, the chin and belly
hair _ is just that, a story, a marketing ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen pashmina close up, and felt it, too, I wonder what
all the fuss is about. It's nice, but no nicer than cashmere. But
then, it is cashmere. Recently the Wall Street Journal asked Dr.
Kenneth D. Langley, a professor of textile sciences at the
University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to put pashmina under a
microscope. He did, and pronounced it ``good ol' cashmere, nothing
special.'' Tell that to the goats.
</P>
<P>
   A word to the wealthy. Spilhaus says this is a good year to buy
cashmere (or whatever you call it). Prices are comparativelylow
because of last year's Asian economic crisis. They're still not low
enough for some of us. If you're looking for me, I'll be airing out
my old woolies and watching those shopping circulars.

IN ARIZONA, MCCAIN'S TACTICS SEEN AS POWER PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New Yok Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON

<P>
   (itals)``I was not a peron to suffer slights lightly.'' _
Senator John McCain, writing about his childhood in his
best-selling autobiography, ``Faith of My Fathers.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Eight years later, former mayor Paul Johnson still
shudders at the memory of his run-in with Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The two had disagreed on a federal land issue. It seemed to
Johnson a minor thing, an understandable dispute between
politicians with different interests. But then he attended a 1991
meeting on the matter in Washington with McCain and other Arizona
officeholders and learned that the senator, and would-be president,
is not a man to stifle a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   When it was his turn to speak, McCain shouted him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute, get a tape recorder. It's best to get a liar on
tape,'' McCain said, as the former mayor recalls it. When the
meeting ended, McCain blocked his exit in an effort to continue the
argument, though Johnson, at 6-foot-7, stands a head taller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me goose bumps to think about what he did for the
country,'' said Johnson, adding that he still admires the former
Vietnam POW who is now running for president. ``But after two years
as mayor, all I could think of was how to get out of his cross
hairs. To him, there are only two kinds of people, those on his
side and those who are his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCain was the subject of Time magazine's cover
story. His extraordinary courage during 5 / years in North
Vietnamese captivity and his witty, telegenic, and often
self-deprecating denunciations of governmental corruption have
struck a chord with voters, most notably in New Hampshire. And many
reporters are taken with his unscripted style. Suddenly, a party
that thought Texan George W. Bush had a vise-like grip on the GOP
nomination is starting to consider McCain as a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Arizona, some prominent Republicans echo the
concerns of the former Democratic mayor. Recent public notice about
McCain's temper, they believe, has obscured a larger issue voters
ought to ponder when they measure him against the demands of the
Oval Office: It is not so much the temper, they say, but what
prompts him to lose it: His frequent unwillingness to accommodate
dissenting views, even those of average citizens; his sometimes
bullying insistence that other politicians do his bidding; and his
tendency to treat those who disagree with him as disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   It is, perhaps, the central irony in the McCain story: A man who
built his political reputation around a maverick disdain for the
way things are done in Washington _ and a willingness to speak out
against settled interests, including those of his own party _ finds
it hard to stomch many challenges to his view of how things should
be done back home.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Former attorney general Grant Woods, once so close to McCain
that he is godfather to one of his children, no longer talks to
him, embittered by what he says were McCain's efforts to dictate
how he ran his office. Most memorable: A belligerent McCain, Woods
said, twice upbraided him for investigating allegations against
Governor Fife Symington, a McCain aly whose office Woods was
investigting for bid-rigging and who was later convicted of
fraudulent bsiness practices. McCain's overtures, in Woods's view,
bordered on being improper.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1993, McCain lost a battle against Phoenix and its Sky
Harbor Airport when his effort to win support for a new regional
airport was stymied. Almost immediately, McCain demanded two
federal investigations of the city airport, prompting charges he
was using his power to get back at his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1994, McCain's unswerving loyalty to an embattled Symington
_ and his bare-knuckle treatment of prominent Republicans who
didn't share his loyalty _ opened wounds in the state party that
have yet to heal. Symington's GOP challenger, among others, got a
tongue-lashing and what amounted to a threat from a top McCain
adviser. Some prominent Republicans who bucked Symington received
tax audit notices from the state, though there is no evidence
McCain was aware of the notices.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight on McCain's sometimes acrimonious dealings with
Arizona Republicans intensified when his feud with Governor Jane
Dee Hull recently broke into the open. Hull said heavy-handed
treatment of her by McCain and his staff included a demand that she
fire her own chief of staff. Hull is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats Jane Hull the way he treats a lot of people,'' one
of Hull's advisers said. ``The fact is, the senator gets very
heated about things. He's a control freak.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview, insisted that the home state sniping is
restricted to a tiny number of paty members in league with ``my
opponents,'' an apparent reference to the Bush campaign. He said
theassertions by Woods and Hull are unfounded, and McCain's
spokeswoman, Nancy Ives, said Johnson's account of the 1991 meeting
was false, although she said it was true that the senator had
``strongly disagreed'' with the then-mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was known as someone who clamped down, was divisive,was
dictatorial, I wouldn't have the highest approval ratings in my
state,'' said McCain, who has not had a primary opponent, or even a
serious general election opponent, since 1982. ``I've had
disagreements from time to time with people, but I am incredibly
proud of the intense loyalty that has been displayed toward me by
thousands of Republicans all over the state.''
</P>
<P>
   William D. McInturff, a Massachusetts native who is the McCain
campaign pollster, said much of the rancor can be attributed to the
everyday ``bump and grind'' of politics. Most of the actions
attributed to McCain and his aides, he said, would be considered
tame if they occurred in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of McCain's supporters, among them politicians
whose endorsement of his candidacy is prompted in part by fear of
his temper, say they wish the underlying discontent could be so
simply explained away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crisis, he's the calmest person in the room,'' said Lisa
Graham Keegan, the elected state superintendent of public
instruction, who supports McCain. But Keegan, who has experienced
McCain's anger, added, ``When he loses it, it's over the small
stuff. It's almost as if there's a magic word that no one knows,
but that when someone says it,it sets him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, unfavorable news coverage has sometimes provoked
McCain; he has publicly castigaed reporters as ``liars'' and
``idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Even bystanders say they have been browbeaten by McCain: Richard
Silverman, director of the Salt River Project, an Arizona utility,
was berated by McCain in the Senate dining room in 1994 after his
daughter, Amy Silverman, wrote unflattering pieces about McCain for
the Phoenix New Times, a weekly. Although McCain's recollection of
the incident was much more benign than the version told to the
Globe by an eyewitness, McCain nonetheless sent Silverman a letter
of apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of those letters floating around,'' one of the
senator's former aides said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a state where the politeness of everyday citizens can be as
refreshing as the dry desert air, the intensity and pugnaciousness
of McCain's involvement in state politics has been extraordinary,
particularly for a US senator. By most accounts, McCain has worked
hard to wrest control of the party away from social issues
conservatives _ while seeking to increase his own power at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   The state's senior senator even supports candidates in city
council races, and Republicans seeking legislative seats _
sometimes in primary fights against other Republicans. McCain's
loyalty to his friends has sometimes made him enemies. Moreover,
some elected officials who have crossed McCain have attracted
opponents encouraged by McCain and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, McCain and his longtime aide, Wes Gullett, used
pressure tactics in a fruitless attempt to head off a primary
challenge against Symington, who was opertng under an ethical cloud
at the time because of past business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Symington's GOP critics were ostracized. Symington's
GOP challenger, Barbara Barrett, received a stern dressing-down
from both men, and by several accounts, was threatened with
political retaliation. Another Republican officeholder, Sandra
Dowling, received the same treatment _ and also a McCain-backed
primary opponent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he's never threatened anyone. But Gullett, who was
Symington's chief of staff at the time, hinted that his own
treatment of Barrettwas not so gentle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't intend to threaten her, although she was mightily
offended,'' Gullett said. ``When I have a direct conversation with
people, they know they have had a direct conversation with me.''

MEDICAL-ERRORS ISSUE GOT HIGH-PROFILE PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happened back when he was playing tight end for Harvard. A
teammate's knee got mangled, then a prominent Boston surgeon
bungled te operation, cutting open the wrong knee before he finally
went to work on the right one. It's an experience that still haunts
the aging pass catcher, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Joseph Lieberman suspec he was a victim of medical
sloppiness 26 years ago, when he served in the Connecticut
Legislature. He was convalescing after having his appendix out when
an infection set in that kept him bedridden for three weeks. The
senator said he thinks the surgeon may not have washed his hands
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Wakefield found herself touched by medical errors even as
she was preparing a report on the topic for the prestigious
Institute of Medicine. Her 83-year-old mother was having an
operation on her left hand. Three hours later, Wakefield got a
subdued voice mail from the surgeon confessing that he had operated
on the wrong hand.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents suggest how common medical mistakes are, as well
as how disturbing the consequences can be. And the fact that they
are happening not just to some amorphous public, but to policy
makers, helps explain how the issue recently became America's most
talked about health-care crisis. Two weeks ago the institute issued
a blockbuster report that madeeadlines nationwide, last week
President Clinton ballyhooed it, and now legislators are tripping
over one another to hold hearings and claim credit even as they get
ready to head home for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the institute looking at research and data on
medical errors,at abstract issues, on Monday and Tuesday that week
of my mother's surgery,'' said Wakefield, who runs the Centerfor
Health Policy and Ethics at George Mason University. ``Then on
Thursday I'm experiencing them firsthand. It showed me how simple
(wrong-site surgery is) to prevent; you just put a mark on the
patients hnd.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical mistakes have been happening ever since doctors began
treating patients, although any discussion generally has taken
place behind the closed doors of doctors' conference rooms.
Understanding how the issue has been propelled into the spotlight
also can help explain how public opinion and public policy are
formulated in America today, especially when it comes to medicine
and science.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork was quietly laid in the last five years. Studies
at Harvard University and elsewhere showed that as many as 100,000
Americans die each year from hospital-related errors, more than
from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or suicide. And there
were highly publicized cases of people dying from errors, most
notably the fatal overdose of cancer-fighting chemicals that
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute gave in 1994 to Boston Globe health
columnist Betsy Lehman. As noted in the Boston Globe series titled
``Patients at Risk'' published earlier this year, hospitals have
been working to root out mistakes nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A broader movement is also under way across America in which
patients have been exercising their right to know about treatments
they were getting, to have a say in those therapies, and, most
important, to ensure they were not given the wrong dose of drugs,
that the correct joint was operated on, and they would not be
subjected to other common errors.
</P>
<P>
   What about the special interests that nip so many other budding
reforms?
</P>
<P>
   Reformers masterfully framed the issue to move it away from
blaming individual hospitals, doctors, and nurses, instead pointing
to flaws in the health system, such as having doctors write
prescriptions by hand when computers are available with built-in
errordetectors. The result: powerful organizations representing
doctors, nurses, and hospitals are sponsring error-reduction
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   All those developments made the issue ripe, but it needed a
boost to distinguish it from other issues competing for the
attention of the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Institute of Medicine, the nation's most prestigious
assemblage of doctors. Two weeks ago it issued a 223-page report
that gave policy makers everything they needed: a clear statement
of how widespread and deadly medical errors are and relatively easy
and inexpensive ways to cut the death rate in half over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Institute of Medicine has clout, people have to genuflect
to it,'' said Dr. Lucian Leape, the Harvard researcher whose 1994
study showed for the first time how widespread hospital errors are
and who was one of the authors of the Institute report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Institute didn't say anything a lot of us haven't been
saying for a long time. It wasn't what the report said, but who
said it,'' Leape said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was said also was key. The Institute report came out on
a slow enough news day, and it became the lead story in the New
York Times, the Washington Post, and USA Today, as well as on the
NBC and ABC evening news, and was featured on three networks'
morning news shows.
</P>
<P>
   All that attention was not lost on Clinton, who political
analysts said was eager to find a domestic issue where he could
grab the spotlight. He held a news conference last week announcing
that he was ordering federal agencies to do all they cn to end
medical errors. The day before that the president signed a bill
ordering the Agency for Healhcare Research and Quality to do
precisely the sort of research on medical errors called for by the
Institute of Medicine, and the following day, he again raised the
errors issue, this time during a news conference called to talk
about renewed peace negotiations between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Key membes of Congress, were also eager to participate,
especially since several of them had been pushing the issue long
before it caught the White House's attention and many had had
personal experience with medical mistakes. Senator Arlen Specter,
Republican of Pennsylvania, is holding a hearing on medical errors,
Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, hopes to hold one
in January, and Democratic Senators Kennedy and Lieberman have
echoed the calls for quick action.
</P>
<P>
   One question raised by the recent flurry of activity is why, if
the problem is pandemic and the fixes are so straightforward, has
it taken five years to move from evidence to action?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is half the 10 years it normally takes for health
problems to be addressed, said John Eisenberg, who runs the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality.
</P>
<P>
   What is critical, those involved with the issue said, is whether
the imperative to fix the problem will persist after the fervor
dies down. Eisenberg said he is committed to getting results,
although he added that while the Institute of Medicine recommended
that the US government spend $100 million a year on error
reduction, Congress in its recent budget increased that funding by
just $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Senar Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, who has been
pushing the issue longer than anyone on Capitol Hill and is the
only doctor in the Senate, said he is confident the momentum will
last ``now that we have the bully pulpit out behind it.'' And he
vowed to stick with it as long as it takes, in part because he
regrets how easy-to-prevent medical errors often undermined the
work he and his colleagues did in saving lives with
state-of-the-art heart and lung transplants.

CHRISTA LUDWIG'S LIFE BECOMES AN OPEN BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christa Ludwig was one of the greatest singers of this century.
The mezzo-soprano sang her final performance in Vienna in 1994 _
her New England farewell was a Tanglewood recital in 1991. Now she
has written a book, ``In My Own Voice'' (Limelight Editions, $30),
one of the few diva memoirs fully worthy of the career it records.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Ludwig was in America to promote the book, and spoke
cheerfully on the phone about her career and her life in
retirement. ``The most terrible thing,'' she says decisively, ``is
when some singers say that when they are not singing any more, they
are not living any more. It is so sad when a singer simply
disappears after her career _ I think of Lisa Della Casa; nobody
knows where she is now, where she is living, and that is a real
pity. I think my life started when I didn't sing any more and I
could begin to live like a normal person.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Russian soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, author of another
remarkable musical autobiography, Ludwig wrote her book herself and
didn't rely on a ghostwriter's bag of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started writing when I was still singing _ in fact, when I
had a big vocal crash during the Salzburg Festival in 1975 when I
couldn't sing so well. I was sitting at home, staring into the air,
and then I rmembered a book from Marlene Dietrich, and I thought,
`Ja, perhaps I could do this.' Then I forgot about it for several
years until I got an offer to write a book, and then I started,
whenever I was on the plane or sittig in the hotel. I wrote it as
how I speak, not the way a writer would, and I worked very closely
with Regina Domeraski, who made the translation into English. In
France, there was a very iterary translation, and this was not the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig always had a very secure sense of her own abilities. When
she was in Boston to sing and record Klytemnestra in Richard
Strauss's ``Elektra'' with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony, she
announced she would not remain an extra day for the ``patch''
session to repair any problems from the live performances. ``In my
case,'' she said firmly, ``this will not be necessary.'' Ozawa
remembers this fondly. ``It wasn't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   She admired other performers who shared a comparable work ethic.
There is very little in her book about her singing with Maria
Callas on a recording of ``Norma,'' but on the phone she said,
``Callas was a hard worker, very precise. I can't say much about
her other than that; the only thing she told me was that I should
imitate her in the duets. I had no idea of the style of Bellini,
which was not my cup of tea. What I remember more from that
recording was the tenor, Franco Corelli _ who was not working as
hard as Callas. We had the sessions beginning at 10 o'clock in the
morning, and always his wife was calling to tell us that Corelli
couldn't come.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A sense of her strengts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one time there was a lot of talk about Ludwig taking on
soprano roles. She did sing and record Leonore in Beethoven's
``Fidelio'' and the Marschallin in Strauss's ``Der Rosenkavalier,''
but resisted entreaties to sing Isolde and Bruennhilde, although
she did learn the role of Isolde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strauss's `Ariadne auf Naxos' I sang in only one season,''
Ludwig recalls, ``in Salzburg, in 1964. I thought this part needed
a more silvery tone than I had. Singing it, I got tired with the
vocal cords, and when they wanted me to sing it the next year, I
said no. The conductor Karl Boehm called me and tried to talk me
into it, and he didn't believe it when I told him it made me tired
_ if you tell people the truth, they will not believe you. But my
friend, the soprano Hilde Gueden, told me, you can never afford to
have some problem with the voice; if you have cancer, they will
hire you again, but if you have a vocal problem, it is over.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who strongly advised Ludwig not to sing Isolde
after hearing her sing the par straight through with piano was the
great Croatian soprano of an earlier generation, Zinka Milanov.
``For the beauty of the voice, hers was my favorite,'' says Ludwig.
``Her recording of `Pace, pace' from `La Forza del Destino' is
absolutely incredible. Conductors were asking me to sing Lady
Macbeth, and I didn't know what to do; my mother was not with me,
and she was my best vocal adviser. I bought a record with Leonie
Rysanek, but I couldn't listen to it because Leonie had such a
special voice that no one could imitate her. So I asked Zinka to do
with me Lady Macbeth. She told me, `First you have to sing it, and
not to push it.' It may not have en the singing as Verdi wanted it;
he said he wanted an ugly voice. But I sang it in the bel canto
style, in Vienna, with Sherrill Milnes, who was fantastic. There
was one high note I could only scream, and not sing in pianissimo,
which is why I never sang it in Italy, although I was asked to. I
thought people would boo me. In those days not everyone sang
difficult music in lower keys _ the way Domingo does.'' Ludwig
laughs, more merrily than wickedly. Lady Macbeth was one of the
triumphs of her career, and the performance has been preserved on
CD.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig was onstage as a teenager, and even sang Ulrica in
Verdi's ``Un Ballo in Maschera'' at 18 _ ``only once,'' she laughs,
``because it was terrible.'' Because she herself started her
professional career so young, Ludwig was recently shocked, when
judging a singing competition in Oslo, to discover that many
contestants were over 30. ``This I cannot understand; they should
be making their careers by now.'' Ludwig repeatedly credits her
mother, who had once sung Elektra under Karajan, for the security
of her own technique. ``I was never booed in my entire career,
although in the beginning I had some very mixed critics. I had no
high notes, and I had to learn this; at the beginning the high
notes cracked always, but my mother told me not to worry about the
critics, who did not understand that I was so young.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she would choose to sing if she could go onstage one
last time, in prime form, Ludwig does not hesitate. ``Kundry in
`Parsifal.' I love this part, ja.'' One of Ludwig's performances of
Kdry under Karajan has recently appeared on CD. ``But you know, on
the records, some of the performance is not ours. Elisabeth Hoengen
sang Kundry in Act I in Vienna, and on the records, it is Martha
Moedl. Apparently the first 18 minutes of the opera is not Karajan
because they could not find it, so they used a Bayreuth performance
conducted by Knappertsbusch. When this was discovered, it made a
big scandal! Of all the roles I never sang, the one I coveted was
Elektra; this was my wish, my dream, but it was not possible. I was
8 or something when I heard my mother sing it, but I wasn't afraid
_ I knew when the screams were going to come!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stories and ideas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig says she did not want her book to be boring. ``I wanted
not to write where I sang such-and-such that was a huge success,''
she says. Her book is a chronological narrative until she
establishes her career; then it changes direction to become a
series of essays about different aspects of a singer's life. She
scarcely mentions her first marriage to the baritone Walter Berry,
but does speak with great pride of their son, Wolfgang, who
contributes a brief, affectionate chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Wolfi is a composer, for musicals. I think he had too
much classical music in the house when he was growing up. He had a
voice like his father and he asked me if he could make a career and
I told him, ``I don't know _ you smoke, you live.' But his
musicality runs in another direction. He has had two musicals come
out already in Germany, although the big success was not there yet.
I like his music. Now I am one time a grandmother, and the
littlene, Kevin, is 7. He attends the American International School
in Vienna, like his parents; the wholefamily speaks English like
New Yorkers!''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Ludwig speaks about the least favorite of her many
recordings, the mother in Offenbach's ``Les Contes d'Hoffmann'' _ a
recording that was conducted by Seiji Ozawa, although Ludwig never
met him during the sessions. Her voice was tracked in later on,
when the original singer was judged unsatisfactory. ``Seiji never
saw me, and I am so ashamed of the record. It was not my fault, but
nobody was there, except for me in the headphones, trying to sing
in a trio with other singers who weren't there. They recorded my
voice without overtones, so I sounded terrible. The engineer told
me he would fix it, but when I heard it, he fixed it really fine!
This, unfortunately, is the modern way of making records.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig does love a few of her recordings. ``The record of
Mahler's `Des Knaben Wunderhorn,' with Leonard Bernstein, this I
love very much. And there is also a live recording of a recital
from the Salzburg Festival with Erich Werba which is very good. I
do not like so much making the Lieder in the recording studio _ it
is so difficult when you do not have the audience; you cannot get
the feeling in it. Of the operas, `Fidelio' with Otto Klemperer _
that is really good. Just now I start sometimes to listen to my old
recordings, and I think to myself, especially with the records I
made in the 1960s, `You know, Christa, you really sang very well.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Today Ludwig lives with her husband, the actor and stage
director Paul-Emile Deiber, near Cannes. ``I am not teacng, at
least not too much, because I am too lazy. For too many years I was
the whole time on the road, and always living in the hotel, and
what I liked was to be at home. Finally an live with my husband, my
dog, and my cat. Sometimes young singers will come to me when they
want to learn something for a recital or run through an operatic
role; theystay for a week and I show them how to phrase. This I
like very much because I do not have to go away to do it. Who would
want to go away from the south of France? I am happy to have
friends I can speak to now, and cook for! I like my life.''

THE REST OF TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the time of the season, year, decade, and century, when
writers and armchair historians pull out the big-bigger-biggest
entertainment TV landmarks for some very important throat-clearing.
About how Lucille Ball was an iconic American wife and how ``I Love
Lucy'' shaped the sitcom mold in the 1950s. About how the Beatles
used TV to graduate from pop phenomenon to full-blown revolution on
``The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the 1960s. About how Archie Bunker's
toilet flush on ``All in the Family'' unleashed realism on TV and
changed it forever in the 1970s. About how ``Hill Street Blues''
brought direly needed verite to drama in the 1980s. And about how
irony and nothingness became a mainstream club when ``Seinfeld''
reigned in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with all that. But put the
MTV-paced collage of TV profundity on pause for a minute, if you
will, to take stock of The Rest of TV, the non-sponge-worthy stuff
of the small screen that has not and never will become legendary,
the everyday programming that isn't about to be dubbed classic by
Nick at Nite or anatomized on ``The E! True Hollywood Story.''
Because the real matter of entertainment television _ its
lifeblood, in fact _ is that steady, ordinary flow of unremarkable,
unmemorable, unhistorical images, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
It's each individual viewer's own personal history of insignificant
TV, what he or she watched in the thousands of hours between ``The
Twilight Zone'' and ``The X-Files.'' It's the filler, the froth,
and the detritus _ Larue and Gidget, Top Cat and Benny, Flip and
Geraldine, Ike and Corabeth Godsey. It's kiddie fodder like
``Romper Room,'' lost soaps like ``The Edge of Night,'' and ads,
ads, ads (paging Mr. Whipple). How about when ``Petticoat
Junction'' went to ``Green Acres''? Oh Hooterville! Oh Consuelo! Oh
Hadji!
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. While the influential ``Mary Tyler Moore Show''
will go down in history, along with that golden ``M,'' and while
the eye-opening ``Puppy Episode'' of ``Ellen'' will be referenced
for years, most of TV is endlessly disappearing into a black hole.
The flooding river of blue glow flows into your home, and then on
to a forgotten land where decades of TV visions evaporate. Unlike
theatrical movies, or CD releases, or, of course, books, TV shows
do not carry about them the hint of immortality, the promise that
they will outlive our age. Sure, the afterlife that's granted by
syndication keeps the luckier series on the air beyond their
natural spans. But, ultimately, TV is about immediacy,
expendibility, and the passing of time. It's the electronic
incarnation of Be Here Now.
</P>
<P>
   The Infinite Hallway
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, we should be quite overwhelmed by The Rest of TV,
which grows fatter with each new cable concoction. It was in the
1980s that TV began its shift from a safe armful of network series
into a dizzying fantasia of options, with MTV, ESPN, and CNN
leading the way. And at the same time HBO quietly gained ground
with its movies and uncensored series, despite it's inauspicious
1972 launch featuring a polka festival. And presto _ here we are in
1999 with some 200 doors off the information hallway, ranging from
the pop cultural archive of VH1 and the celebrity dressing room of
E! to the serious classroom channels (History, Learning, and
Discovery). There's USA, TNT, AMC, BET, and TBS. There's Pay Per
View, and it's multiplex of movies. It's hard to believe, indeed,
that only 60 years ago, when the very first program was televised
in New York from the 1939 World's Fair, TV was borrowing from
vaudeville and radio in a desperate attempt to invent its own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of TV in 1999 is not just the story of a
fiftysomething medium that's growing out of hand; it's the story of
a public that is simultaneously gaining control over TV with their
hands. I speak of the remote control, that little convenience that
allows us to wear holes in our couches and engage in power
struggles with our loved ones. The remote control has been around
since the 1950s, when it was a primitive extra that shook the
entire set as it turned the dial among its few options. But it came
of age in the 1980s, and flourished in the 1990s, because the
multiplicity of channels called for a simple way to get us from Ch.
2 to Ch. 47B. Today, remotes are a necessity, and there are
currently some 400 million in use in US homes.
</P>
<P>
   The remote, so small and sleek, symbolizes our huge power over
programming execs at network and cable stations. We are no longer
captive audiences, never again to be stuck with whatever the big
three _ ABC, CBS, and NBC _ choose to bestow upon us. It is easy to
surf over NBC's ``Veronica's Closet,'' ride the cable wave to HBO's
``Sex and the City,'' and thumb our noses at TV honchos with a
press of our finger. It is easy to dodge the networks' efforts to
hold onto you for an entire night of shows, and surf from ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' at 9 on NBC to ``Sports Night'' at 9:30 on ABC on Tuesdays.
It's easy to say ``oh yeah?'' to Must-See TV. Notice how the
networks fight to keep us from surfing away between shows by
shortening theme songs, by eliminating bookend blocks of
commercials, by splitting the screen at the end of a show and
running a vignette while the credits run.
</P>
<P>
   But still we surf more and more, and increasingly into
non-network realms. Statistically, higher numbers of viewers are
making the psychological leap to cable every year, and for a short
period last summer, cable actually beat the networks in the
Nielsens for the first time ever. As a result, network programmers
have been scared awake and forced into a ferocious competition to
hold onto to viewers who are becoming ever more aware of their
options, their power. One of the great landmarks of ``The
Sopranos,'' aside from its creative brilliance, is the hype it has
built up for cable TV, particularly after its 16 Emmy nominations.
The mob series has made surfing away from the networks seem just a
little less frightening to viewers who, much to the networks' joy,
tend to fall into a network-only rut.
</P>
<P>
   News loses
</P>
<P>
   The contest to win viewers has been a blessing for series TV, if
not for news, which has become something of a travesty at the end
of the 20th century. While the competition has led to a marked
improvement in TV entertainment product since the 1970s, it has
turned televised nonfiction into a parody of itself. Local nightly
newscasts mimic ``Entertainment Tonight,'' making everything from
tragedies to the weather report into glitzy, artificial segments.
Newsmagazines take MTV's ``The Real World'' approach, imposing
fictional narrative devices onto real life to make it juicier. And
breaking news events, from the Monica Lewinsky affair to JFK Jr.'s
plane crash, are turned into tabloid melodramas, with the endless
drone of punditry in the background. News outlets from the networks
to CNN, MSNCB, and CNBC pat themselves on the back for letting
Caroline Kennedy grieve privately, while they convene en masse
outside her house and aim telephoto lenses at her windows. They
compete to land an interview with the friend of the wife of the son
of Lewinsky's mother's garbageman. In those cases, the winner is
the loser, in my book.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, critics are rightly applauding another golden age of
prime-time series as the century winds down. Oh, there's still
plenty of bottom feeding on entertainment TV, there's too much
sexual button-pushing, and clearly the sitcom is in need of
post-``Seinfeld'' reinvention, although ``Will &AMP; Grace,''
``Friends,'' and ``That '70s Show'' still charm. But the dramas _
with series like ``The West Wing,'' ``The Sopranos,'' ``Once and
Again,'' ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``Freaks and Geeks,''
``Roswell,'' ``Felicity,'' and ``The Practice'' _ are better than
ever. The realism and moral ambiguity first seen on ``Hill Street
Blues'' in the early 1980s is now in full bloom, along with
sophisticated writing, acting, and camerawork. Hourlong hybrids
like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' are expanding
TV genres, as are non-stand-up-based sitcoms like ``Sports Night''
and ``Sex and the City.'' The cable channels are also airing
extraordinary pop documentaries and made-for-TV movies, some of
which _ Showtime's ``The Baby Dance,'' or HBO's ``Always
Outnumbered'' _ are better than many theatrical releases.
</P>
<P>
   Press record
</P>
<P>
   And there's no forgetting the VCR, the remote's lovely
accomplice in helping us take charge of The Rest of TV. The VCR has
made us into our own programmers, as we tape shows and watch them
at our convenience. We can fashion our own night of TV, and, most
radically, we can skip through commercials. The VCR got its biggest
boost in 1984, when the Supreme Court decided that taping did not
break copyright laws. Now, it's hard to imagine life without it.
And in the near future, the VCR may take the ultraconvenient form
of a computer chip, squirreling away shows for us from an even
larger collection of channel options. At that point, we may be
shopping and banking on the same screen that we watch TV, and
channel surfing and Internet surfing will be one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, television only wants to be watched, and it will
continue to adapt to get you seated passively in front of it. Its
screen will get larger, it will become sexier and bloodier, it will
grow more intelligent and artful, it will move at a faster pace, it
will make the news more entertaining, it will make fiction more
realistic, it will bring back the game show, it will mimic the
tabloids, it will pander to Generation X, it will sell to baby
boomers, it will be moral, it will be amoral, it will be very good,
and, alas, it will be very bad _ all at once. The question is, will
we choose to use our power tools to navigate our epic TV voyage
through The Rest of TV? Will we vote with our remotes? The answer
when we return.

'GRATEFUL' KRAFT SAYS HIS JOURNEY IS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Robert Kraft's long, strange stadium odyssey began five
years ago, with camera crews jockeying for a shot of the proud new
owner of the New England Patriots. After purchasing the team for a
record-setting $172 million, a jubilant Kraft thrilled local fans
by announcing the franchise wouldn't be moving to St. Louis after
all.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots stadium saga finally ended late Monday night,
Kraft was alone at his Brookline home, with no cameras in sight.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home from a late business meeting and dinner
with his eldest son and confidant, Jonathan, Kraft had just turned
on the Monday night football game when the phone call he'd spent
years waiting for came.
</P>
<P>
   It was Patriots chief operating officer Andrew Wasynczuk calling
fro oxborough High School, where he was tracking the critical town
meeting vote on the team's proposed new $275 million stadium.
Wasynczuk, who spent the last seven months quarterbacking the
team's stadium drive, gave Kraft the good news. Foxborough
residents had just approved the new stadium, by a margin of more
than nine to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional moment,'' Kraft said as he reflected
upon the stadium struggle in an interview this week. ``This wasn't
a normal business deal. It was the stadium problems that hung up
the Patriots' prior owners. So this was about the future of the
team and the love of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was the community of Foxborough, Kraft insisted, that
ensured the Patriots would remain in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got such a vote of support from hard-working people
who were willing to come out on a rainy night and listen to hours
and hours of boring discussion, well, it felt like it was my family
saying welcome home,'' Kraft said, his voice choked with emotion.
``It was a long journey that ended up back where we began. But it's
where the Patriots should be. We're very grateful to the people of
Foxborough and the state who made it possible, and we're going to
build something special that they'll be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office 34 floors above State Street with
Jonathan, Kraft conceded that he purposely kept a low profile
during the stadium debate. Noting his tendency to ``become a
lightning rod'' for criticism, both Krafts repeatedly credited the
team's stadium success to Wasynczuk and other Patriots officials
who negotited the team's agreement and met with Foxborough
officials and residents on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that when I get involved it changes the dynamic
so it becomes more a personality issue rather than a substantive
one,'' Robert Kraft said as Jonathan nodded in agreement.
``Luckily, we had a really great team of people. We let them run
with the ball, and clearly that faith was rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated requests, Kraft reluctantly agreed to discuss the
Patriots stadium struggles late last week, marking his first
extensive interview since he walked away from a publicly financed
$1 billion stadium deal with Connecticut eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of two hours, Kraft and his son readily
acknowledged that over the past five years they stumbled badly as
they struggled to find a new home for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But while both men made it clear they have moved beyond their
earlier missteps, including the team's costly failed id to build a
new stadium in South Boston, they were far less serene about the
team's aborted move Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly about it, I really do,'' Robert Kraft said after
drawing a deep breath. ``The governor of Connecticut and the
Legislature made herculean efforts for us. And the reception we got
from the people of Connecticut was incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just couldn't be done on schedule. And in the end, they
acknowledged that. But I feel very bad about it because while some
people in Connecticut may be happy they aren't spending all that
money, we really were moved by thir passion and support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it would ready in 2001 and then 2002,'' Jonathan
Kraft said. ``But after a thorough review, it was clear it might be
2003, or 4 or 2005. And to compete with other teams, we needed a
stadium before that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft purchased the Patriots, the team ranked dead last in
terms of payroll. Now the team has one of the highest payrolls in
the league. Since 28-year-old Foxboro Stadium lacks the luxury and
club seats that generate the cash to pay for star players, the
Krafts have subsidized the team by using profits from their paper
business. That couldn't continue, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's extraordinary publicly subsidized stadium offer
came after the Patriots had spent years trying _ and failing _ to
get a new stadium in Massachusetts. The last straw came when House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran rejected a plan by Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham to provide infrastructure assistance for a new
Foxboro Stadium that the Krafts would pay for and build on land
they already owned.
</P>
<P>
   The day Kraft signed the contract to move to Hartford, his body
language made it clear he did not want to leave Massachusetts. But
when he agreed to move the team to Hartford, it was with the best
of intentions, Kraft said. He adamantly denied the claim now made
by critics in Connecticut that he signed the Hartford deal simply
to entice Massachusetts into making a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tried so hard for so long but we had come to the
realization that we couldn't do anythin in Massachusetts,'' Kraft
said. ``There was nothing in the works up here, and after ll we'd
been through, we believed nothing would ever change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we had three options: Move to Connecticut, where the people
really wanted us. Sell the team. Or move it out of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while there were plenty of very, very lucrative offers to
move the team to L.A. and a few other cities, I had a personal
commitment to keep the team in New England. I knew I would never
move the team out of this area. That just wasn't something I was
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But five months after signing the agreement to move to Hartford,
the team walked away from the deal. Kraft says he left because the
state could not clean up the polluted stadium site and deliver it
in time for the promised 2001 opening date. Because Jonathan Kraft
was concerned from the outset that the site might have problems,
the Krafts had insisted that Connecticut's contract specify the
Patriots had the right to terminate the agreement with no penalty
prior to May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Citing delays in the site assembly and cleanup efforts, the
Patriots shocked many sports analysts by canceling the $1 billion
Hartford stadium agreement on April 30, two days before the penalty
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a record-breaking deal, so if we were driven by money
we would have held onto it and waited for however many years it
took until they got the site ready or moved us to a new location,''
Kraft said. ``But it was never about money. And people who think
that, don't really understand us. For us, your legacy iat you do
for your family and your community.''
</P>
<P>
   So if it wasn't about money, what was the lure of Connecticut's
$1 billion contract? Kraft says it was the chance for his family to
be involved in ``a greater social good'' beyond a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real kicker for us was the idea that the stadium could act
as a catalyst to help the state redevelop downtown Hartford,''
Kraft said. ``The sacrifice of leaving Massachusetts, which it was
clear to everyone all along I never really wanted to do, was that
we could make a real difference in a struggling city ripe for
redevelopment. That's what turned me on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine months later, Connecticut is still reeling from the
Patriots' sudden departure. And there are lingering threats of a
lawsuit, though given the various exit clauses included in the
Patriots' contract, it's unclear on what grounds the state could
sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look you or anyone else in the eye and say we did
nothing improper'' Kraft declares in steely tone. ``We worked with
Connecticut in good faith, and it simply didn't work out the way
anyone hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the 58-year-old Kraft's voice softens, and he looks
down at the gleaming mahogany tabletop in front of him. ``Still I
hope somehow we can try to make it up to the good people of
Connecticut and to the political leaders down there who
unfortunately took the heat for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, it was Kraft and his son who took the heat,
and not local politicans. Led by then-governor William Weld and
aide Steve Tocco, the Patriots proposed a ne tadium in South Boston
as part of a combined sports and convention center development or
``megaplex.'' Furious that the team hadn't consulted them first,
South Boston leaders errupted, and both Krafts were vilified.
Today, both men say they made mistakes and regret hurt caused by
their plans and off-the-cuff comments. Clearly chastened, they've
both been more wary of public comment ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the bitter disappointment, the Krafts are determined
to slough off critics who labeled them ``whiners'' and worse. Both
blame the South Boston debacle on their own ``naivete'' and
declined to criticize political leaders like Weld and Tocco, who
encouraged the Krafts to spend millions on developing a plan for a
South Boston stadium then abruptly abandoned them when local
leaders howled in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the Krafts take on their former nemesis, Finneran, who
nearly singlehandely drove the team into Connecticut's arms and
once sarcastically referred to an NFL owner as a ``fat-assed
millionaire.'' Finneran later said he was speaking about another
team owner, but most listeners thought he was needling Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm one of those things,'' Kraft said with a smile when
asked about the comments. Turning serious, he said no ill feelings
linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's history,'' the elder Kraft declared. ``There were a lot
of big-picture people who felt that the new stadium belonged in
Boston. And I think many South Boston residents, if left on their
own and allowed to hear things objectively, might have thought it
was better than some of the alternatives.Bt I don't dwell on it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft continues to enjoy what he calls ``the privilege of owning
the Patriots'' and still ``gets pumped'' by the team's loyal fan
base, frequently engaging fans in the parking lot or near the field
before games. But he's also been stung by the ferocity of his
critics, who used to point to his golf-cart spins around the
stadium shaking hands with fans as evidence of either a
major-league ego or a man longing to be loved.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft says his high profile was dictated by necessity. ``When I
first bought the team I think I made 70 speeches in 90 days, but I
did it because we had to pay the bills,'' he said. ``This was a
team that had three owners in the previous four years and was in
disastrous financial shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal identification with fans, Jonthan Kraft said, was
essential to ``branding'' the team and marketing it to season
ticket holders and corporate patrons. ``It was a way of reassuring
potential fans that if you invest your money, time, and passion in
this team now, you won't be sorry. My dad did that, and we sold out
before the season started. That had never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts grow more animated when discussing their plans for
the team's new, 68,000-seat stadium. ``It's a great plan in the
right place at the right time,'' Jonathan Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a signature piece for our family, our team,
and for Massachusetts, and I'm very excited about it,'' Robert
Kraft said. After a pause he added: ``All's well that ends well. I
couldn't ay it any better than that.''

MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRONIC   IN `TELEVIGIL' ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began with the death of one man named John F. Kennedy and,
with awful symmetry, was recapitulated 36 years later, after the
death of another man named John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, it developed into a national rite of mourning
that analyst Ralph Whitehead has dubbed the ``televigil,'' marked
by conventions and characteristics unique to the television era.
</P>
<P>
   As the century draws to a close, television is no longer content
merely to chronicle events. When tragedy strikes, TV coverage
increasingly assumes the contours of an emotional outlet, a channel
for a mass grieving process. At other times, it merely offers
viewers the cheap thrill of vicarious participation in a major news
story.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, even as many groan at the frequent instances of
overkill and the ratings-driven cynicism of the networks, it seems
to be a role that a sizable segment of the public wants television
to play. ``The televigil delivers catharsis,'' observed Whitehead,
a professor of journalism at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he said, TV coverage now offers both ``a
journalistic dimension and a therapeutic dimension,'' with the
latter sometimes overshadowing the former. ``In the beginning,
journalists were there to tell us what's happening; that was their
primary role,'' said Whitehead. ``It was only secondary for them to
play a role in the grieving process. Over time, what was the
secondary role became the primary role.''
</P>
<P>
   For a TV genre born of tragedy, there has unfortunately been no
shortage of material in recent years. We have gathered around the
set for televigils after the Challenger disaster in 1986, the
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the death of Princess Diana in 1997,
the massacres at a Jonesboro, Ark., middle school last year and at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., this year, the airplane
crash that claimed the life of JFK Jr., his wife, and her sister in
July, and the deaths of six Worcester firefighters in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   Television's response to those and other tragedies was defined
by the two hallmarks of the televigil. The first is saturation TV
coverage that preempts other programming and, in Whitehead's words,
``quickly springs the bounds of the evening newscasts and begins to
fill up some, or in rare cases all, other hours of the broadcast
day.'' The second is television's attempt at what Whitehead calls
``structuring the nation's grief.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A nation's mourning &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That new role began to take shape with JFK's assassination in
1963. For the first time, the networks devoted several days of
airtime to around-the-clock coverage that captured unforgettable
images, including the sight of 2-year-old John F. Kennedy Jr.
saluting his father's casket. (That image would be replayed
endlessly when JFK Jr. himself died, completing the circle by once
again becoming a key part of the TV narrative.) Television became
an outlet for a nation's grief, and sometimes reflected it, as when
Walter Cronkite's voice broke as he reported Kennedy's death. In
that piercingly human moment, Cronkite was not just a journalist
but an American citizen mourning the loss of a president.
</P>
<P>
   But television was still largely bound by the conventions of
journalism in 1963. This meant that while the medium exhaustively
chronicled the mourning for Kennedy, it didn't try to lead the
grieving process.
</P>
<P>
   It observes no such restraint today.
</P>
<P>
   When major tragedies like Columbine erupt, TV goes wall-to-wall
_ and sometimes off the wall _ with its coverage. In fact, TV's
mobilization for televigils has become such a universally known
practice that students hiding from the shooters inside Columbine
High used cell phones to call TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   The networks leave no stone unturned in telling the life stories
of the victims, straining to create the illusion that the viewers
knew them personally. When the story involves a celebrity like JFK
Jr. or Princess Diana, they reach into the archives for footage
that is then put into endless rotation. When it is a massacre, like
Columbine, they instead recycle the most arresting images, such as
the picture of the bleeding boy falling from the window.
</P>
<P>
   On newscasts and prime-time newsmagazines, they interview
friends and family members, making the once-private act of grieving
a very public affair. ``The communities affected have contributed
to this,'' noted Whitehead. The networks devote considerable
airtime to pictures of the makeshift shrines (flowers, letters)
built as acts of devotion by people who, in most cases, had no
acquaintance with the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   TV journalists also self-consciously assume the roles of
mediators of the nation's grief. When John F. Kennedy Jr. died, CNN
ran this title card over its coverage: ``JFR Jr.: The world
mourns.'' On ABC, Connie Chung asked the Rev. Billy Graham: ``Do
you think John Kennedy Jr. is in heaven with his mother and father
now?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Becoming participants &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the Columbine shootings, NBC's ``Today'' host Katie Couric
held the hand of a victim's father while she interviewed him. Also
after Columbine, ABC's Ted Koppel hosted a ``town meeting'' in
Jonesboro, site of earlier school shootings, to discuss the issue
with anguished relatives of victims and community members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Koppel, heretofore a journalist's journalist in his
demeanor, jumped into the therapeutic sweepstakes himself,'' said
Whitehead. ``I though that was a remarkable moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordham University communications professor Everette Dennis was
equally struck by the media's front-and-center role in the grieving
process. Noting the relatively short shrift the networks gave to
Vice President Al Gore's visit to Littleton, he said that
``television and its own cast of commentators saw itself as more
important than Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key aspect of the televigil is the parade of experts
across the screen who offer speculative answers to the question of
``Why?'' This occurs almost immediately after answering the
who-what-when-where questions, and sometimes before. Often, the
experts are drawn from the ranks of sociologists and psychologists,
and their analyses are couched in the jargon of therapy and
syndromes.
</P>
<P>
   It is an approach that would have been hard to picture in 1963,
when the televigil was born, but it may reflect the times we live
in, the age of the I-feel-your-pain presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The televigil would likely not have grown into such a force
without the emergence of all-news cable networks like CNN, Fox News
Channel, and MSNBC, which intensified the pressure on CBS, ABC, and
NBC to offer continuous live coverage of major stories. That
sustained coverage, notes Dennis, ``is diametrically opposed to
what else is happening in television: shorter and shorter reports,
the bombardment of fragments.'' He sees one upside to it: ``It
provides a kind of institutional memory that we didn't have
before.'' But in general, he believes it is driven by ``commercial,
pandering'' impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks sense that there is an appetite for continuity in
a story that keeps unfolding, even when there is no story,'' added
Dennis. ``With JFK Jr., there wasn't much of a story after the
plane was first missing, because the outcome was inevitable. But it
allowed for the rehashing and repurposing of all kinds of news
material; you could go back to childhood and do his cameo
appearances through the American scene.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, as the 21st century rushes towards us, that the
American scene will continue to include the televigil, that curious
hybrid of journalism and therapy which came to define television
news in the last part of the 20th century. What is less clear, but
potentially worrisome, is what the long-term effects of TV's
obsession with the form will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic events of Columbine occupied the nation through the
medium of television for many days, yet almost nothing of a
national or official nature has happened because of Columbine,''
said Whitehead. ``If an emotional solution is readily available,
will the energy remain for a political solution?''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, software engineer Eric Raymond was a
lonely voice crying in the wilderness. Last week, the Malvern, Pa.,
resident became rich enough to buy his own forest.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stallman, the renowned Cambridge, Mass. software
designer, also could have cashed in, but he turned down the chance
as a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Stallman are friends, rivals, and leaders of the
most powerful movement in the computer business this year, one that
poses a serious threat to the power of software titan Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``open source'' or ``free software,'' depending on
whether you ask Raymond or Stallman. And the differences in those
two terms helps explain why Raymond is a millionaire and Stallman
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman, the intellectual godfather of the movement, helped to
create the world's best-known open source product, the GNU/Linux
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman believes that all software should be ``free.'' That
doesn't mean he objects to selling software. Stallman means that
once someone buys a program, he should be able to make as many
copies as he likes and give them away without fear of being charged
with software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Stallman says that all software should
include the ``source code'' _ the actual instructions as written by
the programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all commercial software comes in machine-readable form,
but source code isn't included because that would let users see how
the program works. Stallman says that software users have a
fundamental right to this knowledge, and he absolutely refuses to
use any software that doesn't include source codes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he turned down the chance to invest in two red-hot
GNU/Linux companies: Red Hat Inc., a North Carolina firm that
distributes and services a version of GNU/Linux; and VA Linux
Systems Inc., a California company that makes computers that run
GNU/Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies include some ``non-free'' software with their
products, and Stallman felt that ownership of their stock would
fatally compromise his principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't entirely happy with what these companies were doing,
and it would put me in a compromised position,'' Stallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond has a far more flexible view of the world. He helped
coin the term ``open source'' because he believes that calling it
``free software'' scares off corporate investors. Raymond doesn't
mind the inclusion of closed source software with GNU/Linux
systems, and so he gladly accepted 150,000 shares of VA Linux stock
and a seat on the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux went public Thursday, and its stock enjoyed the biggest
first-day run-up in stock-market history, rising from 30 a share at
the opening to close at 239 1/4. In 6 1/2 hours, Raymond earned a
paper fortune of roughly $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning surge in GNU/Linux-related stocks is based on the
perception that computer-industry leaders now take open-source
software very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software has always been cheap; Red Hat's version of
GNU/Linux can actually be downloaded over the Internet for free.
And open source has a strong reputation for high quality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, over half the world's Web servers use Apache, a
free open-source program for distributing Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   But now numerous companies hope to make money by providing
service and support to users of open-source products. That's the
business model for Red Hat. Buy the company's software, and you're
paying for customer support to keep your GNU/Linux system running.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy operating systems,'' said Red Hat chief
executive Matthew Szulik. ``They buy solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux systems can be difficult to set up. VA Linux Systems
solves that problem by peddling powerful computers with open-source
software preinstalled and ready to run. The company's server
computers are popular with businesses that want to establish
high-quality Web sites running Apache and GNU/Linux.
</P>
<P>
   But VA Linux will face tough competition. Nearly every major
computer maker, including IBM Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., now
sells machines with GNU/Linux preinstalled.
</P>
<P>
   Another of last week's hottest newly public firms, Acton-based
Andover.net, runs a network of advertiser-supported Web sites that
provide information, software, and advice to the open-source
community.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known of the company's sites is Slashdot, where
open-source users from around the world share information and
debate ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of market opportunities whenever there's a new
operating system,'' said Andover.net chief executive Bruce
Twickler. Just as the rise of Windows led to lucrative sales of
Windows-oriented magazines and books, Twickler thinks the rise of
GNU/Linux and other open-source software will ensure a large
on-line audience for Andover.net's sites.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market agrees. Andover.net went public on Wednesday at
18 a share. The stock rose as high as 83 5/8 and closed Friday at
67 1/2, giving the firm a market capitalization of just over $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman, whose firm belief in free software started it all,
says he's not sorry to have missed out on the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if I'm broke,'' he says. And while he's not sorry
to see his friend Raymond cashing in, he regrets Raymond's
willingness to compromise on the principles of free software.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's setting a bad example,'' Stallman says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Raymond says his new wealth won't change him much,
because he doesn't much care about money anyway. He's a musician
and an avid gun buff who holds ``Geeks With Guns'' parties for
other programmers at shooting ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay published Friday on Slashdot (www.slashdot.org),
Raymond said he plans to buy a cell phone, a new flute, ``and maybe
a nice hotrodded match-grade .45 semi for tactical shooting. But
really I don't want or need a lot of stuff. I'm kind of Buddhist
that way.''

ENVOY URGES NICARAGUANS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RESIDENCY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Acting like a salesman, the Nicaraguan
ambassador to the United States encourages those from his homeland
not to miss an opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   With phrases like ``time is running out,'' and ``take advantage
of,'' the well-dressed man captivates his audiences _ often
plugging a toll-free number, 877-478-8472.
</P>
<P>
   But Ambassador Francisco X. Aguiree Sacasa is not trying to make
a buck here in San Francisco. Rather he is preaching to people from
his country about the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American
</P>
<P>
   Relief Act (NACARA).
</P>
<P>
   Under NACARA, Nicaraguan nationals are able to apply for
permanent residency in the United States as long as they can
provide proof that they have not committed any felonies and that
they have lived in the United States since before December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running out of time,'' Sacasa told his audience of more
than 50 Nicaraguans on Sunday at the Ira and Leonore S. Gershwin
Theater. ``We need to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the turnout was low on Sunday, Sacasa is asking
Nicaraguans in the San Francisco Bay Area this week to spread the
message about the March 31 deadline when the application
</P>
<P>
   period under NACARA ends.
</P>
<P>
   Of an estimated 150,000 Nicaraguans living in the United States,
</P>
<P>
   slightly more than 40,000 have applied for permanent residency,
the ambassador said, and added that many of those who have not are
scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's fear that they'll be deported, but if they don't file
now, they'll have no one to blame but themselves,'' Sacasa said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that about 25,000 Nicaraguans live in
Northern California, but some believe there are more. Attorney
Thomas L. Hiester has helped 300 people file for permanent
residency under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought anything like this would ever pass,'' said the
Daly City lawyer who attended Sunday's gathering. ``It's so
generous. It comes down to being an amnesty for Nicaraguans.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's always that easy. Nicaraguan native Esteban
Gonzalez, 45, applied for permanent residency more than a year
</P>
<P>
   ago. Even though he has followed procedures, he said, he has yet
</P>
<P>
   to hear about his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating,'' said Gonzalez, who lives in Oakland.
``I've been patient, but I have not heard anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador emphasized that only about a dozen government
employees are screening thousands of NACARA applications. Sacasa
said he was trying to improve relations with U.S. immigration
</P>
<P>
   officials. ``It can be a bureaucratic system. Patience is
important.''

SLENDER `MAO' STUFFED WITH LAYERS OF CONTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MAO ZEDONG 
By Jonathan Spence 
Lipper/Viking, 188 pp., $19.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When China celebrated the 50th anniversary of its revolution in
October, most observers, Chinese and Western both, noted that while
the China of today was far removed from the People's Republic
proclaimed by Mao Zedong in 1949, it still had to be defined by
reference to Mao.
</P>
<P>
   A common observation illustrating this point was that the
instability _ and idealism _ of Mao's permanent revolution had ben
replaced by a stability precariously balanced between a stodgy
enshrinement of Communist ideology and an enthusiastic embrace of
Western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But if Mao provides only a point of reference for considering
what China is today, he remains among the most intriguing of
20th-century nation-builders. And he is _ as Jonathan Spence makes
clear in this tightly drawn study, another in the ``Penguin Lives''
series of brief ographies _ a world figure about whom the
ambiguities and contradictions are at least as interesting as the
momentous accomplishments and the equally momentous horror.
</P>
<P>
   Spence teaches at Yale, and his previous books on Chinese
history have been noted for their scholarship as well as the charm
of their writing. These qualities are everywhere evident in this
volume for general readers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focusing on the major events in which Mao was
involved and telling his story through them _ a conventional
historian's approach _ Spence has attempted, very largely
succeeding, to discover and explore the factors that shaped Mao's
thinking and actions.
</P>
<P>
   The series of upheavals that Mao launched in 1957 led up to the
Cultural Revolution. As they played out over the following years,
they alternately mystified, transfixed, and horrified Chinese and
Western observers _ and they still are not wholly understood.
</P>
<P>
   During the previous year, Spence writes, ``various tracks
converged in Mao's mind: the ability of the nobodies of China to
transform their society, the obstructionism of the Communist
Party's own new establishment, the possibilities of vast economic
strides forward if those with `bound feet' would get out of the
way, the need to deepen the channels of criticism and the flow of
information and to keep the brightest flames of socialism
burning.''
</P>
<P>
   That is pretty solid analysis _ and a pretty fair framework for
understanding the events that were to follow. It is an analysis
most readers would be willing to take on faith, as it were, from a
scholar of Spence's standing. But what makes thisook so fine an
accomplishment _ especially considering its length _ is that Spence
provides supporting evidence about Mao's thinking, mainly from a
``curious'' four-hour speech to party leaders on the subject of
``contradictions.'' There were ``antagonistic'' contradictions
between ``the enemy (landlords, imperialist elements, and the like)
and ourselves'' and ``non-antagonistic'' ones ``among the people''
and within the party, and these were to be resolved through a
``process of unity-criticism-unity.''
</P>
<P>
   One interesting element of Mao's life is his personal relations
with his successive wives, his children, and his old revolutionary
comrades. It is surprising to find it even mentioned in so
compressed a study as this, but it is one that Spence draws upon
effectively. In the early 1950s, Spence notes, Mao received many
letters from such people, conveying news from ``across space and
decades,'' which ``gave him an intimate view of how the revolution
was affecting individuals he knew well, and enabled him to place
the larger national criteria in a smaller-scale series of
contexts.''
</P>
<P>
   As a historian rather than a political scientist, Spence is
interested in placing Mao in the context of Chinese cultural
history and philosophy. Several times he cites Mao's poetry as
something he used to define his place in a Chinese pantheon.
Curiously, however, Spence ignores an even more important cultural
element, calligraphy, which Mao _ like the emperors before him _
deliberately exploited to project power and establish his
legitimacy to rule.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Spence notes that ancient Chinese
philosophers ``loved the paradoxes of status reversed . . . the
dizzying possibilities inhren in turning things upside down.'' They
were ``natural dialecticians,'' he writes, for whom ``te aspects of
misrule were always embodied within the concept of order.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be ``Mao's terrile accomplishment,'' Spence writes, to
meld such insights with Western socialist thought into ``a
long-drawn-out adventure in upheaval.'' And it is that kind of
assessment, well argued and well documented throughout, that makes
Spence's slender book on ``Mao'' a necessity even on shelves that
sport _ or flaunt _ the five volumes of Mao's collected writings.

<P>
   CROSSMAGLEN, Northern Ireland _ Sitting in Paddy Short's pub, a
neglected pint of Guinness in front of him, the IRA man didn't
hesitate when asked what the chances were of his organization
turning in some weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a chance in hell,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The political progress achieved in Northern Ireland over the
past month has been predicated mostly on the premise that the Irish
Republican Army will begin disarming, but there is no appetite for
doing so here in the republican heartland of South Armagh.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA still runs this hilly, rural corner of Northern Ireland.
Through most of the Troubles, the British Army has been forced to
operate by helicopter here, so dangerous are the narrow roads lined
with hedgerows that hide bombs and assassins.
</P>
<P>
   That there seems no evidence that the IRA's most hardline
disciples are willing, or have been prepared, to countenance the
handing in of weapons would lead one to despair for the future of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Ulster Unionists, Northern Ireland's largest
party, have said they will withdraw their support and force the
collapse of the power-sharing government that took office this
month, unless the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics say that the last government that sought to share power
between Protestant Unionists and Catholic Republicans lasted six
months before collapsing in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will fail, just as other attempts to sell out the loyal
people of Ulster will fail,'' the Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the
Democratic Unionists and a bloc of Protestants who want the
government to fall, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the defiant republicans in Paddy Short's pub, and
the uncompromising unionists at Stormont, there are important
differences between today and 1974 that bode well for the future,
according to historians and political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved beyond the failed policies of the past,'' said
Sinn Fein's leader, Gerry Adams, who in 1974 was an IRA commander
but who has since persuaded the IRA to let politics replace the
``armed struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Morrison, a former IRA figure who is now a writer but who
is still close to senior IRA leaders, says he believes the IRA will
put weapons ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, only the mainstream parties were committed to
power-sharing, and moderate unionists were even more divided than
they are today. And, crucially, the main paramilitary groups on
both sides were violently opposed to the idea of a compromise
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA was convinced in 1974 that it was winning its campaign
to end British control of Northern Ireland. The loyalist
paramilitary groups, appalled at the thought of sharing power with
Catholic nationalists, used their own power to shut Northern
Ireland down with a general strike that brought the collapse of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, despite the IRA's misgivings about turning in
weapons, its allies in Sinn Fein are part of the government. The
IRA and its loyalist counterparts, the Ulster Defense Association
and the Ulster Volunteer Force, are openly in favor of a political
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   While dissidents on both sides of the divide remain committed to
wrecking the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998, their ability to
inflict anything but sporadic violence is limited, according to
security officials on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a noticeable momentum in Ireland. On an island
where history weighs heavily, the word ``historic'' tends to be
overused here. But it is hard to find another word to describe what
has happened over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of political paralysis that followed the
endorsement by voters, both north and south, of the Good Friday
Agreement, there has been a burst of progress in implementing the
provisions of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   First, the former US senator from Maine, George Mitchell, spent
three months persuading the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein not to
allow the failure of the agreement he brokered. Mitchell's efforts
at trust-building were rewarded when the Ulster Unionists dropped
their demand that the IRA begin disarming before they formed a
government with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare pledge of tolerance by an Ulster Unionist leader,
David Trimble acknowledged the legitimacy of nationalists seeking a
united Ireland by peaceful means, and vowed to treat Catholics as
equals.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's Adams responded by unequivocally rejecting violence
and by pledging to work in partnership with unionists to create a
more egalitarian society. The IRA completed the jigsaw carefully
choreographed by Mitchell with a statement reversing its refusal to
consider disarming.
</P>
<P>
   All this set the stage for the dramatic developments of this
month. In the space of two days, the British Parliament returned
governing power to the Northern Ireland Assembly. On Dec. 2, the
Irish government formally dropped its constitutional claim to the
territory of Northern Ireland; Britain and Ireland signed a new
treaty governing their relationship; and the first-ever meeting of
a power-sharing government that included unionists and republicans
took place at Stormont castle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most remarkable was the appointment of Martin
McGuinness, once the IRA's chief of staff, as the education
minister in the new government. McGuinness acknowledged that the
eyes of his former comrades-in-arms will be on him and he will have
to prove that, as he put it, ``politics provides a real alternative
to conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the optimism generated by the return of an elected
government here for the first time in 25 years, it remains true
that this experiment in power-sharing could collapse as the last
one did in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But much has happened since then. Many of the grievances of
Catholics, such as the housing discrimination that catalyzed the
civil rights movement whose suppression touched off the conflict,
have been addressed _ at least with legislation that provides
redress to anyone who feels discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the importance of British and Irish sovereignty has been
diminished by the increasing power of the European Union, the
15-nation bloc to which both countries belong that has taken over
many responsibilities that used to be the domain of national
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and Ireland, historic foes, have never been closer. In
1974, few Irish people were willing to drop their claim to Northern
Ireland. Last year, 95 percent voted to do so and to enshrine the
principle of consent: that Northern Ireland will remain part of the
United Kingdom until a majority living there say otherwise. In
1974, Britain saw Dublin's interest in Northern Ireland as
interference; now the two governments are partners, with the new
treaty enshrining cross-border, and cross-island, cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference is that between 1974 and today some
2,000 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just want a bit of peace,'' said Ann Carr, who staged
peace vigils for years to encourage the Ulster Unionists to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Many people remain doubtful that the IRA will turn in, or
destroy, any of its weapons. But Brian Feeney, a political analyst
and former nationalist politician in Belfast, says there is great
incentive for the IRA to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about the north anymore,'' he said. ``It's about
the south, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the next general election in the Irish Republic, which could
be held as soon as next year, Sinn Fein stands to gain three or
four seats in the Irish parliament. Feeney says that would probably
make them kingmakers, holding the balance of power to create a
coalition government. But Feeney says that scenario can occur only
if the IRA does its part and turns in some weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons retain a mythical importance to the IRA. But political
power, which its allies in Sinn Fein now hold in the north and
could soon gain in the south, is a tradeoff that the leaders of the
most resilient guerrilla movement of the 20th century have to
consider as the century comes to a close.
</P>
<P>
   As even the wary IRA man at Paddy Short's pub acknowledged,
``I've seen things this week I never thought I'd see.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... is black.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But West's rhetoric has been far more incendiary than Bradley's
to date. West writes hopefully of the need for racial unity, but he
criticized Clinton's vaunted dialogue on race as little more than
``chitchat.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a harsh critic of government in general, writing of the
police and prison systems as mechanisms of state violence against
minorities, and of the FBI and CIA as more subtle forms of that
vioence, ``whose actions threaten personal liberties, and remain
beyond public scrutiny and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is not the grand paradox of American democracy at its
inception that the people are distrusted and contained, their power
dispersed and diluted so that elites may prosper at the expense of
workers' power, women's power, and especially black, brown, yellow
and red power?'' West wrote in the introduction to his latest book,
``The Cornel West Reader.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticizes ``multinational corporate capitalism, with its
bankrupt and authoritarian-like state,'' persecuting the ``black
and brown, and working poor and underclass,'' attacking women's
reproductive rights, and making lesbians and gays ``cultural
scapegoats.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that white fear of a black sexuality is ``a basic
ingredient of white aism.''
</P>
<P>
   He has criticized today's black middle class as ``more deficient
and more decadent' than in previous decades, their selfishness a
prime reason for what he sees as a crisis in black leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most present-day black leaders seem too hungry for status to
be angry, too eager for acceptance to be bold, too self-invested in
advancement to be defiant,'' he wrote in his bestseller, ``Race
Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   West's association with Sharpton, who has a reputation for
widening the racial divide, and his qualified sympathy for Minister
Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam reinforce his image as a
radical.
</P>
<P>
   His links to Sharpton and Farrakhan, especially, will not fly on
a national political stage, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some rather bizarre ideas,'' said Steele, of Stanford.
``That children should be able to vote, that government should take
care of everybody. He's socialistic in that bent. Overall, those
ideas would be dangerous for Bradley politically because the public
would identify him with the far, almost exotic, left.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Abigail Thernstrom, the coauthor of ``America in Black and
White: One Nation, Indivisible'': ``I do not think Cornel West's
ideas or Bradley's ideas, which are very `two nations, separate and
unequal,' (are) reality in 1999, and I think the American public
knows that. The average voter will say, `Give me a break.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Voters will not respond well to claims that ``all whites are
racist, and that there has been no black progress that is
meaningful,'' said Thernstrom, who knows both Bradley and West. ``I
don't think his voice swhere the American public is, I really do
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The American public has never responded well to calls for a
redistribution of wealth, even during the Great Depression, said
Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow and public opinion specialist at
the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   She cited a 1993 survey, which found that even 51 percent of
people who earned less than $15,000 a year believe Aericans should
be able to accumulate as much wealth as possible even if others
live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are voters likely to respond well to West's criticism of
welfare reform, Bowman said. In a mid-November Los Angeles Times
poll, which asked respondents what opinions would make them likely
to vote against a candidate, 59 percent of respondents were less
likely to vote for someone who opposed the welfare reform bill, as
Bradley did. Of the many issues surveyed, that position elicited
the strongest negative sentiment, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley rejects the suggestion that he might be
called upon to answer for West's views.
</P>
<P>
   ``My positions on race are formed out of my own experience and
my own life,'' he said. ``Cornel's a friend and he's an admired
friend. I don't know all the positions he's ever taken on all the
issues. I don't think they'll be liabilities because Cornel is
speaking to who I am as a person. I'm not worried, because I speak
for myself as to what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many observers, especially those who know Bradley,
warn against overestimating West's sway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would doubt that Cornel West has a lot of influence on
him,'' said Walters, who was Bradley's colle when the former
senator taught for a short time at the University of Maryland. ``I
don't think anybody has that much influence over Bill Bradley. (He)
has proven he's his own man. That's precisely the attraction he has
for a lot of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley does not brook attempts to hold him responsible for the
people with whom he associates: he defended his August visit to
Sharpton in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was the first Democratic politician in a primary
campaign to go to Harlem since 1968,'' Bradley said. ``I don't
agree with Al Sharpton on all the issues. But I recognized that it
was an opportunity to speak to a community that doesn't often have
presidential candidates come speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite Bradley's determination to remain solely responsible
for his public views, Walters said, West's presence in the campaign
might pull Bradley's image farther left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that view that Bradley is more liberal than he really
is, because he has surrounded himself with people like West,''
Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bradley and West will be bound together even more
closely in coming weeks, during their tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very highly respected voice in the
African-American community,'' the candidate says of West. ``He's a
friend of mine who's known me for many years, and he can speak
about me in ways other people can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Added West: ``It's just to push him over the top. We'd go
everywhere, especially through the South. We'd be going to churches
and synagogues and trade union centers, barber shops and beauty
salons, the full court press.''
</P>
<P>
   They face a difficult battle. In the South, where most black
Democratic voters live, Gore's approval rating is at 74 percent,
whil,according to an August survey, 42 percent of voters still did
not know who Bradley was. And West is a complete unknown outside
intellectual circles in the Northeast, said David Bositis, senior
political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
studies, who conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The whole trip might backfire, turning off black voters, Steele
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley is making a very serious mistake,'' Steele
said. ``If he's working through Cornel West, he does not understand
the black American community. He needs to reach out in a much
broader way.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele called West's ``aggressive support of racial preferences
very out of step with broader America,'' including a half of black
Americans. ``Bradley is placing himself in the far left of black
community,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   West, however, is unlikely to abandon his position as a liberal
crusader against institutional power _ even if he succeeds in
helping his friend make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Then, West said, ``I'll become his loving and friendly critic.''

SENSE IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- It took President Clinton, spouting Third Way
nostrums that go beyond petty politics, to finally clear away the
tear gas and the polysyllabic fog from the bizarre goings-on inside
and outside the hall at the World Trade Organization's battle in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The president's contributions were two: explaining why the trade
meeting was a flop only in a short-term sense, and declaring that
the truly big issue ahead is the looming vote in Congress on
establishing normal trade relations with China _ our end of the
bargain in getting the world's most populous nation into a system
that can guide its development to the world's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that a more open world continues to work the same
economic wonders that have been occuring ever since the basic
system was erected after World War II. Tre are, and always have
been, adjustment problems and abuses, but grown-up people can and
must deal withtem, and their track record is more than good.
</P>
<P>
   The oter reality is that a more open trading world is a vital
security concern as well as the engine of economic growth. The
president was correct in noting that the world's hot spots after
the Cold War are distinguished by too little, not too much, contact
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Theconventional political babble declared the WTO gathering a
disaster because Clinton went out there to cave in to labor and
environmental groups for the benefit of the Democratic Party and Al
Gore next year. That may work for entertainment on cable channels,
but it doesn't stand up to analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the president went West to declare that any
new round of global trade negotiations has to include the topics of
labor and environmental standards on its agenda. The developing
nations resisted, and so the talks were inconclusive _ but only for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks that is a new position for Clinton has been
asleep for the last eight years
</P>
<P>
   It was in October '92 at North Carolina State that he first
articulated his ``Yes, but'' philosophy, using the North American
Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico as his takeoff point.
As negotiated by President Bush, NAFTA was unratifiable at that
point. By insisting on side agreements regarding labor and
environmental rules and by actually negotiating them in the early
months of his presidency, Clinton made ratification possible.
Applying these principles worldwide was a position first stated on
behalf of the administration in spring '94 by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Clinton's notion was hardly that wages in other
countries should be similar to ours or that a Third World factory
need to follow American EPA rules. Instead, he introduced the
principles that extreme violations of human rights and of the
environment should be addressed and that races to the bottom for
trading advantage should be avoided. Later, Clinton negotiated
deals that recognized countries' rights to guard against sudden,
massive surges in imports following market-opening deals. That's
not protectionist; it's common sense.
</P>
<P>
   As he noted, it has often happened that concepts initially
considered alien to trade become central with time. Few thought
there were ways to begin protecting intellectual property rights in
commerce, but it turned out there were.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the break-up for now of talks about starting a new round
of world-wide trade talks necessarily disastrous. As Clinton
pointed out, it took four years, from 1982-86, to get the Uruguay
round started, and it didn't conclude until 1996. The preliminaries
to Seattle started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody needs something to happen. The United States wants
more access for farm and other products as well as formal talks on
labor and environmental standards; the Europeans and Japanese don't
like our tough antidumping laws; the Third World wants more access
for its farm and textile goods. The only way everybody can get some
satisfaction is to deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the real issue before the United States is China, and
a push is on for a congressional vote on trade relations by the
spring. Economically, the issue should be a slam dunk. US companies
and farmers will have market cess beyond their recent dreams; and
China has agreed to tough rules and safeguards on import surges
that are similarly sound.
</P>
<P>
   But the hidden issue is security. Rejecting trade relations is
almost certain to mean the demise of China's relatively
outward-looking government. In its place will come the thugs who
have Tiananmen Square, anti-economic reform, anti-Americanism, and
truculence toward Taiwan on their resumes. Stability in Asia is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's business allies need to cut him enough slack to
realize he is not caving to their labor and environmental
antagonists. And his friends on the left need to recognize that in
the politics of 2000, control of Congress will be decided in swing
districts where the president's approach is the popular one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Robert Kraft's long, strange stadium odyssey began five
years ago, with camera crews jockeying for a shot of the proud new
owner of the New England Patriots. After purchasing the team for a
record-setting $172 million, a jubilant Kraft thrilled local fans
by announcing the franchise wouldn't be moving to St. Louis after
all.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots stadium saga finally ended late Monday night,
Kraft was alone at his Brookline home, with no cameras in sight.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home from a late business meeting and dinner
with his eldest son and confidant, Jonathan, Kraft had just turned
on the Monday night football game when the phone call he'd spent
years waiting for came.
</P>
<P>
   It was Patriots chief operating officer Andrew Wasynczuk calling
from Foxborough High School, where he was tracking the critical
town meeting vote on the team's proposed new $275 million stadium.
Wasynczuk, who spent the last seven months quarterbacking the
team's stadium drive, gave Kraft the good news. Foxborough
residents had just approved the new stadium, by a margin of more
than nine to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional moment,'' Kraft said as he reflected
upon the stadium struggle in an interview this week. ``This wasn't
a normal business deal. It was the stadium problems that hung up
the Patriots' prior owners. So this was about the future of the
team and the love of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was the community of Foxborough, Kraft insisted, that
ensured the Patriots would remain in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got such a vote of support from hard-working people
who were willing to come out on a rainy night and listen to hours
and hoursof boring discussion, well, it felt like it was my family
saying welcome home,'' Kraft said, his voice choked with emotion.
``It was a long journey that ended up back where we began. But it's
where the Patriots should be. We're very grateful to the people of
Foxborough and the state who made it possible, and we're going to
build something special that they'll be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office 34 floors above State Street with
Jonathan, Kraft conceded that he purposely kept a low profile
during the stadium debate. Noting his tendency to ``become a
lightning rod'' for criticism, both Krafts repeatedly credited the
team's stadium success to Wasynczuk and other Patriots officials
who negotiated the team's agreement and met with Foxborough
officials and residents on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that when I get involved it changes the dynamic
so it becomes more a personality issue rather than a substantive
one,'' Robert Kraft said as Jonathan nodded in agreement.
``Luckily, we had a really great team of people. We let them run
with the ball, and clearly that faith was rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated requests, Kraft reluctantly agreed to discuss the
Patriots stadium struggles late last week, marking his first
extensive interview since he walked away from a publicly financed
$1 billion stadium deal with Connecticut eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of two hours, Kraft and his son readily
acknowledged that over the past five years they stumbled badly as
theysruggled to find a new home for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But while both men made it clear they have moved beyond their
earlier missteps, including the team's costly failed bid to build a
new stadium in South Boston, they were far less serene about the
team's aborted move Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly about it, I really do,'' Robert Kraft said after
drawing a deep breath. ``The governor of Connecticut and the
Legislature made herculean efforts for us. And the reception we got
from the people of Connecticut was incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just couldn't be done on schedule. And in the end, they
acknowledged that. But I feel very bad about it because while some
people in Connecticut may be happy they aren't spending all that
money, we really were moved by their pssion and support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it would be ready in 2001 and then 2002,'' Jonathan
Kraft said. ``But after a thorough review, it was clear it might be
2003, or 4 or 2005. And to compete with other teams, we needed a
stadium before that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft purchased the Patriots, the team ranked dead last in
terms of payroll. Now the team has one of the highest payrolls in
the league. Since 28-year-old Foxboro Stadium lacks the luxury and
club seats that generate the cash to pay for star players, the
Krafts have subsidized the team by usin profits from their paper
business. That couldn't continue, Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's extraordinary publicly subsidized stadium offer
came after the Patriots had spent years trying _ and failing _ to
get a new stadium in Massachusetts. The last straw came when House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran rejected a plan by Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham to proi infrastructure assistance for a nw
Foxboro Stadium that the Krafts would pay for and build on land
they already owned.
</P>
<P>
   The day Kraft signed the contract to move to Hartford, his body
language made it clear he did not want to leave Massachusetts. But
when he agreed to move the team to Hartford, it was with the best
of intentions, Kraft said. He adamantly denied the claim now made
by critics in Connecticut that he signed the Hartford deal simply
to entice Massachusetts into making a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tried so hard for so long but we had come to the
realization that we couldn't do anything in Massachusetts,'' Kraft
said. ``There was nothing in the works up here, and after all we'd
been through, we believed nothing would ever change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we had three options: Move to Connecticut, where the people
really wanted us. Sell the team. Or move it out of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while there were plenty of very, very lucrative offers to
move the team to L.A. and a few other cities, I had a personal
commitment to keep the team in New England. I knew I would never
move the team out of this area. That just wasn't something I was
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But five months after signing the agreement to move to Hartford,
the team walked away from the deal. Kraft says he left because the
state could not clean up the polluted stadium site and delier it in
time for the promised 2001 opening date. Because Jonathan Kraft was
concerned from the outset that the site might have problems, the
Krafts had insisted that Connecticut's contract specify the
Patriots had the right to terminate the agreement with no penalty
prior to May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Citing delays in th site assembly and cleanup efforts, the
Patriots shocked many sports analysts by canceling the $1 billion
Hartford stadium agreement on April 30, two days before the penalty
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a record-breaking deal, so if we were driven by money
we would have held onto it and waited for however many years it
took until they got the site ready or moved us to a new location,''
Kraft said. ``But it was never about money. And people who think
that, don't really understand us. For us, your legacy is what you
do for your family and your community.''
</P>
<P>
   So if it wasn't about money, what was the lure of Connecticut's
$1 billion contract? Kraft says it was the chance for his family to
be involved in ``a greater social good'' beyond a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real kicker for us was the idea that the stadium could act
as a catalyst to help the state redevelop downtown Hartford,''
Kraft said. ``The sacrifice of leaving Massachusetts, which it was
clear to everyone all along I never really wanted to do, was that
we could make a real difference in a struggling city ripe for
redevelopment. That's what turned me on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine months later, Connecticut is still reeling from the
Patriots' sudden departure. And there are lingering threats of a
lawsuit, though given the various exit clauses included in the
Patriots' contract, it's unclear on what grounds the state could
sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look you or anyone else in the eye and say we did
nothing improper,'' Kraft declares in steely tone. ``We worked with
Connecticut in good faith, and it simply didn't work out the way
anyone hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the 58-year-old Kraft's voice softens, and he looks
down at the gleaming mahogany tabletop in front of him. ``Still I
hope somehow we can try to make it up to the good people of
Connecticut and to the political leaders down there who
unfortunately took the heat for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, it was Kraft and his son who took the hat,
and not local politicans. Led by then-governor William Weld and
aide Steve Tocco, the Patriots proposed a new stadium in South
Boston as part of a combined sports and convention center
development or ``megaplex.'' Furious that the team hadn't consulted
them first, South Boston leaders errupted, and both Krafts were
vilified. Today, both men say they made mistakes and regret hurt
caused by their plans and off-the-cuff comments. Clearly chastened,
they've both been more wary of public comment ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the bitter disappointment, the Krafts are determined
to slough off critics who labeled them ``whiners'' and worse. Both
blame the South Boston debacle on their own ``naivete'' and
declined to criticize political leaders like Weld and Tocco, who
encouraged the Krafts to spend millions on developing a plan for a
South Boston stadium then abruptly abandoned them when local
leaders howled in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the Krafts take on their former nemesis, Finneran, who
nearly singlehandely drove the team into Connecticut's arms and
once sarcastically referred to an NFL owner as a ``fat-assed
millionaire.'' Finneran later said he was speaking about another
team owner, but most listeners thought he was needling Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm one of those things,'' Kraft said with a smile when
asked about the oments. Turning serious, he said no ll feelings
linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's history,'' the elder Kraft declared. ``There were a lot
of big-picture people who felt that the new stadium belonged in
Boston. And I think many South Boston residents, if left on their
own and allowed to hear things objectively, might have thought it
was better than some of the alternatives. But I don't dwell on it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft continues to enjoy what he calls ``the privilege of owning
the Patriots'' and still ``gets pumped'' by the team's loyal fan
base, frequently engaging fans in the parking lot or near the field
before games. But he's also been stung by the ferocity of his
critics, who used to point to his golf-cart spins around the
stadium shaking hands with fans as evidence of either a
major-league ego or a man longing to be loved.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft says his high profile was dictated by necessity. ``When I
first bought the team I think I made 70 speeches in 90 days, but I
did it because we had to pay the bills,'' he said. ``This was a
team that had three owners in the previous four years and was in
disastrous financial shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal identification with fans, Jonathan Kraft said, was
essential to ``branding'' the team and marketing it to season
ticket holders and corporate patrons. ``It was a way of reassuring
potential fans that if you invest your money, time, and passion in
this team now, you won't be sorry. My dad did that, and we sold out
before the season started. That had never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts grow more animated when discussing their plans for
the team's new, 68,000-seat stadium. ``It's a great plan in the
right place the right time,'' Jonathan Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a signature piece for our family, our team,
and for Massachusetts, and I'm very excited about it,'' Robert
Kraft said. After a pause he added: ``All's well that ends well. I
couldn't say it any better than that.''

MTV, VH1 PREDECESSOR STILL GOING STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Garth Brooks walks up the aisle, grabs his belly
contentedly _ this is clearly a man who loves to eat _ and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you stretch video? Can you? I am stuffed,'' he says as
more and more heads swivel his way and the activity on the drafty
soundstage stops.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Garth is in the house _ full as a tick and an hour late,
but ready, at last, to work. It's just a shade before 2 p.m. on
Wednesday, Nov. 3, and the biggest country star in history has come
to the sixth-floor studio of the University of Texas' KLRU-TV to do
a sound check before the taping of the first show of the 25th year
of ``Austin City Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the night is over, he will do a full career retrospective
_ all the hits with his regular group, and a brief set of Chris
Gaines material with a second band. The reward will be playing for
just 450 people and a mere $500 _ union scale.
</P>
<P>
   Makes no sense? Makes perfect sense. Brooks _ who has compared a
spot on ``ACL'' to playing in the World Series _ loves the small
venue, the enthusiasm of the Austin fans, the whole, well, vibe of
the joint and the staff and the program. And he knows that his
``ACL'' show will reach, when aired Feb. 5, ]a country full of
serious music fans.
</P>
<P>
   And he is only one of many who know this. It's easier to list
who hasn't played ``ACL'' than who has. Suffice to say that just
about any American musician of note, from darned near every genre,
has passed through these doors and stood on this stage. B.B. King.
Sheryl Crow. Joe Ely. The Dixie Chicks. Johnny Cash. Tom Waits.
Lyle Lovett. The Allman Brothers. The late, great Doug Sahm. Neil
Young. George Jones. Ruth Brown. Los Lobos. Merle. Waylon. Stevie
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Videos on VH1 (when you can actually find them) may resemble
fashion shows, playa fantasies or soft porn; but here, all is right
with the world, and everybody, as Brooks will say before tearing
into ``We're Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House,'' ``is in it
for one thing, and that's the music.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, ``ACL'' hasn't changed a whit since 1974, when
Willie Nelson taped the pilot (which aired in 1975) before the
program even had a name.
</P>
<P>
   Today ``ACL'' is shown on 300 PBS stations nationwide, which
means it gets to 90 percent of all U.S. markets. Thus, on a
national scale, it provides a safe, homey, often very funky oasis
of lived-in blues, jazz, rock, Tejano, bluegrass, folk, country,
zydeco and soul in a world where it seems a new teen-age pop star
reaches supernova status every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``ACL'' is celebrating its anniversary with ``Austin City
Limits: 25 Years of American Music,'' (Billboard Books, $35
hardcover) a handsome, photo-filled tome detailing the show's
history, and a companion video of the same name. But really the
celebration is just in the doing, the program's continuing ability
to bring some of the best names in roots music to this drafty
little studio just a stone's throw from the trendy shops and hordes
of roving UT students on Guadalupe Street.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why there's so little hubbub surrounding Garth's
taping. Despite his lateness and the fact that the show will start
an hour late due to the scheduling of another event on the sixth
floor, nobody panics, nobody frets or complains (well, not very
loudly, anyway); everybody just gets his or her job done.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all is Terry Lickona, a slim,
unassuming-looking man who has been producing the show since its
fourth season, in 1979. He's the first person Brooks shakes hands
with when he enters the studio, he's going to be one of the last
people out of the building after the show wraps around 11:30 p.m.,
and he is clearly in quiet control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it is pretty simple _ the emphasis has always been on
straightforward presentations of music with no gimmicks,'' he says,
sitting in a corridor, the sound of Garth's drummer going a sound
test getting resounding from down the hall. ``My vision has always
been to have a broad cross section of American roots music _ people
with a unique voice _ but also as a sort of window on Austin to the
rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lickona is obviously pleased that Brooks is here, as much as he
is still unhappy that Linda Ronstadt blew off an appearance on the
show just a few days earlier, despite the fact that she and Emmylou
Harris had played a show in Austin the night before the scheduled
``ACL'' date.
</P>
<P>
   The show had already been publicized in ``TV Guide,'' and
Lickona had reacted with highly uncharacteristic anger for such a
low-key, amiable man, at one point comparing Ronstadt with Jabba
the Hutt.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to focus on that now, other than to say he's
still honked off, but one could hardly fault him. The Ronstadt
no-show, like Brooks' appearance, highlights just how demanding his
job is. Lickona must nail down the acts for the 13 new shows that
air during an ``ACL'' season, which is February through May. As
taping is typically done between August and January, this means
that he usually sits down in late spring with a wish list of acts
he'd like to have for the next season.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is, he's having to balance numerous factors: Who is
touring? Who is coming through Texas, or who can be persuaded to
make a detour through Austin? How many male and female acts are
there? Newbies and superstars? Austin and Texas performers and
national acts? People who have appeared on the show before and
those who never have? Bluesmen and jazzers? Veteran rockers and old
R&AMP;B singers?
</P>
<P>
   Add to all this Lickona's own Holy Grail performers, which
presently include Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.
Lickona has been working on snagging these folks (and Ronstadt and
Brooks) for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases he's come close (Parton, he says, is a probable
for sometime in 2000) and others, such as the Boss, he admits, have
never given him any response. But he keeps on plugging; getting
somebody like Brooks to give one day of his life to ``ACL'' can
mean literally years of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But when it happens, it often happens fast: After five years of
work, ``ACL'' had 10 days' notice that Brooks would do the show.
This is the way ``ACL'' works: Shows are filmed based on artist
availability, not on a set show schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we'll have a windfall,'' Lickona says. ``And
frankly, sometimes I prefer less lead time _ it means the date is
less likely to change. I never give up. Persistence pays off.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the historical thing that's interesting is that `ACL' is
something a whole generation of artists have grown up with. When
Alan Jackson was here, he made the comment that when he was growing
up, this was the closest thing he had to seeing a live show. Seeing
George Jones here made an impression on him because he couldn't, in
the little town in Georgia where he grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1974, though, there was not a whole lot of vision,
just a bunch of guys at KLRU who loved the progressive/outlaw
country music so in vogue in the city at that time and who wanted
to get it on television. The three were Bill Arhos, Paul Bosner and
Bruce Scafe, and when PBS started its common market in 1973, they
decided to try to get some Austin music broadcast around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a proposal and got $13,000 to do a pilot,'' says
Arhos, who is still the show's executive producer. ``The Armadillo
World Headquarters was bringing in all these musicians, and we got
B.W. (Stevenson) and Willie. B.W. was actually bigger, at the time,
with `My Maria.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't draw as well in Austin; 600 people showed up for
his taping, while Willie drew 1,000. They went with Willie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in the can and didn't even have a name yet,'' Arhos
says. ``We went to a programming meeting in Washington, D.C., and I
took a break and sat in the park and ``Macon County Line'' was
playing across the street. It really had a good ring to it and I
told Paul, and he said, `Well, instead of ``Travis County Line''
how about ``Austin City Limits?'' ' ''
</P>
<P>
   The show was played during a PBS pledge drive and drew well;
Arhos had a selling point and got the nod to do the first season,
whose first show premiered Jan. 7, 1976. The first year it was all
Austin bands _ Alvin Crow, Steve Fromholz, Marcia Ball _ with a few
San Antonio ringers, such as Flaco Jimenez and Charlie Daniels,
thrown in for spice.
</P>
<P>
   But just as ``ACL'' was trying to make a name for itself, the
outlaw country scene was dwindling. The next few years, Arhos says,
were tough. There were times when he had to get on the radio and
beg people to attend the tapings _ during the show's third season,
only 300 people showed up to see Merle Travis.
</P>
<P>
   The show had several aces in the hole, though. One was the lack
of other outlets for musicians on television; these, remember, were
the days before MTV and VCRs, and save for one band doing two shows
per week on ``Saturday Night Live'' and a few others, there was no
way to see bands on the tube _ and certainly not guys like Willie,
John Prine, Jerry Jeff Walker or Gatemouth Brown. Another was UT
football coach Darrell Royal, who coaxed his old pal Merle Haggard
to play the show's third season.

FOR QUEEN, PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is said that revenge is a dish best served cold, but
Queen Elizabeth II apparently has decided that the royal family's
answer to Mohamed Al Fayed and his conspiracy theories will be a
nice, hot pudding _ 1,411 of them, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since August 1997, when his son Dodi died with Diana,
Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris, Fayed, the owner of
Harrods, London's most famous department store, has been claiming
that the couple was assassinated by British secret agents.
</P>
<P>
   Fayed insists that the British establishment could not stomach
the idea of Diana, mother to the heir of the throne, marrying Dodi
and bearing Muslim children.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the couple had only started dating, that there
were no wedding plans, and that a French judge has ruled that one
of Fayed's employees, the couple's chauffeur, killed the couple and
himself while driving drunk as he sp ay from paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   Fayed has produced no evidence to support his claims. But last
month, wile testifying in a slander case brought against him by a
former politician whom he said he had paid for favors, Fayed
expounded on his conspiracy theory. He said that Prince Philip, the
queen's husband, was the brains behind the assassination plot.
</P>
<P>
   Even Prince Philip's detractors rose to his defense, though
their assertion that he was not bright enough to carry out such an
elaborate conspiracy was a classic case of damning with faint
praise.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and serious commentators here have treated Fayed's
accusations with derision. Some say the Egyptian-born Fayed's
frustration over failing to get British citizenship is at the root
of his claims.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the royal family turns the other cheek when its
members are libeled or slandered. It is considered bad form to do
otherwise. But this time, the Buckingham Palace crowd did not get
mad, they got even. They hit Fayed where it really hurts: the cash
register.
</P>
<P>
   There is, it turns out, a price to be paid for peddling
conspiracy theories. In Fayed's case, that price is about $40,000
worth of traditional Christmas puddings that the queen buys as
presents for her household staff.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the queen has treated her staff to the Super Luxury
Christmas Pudding from Harrods, at about $30 a pop. But at the
urging of Andrew Farquharson, assistant to the Master of the Royal
Household, the queen recently tasted the matured Cristmas pudding
from Tesco, a British supermarket chain. The queen was suitably
impressed, and next week 1,411 of the Tesco puddings will be
distributedo the staff at the royal family's various residences.
</P>
<P>
   While no one would ever confuse the luxurious Harrods store in
Kensington with the ubiquitous Tesco supermarkets that are spread
across Britain, the Tesco pudding recipe has upscale roots. It was
prepared by Anton Edelmann, head chef at the Savoy Hotel, one of
London's finest.
</P>
<P>
   At Buckingham Palace, a spokeswoman denies that the change in
puddings has anything to do with Fayed's attacks on the royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't react to allegations,'' insisted Clare Sillars, the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Poppycock, say other palace insiders, who are delighted by the
queen's ability to simultaneously snub Fayed and score points with
the masses who shop at Tesco. The Tesco 2-pound pudding costs less
than half of Harrods' 3-pounder. Since Diana's death, the queen has
been keen to make gestures that make the royal family more
accessible and relevant to the public.
</P>
<P>
   There are some at the palace who hope the royal family goes the
next step and strips Harrods of its royal warrant. Harrods is one
of about 800 businesses whose supplying of goods and services to
the royal family has earned them a royal warrant, a prestigious
seal of quality. The warrants are reviewed every five years, and
Harrods' is under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   While turning the other cheek has its merits, and the quality of
Harrods' merchandise is undisputed, there are some at the palace
who believe it is outrageous for the royal household to patronize
the business of someone who routinely slanders the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the queen's genersy is not boundless. One man who worked
for the palace for half the year, walking the queen's dogs, willnot
be getting a pudding. He was caught plying the queen's corgis with
gin.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another story.

AUSTIN, Texas: third season. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it was Willie Nelson who really saved the day. His ``Red
Headed Stranger'' LP was slowly gaining ground, making him a
country legend and attracting attention among rock critics, and
thanks to his debut show and other appearance, he (and his
mystique) became associated with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his show, `Stranger' came back on the charts and stayed
there 48 weeks,'' Arhos says. ``Pat Metheny's LP went from No. 12
to No. 2 on the jazz charts after he played. So we had a selling
point for musicians and booking agents. We didn't make people a
star, but if they had label support, it certainly did help people
become stars.''
</P>
<P>
   This is called momentum, and suddenly ``ACL'' had it. The fourth
season saw Tom Waits and the Neville Brothers stop in, and the
fifth season featured a songwriter's special, with Willie, Hank
Cochran, Ray Price and others. (The Austin-skyline backdrop,
incidentally, wasn't put in place until the seventh season, in
1982).
</P>
<P>
   And right from the first few seasons, ``ACL'' proved to be an
important vehicle for performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show allowed people to experience music on TV like they
never had before, with artists really relating to the audience,''
says Bobby Bridger, who appeared on the show's first and third
seasons. ``And they were concerned with good music, not who had a
record deal or who had been on the Carson show the night before.
The show solidified me in Texas, that I was part of the Texas music
scene and that I was there to stay. It meant the world to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Roundtable _ or theme _ shows have become one of ``ACL's''
signatures; it gives numerous performers exposure and continues to
focus on the show's folk/country roots.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the genre, though, there has been no question for some
time now that ``ACL'' gets results, from better bookings to a
better showing on the charts. For smaller labels, it is one of the
best ways _ if not the best _ of getting their music to a national
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the primary vehicle for promoting roots music _ that's
it,'' says Barry Poss, president of North Carolina's Sugar Hill
Records. Numerous Sugar Hill artists, from Guy Clark to the late
Townes Van Zandt to Doc Watson, have appeared on the show, and
every time one does, Poss says, there's a spike in interest and
sales.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, though, ``there's the prestige factor,'' says
Poss. ``It means an artist has arrived, that you're at the top of
your game. And the fact that it's so performance-driven means it's
the perfect artist vehicle. Basically, you have the premier club of
American roots music in your living room every week. There's
something magical about those performances.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin favorite Joe Ely, who has appeared on the show seven
times, calls it ``the David Letterman show of Texas. The first time
I did it (in 1980) I was scared to death _ it was a really big
deal. All my favorite songwriters had been on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first did it and went out on tour, I was surprised how
broad an audience it had in America. People always told me they had
seen me on the show, and they still do. It's a great scene _
there's no place like it for a good sound, a great stage. They do
everything right there.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Back in the studio, the drummer's endless whacking has,
mercifully, been replaced by Brooks and company doing ``Rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of the past leads to talk of the present and the future.
Lickona says he wants, someday, to double the long-standing
schedule of 13 shows per year, ``and still do the Texas artists and
the Tom Waitses and the Leonard Cohens.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has lasted for so long for a number of reasons, not
least of which is that it's never had a celebrity host, which meant
its star was never hitched to any one person's career.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Lickona says, being on PBS frees the show of the pressure
to get ratings that it would have encountered on a commercial
network. It also means the finished product won't be broken up by
commercials, which detract from the flow of what's happening
onstage: On a good night, ``ACL'' can still feel like a peek into
the concert of your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Lickona says he feels little competition with VH1
because few ``ACL'' artists would ever be seen there anyway. The
show, he says, can both stand solidly outside music trends and be a
reflection of them.

   ``In the first five years, we had four female artists and two of

the same way as we always have.

CANDLES SOOTHE OUR SENSES BUT COULD THEY ALSO BE HARMING OUR
HEALTH?
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by BC-CANDLE-TIPS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, I have acquired enough candles to make a beautiful
candlescape of flickering light and aromatherapy on my dining-room
table. My bad luck holds, though: I have done so just as the
flourishing $2.3 billion a year candle industry is hit by a
controversy over indoor-air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of recent articles says candles are a health hazard.
Among the concerns expressed in news reports: that metal wicks can
release lead into the home; the flames can send out dangerous
amounts of soot; and that melting wax can release toxins. A Plano,
Texas, couple filed suit in September alleging that candles they
purchased at The Gap, and which they burned for several hours a
day, created soot problems in their home.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap has responded in the same way as U.S. candle makers,
saying that candles are safe unless misused by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the answer? Until the industry resolves the conflict,
a safe step for the consumer is to avoid metal wicks and to limit
exposure to candle emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy erupted this fall after a University of Michigan
study said that in spite of an agreement 26 years ago by U.S.
candle makers to voluntarily banish lead from metal-core wicks,
several U.S. candles with zinc-cored wicks tested positive for lead
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lead was detected in small quantities in emissions from
zinc-based wicks, suggesting that the lead may be a common
contaminant in the zinc, wick or wax,'' Jerome Nriagu, a University
of Michigan professor of environmental health, says in a summary of
his study.
</P>
<P>
   Nriagu's study showed that one-third of the 15 candles he tested
from the United States and overseas released more lead into the air
than is recommended as safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. Amounts of lead in the air increased the longer the candles
burned. Lead emissions were the worst from candles made in China
and the United States, Nriagu said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Candle Association, a trade organization in
Washington, D.C., challenges the study, saying its independent
tests show that zinc wick cores are widely used in U.S. candles and
are safe. Candle sellers complain that the study doesn't say which
brands were tested, nor does it say if the ``small amounts'' of
lead in zinc-cored wicks were enough to actually cause health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Experts _ specifically a NASA scientist, a professor of
environmental health, and a major retailer's manager in charge of
meeting government regulations _ agree that candles do have the
potential to create unhealthful air, but each says that danger can
be avoided if some basic safety tips are followed, such as: don't
let the candles smoke; use candles with cotton or paper wicks; and
burn groups of candles in the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   It's relatively easy to find candles with cotton or paper wicks.
Eighty percent of U.S.-made wicks are all cotton or paper, says Jeb
Head, president of Atkins &AMP; Pearce, Covington, Ky., the nation's
largest wick maker. Metal wicks, which are used to keep the wick
rigid in some candle shapes and types of wax, are most likely to be
found in votives or unusually shaped candles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of smoke. David Urban, chief of
microgravity combustion science at NASA's Glenn Research Center in
Cleveland, says the combustion byproducts of candle flames are
largely controllable. Urban has made a career out of researching
smoke and flame patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Keep them out of drafts, and trim the wicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to limit the wick size to limit the amount of fuel
released into the flame,'' Urban said. ``The longer the wick, the
more wax vaporizes into the flame.'' Drafts cause candles to
flicker, and smoke is released when the flame is disturbed, he
said. ``A little flicker is OK, but not the big flickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Flickers cause smoke, and that leads to problems of soot, the
airborne partially burned particles that can settle as dust or be
inhaled. All flames have soot, or they will not emit much light and
they'll be blue, like the flame of a gas burner, Urban said.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when candles were used for light, our grandmothers or
great-grandmothers knew that smoky candles made a house dirty. Back
then, candle makers developed self-trimming wicks that curl as they
burn and don't release as much smoke. But now, with candle sales
that are growing at a rate the National Candle Association says is
10 to 15 percent a year, we are burning more, and we may have
forgotten what used to be common wisdom, Urban said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   If lead and soot aren't enough to worry about, candles contain
various other agents released into the air when burned, such as
fragrances, wax and dyes.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are again left in the dark over the issue of these
``fumes,'' without any guidance from studies or government
recommendations on which candles are safest to burn and how many
are safe to burn at once.
</P>
<P>
   The state of California, under its Proposition 65 Safe Drinking
Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, has identified at least
seven toxins in candles' waxes, including benzene, a carcinogen.
Under Proposition 65, a California attorney recently filed an
``intention to file suit'' against 33 candle makers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``intention to file'' notice gives candle makers and sellers
in California 60 days to reformulate their product or put warning
labels on candles, or be sued. That case is not resolved, said Lana
Beckett, a spokeswoman for ``Prop 65 News,'' a publication that
tracks cases filed under the act. California's attorney general or
county district attorneys can join in the suit if they believe it
has merit, but so far they have not, Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission has stayed away
from the issue. Spokesman Ken Giles said the commission has
recalled certain candle lines if the wick produced too high a flame
or if the container broke. But he said the commission doubts most
people have enough exposure to large quantities of candle emissions
to make an inquiry into fumes worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Thorough documentation on exposure has yet to be done and will
be a complicated prospect at best because candles are made of so
many different substances and burned under so many different
conditions, said John A. Baker, senior manager for government
regulations at Pier 1 headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he burns candles at home, where he groups them in his
fireplace, because he is often burning several at a time to see how
they burn. Any candle smoke will go up the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientist Urban burns candles at home, too, choosing the
classic dinner-table candle known as a taper, which he said
releases the least amount of smoke. Even University of Michigan
professor Nriagu, whose study helped fuel this fire, burns candles
at home _ no metal-wicked ones, of course.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I'll burn cotton-wicked candles, maybe just a couple
at a time, and keep them away from drafts.

   _ Candles with all-cotton or all-paper wicks are the safest bet,
at least until the controversy is settled over metal-core wicks.
</P>
<P>
   _ To test wicks for heavy lead content: A major U.S. wick
manufacturer recommends snipping off a small piece of wick. Strip
it of wax and soot, then rub the small metal wire against a sheet
of white paper. If it's mostly lead content, it will leave dark
marks on the paper, says Jeb Head, president of wick maker Atkins &AMP;
Pearce, Covington, Ky. However, the test will not reveal trace
amounts of lead, which can be harmful, depending on how many are
burned and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large numbers of candles are best burned in the fireplace, so
emissions can escape.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PHOENIX: ... with me.''   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another official who chose a candidate other than Symington,
Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza, expected to run unopposed for mayor in
1995. But Telda Williams, who entered the race against him, said
she did so because McCain and Symington asked her to. ``They wanted
to send Skip a message,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Against that divisive backdrop, some prominent Republicans who
supported Barrett and Democratic nominee Eddie Basha received tax
audit notices from the state Revenue Department, only to be told
later that the notices had been sent in error, according to several
Republicans. Rick DeGraw, who ran Basha's campaign, said that among
the Basha supporters who received similar notices was Grant Woods's
father, contractor Joe Woods. The former attorney general confirmed
these accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After Symington's 1996 indictment, Keegan became the first
prominent elected Republican to call for his resignation. For that
stance against Symington, she said, she incurredMcCain's wrah.
</P>
<P>
   She also soon received a state tax audit notice. ``If you made
the governor uncmfortable, you ended up with a tax audit notice. It
was not a coincidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Symington, whose conviction was later
overturned and remains on appeal, were unavailing. McCain and
Gullett said they were unaware of the audit notices. If anything
like that occurred, McCain said, prosecutors should investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recollection of others, McCain said he played a
minimal role in the 1994 governor's race. He was, he said, merely
trying to avoid a split in the party and sought to dissuade Barrett
from running only because party officials asked him to.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Phoenix officials who in 1993 successfully battled
McCain's effort to have a new regional airport built between
Phoenix and Tucson, a different sort of audit was in order.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after he pulled out of the fight, McCain asked the US
Department of Transportation to investigate leases at the city-run
Sky Harbor airport. He also asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to look into public safety costs at Sky Harbor. When
the first audit raised questions about low lease rates, McCain
suggested that federal funds for a third runway might be
jeopardized unless the city took corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   City and airport officials accused McCain of retaliating. The
senator denied doing so, but the Arizona Gazette, which
consistently endorsed the senator, editorialized that McCain's
actions hinted at a ``petty, mean vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator's request for the investigations was in
retaliation for our opposition to h regional airport, there's no
question about it,'' recalled Ed Korrick, who was a member of the
airport's advisory board in 1993. ``He's been upset with a lot of
Phoenix mayors: They don't do what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so Mayor Rimsza: He recently endorsed McCain, saying in an
interview that he did so because ``you don't embarrass an Arizonan
when he's up against a Texan. We're family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans who have talked with Rimsza said fear of McCain
helped make up his mind. He wants passage of a city referendum to
increase the sales tax to fund public transit, and sought insurance
that McCain would not obstruct the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Former attorney general Woods, by his own account, was one
official who refused to buckle. McCain was his mentor. Woods was
McCain's first top assistant when he went to Congress. Yet when
Woods was elected attorney general in 1990, it did not take long
for the relationship to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said McCain called him twice and objected ``in his
inimitable style'' that his office was investigating Symington. ``I
expected he would understand it was my job. He took it more as
disloyalty,'' Woods said. ``He's from a military background, and
really believes in a pecking order. In the military, you salute
your superiors, regardless of the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said McCain's approach ``wasn't appropriate,'' although
McCain did not ask him to drop the inquiry. He added: ``We stopped
the conversation short of him interfering unethically.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Woods's account is baseless. Rather, as McCain
recalls it, their estrangement is due partly to Woods's refusa to
accept McCain's solution to an Indian gaming dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I think you ought to approach the Iian gaming issue
this way, and why don't you do that?'' McCain sd. ``And he said to
me, quote, `That's a stupid idea.' I hung up the phone and we had
no further conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of McCain's outsized presence and the aggressive
tendencies of his Arizona staff has left some GOP stalwarts here
intimidated. But it has also at times led to McCain being blamed
for the tough handiwork of aides, and, it appears, to some lore
about McCain's hot-tempered intrusiveness that doesn't hold up to
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   One such case concerns state Representative Karen Johnson, a
strident social issues conservative, who said in an interview last
week that before she won political office McCain sought to have her
sacked from three public sector jobs over several years.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Globe interviewed her former superiors, all of them
said they had never been contacted by McCain about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that John McCain has a temper. I've seen
it. And Republicans fear him,'' said David S. Schweickert, who
employed Johnson when he was the state Senate GOP whip. ``But some
of his key staff have always had too much free rein, and they play
politics pretty rough. So if it rains on your wedding day, they get
blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, McCain and US Representative Jim Kolbe were
in a Phoenix coffeehouse when a woman approached McCain and told
him she thought McCain and other senators who voted to convict
President Clinton were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing the tactful reply that is second nature to most
poticians, McCain replied: ``You think lying under oath is OK? You
think obstruction of justice is OK?'' When the woman said she was
just expressing herself as a constituent, McCain said: ``Well, I've
got 4 million other constituents. And they don't think lying under
oath and obstructing justice is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of John's personality. He can be provoked,'' said
Mike Hellon, a member of the Republican National Committee from
Tucson and a friend of McCain. ``But where John McCain has been in
life and what he has done for the state and the country are so
remarkable that a lot of people, myself included, look right past a
lot of things we would find annoying in others.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is little turnover in McCain's staff, which is
devoted to him. Interns in his office call him John: He insists on
it. Most often, McCain is uncommonly cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   And he is also known for compassion and for surprising acts of
forgiveness: It was McCain, unnoticed for months, who kept a
regular vigil at the deathbed of former Arizona congressman Morris
K. Udall, a Democrat. Long before that, McCain reached across a
deep ideological chasm to forge a friendship with David Ifshin,
whose antiwar speech from Hanoi in 1970 was broadcast into the
prison cell where McCain lay, weak from the beatings he endured
from his captors.
</P>
<P>
   When Ifshin died of cancer at age 47 in 1996, McCain was among
those who eulogized him. From his friend David, McCain said, ``I
learned the futility of looking back in anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Measured against that side of McCain, his 1991 telephone call to
Dianne Smi, then a 63-year-old Phoenix widow, seems inexplicable.
As she recalled it last week, Smith was upset when McCain
challenged Anita Hill's credibility before her testimony against
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   So Smith wrote her first-ever letter to a public official, a
short handwritten note to McCain expressing her annoyance at what
he had said. ``I didn't think it was rude or impolite,'' Smith
said. ``I mailed it and forgot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks later, Smith's phone rang. It was McCain. For
several minutes, she said, McCain ``ranted on and on about what a
nerve I had to question his integrity. He was shouting, he was mad.
I was absolutely taken aback. It didn't make sense. I wasn't
somebody important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just listened. It was such an experience to have a US
senator yelling at me on the phone,'' she said. When McCain
finished shouting, she said, he simply hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the call, McCain said it never happened. Besides, he
said, he never challenged Hill's credibility. But a search of news
archives shows that he did _ just as Smith remembered it, before
Hill testified.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain's temper became an issue in the campaign, he and
his aides have sought to recast his temper as his passion for
issues, and his anger as frustration with government waste and
corruption. And in interviews, supporters sometimes use euphemisms
to describe behavior that baffles many otherwise admiring
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gets stuff done by butting heads,'' said McInturff. State
Senator Marc Spitzer said McCain ``is not timorous. When he gets
involved in Arizona politics, sometimes he goes overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's supporters dismiss the notion that his temper is in
any way disqualifying. Rpresentative Kolbe, among others, sees it
as a plus, saying, ``His impatience with the way things re may be
exactly what voters are looking for in a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Gullett, as much McCain's Arizona alter ego as anyone:
``Every day when he wakes up, he knows he shouldn't be alive. So he
doesn't want it written on his tombstone, `He's a wonderful, sweet
man.' He wants it to read, `He did great things.' ''

OVERLAPPING VIEWS ON RACE BIND BRADLEY, CORNEL WEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In coming weeks, Bill Bradley, candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, will be on a mission. Traveling through
churches, shops, parks, and beauty salons, he will be courting
ordinary folk in the South _ the region most resistant to his
challenge to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him will be Cornel West, Harvard Afro-American Studies
professor, Bradley's friend, his Massachusetts cochairman, and a
key adviser in a campaign the former senator repeatedly says hinges
on race.
</P>
<P>
   Already West, 46, a powerful, preacher-like speaker, has
introduced Bradley at a dozen events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't just endorse Bill Bradley,'' he said at a Washington
reception in September. ``Endorse is too weak and impoverished a
term. I'm in solidarity with him because he's my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But as West moves from the forgiving world of academia into the
hazardous arena of presidential politics, increasing numbers of
observers _ black and white, from politics and academia _ say there
is reason to believe that mainstream voters will be dismayed by his
views.
</P>
<P>
   The author regularly takes positions to the far left of what
voters have come to exct of national politics in recent years, in
which the middle ground has become hallowed. He proclaims himself
both a radical and a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy of white supremacy'' still runs deep in America, he
has said.
</P>
<P>
   He has vociferously condemned welfare reform, and criticized
President Clinton and the Democratic Party for having no
``intention of responding to the concerns of African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   He laments the subordination of workers, and American
imperialism, and he sees a cure for many of America's ills in a
redistribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   He decries ``multinational corporate capitalism, with its
bankrupt and authoritarian-like state,'' and describes prisons and
police as ``forms of institutionalized state violence against
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is going on the road with the man who wants to lead the
very institutions he has been attacking for years.
</P>
<P>
   West concedes that Bradley might not endorse everything he
stands for, pegging the candidate as libera but ``experimental''
rather than radical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley and I we never agreed on everything,'' West said.
``When you're a brother, and a friend, and comrade, you accent what
you overlap, and you're candid with your disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley bristls when asked if he agrees with all of West's
positions, saying they are separate people who agree and disagree
on various issues. And both he and West assert that their
relationship is more personal than ideological.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes for a lively friendship might not translate so
well into the electorate. In this campaign, advisers have been fair
game: Gore was pilloried recently for accepting the counsel of
popular feminist author Naomi Wolf. And hile some observers think
West might help Bradley among black voters, others wonder if West's
views could harm him among whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (West's ideas) will play on a national stage,''
said Shelby Steele, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University, and a conservative black academic frequently
at odds with West. ``They will be seen as far left, and kooky, and
they will hurt Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has told the stories dozens of times already: of his
Aunt Bub, whose every utterance of the N-word cut him afresh; of
traveling with his baseball team in segregated Joplin, Mo., and
having to stay at third-rate motels because the decent ones would
not admit his black teammates; of seeing racism firsthand as a
white basketball player traveling wih a mostly black New York
Knicks team.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he made several addresses on race, and spoke
often, as he still does, of ``white skin privilege.'' After the
Rodney King beating, Bradley took to the Senate floor and made a
dramatic speech, hitting the podium 56 times, once for each time
King was struck.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has said repeatedly that he is staking his campaign on
his wish for racial unity: ``It is not a political position; it's
my core,'' he said at the annual Rainbow/PUSH convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was convinced that a message of racial healing would
attract not just black voters, but also white ones, 30 percent of
whom, he said, ``want a deeper level of racial unity.'' His vision
of improved race relations is centered on ``building multiracial
coalitions'' to solve issues such as chl poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm wrong,'' he told the Globe recently, ``I'm toast.''
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, he has aggressively courted black voters, not
through the usual Democratic Party channels, which Gore has all but
sewn up, but in more activist quarters, chiefly by cutting to the
left of the vice president, and reaching beyond the establishment,
attracting celebrity endorsements.

   Making race such a large part of his campaign is unwise
politically, said Ronald Walters, a professor at the University of
Maryland, College Park, and deputy campaign chairman for Jesse
Jackson's two presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't counsel my candidate to put race front and center,
because the issue of race has been the source of so much
alienation, especially among whites,'' Walters said. ``It's race
that has driven whites away from the Democratic Party, to conceive
of (it) as the party of blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   West, for his part, thinks it is entirely possible to talk about
race in a way that appeals to all kinds of voters. And though
Bradley downplays West's influence on his policies, West
illustrates this point by citing the role racial discrimination
plays in child poverty, just as Bradley did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley puts child poverty front and center,'' West said.
``He understands he's talking about race through the prisms of what
our responsibilities are as citizens. It's different from putting
race out there in raw form. It's part of a discourse about
citizenship in which race plays a role; that's the way to do i'

<P>
   West and Bradley met in 1990, when West was a professor of
religion and Afro-American studies at Princeton. Bradley, a
Princeton graduate and US senator from New Jersey, convened a
regular gathering of intellectuals, ``with the purpose of
discussing the prospects of the American republic, and the future
of American democracy,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   West, who held professorships at Yale and Princeton before his
colleague, Henry Louis Gates Jr., enticed him to join the
Afro-American studies department at Harvard in 1994, talked
publicly about his disillusionment with the Democratic Party not so
long ago, similar to Bradley's when he left the Senate. Changes in
the welfare system turned West against the Clinton administration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His signing the welfare reform bill was the straw that broke
the camel's back,'' West told an interviewer in 1997. ``You just
can't play games with people's lives like that.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he has expressed his objections in class terms,
suggesting that welfare recipients should not be punished until big
corporations are weaned from government subsidies: ``We needed
welfare reform, but not pushing the poor out on their own,'' West
explained recently. ``I wanted to begin with corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Bradley is different, West signed on to the
campaign as an unpaid adviser, squeezing in his stumping for
Bradley among his many speaking engagements and book-promotion
trips. He introduced Bradley to the Congressional Black Caucus in
August; took him to meet witthe Rev. Al Sharpton and his supporters
in Harlem; introduced him before a speech on race relaions at
Cooper Union College in New York City; and appeared with him at a
Washington gala packed with black celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a union in the way they see the world with respect
to the issue of race,'' said Walters, who is black.

   LAS VEGAS _ Perhaps only in Las Vegas could there be a theater
show featuring a 1.5 million-gallon water tank in which the cast
dives, swims, or dances on a hydraulically lifted floor that moves
up and down in pieces _ allowing dancing on one part and diving on
another _ while transporting fiberglass horses from their
underwater berths.
</P>
<P>
   It's an engineering spectacle raised to high art _ and it's the
theme of the mind-blowing, $70 million Cirque du Soleil show called
``O'' (adapted from the French word for water, ``eau'') now playing
at the 1,800-seat Bellagio Theatre, which was built expressly for
this production.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has always lured gamblers to its casinos, but the new
game in town is to lure theatergoers looking for spectacular,
post-Broadway thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cirque du Soleil's ``O,'' which has sold out weeks in
advance and is considered the hottest ticket in Vegas (at $100 and
$90 each), is not your father's Broadway show. Nor is it something
that will ever tour _ hence its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shows like this are taking the place of the old feather shows
with the dancing girls,'' said Las Vegas Review-Journal
entertainment reporter Mike Weatherford. ``And you can't do these
on Broadway, because Broadway theaters are ancient. You can't put a
water pool into a Broadway theater.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you can't, certainly not a 1.5 million gallon pool, as
conceived by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil production team,
which worked for two years to build the Bellagio Theatre. It's
designed to be an avant-garde version of the Paris Opera House, but
with a pool that is 25 feet deep, measures 150 by 100 feet, and has
108 incandescent underwater lights.
</P>
<P>
   The ``O'' show, which is running indefinitely, features
synchronized swimmers and sultry alien creatures in waterproof
makeup, along with bungee jumpers, contortionists, trapeze acts,
and gymnasts who do aerial acrobatics on parallel bars attached to
a hoisted, stainless-steel boat. The boat is raised by a ceiling
carousel with four winches that can lift 1,000 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   It's an awesome spectacle by any definition, enhanced by upwards
of 4 million watts of light. It even makes most stadium-sized rock
'n' roll productions look like amateur hours.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has another Cirque du Soleil show, ``Mystere,''
playing at the Treasure Island Hotel. While ``O'' has been running
for just a year, ``Mystere,'' which has a more human element and
includes taiko drummers, has been going for six years and has drawn
3 million patrons.
</P>
<P>
   There are now seven different Cirque du Soleil productions
playing on four continents.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the Cirque shows the only mega-productions in this city
in the desert. The MGM Grand has ``EFX.'' And the new Mandalay Bay
has the Broadway-style ``Chicago.'' All have done a brisk business
and given Las Vegas a new cachet in the theater world.
</P>
<P>
   These long-running shows cost a fortune to produce, but are
based on the theory that the money will be made back once the
tourists start to roll in. And if they stop, there always seems to
be more money to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Las Vegas Hilton. Once known for booking Elvis Presley,
its entertainment center changed five years ago from a concert room
with chandeliers and tables to the ``Starlight Express,'' starring
performers on rollerskates racing around extended ramps to the
music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Then last year it was changed back to
a concert venue, at enormous expense.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what will happen to the Bellagio Theatre once
``O'' finishes, but there's no need to worry about that at the
moment. Whether it's Mom and Dad coming to Vegas for the weekend,
or corporate expense-account types coming for a convention, all
seem eager to see the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the Bellagio one afternoon and I couldn't believe how
many people were standing in a waiting line to see if they could
pick up any canceled tickets for that evening's show,'' said
Weatherford. ``In Vegas, you hear a lot about how shows are sold
out, when really, the casinos always pull tickets so they can give
them away to gamblers and VIPs. But `O' seems to be seriously sold
out all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, really, is it any wonder? How many blackjack tables can a
visitor stand? How many slot machines? Vegas is trying to make sure
that if the city's core vices don't sell, then at least people can
get some unforgettable theater for their dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, Broadway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The poet Robert Penn Warren was once described as a man
who looked as if he was about to throw you off his land. The same
can still be said of John Silber.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of Boston University has not gone gently
into that good night. At 73, he remains all edge. Silber is still
the bantam who slashes at intellectual opposition the way
Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest savaged Union lines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his failed gubernatorial bid in 1990, politics still
interests him _ he abhors life at the margins. And he focuses on
the issues central to any presidential campaign: education, foreign
policy, and the military.
</P>
<P>
   While he has three books to finish, the man chafes at the
thought of a contemplative pace. Chancellor of the institution
since he retired as BU president in 1996, Silber maintains two
shifts of secretaries to arrange his peripatetic schedule of
speeches and fund-raising across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before John McCain's temper became an issue in this
presidential campaign, John Silber's dander was on parade. During
the long arc of his years in academe and politics, it shaped his
public persona, endearing him to some while appalling others. Love
Silber or hate him, Boston seemed a richer place when he was in the
fray.
</P>
<P>
   He is hard on himself and everyone around him, yet he claims to
have no idea why he scares friend and foe alike. For all of his
acute perceptions about others, he fails to recognize his own
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I suppose because there are a lot of people who
don't ever want to be challenged with the truth,'' he offered as
explanation for the fear he generates. ``I think anybody who leads
people and has ideas is going to scare some people who don't want
to work or who don't have any aspirations. It goes with the
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Ronald Reagan never scared people to achieve
what he wanted. Nor did Franklin Roosevelt. And one is hard-pressed
to name a university leader who has generated the tumult this man
has. But Silber is uncomfortable with routine, not anger, and it is
through this emotion that he finds comforting links with larger
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Truman had one hell of a temper,'' he said from his
grand office overlooking the Charles River. ``They'd say, `Give 'em
hell Harry,' and Harry would say, `I don't give them hell. I just
tell the truth and they think it's hell.' That's the same thing I'd
say about myself on a smaller scale. And that's what I'd say about
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's problem isn't his temper. It's money. If he had
two-thirds the money that Bush has, I think he'd be doing very
well. Most people greatly admire the man's integrity. I wouldn't
have the gall to challenge the character of John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber scoffs at the notion that he smells fear in others and
exploits it mercilessly. ``That's a lot of crap,'' he said.
``That's the kind of cheap psychology you have to put up with
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And he denies that he holds a grudge, even against Channel 5's
Natalie Jacobson for her interview with him in which he lost his
temper a few days before Election Day in 1990. ``If I had been a
more experienced candidate, she would have been in my house for 15
minutes, not two hours,'' he said. ``That's not Natalie's fault. I
don't blame Natalie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a hater,'' he maintained. ``I have too much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber has always considered himself a liberal and seems
flummoxed by the perception that he is a conservative. He addressed
this in an article about liberalism in May in the journal The New
Criterion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I face the issue baffled, and my bafflement is personal as
well as conceptual,'' he wrote. ``I have almost always thought of
myself as a liberal, yet in the marketplace of ideas I am almost
always called a conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber argues that his strong record on civil rights, his
opposition to the death penalty, and his defense of First Amendment
rights at the University of Texas and Boston University secure his
liberal credentials. He blames attacks from the left on its
penchant to eat its own. ``One is not liberal but an ideologue if
one joins the thought police to enforce political correctness in
society and especially in academe,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that his vilification warms the contrarian in
Silber. He cannot operate in a vacuum. He adores the idea that BU
marches to its own drummer. ``What I am proudest of is that this is
a major university and it is probably the least politically correct
university in the country,'' he said in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Silber remains an unreconstructed meritocrat. He champions
access over outcome. Nothing sends him ballistic faster than what
he terms ideological demands for equality of achievement rather
than equality of opportunity. The former, he believes, diminish the
struggle he deems essential in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time you have equality of achievement is if you cut
everybody down to the lowest common denominator,'' he said. ``We'll
all get down to the level of Down syndrome. Is that what you want?
That's equality? Or maybe it has to be worse than that. Maybe it
has to be the equality of Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath this dyspeptic carapace lies a tender pride that often
has been punctured over the years, and a yearning for acceptance
that has never come to him. Boston has never embraced Silber or his
institution. He is oblivious to the possibility that he may have
had something to do with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this hostility to Boston University that is
unrelenting,'' he said. ``This is the thing that has disappointed
me most: the political hostility to a university that has played
the game and done more for this city relative to its strengths than
any other institution around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber's bile toward Harvard, and the ``cream-puff articles'' he
finds in The Boston Globe, is pungent. ``Harvard has done nothing
for the community compared to Boston University,'' he said. ``We
could itemize that very easily in terms of scholarships we give,
the services we provide, the work we do in Chelsea. You have these
sweetheart articles on Northeastern, on Boston College, on Harvard.
You don't get them on Boston University.''
</P>
<P>
   His bitterness has not clouded his bead on the Yankee culture
here and its differences from his native Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of energy and civic enterprise is far greater in
Texas than it is in Boston,'' he said. Exhibit A is the city's
travails over the years to fund a convention center. ``They would
have put that together in about two months in Houston, about four
months in Dallas and maybe six months in San Antonio,'' he said.
``This is like Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a Democrat, Silber has kind words for Republican and
fellow Texan George W. Bush, as well as for McCain. ``He's got
about as effective an educational reform movement going as anybody
in the country,'' Silber said about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And he swats away criticism that Bush is unprepared to occupy
the Oval Office. ``He is so far better qualified than many of the
people who have held this office it's not funny,'' he said. Like
who? ``Well, Carter, for example. George W. Bush would be a much
better president than Carter. He's got the administrative sense of
what his role is. His role is that of keeping his eye on the whole
forest and not the individual trees.''
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Silber expects Bush would learn on the job,
as do countless other presidents. ``When Harry Truman went in,
everyone said, `Harry Truman's totally incompetent _ a minor little
senator from Missouri. What the hell does he know about anything?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Silber offers perfunctory praise for Democrats Al Gore and Bill
Bradley. He is particularly guarded about Bradley, whose public
reserve is foreign to him. ``He's cool _ and they talk about the
importance of being cool _ in the sense of TV cool,'' he said in a
timbre that reflected a disdain for the concept. ``The guy doesn't
get angry. If having a temper is supposed to be a disadvantage to
McCain, then being cool has got to be an advantage for Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   John Silber doesn't like that one bit.

IS POLITICS DEAD, OR JUST SLEEPING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The most enduring figures of the late 19th
century were not the powerful men who shaped its public policy, men
such as Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, or Benjamin Harrison,
who helped craft the government we know today. No, it is John D.
Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John
Pierpont Morgan whom we remember, men who led the way in the oil,
steel, railroad, and finance industries.
</P>
<P>
   Decades from now, when Americans look back at the late 20th
century, they, too, may be far less captivated by the
accomplishments of politicians and presidents. Jimmy Carter, George
Bush, and Bill Clinton may pale next to Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and
Jack Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Like the years between Reconstruction and Populism, this is a
period when civic life is in decline. Like the end of the 19th
century, America's energy and spirit have been dedicated to
business, not government. Like that earlier era, the most creative
minds have turned to invention, not ideology. And like that other
time, people now are asking if politics is dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably only slumbering.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened in the waning years of the last century,
according to Winston Churchill, known for his attention to, and
affinity for, American politics. ``After slumbering since the end
of Reconstruction, American politics suddenly awoke. The alarm
clock was Populism,'' he wrote in his magisterial ``History of the
English Speaking People.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that awakening, he wrote, the politics of the mid- to
late-19th century were ``insignificant,'' though the period's
``economic developments were of the first importance.''
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions _ the fall of Soviet communism, a force
that held history in its iron grip from 1917 to 1989, was truly one
of the important human achievements of all time _ most of the
politics of the recent era have flirted with insignificance. Like
the 19th century, the political world in recent years has been
dominated by small partisan skirmishes, derivative of earlier
politics rather than innovative in their own right, controlled by
the special interests, vulnerable to the entreaties of big money.
</P>
<P>
   But _ again like the 19th century _ the business and
technological developments of the era have been of immense
importance, largely because they reorganized how human life was
structured, and altered widely accepted notions of human promise.
</P>
<P>
   In our own time, the common metaphor of national life _ the
journey _ has been transformed. Once it meant a physical journey,
from Kansas City to the Pacific, for example, first by Conestoga,
then by rail, then by automobile, finally by air. Now Americans are
conducting journeys every day at their desks, and the ``places
you'll go,'' as Dr. Seuss might have put it, are not locations on a
fixed continent but faraway corners of the human mind and
cyberspace so vast and unknown that their wrinkles cannot even be
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were higher voter-participation rates in that 19th-
century period than we have now, but American life was not very
political, just as it isn't very political now,'' said William G.
Mayer, a Northeastern University political scientist. ``There were
no great issues that divided the populace. There were no great
presidents either. Not many people can even name them.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians will almost certainly remember the present period not
for the activities of our presidents _ they will be footnotes _ but
as the age of computers, genetic engineering, biotechnology, and of
the emergence of a new set of dilemmas that underscored how our
technological capacity grew faster than our ability to shape our
ethical values to those new machines and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Historians also will almost certainly remember our time as the
preface to a new period of political activism, agitation, and
passion.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the emergence of populism at the beginning of the
1890s (and progressivism a decade or so later) was the
technological and economic gap that became evident in American life
_ the gap between the industrial and economic power of the captains
of industry and the poverty and hopelessness of rural life at the
time, for example. (The source of so much industrial wealth, the
railroad, was simultaneously the source of so much rural anger and
distress.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the gap between the settled urban groups and
the new immigrants of the cities caused tensions in Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, and Chicago that called for a new brand of
politics. It is no coincidence that the machines that controlled
the jobs of the ``huddled masses'' whom Emma Lazarus celebrated
also fostered the growth of political organizations that came to be
known as ``machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Many similar tensions are building today, as the battle in the
streets of Seattle this month vividly suggested. They may produce
the politics of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of periods in American life when people
have disliked or distrusted politics and politicians,'' said John
G. Geer, a Vanderbilt University political scientist. ``It is a
longstanding national pattern. If you look at America right now,
the economy is good and there is peace. The public is the most
rational of anybody in this game. The public is disengaged, but
maybe there is no reason to get engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not now. But inevitably there will be later. And the
entire nature of political involvement may shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at students today, the people who want to be
involved don't think the thing to do is to vote,'' said Constantine
J. Spiliotes, a Dartmouth College political scientist. ``They are
active in civic affairs. But they don't think political campaigns
is the way to do it. They do grass-roots organizing, teaching, go
into the Peace Corps, or work at specific issues, like housing or
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why even a politician with such impeccable
establishment credentials as Al Gore traffics in such words as
``psychobabble,'' drops phrases like ``peer mediation'' into his
talks with students, and speaks easily of ``self-esteem'' and
``people who feel a lack of respect for themselves.'' When Vice
President Gore met some first-time voters and voters of the future
at Concord High School recently, he was more the teacher than the
politician, speaking of what the First Amendment means, talking
about how people get colds, alluding to the prominence of violence
in Elizabethan drama, and talking about the difference between
conscious thought and instinct. This was decidedly unpolitical, by
any traditional definition, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these days voting is passe. And so, in some ways, is
traditional politics. A new study by Harvard University's
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy shows
that nearly two out of three Americans surveyed regard the 2000
presidential campaign as ``boring,'' and that more than half regard
the campaign as ``uninformative.'' More distressing, more than a
third of Americans consider the campaign ``discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shorenstein Center, working in conjunction with the
Vanishing Voter Project, also is monitoring how much attention the
public is paying to the presidential election. During one week last
month, only 19 percent of those polled said they had been paying
``a great deal'' or ``quite a bit'' of attention to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going well and people are entitled to feel good
about things,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a former president of Common
Cause and a longtime observer of Washington and politics. ``But
I've never seen such disconnection between politics and the people
_ and so much good reason for that disconnect. The people see
poisonous partisan politics all the time. They have a president who
has done well by them on the economy but who sets the lowest
possible personal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   People don't care as much about politics right now because they
don't need as much from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is low, and so one of the perennials of the capital
in bad times _ bills to extend unemployment benefits for another 19
weeks _ is unknown to a generation of newspaper readers. Threats
from abroad are few, and so one of the chief debates in modern
American politics _ Are we safe from invasion? _ is regarded as
more of a quaint relic than might be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   History may have few lessons, but surely one of them is that
prosperity doesn't last and neither does tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Hard times will be back, maybe not next month or next year, but
sometime. External and internal threats will return, maybe not
right away, but before the next decade is out. When they are back,
politics will be, too. Count on it.

PUTTING THE PUBLIC IN POLICY

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kurt Ehrenberg wants to change politics. But first,
he has to change the way politics is conducted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the rest of the world has successfully transferred
its business on line, politics on the Web remains something of a
joke, with anonymous ``voters'' casting meaningless ``ballots'' on
issues of the day. Despite a recent explosion of on-line polls,
none has won the respect of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenberg, a New Hampshire resident who last week held the
``first presidential on-line primary'' is part of a new breed: the
Internet poll scientist. He is among a cluster of analysts trying
to develop a system of reliable on-line surveys. And as a result,
he is on the front line of a growing battle over how democracy
should work.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has it been possible for the United States to
consider government by ``direct democracy,'' in which each person
votes on every issue. But now, the pervasiveness of the Internet _
and the developing potential to poll millions of people hourly in
their homes _ is rekindling one of the oldest debates in US
history: How directly should the masses decide public policy?
</P>
<P>
   The technology does not exist to hold a national daily
referendum on policy, such as whether to bomb Kosovo or ban
handguns. Nor is anyone suggesting the country should be run by
on-line polls, though Ross Perot's embrace of ``electronic town
meetings'' comes close.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts expect reliable on-line polling to have an
influence within a matter of months on local and state and even
federal levels, however, as congressmen respond to more-accurate
surveys and local officials toy with small-scale referendums on
issues ranging from the placement of stoplights to control of
suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe science can get to the point where the polls are
accurate. Then the question is, my Lord, do we want that?'' said
Douglas L. Bailey, publisher of Hotline, a political newsletter.
``The public can register its opinion immediately, and members of
Congress will be able to measure the public's view . . . and they
can vote that way. But is that their job?''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like former Clinton polling guru Dick Morris, argue
politicians should be held accountable to the public every day. It
is not a new question, but one that dates back to the ancient
Greeks, one that divided James Madison and Thomas Jefferson as they
debated how much power to give the public and the political elite.
It is a question that prompted British statesman Edmund Burke to
write in 1774: ``Your representative owes you, not his industry
only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he
sacrifices it to your opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke doubted the public's ability to make a reasoned decision
on every issue, and such concerns, shared by his American admirers,
led to the US system of representative government. Voters were
never supposed to decide matters of trade policy or commerce; their
congressmen and senators were. And officials were subject to the
public's whims only at election time.
</P>
<P>
   But that distance has eroded over the last century, beginning
with the emergence of reliable polling in the 1930s and culminating
with the Clinton administration, which has reportedly polled on
everything from bombing Iraq to whether President Clinton should
admit his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Now, with daily polls on the
horizon, some Internet advocates foresee a more responsive, and
responsible, government.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenberg and his firm, Politics.com, are focused on the
presidential primary process. Currently, he said, each party's
nominee is essentially decided in early primary states such as Iowa
and New Hampshire. To counter the imbalance, Politics.com and the
firm Votation conducted their own ``primary,'' a poll intended as
an expression of how the rest of the country feels.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenberg said he thinks electronic feedback will transform
politics, but he has a more immediate goal: overcoming scientific
hurdles, because ``there are a lot of polls on the Internet that
are fun for people to participate in but are meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   His poll was far from perfect. Although it was called a primary,
candidates from all parties ran against one another.
</P>
<P>
   The results were announced last Thursday: Of the more than 8,000
voters, 29 percent favored Texas Governor George W. Bush, 21
percent voted for Bill Bradley. Vice President Al Gore finished
fifth with 10 percent, behind Patrick J. Buchanan at 17 percent,
and Senator John McCain with 12 percent. The others had 5 percent
or less.
</P>
<P>
   Politics.com required a street address from each voter, which
was then checked against post office records to verify that it
exists and to guard against anyone voting more than once. It did
not eliminate other methodological problems, such as who voted and
why. ``It's not a perfect system,'' he said, but ``we're not saying
that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are hard at work. Harris Interactive is spending $55
million on building a database of polling subjects who respond to
Internet questionnaires. InterSurvey is building a similar panel of
as many as 250,000 subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problems with on-line polling are demographics and
randomness. Though ubiquitous in many middle-class neighborhoods,
home computers and Web browsers are not nearly as universal as
telephones among the poor. And polls conducted on the Internet
today are weighted by disproportionate responses from activists,
the well-educated, and the opinionated, whereas traditional polling
relies on reaching a representative sample of the voting public by
telephone, using a random-digit dialing system that has proved
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   InterSurvey is attempting to coopt the traditional method by
randomly phoning subjects who then join its polling pool. After
agreeing to participate, each subject gets a Web TV unit and
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it is the wave of the future,'' said the firm's
opinion research director, Anna Greenberg, the daughter of former
Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg and an assistant professor of
public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School. ``I don't know who's
going to master it or who's going to corner the market, but I do
think everyone is very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the long-term use of such polls are troubling to
some, given the history of Internet polling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more provocative Web sites is Vote.com, which polls on
everything from Donald Trump's tax plan to criminal penalties for
children. Run by Morris, the site caused a stir after a Republican
presidential debate when it declared candidate Alan Keyes the
victor based on votes from users on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great example. To suggest a guy like Alan Keyes
somehow emerges as a winner shows that kind of technique really
isn't useful,'' said Democratic consultant Tad Devine, who said
such a poll reflects a noisy on-line minority. ``It can distort
insight rather than give insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is a champion of on-line polling, not only in predicting
elections but in influencing daily policy decisions. He invokes
Thomas Jefferson, who ``had to shelve his vision of a direct
democracy in which people made their own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are about to reclaim the power Jefferson would have
given us,'' Morris writes in his book, ``Vote.com.'' But, he said:
``Whether direct Internet democracy is good or bad is, however,
quite beside the point. It is inevitable . . . Restricting the
power of the people is no longer a viable option. The Internet made
it obsolete.''

<P>
   We honor them when they die. The rest of the time, we hold up
their contracts, question their overtime pay, and grouse about
their soft duty in an era when serious fires are on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing false in our grief at the tragic deaths of Paul
Brotherton, Timothy Jackson, Jeremiah Lucey, James Lyons, Joseph
McGuirk, and Thomas Spencer, the six firefighters killed in the
conflagration in that vacant Worcester warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   There is something disingenuous, however, about all of or
rhetorical tributes to our firefighting forces, something strained
and nostalgic about the homage we are paying to this corps of
selfless public servants.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, we have been honoring the sacrifice of
these fallen firefighters, their parents, their widows, and their
17 fatherless children _ families who were willing to live every
day with the possibility of sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, we have been telling ourselves and our
children that these are the men we most admire, men who were
willing to do what most of us cannot even imagine ourselves doing:
enter a burning building with the full knowledge that they might
not come out alive.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we say, but what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   Did weall the firefighters in Brookline heroes last summer when
Local 950 of the International Association of Fire Fighters had to
throw up picket lines outside the Longwood Cricket Club, site of
the Davis Cup tennis tournament, and outside The Country Club, host
of the Ryder Cup golf tournament, to pressure the town to seriously
negotiate a new contract?
</P>
<P>
   Was that how we viewed Local 1795 of the same union when we let
the firefighters of Wellesley work without a contract, or a pay
raise, for four years running?
</P>
<P>
   We act toward our firefighters the same way we do toward our
police officers and our public school teachers, paying lip service
to their honorable professions while shortchanging them of
everything but our resentment on payday.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Commonwealth, throughout the nation, municipal fire
departments are in the midst of a major reassessment of their
public safety mission. In Boston, the number of fires has declined
by more than half in the last decade. Because of advances in fire
prevention and more stringent building codes, that trend can be
seen in small towns as well as big cities everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The transition to a broader role in their communities is not
without obstacles. In cities and towns across Massachusetts, turf
battles are raging between local fire departments and private
for-profit ambulance companies that compete to provide emergency
medical services. The Boston Fire Department has been struggling
all year to sort out its relationship with the paramedics of
Emergency Medical Services. The EMS handles most medical calls but
firefighters respond to more than 30,000 emergency medical cal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems in the department are unique to Boston _
how many other big-city fire commissioners have firefighters
available to walk their golden retriever? _ but other issues
confront every firehouse in Massachusetts. How many uniformed women
and people of color marched into the Worcester Centrum last week as
full-fledged members of ``the brotherhood'' we heard so much about?
Of those who did, how many have any rank of note?
</P>
<P>
   The best managed fire departments are reinventing themselves,
scaling back firefighting units that are no longer needed and
recruiting firefighters as diverse as their communities. The
worst-managed _ Boston comes to mind _ are plagued by patronage
appointments, mired in the past, and resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   Former state public safety secretary Kathleen M. O'Toole is
expected to issue a report any day now on management problems in
the Boston Fire Department. When she does, will we focus only on
union contracts, overtime pay, and light duty in one city? Will we
forget the heroism of Brotherton, Jackson, Lucey, Lyons, McGuirk,
and Spencer in another? Can we hold two conflicting images in our
minds simultaneously or must every firefighter be either a hero or
a goat?
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that our children want to grow up to be Bill
Gates, not the town fire chief, or Officer Friendly or Mr. Chips.
Children watch what we do as carefully as they listen to what we
say. Maybe the memory of the stirring speeches of these last
difficult days in Worcester will alter their thinking. But when the
smoke has cleared and the funerals are behind us, will it have
altered ours?

KING CONSPIRACY FINDING SHEDS WELCOME LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week a jury in Memphis found what the family of the
Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., as well as many other Americans,
have long been looking for _ a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   A Memphis jury hearing a lawsuit filed by King's family found
Wednesday that the civil rights leader was the victim of a murder
conspiracy, not of a lone assassin. The family's lawyer claimed
that the FBI, CIA, the Mafia and the military were involved.
</P>
<P>
   When the King family filed the wrongful death civil lawsuit
against Lloyd Jower, a retired businessman who said six years ago
he paid someone other than James Earl Ray to kill King, they were
not interested in a big settlement. They were asking for a token
payment, such as the $100 they were awarded last week.
</P>
<P>
   What the King family truly wanted, and may get as a result of
the verdict, is a new investigation into King's death _ one that
takes the conspiracy theory seriously. What the family also wants
is to have the history books re-written to reflect the truth of
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a limited
investigation by the US Justice Department into two alleged
conspiraces in the King assassination. One involved Jowrs' claim of
paying someone else to kill King, and the other involved a
statement by former FBI agent Donald Wilson that he found papers in
Ray's car that may support a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the King family wants is a full and complete new
investigation that will prove what their lawyer outlined in his
conspiracy presentation at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Dexter King, the slain civil rights leader's son, talked
with Ray, who was serving a life term after being convicted of
killing King. Ray was quoted as saying, ``I had nothing to do with
shooting your father.'' And Dexter said ``I believe you and my
family believes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Memphis jury of six blacks an six whites
did not address that issue of whether Ray was involved. Instead, it
backed the argument by the King family's attorney, William Pepper,
that more than one person was involved in the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper told jurors that Jowers was part of a vast conspiracy
that included agents of the federal government and the Mafia. he
argued that King was targeted for assassinatuon because of his
opposition to the Vietnam War and plans for a massive civil rights
march in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He further argued that there was a coverup after King's murder
in Memphis that involved the FBI, CIA, the media, Army intelligence
and state and city officials. Pepper, who wrote a book about his
conspiracy theory in the King case, told and apparently convinced
the jury to send a message ``to all of those in power that you
cannot get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The juy concluded that Jowers was part of that conspiracy and
ordered him to pay the family $100 in keeping with the family's
request of a token payment in the verdict. Expressing what many
Americans _ and most African-Americans _ believed, King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, said last month as a withness in the trial, ``I
always felt that somehow the truth would be known and I would live
to see it.'' No doubt that's how she felt after the verdict came
in.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are critics of the verdict who argue that the trial
didn't prove anything, nor changed their view that Ray was the lone
gunman in the slaying. One of them, Shelby County prosecutor John
Campbell, who investigated the assassination several years ago but
was not involved in the Jowers trial, said that Jowers' claim that
he paid someone other than Ray to kill King, and that there was a
conspiracy, has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he looked at this off and on for five years ``and
I've still seen nothing that would change my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argu that the trial was tilted in favor of a conspiracy
because Pepper was also the lawyer for Ray during his trial on
charges of killing King. Nonetheless, the jury's verdict did
accomplish one goal of the King family: to find a way to open a new
full investigation into King's death.
</P>
<P>
   And the trial also raised again the question of how Ray managed
to get a room across from the Lorraine Hotel, kill King with a
single shot, and escape from the neighborhood, and the city,
without being stopped and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   What one juror, David Murphy, said was what many other skeptics
felt about Ray being the lone gunman. Theassassination was far too
complex to have been carried out by one person. And that contention
becomes even stronger given that Ray, a prison escapee from
Missouri, could not have carried out the killing and go out of town
without a lot of help.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison, said in last week's trial
that while the jury could conclude that King was the victim of a
conspiracy, Jowers at best played only a minor role.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers had owned a small restaurant, Jim's Grill, across the
street from the Lorraine Motel. Ray, under an assumed name, rented
a room in a rooming house above Jower's restaurant. Garrison may
have helped the jury reach its conclusion when he said at the trial
that it was hard to believe that the ``owner of a greasy spoon and
an escaped convict'' could by themselves have pulled off the King
assassination.'
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the verdict in Memphis last week raised the volume
in the call for a new investigation. It also raised conspiracy
advocates' call for an investigation into President Kennedy's
assassination, and the possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald did not
act alone, and may not even have been involved, in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the trial occurred three decades after
King's death, and after Ray himself had died in prison, the volumes
of testimony that was examined by the jury does give the jurors
enough credibility to render a vedict in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   And since the verdict supported the arguements that there was a
conspiracy in the killing of King, the King family should have the
opportunity to see a new investigation _ one that would find the
truth, once and for all. After all, the King family, having endured
the personal pain of the assassination for more than 30 years, has
arned its right to bring closure to America's tragedy.

   While celebrities and US officials endorse milk as a
near-perfect food in slick ``milk mustache'' ads and elsewhere,
emerging research is raising questions about milk's wholesome
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, though far from definitive, suggest that
consumption of cow's milk may be associated in some people with a
higher risk of diabetes, prostate cancer, or ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And the well-known Nurses' Health Study reported two years ago
that older women who drank two or more glasses of milk a day had no
greater protection from hip or forearm fracture than women who
drank one glass or less a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``High milk intake and better bones is not well-established,''
said Dr. Meir Stampfer, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at
the Harvard School of Public Health, and one of the researchers
involved in the Nurses' Health Study. ``And I'm not convinced that
the data are really strong enough to support the very vigorous type
of pro-milk campaign'' that is now being promoted.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials, other health professionals, and the
dairy industry say there are plenty of data to support the health
benefits of low-fat milk and other dairy products in preventing not
only osteoporosis, but also high blood pressure and possibly colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   They say there is a ``calcium crisis'' in the US now, with
children and adolescents drinking more sugar-laden soda and less
calcium-rich milk, putting them at risk of developing osteoporosis,
the bone-thinning disease, and bone fracture in their later years.
Milk is not only fortified with vitamin D to help the body absorb
calcium, they say, it also provides riboflavin and other essential
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern we have is that you're going to have in the very
near future, a generation of people, especially women, who are
developing significant osteoporosis and developing it younger than
in the past,'' said Dr. Jonelle C. Rowe, a physician on the staff
of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD), which currently has a ``Milk Matters'' public health
campaign to encourage children and adolescents to increase their
calcium intake.
</P>
<P>
   While the scientists who are finding the unsettling though
preliminary results on milk and health do not believe cow's milk is
necessarily harmful, they say there is an overemphasis on milk in
the diet. There are other ways to get calcium, they say, pointing
to calcium-fortified orange juice or leafy green vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   And a little daily sun exposure year-round can allow the body to
make all the vitamin D it needs to absorb calcium (or a vitamin D
or multivitamin supplement for those in northern latitudes or for
those who are housebound), while weight-bearing exercise helps
build bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the current controversy surrounding milk began because
so many adults, particularly minorities, have difficulty drinking
it because they gradually lose an enzyme to digest milk sugar, or
lactose. About 90 percent of Asians, 70 percent of blacks and
Native Americans, 50 percent of Hispanics, and 15 percent of whites
have difficulty digesting lactose, according to a review of the
literature by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,
which this week is filing suit against the US government for being
racially biased in its dietary policy.
</P>
<P>
   But milk supporters dispute the claim that people who have
difficulty digesting lactose cannot safely or comfortably drink
milk. They say even people with little or none of the enzyme needed
to digest the sugar can gradually work their way up to a glass of
milk a day. Or they can eat yogurt and cheese, in which lactose is
broken down, or use products that have reduced lactose or an enzyme
needed to digest lactose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anyone can tolerate a glass of milk. . .or the
lactose-equivalent of a glass of milk,'' said Dr. Nevin S.
Scrimshaw, a physician and MIT professor emeritus who taught at the
Center for International Studies, and is currently president of the
International Nutrition Foundation, a private Boston-based
nonprofit organization that works to fight hunger and improve
nutrition around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drink a glass or two of milk a day, you've got the
additional calcium, got the protein, got the riboflavin,'' said
Scrimshaw, who has served as food and nutrition adviser to a United
Nations program, as well as conducted studies in black Americans
and others who have difficulty digesting lactose and found they can
gradually adapt to a glass of milk with little or no discomfort,
particularly if they drink it during meals.
</P>
<P>
   But when people do experience discomfort, it can be severe. Some
people with lactose intolerance may experience abdominal bloating,
cramps, flatulence, nausea, and severe diarrhea by drinking even a
single glass of milk. People who regularly experience severe
diarrhea may not properly absorb nutrients, because they're lost
from the body so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The role of milk in the US diet is currently being assessed as
the US government prepares to revise its dietary guidelines for the
first time in five years. A government-appointed committee of
doctors and nutritionists _ including Harvard's Stampfer and Tufts'
Johanna Dwyer and Alice Lichtenstein _ is expected to give its
dietary guidelines recommendation to the government by the end of
this month. The final guidelines are expected next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Even scientists and health officials who recommend 2-3 servings
a day of cow's milk and other dairy products point out that it's
best for infants to be breast-fed in the first year of life. The
American Academy of Pediatrics made the breast-feeding
recommendation in the early 1990s, after research indicated that
cow's milk or cow's milk-based formula could increase the risk of
type 1 diabetes in some children, perhaps as a result of an
autoimmune reaction to a protein in milk.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1 diabetes, also called insulin-dependent diabetes, has
long been known to have a genetic component, but the possible
contribution of cow's milk and other environmental factors is now
being explored, particularly in Finland, where there are higher
rates of both type 1 diabetes and milk consumption, said Jill
Norris, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University
of Colorado Health Sciences Center, who has done some of the
research.
</P>
<P>
   But while cow's milk should be kept from infants, it needs to
become a bigger part of the diet for children and teenagers,
according to US health officials. USDA statistics indicate that
adolescents are drinking twice as much soda _ more than 12 ounces a
day _ and half as much milk _ about 6 ounces a day _ as they were
20 years ago. Early attempts by the soda industry to fortify
beverages with calcium didn't work, since the caffeine in cola
counteracts the effectiveness of calcium. The orange juice industry
has recently taken to fortifying its products with calcium with an
amount equivalent to that found in skim milk: about 300 milligrams
a cup.
</P>
<P>
   The usual adult calcium recommendation is 1,000 milligrams,
while women who are pregnant, nursing, or postmenopausal are urged
to get 1,500 milligrams a day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who view cow's milk from an anthropological and
evolutionary point of view say the product is not necessarily a
dietary requirement for humans, especially adults.
</P>
<P>
   Cow's milk has been in the human diet less than 10,000 years, a
drop in the evolutionary bucket, when dairy farming started in
parts of northern Europe and what was once known as the Near East
(and today called the Middle East). The first cows were brought to
America less than 400 years ago, by Pilgrims who settled Plymouth
Colony.
</P>
<P>
   That's why most adults who have the enzyme that digests lactose
are descendants of people from those dairying cultures. As a
result, Robert Dirks, professor of anthropology at Illinois State
University and a specialist in food and culture, said he thinks of
milk as an ``ethnic food.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frederick Simoons, a University of California, Davis,
professor emeritus of geography, said it's a ``normal human
condition'' for people to have a decline in the enzyme that digests
lactose as they reach adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But today, ``Certainly a lot of prominent people feel quite
comfortable that milk is a good thing; even Donna Shalala gets her
milk mustache, doesn't she?'' said Dr. Daniel W. Cramer, professor
of OB/GYN and reproductive biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital
and Harvard Medical School, referring to the US Secretary of Health
and Human Services' appearance in the industry-sponsored ``Got
Milk?`` ads featuring well-known people with milk mustaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not everybody signs off on this idea that there can't be
anything wrong with consuming milk as an adult,'' said Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer has researched a potential link between milk and ovarian
cancer and infertility in a study involving 500 Massachusetts women
and in international comparisons of health statistics based on a
country's milk consumption. While the possible mechanism is not
known, Cramer hypothesizes that it involves galactose _ a metabolic
byproduct of milk sugar, or lactose _ based on his and others'
findings that the rates of ovarian cancer and infertility appear to
be elevated in women who are able to break lactose down into
glucose and galactose, but are then unable to metabolize galactose
further.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other emerging research findings that raise questions
about milk, but that still need to be be confirmed by other
studies: Men with high calcium consumption, whether from milk or
elsewhere, are at 4.5 times the risk of getting metastatic prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Giovannucci of Harvard Medical School and Harvard
School of Public Health postulates that the link between prostate
cancer and calcium he and his colleagues found in the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study, involving nearly 50,000 men, is a
result of a shutdown in the body's production of a certain form of
vitamin D in response to too-high calcium levels; that form of
vitamin D has been thought to protect against prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are associations. You can't prove cause and effect, but
it's quite striking that we saw an increased risk for both calcium
supplements and milk,'' he said. While this same study's weaker
finding about the possible protective effect of lycopene in
tomatoes against prostate cancer has gotten a lot of media
interest, Giovannucci said he has been surprised that this 4.5-fold
increased risk in metastatic prostate cancer for men with the
highest calcium consumption hasn't generated the same attention.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Miller, vice president for nutrition research for the
National Dairy Council, which is helping to fund the milk mustache
campaign, said while some of the studies questioning milk are
``very interesting,'' the weight of the scientific evidence is on
the side of milk's healthful effects. The studies questioning milk
are limited in their design and unable to prove cause and effect,
he said. ``In the summer, consumption of popsicles go up and the
rate of drowning goes up. Does that mean popsicle consumption
causes drowning?''
</P>
<P>
   While researchers agree that there is still no solid proof that
milk causes disease, they say there is enough evidence to question
the dietary role of a fomerly unquestioned food.

WHAT'S AN ASTEROID? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is an asteroid made of? Where do they come from? How
fast do they go? How big are they?
</P>
<P>
   N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the huge gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, in an
area known appropriately enough as the Asteroid Belt, are thousands
of asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Marsden, of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's
registry for Near Earth Objects, says asteroids are rocks, made of
mostly the same kinds of things rocks here on earth are made of _
silica, carbon, iron, nickel, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But because these rocks haven't been altered by the dynamic
forces affecting rocks on Earth, learning more about asteroids
could help us know more about how our own planet formed.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers believe that as solid material condensed out of the
gaseous early universe, little bits were drawn together either by
collisions or by gravity and grew into planets. Asteroids are
little bits that never joined. They are stuck in the asteroid belt,
circling the sun just as the planets do, unable to glom together
into a planet because of the gravitational pull of Mars on one
side, and massive Jupiter on the other, keeping the little chunks
of space rock apart. Many of them act like mini-planets, rotating
on a single axis as they orbit the sun at about 36,000 miles per
hour. (The Earth orbits the sun at 64,800 m.p.h.)
</P>
<P>
   Asteroids range in size from pebbles up to beefy Ceres, 500
miles across.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they collide with each other and one ends up in an
elliptical orbit that brings it closer to Earth. This creates two
opportunities: First, science can study it more closely. Second,
Hollywood can make movies scaring the bejeebbies out of us that a
monster asteroid might one day smack us into oblivion. Marsden says
the Big One hasn't been spotted. Yet. We are pestered only by the
rogue asteroid flying through our atmosphere, appearing as a
shooting star as friction burns it up. A few are big enough to
survive their fiery arrival and make it to the surface. That's how
we can study them here on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of asteroids out in space have had mixed success. A
satellite sent to photograph the asteroid Braille, about 30 million
miles away, got there but failed to send back pictures. But the
Galileo spacecraft got some great information about the large
asteroids Ida and Gaspra as it passed through the asteroid belt on
its way to studying Jupiter. And another satellite got good data
passing within 753 miles of Mathilde, and then heading on to
examine Eros, with an elliptical orbit that brings it within 13
million miles of Earth. That satellite, NEAR for Near Earth
Asteroid Rendezvous), is scheduled to go into orbit around Eros and
begin following it on Valentine's Day next year. A Valentine's Day
rendezvous with an asteroid named for the Greek God of Love? We're
sure this is coincidence.

WHO'S RESPONSIBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; most remarkable thing happened in Seattle last week. The
chief of police resigned. In the aftermath of riots that disrupted
the World Trade Organization, caused millions of dollars in damage,
and blackened the reputation of Seattle's police, Chief Norm
Stamper did the stand-up thing. He stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The marvel of this resignation is that it was unforced. Stamper
was not pushed out; Seattle's mayor even said that he had tried to
talk Stamper out of leaving. But the chief understood that it will
be easier to repair the police force after the WTO debacle if
someone new is at the helm. And perhaps he felt that this was a
matter of honor _ that since something went so badly awry on his
watch, he deserved to pay a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Stamper tendered his resignation in
Seattle, a professor at Boston University tendered his. John Schulz
voluntarily stepped down as chairman of the school's Mass Media,
Advertising, and Public Relations Department after it transpired
that he had used someone else's words in a lecture without giving
credit to the author.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody doubts that the lapse was unintended _ he was in a rush
and simply forgot to attribute the quotation. Yet Schulz himself,
declaring that ``the failure to attribute a source is a serious
offense in a university,'' insisted on walking the plank.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo to both men. What they did took real integrity. A pity it
doesn't happen more often.
</P>
<P>
   It would be refreshing if more high-ranking officials _ in every
field, but especially in government _ resigned when honor required
it. Not over a mere mistake, as in Schulz's case, but when
something has truly been botched. An official who accepts
responsibility for a grievous failure and demonstrates it by
resigning sends several messages, all of them salutary. First, that
failure carries a price. Second, that one can always behave with
class. And third, that honorable men and women don't blame their
underlings when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falklands war began in 1982, Britain's foreign
secretary, Lord Carrington, resigned his post. He _ that is, the
foreign ministry _ had failed to predict or prevent the Argentine
invasion. For that failure he took personal responsibility and
stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Far from destroying Carrington's reputation, his resignation
only enhanced it. Two years later he became NATO's
secretary-general; two years after that, he delivered the
commencement address at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time an American did what Carrington did?
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Saddam Hussein's belligerency toward Kuwait failed to
set off alarms in James Baker's State Department. The US ambassador
to Iraq assured Saddam that Washington had ``no opinion on the
Arab-Arab differences like your border disagreement with Kuwait.''
It was a serious blunder; Iraq invaded three weeks later. Baker
stayed on as secretary of state; no doubt the thought of emulating
Carrington never crossed his mind. But suppose he had resigned his
office for having misjudged the situation so grievously. Americans
would have applauded his integrity. They would have seen that the
Bush administration held itself to the highest standards. And the
allies would still have won the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno after
an FBI assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, led
to the deaths of nearly 80 people. ``I'm accountable. The buck
stops with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But accepting responsibility didn't mean that she was ready to
accept punishment. She didn't offer to leave office. The buck
stopped with her, but nothing changed. What kind of responsibility
was that?
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally American officials resign on a matter of principle.
Elliot Richardson, Nixon's attorney general, quit rather than carry
out an order to fire the Watergate special prosecutor. In 1980,
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned because he opposed Jimmy
Carter's decision to attempt a military rescue of the hostages in
Iran. To protest the US failure to combat Serbia's murder spree in
Bosnia, five State Department officials resigned between 1992 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But shouldering the blame and resigning with dignity because
something important has been badly mishandled? In our culture, that
happens almost never.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the $165 million Mars Polar Lander disappeared. In
September, the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter vanished too,
doomed by NASA's failure to convert English measurements into
metric units. The agency's accident review board found that NASA is
plagued with weak internal communications, poorly trained
employees, and lax oversight. How bracing it would have been if,
upon release of that report, someone squared his shoulders and
said, ``This should never have occurred. I am responsible. I hereby
resign.'' Instead there has been the usual: excuse-making,
equivocating, and finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   If contemporary America had a slogan, it might well be ``It's
Not My Fault.'' Taking responsibility has become a dying art. Hats
off to Chief Stamper and professor Schulz for reminding us how it's
done.

reading for adults and children alike. The stories are the best
fantasy since Alice in Wonderland. The people who want to ban
theses books, contending they promote evil witchcraft, are nuts.
The books don't promote anything but good clean fun. By MARIANNE
MEANS.

SOCCER CHAMPS OPPOSE MOVING WOMEN'S WORLD CUP TO 2002
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Members of the U.S. Women's World Cup team
say they strongly oppose a plan by the sport's governing body to
move the next women's championship from 2003 to 2002, the same the
same year that the men's World Cup will be contested.
</P>
<P>
   To a woman, the members of the U.S. team think the proposal by
FIFA is a very bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insane,'' said veteran midfielder Julie Foudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we proved at this year's Women's World Cup that it
could be a stand-alone event,'' longtime national team defender
Brandi Chastain said. ``We don't need to move it up.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think we deserve to have to piggyback on the men's
World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goalkeeper Tracy Ducar added, ``We don't want to take a
back stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we don't need to,'' Chastain added.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said the first she and her teammates heard about FIFA's
``nightmare'' decision ``was when we read about it in the
newspaper. We were all very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   They then discussed it with Alan Rothenberg, the recently
departed president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and a major mover
in the sport globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan said FIFA had never discussed it with him, either,''
Chastain said. ``He was as shocked as we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain pointed out that a huge problem with holding both the
men's and women's World Cups in the same year is that media
resources would be stretched so thin that something would probably
be sacrificed in print and electronic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody (in the U.S. camp) is interested in fighting
this decision,'' Chastain said. ``I don't think it's set in
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team has something else to be concerned about. It is
without a head coach as it nears the start of training for the 2000
Olympics. Tony DiCicco resigned as coach to spend more time with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us just want the decision on a new coach to be
made,'' Ducar said, ``so we can move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducar, who played in Briana Scurry's shadow in the Women's World
Cup last summer, was the star Saturday as the U.S. team beat the
World squad, 8-5, before a crowd of 10,842 at San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Ducar was perfect as the U.S. team built a 7-0 halftime lead,
before turning the net over to Scurry, who was under assault
throughout the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Then the U.S. women are off to Australia to begin getting ready
for the Olympics. Their immense triumph over China last summer
already seems a distant echo.
</P>
<P>
   But Chastain and her teammates are still enjoying the good
feelings while they can.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sum up what the reception on their Victory Tour across
America has been like, Chastain didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open arms,'' she said. ``Open arms.''

   WALLSTREET-PAYDAYS (New York) _ Wall Street is overflowing with
holiday cheer: Investment banks have set aside $13 billion to pay
bonuses, up 20 percent from last year. Pay packages above $10
million are no longer rare. Yet among Wall Street professionals
whose incomes still astound the rest of America, the mood has
changed. One top trader bemoans the ``opportunity cost'' of
remaining a financier in the Internet age. By Joseph P. Kahn.

<P>
   EURO-AUTO-TRENDS (Paris) _ Europeans have been trading up their
midget Fiat Cinquecentos and Renault Twingos to sports utility
vehicles. While clogged cities, astronomical gas prices and a
tradition of compact cars would seem to work against the popularity
of SUV's, their sales surged 26 percent last year. The recent
growth has been fed by the introduction of new models that are
somewhat smaller than their American cousins and and hence better
attuned to European roads. By John Tagliabue.

   MARKET (New York) _ Daily market roundup. At midday, the Dow is

   TEENS-ADCOL (Undated) _ Madison Avenue has supported efforts to
curb youth violence by creating public service advertising,
offering the commercials and print campaigns free to the media. One
advertising executive has taken a different approach. Alan Rambam
has started Seeking Harmony In Neighborhoods Everyday, or Shine, a
nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing youth violence. Using

<P>
   OBIT-HELLER (New York) _ Joseph Heller, the novelist who made
the term ``Catch-22'' a synonym for the tripwires of life, died
Sunday night. He was 76. The Brooklyn-born author was a master of
satire and sardonic humor whose bleakly witty view of the human
condition was expressed in a series of novels that began in 1961
with the phenomenally successful ``Catch-22'' and continued through
``Something Happened'' (1974), ``Good as Gold'' (1979), ``God
Knows'' (1984) and ``Picture This'' (1988). By Herbert Mitgang.

<P>
   SCI-GEORGE-WASHINGTON (Undated) _ Two hundred years ago Tuesday,
on Dec. 14, 1799, the first president of the United States died at
the age of 67 in his bed at Mount Vernon. Washington's doctors said

 LAKES-SKI SITE-LADN  
Local ski site undergoing a major tune-up 
Story and photos by Eric Noland, Travel Editor 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ There was no grand design, no master plan when
Mammoth Mountain began developing as a ski area a half-century ago.
Rather, its growth mirrored that of many California communities of
the era _ a formless, hurried sprawl, with support enterprises and
improvements springing up here and there as needs arose.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Mammoth has always maintained such a
comfortable, old-boot appeal to Southern Californians: It felt a
lot like home.
</P>
<P>
   Commute up on a Friday night _ a five-hour haul that never felt
any more taxing than a 4 p.m. negotiation of the 10 Freeway. Check
into the Motel 6. Drive around the mountain to the main ski area in
the morning. Drive into the town of Mammoth Lakes for dinner,
perhaps at that place whose sign reads ``Mexican American Italian
Grill.'' Drive to Grumpy's for beer, popcorn and a game of pool.
Gas up. Drive to the motel; huddle around the wall heater. Drive
back to the ski area in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth is deep in the throes of change, however. Its teeming
prosperity of the mid-1980s _ when visits by winter-sports
enthusiasts reached 1.5 million annually _ began to subside when
the term ``amenity'' began to creep into the ski-resort vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   Customers began to drift away to places like Vail, Colo.; Deer
Valley, Utah; and Whistler, British Columbia; where they would
enthuse over live bands, heated sun decks, four-star cuisine and _
brace yourself here _ a village environment with something called a
pedestrian walkway.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth is scurrying to catch up with industry trends, so much
so that the place might not even be recognizable in another four
years or so.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, ski area founder Dave McCoy and his family entered into
a partnership with Intrawest, the Vancouver-based developer
that!dlim!established the prototype for the upscale ski resort _
witness its work at Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia,
Tremblant in Quebec and Copper Mountain in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth is about halfway through a five-year, $130 million
upgrade project, and it has even more grandiose schemes on the
boards for the next decade. New for this winter are luxury condos,
another high-speed quad lift, completion of the gondola overhaul,
and a new gondola station that will include a kids' sports center.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the bulldozers are scheduled to converge on the corner
of Main Street and Minaret Road to break ground for ... yep, one of
those ritzy villages.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, a spry 84, sat in his Main Lodge office recently and
reflected on the days in the 1930s when he rigged a portable rope
tow so he and his friends wouldn't have to sidestep up the face of
the hill. The first chairlift began making the climb on
Thanksgiving Day, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, skiers were rough-and-tumble people,'' McCoy
said. ``They didn't care what they had to put up with to ski. Now
it's changed. Now they want hotels and fancy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competition isn't just other ski areas. It's the cruise
companies, Disney, Vegas, golf. People want recreation and
relaxation. We see the demand coming on us that we never saw in the
past _ to have amenities and make it easier than it was in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, no one could have predicted the explosive growth of
skiing and its latecoming cousin, snowboarding. And even if someone
had, it's unlikely that Mammoth could have delivered the elaborate
master planning that characterizes some of the West's most lauded
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The region is a patchwork quilt of land held privately and by
the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and other
government entities. ``We're kind of a doughnut,'' McCoy said, ``in
the Forest Service land.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mammoth is concentrating its development on four portals
strung out along the mountain's base _ Main Lodge, Canyon Lodge,
the Village at Mammoth and Juniper Springs _ in the hope that each
can eventually accommodate 5,000 people a day. The people might
even find so much to do at each location that they refrain from
spending a third of each day in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The further hope is that winter-sports folk find the entire
resort so inviting that they plan extended ski vacations here,
supplementing that weekend stampede from Southern California.
Included on the upgrade list is Mammoth's podunk airport, with the
expectation of attracting a major carrier within two years. (An
American Airlines spokesman confirmed that talks have been
conducted between the parties and ``we are definitely interested in
the potential for service there in the future.'')
</P>
<P>
   At Mammoth, they speak grandly of a renaissance. ``We're about a
year away from sharing Mammoth with the whole world,'' said Rusty
Gregory, the ski area's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Such giddy optimism is to be expected when a major player like
Intrawest acquires 58 percent of your company and begins buying
land and launching redevelopment projects.
</P>
<P>
   Five or so years from now? Here's what Mammoth plans to offer:
</P>
<P>
   _The Village at Mammoth will reconfigure the gateway to the ski
area, the corner of Main and Minaret. Imagine an area of boutiques,
restaurants, clubs and top-end lodging, all interspersed with
winding walkways, undoubtedly in some alpine theme of gingerbread
roofs and cobblestones. (Minaret will be routed around it,
according to resort officials.) A gondola will climb through the
trees (and past residences) to Canyon Lodge, linking with a gondola
that ascends Lincoln Mountain. A back trail will enable guests to
ski to the very edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   _Nearly 300 ski-in, ski-out condos will hug the slope at Juniper
Springs _ the base of what is now Chairs 15 and 24. The Juniper
Springs Lodge opened this summer with 174 upscale units. Just up
the slope, Sunstone Lodge and its 77 units are taking shape _ they
sold out in 36 minutes, according to Gregory _ and a 36-condo
property in the same region, Eagle Run, is to be built when it is
finished. All of these rooms will be serviced by a new gondola and
the Eagle Lodge base facility, both of which are scheduled for
construction next summer.
</P>
<P>
   _New facilities will improve the experience at Mammoth's primary
base area. The renovation of the gondola included construction of a
13,500-square-foot facility, Panorama Station, next to the resort's
distinctive woolly mammoth statue. Woollywood, a kids' sports
center, takes up the entire first floor. On its beginner slope,
Mammoth also spent this off-season replacing Chairs 11 and 27 with
a high-speed quad, the Discovery Chair.
</P>
<P>
   (This base area could do with more extensive improvements _ a
razing of those unsightly 1950s rectangles that pass for lodging,
to begin with _ but any makeover here will have to wait until the
other village is completed.)
</P>
<P>
   _For summer visitors, there will be golf. Intrawest opened
Sierra Star Golf Club, an 18-hole championship course just south of
the Village at Mammoth site, this year. There will be townhouses
along the fairways, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth can probably institute all of these improvements without
creating a pinch. This mountain resort is true to its name, with
3,500 skiable acres, a rise to 11,053 feet, 150 named trails and 28
lifts. It's one big mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of its recreation has always received high marks. A
Ski magazine readers' poll _ which ranked the resort 17th in
western North America _ returned raves for the quality and
challenge of Mammoth's terrain and for its lifts. However, in the
same survey, the region ranked far down the list in after-ski
diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Intrawest's track record suggests that this will change. This is
not a developer that cuts corners on creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   For verification, check into the Juniper Springs Lodge this
winter (rooms $210 and up). Its design blends timbers and river
stones, borrowing unapologetically from the distinctive look of
Yosemite's Ahwahnee. Inside, there are many tasteful design
touches: generous use of mountain hemlock as wood accents, Arts and
Crafts lamps outside each room, Morris chairs in sitting areas,
black-and-white photos of the early days of Mammoth's skiing days,
simple baskets of pine cones.
</P>
<P>
   There are also numerous opportunities to unwind after a long day
of downhill exertions. Each room has a fireplace _ alas, they burn
gas, not wood, but the design is so efficient that even the lowest
setting will soon drive you onto the balcony. Rooms are also
equipped with full kitchens and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Two outdoor Jacuzzis afford views of the mountain crescent that
shelters the Mammoth Lakes Basin. The pool itself is heated to a
restorative 84 degrees. The pool deck is heated to hasten snow
melt. And there's even a fire pit out there; lodge general manager
Michael Bennett said the open blaze at Mammoth's Mill Cafe, which
opened last year at the base of the Stump Alley Express, was such a
hit that the lodge resolved to build one for its guests.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Mammoth could realize its goal of broadening its appeal
to upscale resort travelers _ people who stay several days,
actually get out of their cars and don't break out in a panicked
sweat when the wild mushroom strudel on the appetizer menu lists
for $12.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, however, Mammoth officials insist they don't
want to forsake their bread and butter: the Southern California
weekenders who tear up Highway 395 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bothers me is the price tag you have to
put on the sport to meet the needs of today's skier,'' said McCoy,
perhaps mindful that Mammoth's adult lift ticket inched up 6
percent to $52 this year.
</P>
<P>
   But marketing director Rob Perlman cited the Mammoth Club and
College Club _ reduced-rate programs for frequent visitors _ and
said, ``There will still be the ability for a family of five to
come here, stay in a condo, go to Vons, brown-bag it and have a
great time on the mountain. That's something we don't want to take
away from our loyal skiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By contrast, there will be the ability for someone to come
here and enjoy the resort experience. It's tough to be all things
to all people, but I think we can have a variety of experiences and
(appeal to different) spending levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The upgrades that have occurred at Mammoth over the past two
years and the sweeping changes that are planned for the next few
years reflect a simple philosophy, really. ``It's a matter of
asking people what they want and giving it to them,'' said Gregory,
the company's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled slightly and added, ``It started with the rope tow.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Mammoth Lakes is 310 miles north of Los Angeles via
I-5 and highways 14 and 395. It is 289 miles north of San
Bernardino via I-15 and Highway 395.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: The adult daily lift ticket at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area
is $52. Prices are lower for teens, children and seniors. Multi-day
discounts and frequent-guest programs (Mammoth Club, College Club)
are also available.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Juniper Springs Lodge offers comfortable new condos at
the base of Chair Lifts 15 and 24. In winter, they are priced at
$210 for a studio, $310 for one-bedroom units, more for two- and
three-bedroom units. Reservations: (888) 311-1102. Information:
(760) 924-1102. For information on other accommodations overseen by
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, (800) 228-4947; www.mammothlodging.com
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Lakefront restaurant at the Tamarack Lodge continues
to offer the finest dining in the area. Chef Frederic Pierrel is a
wizard with mushrooms, and he garnishes main dishes (beef, lamb,
fish, even elk) with numerous fresh vegetables. Main courses are
priced from $17 to $25. Reservations recommended: (760) 934-3534.
Another nice option is Whiskey Creek, (760) 934-2555. Nevados has
also received high marks in guide books, (760) 934-4466. For
breakfast, it's difficult to beat the Stove, (760) 934-2821.

 &HT;    CITIES GAINING ON SUBURBS AS SITE FOR NEW HOMES
 &HT;    With CITIES-DATA.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While most homes are still built in the suburbs,
the 1990s has seen a trend toward more housing construction in
large cities, the Brookings Institution reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study of new housing construction in America's 39 largest
metropolitan areas over the past 15 years showed that more than 80
percent of home building took place in suburbs. However, between
1991 and 1998, the number of new housing permits more than doubled
in large cities, growing at a faster rate than in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The growth was distributed unevenly. While new home building is
booming in cities such as Seattle, Orlando, Boston, Tampa and
Columbus, Ohio, it continues to stagnate in others, including
Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, home building has rebounded from the recession of the
early 1990s and is reaching the levels of the economically roaring
mid-1980s, according to the Brookings study, which was conducted in
collaboration with Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that ``the trend, essentially for the century,
continues,'' said Nic Retsinas, director of the Harvard center.
``For at least 60 years, every generation of Americans has been
more suburban than the previous generation.''
</P>
<P>
   This outward growth has caused problems, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fears that uncontrolled suburban growth will degrade the
environment and engulf the neighboring countryside has made
'suburban sprawl' a national political issue,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, Vice President Al Gore announced a federal effort to
control sprawl by encouraging construction within central cities,''
the report said. ``The states of Maryland and Georgia recently
enacted measures aimed at containing urban growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics show some movement in that direction. ``Large
cities' share of metropolitan permits rose from 14.6 percent in
1991 to 17.8 percent in 1998,'' the report said. However, the
percentage has not regained its level of 19.1 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, about 82.2 percent of the housing permits were
issued in the suburbs in 1998, compared to 80.9 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The report focuses on housing permits issued in four years:
1986, a boom year; 1991, a recession year; 1996, a recovery year,
and 1998, the most recent year for which statistics were available.
The researchers examined the 39 largest metropolitan areas, where
over half of all Americans live, focusing on the core city, the
suburbs and the combined area.
</P>
<P>
   The study grouped metropolitan areas by the geographic size of
the central cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorting the cities by their land area distinguishes between
giant cities, such as Phoenix and Dallas, which contain significant
areas of undeveloped land, and small, intensely developed
metropolises such as Hartford and Miami,'' the report said.

SIMPLE ACTS GO A LONG WAY IN COMFORTING THE BEREAVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a drunken driver left Margaret Kramer a young widow with
four small children, her Minnesota friends and neighbors pitched in
with ready-to-eat meals, took turns mowing the lawn and
baby-sitting and a year or so later surprised her by painting the
outside of her house while she and the children were away on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Crewdson died, a friend said to his widow, Carole,
``Tell me what needs doing,'' then cleaned out her refrigerator,
which had been neglected for the three months her husband had been
ill. Other friends investigated cremation arrangements, brought
frozen packets of homemade soup and took her shopping. When life
quieted down a bit, friends took her out to lunch or to the movies
and even on a short trip to the West Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When someone dies, most people know to send the bereaved a card,
note or letter expressing their sorrow and sympathy, letting the
survivors know they are thought of and cared about during this
difficult time. If the note includes a fond memory of the person
who died, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Sending a memorial gift, planting a tree, donating a book plate
_ all are common gestures always appreciated. Bargemusic, the
concert program in Brooklyn, was thrilled to receive more than
$6,000 in contributions sent in memory of Frank Crewdson, a
Brooklynite who was an accomplished amateur musician.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond writing, calling or sending a memorial gift, many
people feel a little helpless about how best to comfort a friend or
relative who is grieving.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can pay a bereavement call, food is nearly always
a welcome gift either for the grieving family or for the visitors.
If possible, use disposable containers that do not need to be
returned. Keep in mind dietary restrictions and label the packaged
meals as to contents and reheating directions.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Kelly, author of ``Don't Ask for the Dead Man's Golf Clubs:
Advice for Friends When Someone Dies'' ($12.95, Kelly
Communications, 888-401-6602 or 303-740-8278), suggests, ``If you
have expertise in an area where your friends need help, offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Crewdson's friends provided invaluable help after Frank
died. A jack-of-all-trades fixed a broken door knob and light
fixture.
</P>
<P>
   An architect developed a list of house repairs that were needed.
A lawyer advised her on legal matters and translated legal
gobbledygook for her. And a stockbroker helped her figure out her
finances and accompanied her when she met with an investment
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what needs to be done and, if the person is unable to
answer, look around to see how you might help, perhaps by doing
laundry, tending the garden, washing the car or taking it to the
shop for maintenance, cleaning the house, baby-sitting, caring for
pets, helping to start a memorial fund, chauffeuring the children
or taking them for a weekend. Or you might say: ``I can do this,
this, this and this. I would like to help you. Tell me what I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   If family members are unavailable or unable to handle such
matters, you might offer to help dispose of the deceased person's
clothing and other personal effects. But don't do things without
asking.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly recounts the experience of Sam Newton of Englewood,
Colo., whose 7-year-old daughter died in an accident: ``Somebody,
we don't know who, came in right away and cleaned out our little
girl's room and took away all of her things. We really didn't want
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the initial stages of grief have passed, issue invitations
_ to lunch or dinner, to a movie or concert, to visit a museum or
to take a ride in the country or a walk in the park.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be put off if your friend is unwilling to join you at
any given time. Ms. Kelly advises, ``Hang in there even if your
friend doesn't respond to your first idea, or second, or third.''
</P>
<P>
   Marta Felber, author of ``Grief Expressed: When a Mate Dies,''
(Life Words, 800-789-0100, $19.95), wrote that many people wanted
to keep her busy after the death of her husband, Joe.
</P>
<P>
   But what she wanted most was time alone to grieve. So at first
she said no to invitations to things like pot-luck suppers, bridge
club, a computer class, jazz concert, singles group and a lengthy
trip. (Such activities may be enjoyable after a while.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Crewdson, too, often vacillated when an invitation was
issued. She said one of the most valued contributions from her
friends was their willingness to ``put up with my mood changes and
sudden changes of plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Holidays, anniversaries, birthdays and other such occasions are
especially difficult for people who are grieving.
</P>
<P>
   Try to make sure the bereaved are not alone at these times, but
be prepared for the possibility that they may refuse company or be
unwilling to celebrate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly warns, ``Don't offer to do something if you don't
intend to follow up.'' Joel Bershok of Littleton, Colo., who was 9
when his father died, told her that three men from a volunteer
organization had offered to help him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy poured out his heart to one man, who was never seen
again. ``He just wanted it on his resume,'' Bershok said. The
second volunteer moved away before he could do anything, and the
third never called after the initial contact.
</P>
<P>
   If you say you will invite a bereaved friend to dinner or to the
country for a weekend, do it. If you tell children you will take
them to a ball game or a show, do it. Those who are grieving do not
forget such promises. Failing to fulfill them just reinforces their
feelings of abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that your initial gesture of comfort following a
death is all that is needed by the bereaved. Most appreciated are
the friends who continue to make such gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Felber was touched by a friend who called long-distance
every evening for the first 10 days she was alone. ``I'm just
calling to hear about your day and tuck you into bed,'' the friend
would say. Another would call to say she was going shopping, and
did Ms. Felber want to come along? Still another kept writing notes
long after everyone else had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Felber said of these little but meaningful gestures, ``I
remember how good each contact felt and the comfort it brought.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't try to dictate how a person should be grieving or
for how long. Remember that each person grieves in his or her own
way and there is no time limit to grief. At first it often comes in
waves, perhaps days or weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   But later it can resurface at any time, triggered by a memory,
by a happy event that the deceased is missing or even by a
beautiful day. Be patient with your friend, provide a shoulder for
the tears, and respect the times he or she wants to be alone.

LIFE IS PARED TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., N.Y., Calif. Pa., Minn.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is life?
</P>
<P>
   There are long answers to the question, and a crisp, pragmatic
one.
</P>
<P>
   This short answer would be to make life, on the principle that
if you can manufacture something from defined ingredients, you have
a pretty good understanding of what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists cannot yet synthesize a living cell from the
appropriate chemicals. But in the light of recent research
findings, the project has become at least conceivable. And the
possibility raises two broad sets of questions.
</P>
<P>
   First are the philosophical issues of how far life would thereby
in some way be defined. Second are the practical results that might
flow from creating a suite of artificial life forms, like microbes
that could serve as more efficient vaccines, brewing agents or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to decode the entire DNA of small organisms has
yielded an unsurpassed view of their genetic instruction manuals.
After the full DNA, or genomes, of the first bacteria were decoded,
researchers saw the possibility of trying to define the minimum set
of genes necessary for life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clyde A. Hutchison, a microbiologist at the University of
North Carolina in Chapel Hill, has examined two of the smallest
known bacteria, a kind known as Mycoplasma. Their minimum set of
genes _ the ones need to survive and replicate in a nutrient-rich
environment _ is from 265 to 350, Hutchison and colleagues reported
in last week's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Those genes could be synthesized, providing a minimal genome,
and in principle biologists could also make the other essential
components of a cell _ an outer membrane of fat molecules and a set
of ribosomes, the little machines that manufacture proteins from
the blueprints in the genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big technical challenge, and it's not something you
could do on pocket change,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   But such an artificial cell would, in his view, explain a lot
about the nature of life. Even more satisfying would be a computer
model that predicted all the proteins specified by the genes, and
the proteins' behaviors and interactions. If the computer's
predictions matched the cell's behavior, that would be proof that
the programmers had grasped the cell's essential nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate test of understanding a simple cell, more than
being able to build one, would be to build a computer model of the
cell, because that really requires understanding at a deeper
level,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   For many biologists, who see an unbroken evolutionary continuum
from the first single-cell organisms to people, an artificially
made microbe would be a giant step toward understanding the nature
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the ultimate in saying we have got all the parts
and put them together correctly _ a fantastic human
accomplishment,'' said Dr. Jack Maniloff, a microbiologist at the
University of Rochester in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept of being able to define life in such simple
terms has disturbed a group of ethicists who studied Hutchison's
idea. ``The temptation to demonize this fundamental research may be
irresistible,'' they write in a companion article in Science.
</P>
<P>
   The reductionist approach _ breaking complex things down to
components simple enough to be understood _ underlies biology's
greatest successes. But it is a term of opprobrium to those who
fear biologists are saying life is nothing but atoms and molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious danger,'' the ethicists warn in their
report, that the synthesis of minimal genomes ``will be presented
by scientists, depicted in the press or perceived by the public as
proving that life is reducible to, or nothing more than, DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mildred K. Cho, a medical ethicist at Stanford University
and an author of the ethicists' report, noted that when biologists
sequenced the first human chromosome last month, they called it
``the first chapter in the book of life, as if life is
chromosomes.''
</P>
<P>
   But although the ethicists deplore what they consider to be the
errors of reductionism, they give the green light to the general
principle of creating minimal genome organisms, while preaching
caution about the possible hazards of each particular case.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after consulting members of their panel drawn from the
Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant faiths, the ethicists
concluded, ``There is nothing in the research agenda for creating a
minimal genome that is automatically prohibited by legitimate
religious considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists may disdain the reductionist life-is-just-DNA approach
that they impute to scientists, but what definition would they put
in its place? Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a bioethicist at the University
of Pennsylvania and a member of the panel, said everyone was
surprised at the outcome when the theologian members of the panel
were asked to consult the teachings of their respective faiths for
a definition of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even our own theologians were a little surprised that they
couldn't find definitions,'' Caplan said. ``In the materials at
hand and key texts, the definitional question had not really been
wrestled with.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who dislike the reductionist definition of life would, of
course, be in a stronger position if they had one of their own to
substitute for it. An interesting approach along these lines is
taken by Dr. Ian G. Barbour, a physicist and theologian who teaches
at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. Barbour, who this year won
the $1.24 million Templeton Prize for progress in religion, said
the nature of life lay in the higher orders of organization of the
chemicals of which living organisms are composed.
</P>
<P>
   Making a minimal genome organism ``would not add anything
intrinsic to our understanding, because without being a dualist,
one can still say that there are properties that only show up at
higher levels of organization,'' Barbour said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these higher levels of existence depend on their
molecular structures doesn't mean they are just molecular
structures. So I don't find any threat to human dignity or the
sanctity of life that they depend on molecules _ it doesn't mean we
are just molecules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, however, is sticking with the reductionist approach
and the idea that the minimal genome could lead to a sufficient
definition of life. ``Although at some level everything about a
simple living organism is implied by its genes,'' he said, ``on the
other hand, you really have to understand the products of the genes
and how they interact, which is much more complex than just knowing
the sequences of the genes. But I guess I do think life can be
explained from a reductionist point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a scientist's work to appear alongside an
ethical review of its implications. The initiative in this case
came from one of Hutchison's co-authors, Dr. J. Craig Venter, now
president of the Celera Corp. Having decoded the first bacterial
genomes, including those of the two Mycoplasmas studied by
Hutchison, Venter was concerned at the ethics of creating new
bacteria from scratch and specifically the danger of such microbes
being used in biological warfare, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a chance to assess the ethical issues of a new technology
before the horse had bolted the stable, Caplan suggested that
Venter give him a grant to convene a panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of any life form is likely to be seen as
disturbing, just because it has never happened before,'' Caplan
said. ``It taps into traditions of concern, from Frankenstein to
Prometheus. By trying to discuss it early, we hoped we could have a
good societal debate and not one skewed off into the fringes.''

   MIDEAST-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ After hours of impassioned debate _
and just two days before talks begin in Washington _ Israel's
parliament narrowly endorsed Prime Minister Ehud Barak's quest for
a comprehensive peace settlement with Syria. Israel will pay ``a
heavy territorial price,'' Barak acknowledged in an emotional plea
for parliamentary support Monday. But failure to pursue peace with

steering his country away from decades of socialism and into a new
era of capitalist growth. But in India, where a long line of Hindu

   Q. Can you reinfect yourself with an infectious disease from
which you are recovering, perhaps through exposure to residual
germs on your hands?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``There is no simple answer, but in general, it is very
unlikely,'' said Dr. John R. La Montagne, deputy director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In theory,
such reinfection is conceivable, he said, ``and one cannot say it
could never happen, but it would be very unusual and there are no
documented cases of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility would depend on the organism and how the
person's immune system responded to it, he explained. ``If a
pathogen is on the skin a long time, the person has probably
developed immunity to it,'' he said, ``and the same holds true for
an infection from which a person is recovering, so it is difficult
to `reinfect' yourself unless it is a totally different organism, a
new germ.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with two cases of flu in the same winter, La Montagne said,
the second case would probably involve an unrelated flu virus that
was present at the same time. The same patterns of disease would
appear, so it would be impossible for the patient to distinguish
between the two infections.

<P>
   Two years ago Rick Ellis of Bordentown, N.J., wanted to hire a
personal trainer to build up what he called his ``98-pound-weakling
body.'' But Ellis, a 47-year-old kindergarten teacher, was not
about to go to the gym near his home and ask about one-on-one
workouts. ``It was much too intimidating,'' he said. (It didn't
help that the gym was called Powerhouse Fitness.)
</P>
<P>
   But once he tapped his reserves of self-esteem and got through
the gym doors, he eased into personal training with a class called
Be Fitt. The hourlong session, a hybrid of an exercise class and a
one-on-one session, consisted of six to 10 clients working out on a
circuit of free weights and machines with three trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ellis has reduced his body fat from 29 percent to 17
percent, can do squats with 200 pounds and is known as ``Pump Dog''
around Powerhouse. ``The group motivated me, but I was still able
to get the personal attention that I needed from the trainers,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, personal training is often not so personal. Around
the country, growing numbers of trainers are offering the benefits
of one-on-one fitness to small groups of people who would prefer to
sweat together. ``Personal training is on the rise, and there's a
correlation between that increase and the growth of people working
with trainers in groups,'' said Maeve McCaffrey, spokeswoman for
the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, a
trade organization in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimates that in 1998, 4 million Americans used a
personal trainer. And from 1992 to 1998, the number of health clubs
offering personal training programs increased to 95 percent from 74
percent. ``People who work out in groups are generally those who
thought one-on-one was not possible,'' said Ms. McCaffrey. ``As
more clubs offer group training, the idea of working with a trainer
touches more people and makes it feel more accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also be a bargain. At the Boston Athletic Club, for
example, a one-on-one session costs $50 an hour, while semiprivate
training with two people is $35 per person. Be Fitt at the
Powerhouse gym costs $69 for a package of six classes, while one
personal training session is $45 an hour. ``It's a huge cost
saver,'' said Christopher Carney, the gym owner.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be a time saver. Once a week, Sharyn Pak, a personal
trainer, guides Beth and Ron Clearfield through an hourlong mix of
cardiovascular, strength and toning exercises in their home in
Richboro, Pa. ``We don't have a lot of time to work out,'' said
Mrs. Clearfield, 34. ``My husband is an attorney, and he doesn't
get home until 7 at night. Plus we have three kids under 8. Working
out with Sharyn, we get the benefits of exercise and we get to do
something together.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, the Clearfields make their training sessions a
family affair. ``Sharyn has set up drills for all of us using the
swing set, trampoline or whatever,'' Mrs. Clearfield said. ``We've
all gone out with me pushing my girls in the double stroller and my
husband running down the street doing soccer drills with Sharyn.
Even our dog, Sheba, joined in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many small-group enthusiasts believe camaraderie is the most
important benefit. Mary McArthur and Marlene McDonald work out
together on Mondays and Thursdays with Bjorn Read-Friedmann at
Citadel Health Management Group, a fitness center in Vancouver,
British Columbia. On Thursdays, their friend Collette Storrow joins
them for 20 minutes of aerobic exercise, 20 minutes of weights and
some stretching and toning. ``It's more of a social event with two
or three people,'' said Ms. McArthur, a 61-year-old retired manager
of a medical lab. ``Plus, being with buddies makes you much more
committed to exercising.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all trainers are convinced that small-group workouts are a
good idea. ``There's a move afoot to encourage trainers to work
with more than one client at a time, but I think it's a mistake,''
said Mark Occhipinti, president of American Fitness Professionals
and Associates, a certification and education organization in Ship
Bottom, N.J. He discourages the 17,000 members of his group from
doing it. ``It's like going to a doctor who is seeing three or four
patients at the same time in the same room,'' he went on. ``You
can't pay as close attention with three or four as when you're
working one on one. You lose the one-on-one intimacy between client
and trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep focused, some trainers will not work with more than two
people at a time, while others limit their groups to four. ``With
more than four, you can't give individualized attention,'' said
Read-Friedmann of Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   But even Ms. McArthur says she has never felt a lack of
attention during sessions with her two friends. ``When I've
exercised with a trainer alone, I admit I've worked harder,'' she
said. ``But even with three of us, I still feel like my workout is
designed just for me.''

CORAL'S STRANGE HOME  
 WORLD'S TINIEST TWEEZERS  
 BIRTH OF GIANT PLANETS

<P>
   Offshore oil rigs are not the most environmentally friendly of
places. As they take oil or gas from the depths, they also spew
chemicals, mud and other contaminants into the water.
</P>
<P>
   So it may come as a surprise to learn that some older rigs in
the North Sea have been found with colonies of an endangered coral
growing on their concrete structures some 100 to 200 feet below the
surface. It is the first appearance in the North Sea of the coral,
Lophelia pertusa, which has been considered by some scientists to
be susceptible to just the kind of contamination found around oil
rigs.
</P>
<P>
   The coral was also found on the Brent Spar, a huge cylindrical
oil storage and loading buoy that was taken out of service and
dismantled after 15 years in the North Sea. The Brent Spar had been
the focus of major environmental protests in Europe because the
original plan was to dump the buoy, with its six contaminated
storage tanks, in deep water in the North Atlantic. (Instead, it
was cut up into sections, cleaned, and used to help build a dock
extension in Norway.)
</P>
<P>
   The finding of the coral, reported by scientists with an
environmental consulting firm in the journal Nature, raises
questions about future dismantling of obsolete oil platforms. The
authors suggest that an option might be to leave some parts of the
structures _ huge concrete footings, for example _in place to
preserve existing colonies of the coral and help it gain more of a
foothold in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Got a splinter? A really tiny splinter? Two Harvard scientists
may have just the thing to help: a pair of ``nanotweezers'' capable
of manipulating objects as small as one-50,000th of an inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   To make the tweezers, the scientists attached nanotubes _
cylindrical molecules of carbon atoms _ to metal electrodes
deposited on the end of a tapered glass pipette that had been
pulled to a very fine tip. The tweezing action was created by
applying a voltage to the electrodes, which caused the nanotube
arms (which themselves are only about one-500,000th of an inch in
diameter) to close on each other.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, describing their work in the journal Science,
used the tweezers to grab and pull clusters of polystyrene
molecules. These clusters are about the size of structures within
cells, so the tweezers may eventually find a use in manipulating
and modifying biological structures.
</P>
<P>
   Since electricity is used to make the tweezers work, they could
also be used to study the electrical properties of the tiny
structures and molecules they grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists have a pretty good idea about how the solar
system's two gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, came to be. Rocky
cores formed out of the nebular disk of gas and dust swirling
around the young Sun, and then the cores attracted the helium and
hydrogen that form the bulk of the planets' masses.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to explaining how the solar system's other two
giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, were formed, this model has some
flaws. For one thing, the two planets are much farther from the
Sun, and the gas and dust in that part of the nebular disk was not
very dense. So formation of these planets' rocky cores would
probably have taken longer than the age of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Canada and the United States, using computer
modeling, have come up with an alternative explanation: that Uranus
and Neptune were formed in the vicinity of Jupiter and Saturn, and
were later kicked out of the neighborhood by the gravitational
interactions of these two planets.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory, described in Nature, Uranus and Neptune
would have been left in highly chaotic, irregular orbits for a few
hundred thousand years until friction with the nebular disk
produced their final circular orbits.  &QL;

SENSE IN SEATTLE

   WASHINGTON -- It took President Clinton, spouting Third Way
nostrums that go beyond petty politics, to finally clear away the
tear gas and the polysyllabic fog from the bizarre goings-on inside
and outside the hall at the World Trad Organization's battle in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The president's contributions were two: explaining why the trade
meeting was a flop only in a short-term sense, and declaring that
the truly big issue ahead is the looming vote in Congress on
establishing normal trade relations with China _ our end of the
bargain in getting the world's most populous nation into a system
that can guide its development to the world's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that a more open world continues to work the same
economic wonders that have been occuring ever since the basic
system was erected after World War II. There are, and always have
been, adjustment problems and abuses, but grown-up people can and
must deal with them, and their track record is more than good.
</P>
<P>
   The other reality is that a more open trading world is a vital
security concern as well as the engef economic growth. The
president was correct in noting that the world's hot spots after
the Cold War are distinguished by too little, not too much, contact
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional political babble declared the WTO gathering a
disaster because Clinton went out there to cave in to labor and
environmental groups for the benefit of the Democratic Prty and Al
Gore next year. That may work for entertainment on cable channels,
but it doesn't stand up to analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the president went West to declare that any
new round of global trade negotiations has to include the topics of
labor and environmental standards on its agenda. The developing
nations resisted, and so the talks were inconclusive _ but only for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks that is a new position for Clinton has been
asleep for the last eight years
</P>
<P>
   It was in October '92 at North Carolina State that he first
articulated his ``Yes, but'' philosophy, using the North American
Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico as his takeoff point.
As negotiated by President Bush, NAFTA was unratifiable at that
point. By insisting on side agreements regarding labor and
environmental rules and by actually negotiating them in the early
months of his presidency, Clinton made ratification possible.
Applying these principles worldwide was a position first stated on
behalf of the administration in spring '94 by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Clinton's notion was hardly that wages in other
countries should be similar to ours or that a Third World factory
need to follow American EPA rules. Instead, he introduced the
principles that extreme violations of human rights d of the
environment should be addressed and that races to the bottom for
trading advantage should be avoided. Later, Clinton negotiated
deals that recognized countries' rights to guard against sudden,
massive surges in imports following market-opening deals. That's
not protectionist; it's common sense.
</P>
<P>
   As he noted, it has often happened that concepts initially
considered alien to trade become central with time. Few thought
there were ways to begin protecting intellectual property rights in
commerce, but it turned out there were.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the break-up for now of talks about starting a new round
of world-wide trade talks necessarily disastrous. As Clinton
pointed out, it took four years, from 1982-86, to get the Uruguay
round started, and it didn't conclude until 1996. The preliminaries
to Seattle started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody needs something to happen. The United States wants
more access for farm and other products as well as formal talks on
labor and environmental standards; the Europeans and Japanese don't
like our tough antidumping laws; the Third World wants more access
for its farm and textile goods. The only way everybody can get some
satisfaction is to deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the real issue before the United States is China, and
a push is on for a congressional vote on trade relations by the
spring. Economically, the issue should be a slam dunk. US companies
and farmers will have market access beyond their recent dreams; and
China has agreed to tough rules and safeguards on import surges
that are similarly sound.
</P>
<P>
   But the hidden issue is security. Rejecng trade relations is
almost certain to mean the demise of China's relatively
outward-looking government. In its place will come the thugs who
have Tiananmen Square, anti-economic reform, anti-Americanism, and
truculence toward Taiwan on their resumes. Stability in Asia is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's business allies need to cut him enough slack to
realize he is not caving to their labor and environmental
antagonists. And his friends on the left need to recognize that in
the politics of 2000, control of Congress will be decided in swing
districts where the president's approach is the popular one.

HOORAY FOR HARRY POTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The three Harry Potter books, rightfully entrenched
at the top of the best-seller lists, are the most imaginative tales
to come along since Alice in Wonderland, fun to read for adults as
well as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' the first of what
will eventually be a series of seven books, will soon be made into
a movie. The current novels, which take little Harry through his
first three years at wizard school, have sold more than 17 million
copies worldwide, some 5 million in this country alone. Christmas
sales are expected to go through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   When their author, J. F. Rowling, toured America recently,
thousands of excited children and their parents stood in line for
hours to meet her. It is the publishing phenomenon of not just the
season, but the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The whimsical books have made Rowling fabulously wealthy. More
power to her. She has created a classic young hero who will delight
future generations of children and grandchildren, as he is
delighting us. My husband and I, both writers who read a lot,
cannot remember when we have been as entertained by the printed
page as we were this past week devouring Harry's adventures. Who
says books are dead?
</P>
<P>
   As puzzling as the goings-on at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry, however, is the outcry from stuffy muggle folk who
contend the books are an evil influence on young minds. Muggles, in
case you haven't read the books, are what Rowling's wizards call
ordinary people who cannot make magic and cannot understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative parents, particularly fundamentalist Christians,
complain that making magic seem like fun promotes the occult and
weird religions like Wicca, which is a tiny sect that indulges in
pagan rites. Evangelist Pat Robertson is in a froth about Wiccans,
but nobody else seems to think they represent a threat to organized
religion or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Galloping gargoyles, are these book-banners reading the same
elegant prose I just did?
</P>
<P>
   Harry is in the great tradition of our best fairy tales, which
can be scary and filled with danger but always have happy endings
in which good conquers evil. His early childhood as an unwanted
orphan abused by relatives is the Cinderella tale revisited. His
story is a struggle against rejection, hardship and evil forces,
with which we can all identify. The addition of humor and a little
magic dust provides the enchantment that attracts us and keeps us
rooting for him and thrilled when he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter doesn't talk to a supernatural world. He doesn't
pray to ghosts. He and his friends rely on their own wit and
courage. He has odd powers denied muggles, but he is human, lives
in a defined wizard world and makes recognizably human mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   He forgets to wear his invisible cloak and exposes his presence
in places he is not supposed to be. His wand doesn't always work
right. He can't control the broomstick he is riding in a game in
the sky. He almost got picked for the least desirable Hogwarts
dormitory. He flubs the password, which is ``pig snout,'' to get to
his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   An annoying but harmless ghost named Peeves haunts the student
quarters. The professors know how to turn themselves into animals,
but Harry hasn't learned that trick yet.
</P>
<P>
   A three-headed dog and mountain trolls lurk dangerously.
Centaurs roam the nearby forest. Owls deliver the mail, but Harry
never gets any from his guardians, who are glad to be rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   He takes classes in making mysterious potions, which he is not
very good at. The spine of his book on monsters has to be stroked
to make it stop growling and to open its pages. A rival classmate
bugs the dickens out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the inventive antics, dollops of wisdom fall. The
school's headmaster, explaining a mirror that can show the past and
the future, advises his young charge, ``It does not do to dwell on
dreams and forget to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry is 11 when he goes to Hogwarts, where his murdered parents
had distinguished themselves as outstanding good-guy wizards.
Rowlings says she will take him to adulthood at 18 and then stop. I
sob at the very thought of losing Harry but eagerly anticipate his
next four years as a wizard-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow-minded, would-be book-banners are missing something
wonderfully special. I feel sorry for them _ and their children.

FORBES' POLITICAL FORTUNE YET TO MATERIALIZE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNAPEE, N.H. _ Outside, moonlight glistened off a scenic
mountain lake, and a crispness in the Saturday night air hinted at
the winter that would soon grip this state, presidential candidates
and all.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the community lodge, magazine publisher Steve Forbes
stood before a fire, explaining to 150 people what was wrong with
the politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sort of practice there what you might call the rooster
method of government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, roosters feel that they cock-a-doodle-do and the sun
rises each day. In Washington, they do the same thing. They make
the appropriate noises in the morning, the sun comes up, but unlike
the roosters, they send out press releases, proclaiming what
they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, fortunately, doesn't have to make a living as a standup
comedian. But the heir to a multimillion-dollar family fortune
clearly is running for the Republican presidential nomination as a
Washington outsider, someone who repeatedly decries the
``disconnect'' that he sees between the political culture of the
nation's capital and the ``potential greatness'' of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   He has ridiculed Washington politicians as roosters and worse in
countless speeches throughout the country at a time when
anti-Washington feelings are running high among voters.
</P>
<P>
   What is not so clear, however, is why he is running. Until his
surprise entry in the 1996 presidential race, Forbes had never
sought elective office. He created some excitement with his
flat-tax proposal, spent more than $30 million and won two minor
primaries before dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, millions of dollars into his second campaign, he is
advocating tax reform again as well as changes in the health care
system and letting younger Americans invest their Social Security
dollars in their own personalized retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And he has expanded his message to embrace the priorities of the
social and religious conservatives who helped derail him four years
ago. But he has been able to register only single digits in most
public opinion polls, widely trailing GOP front-runner George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Why does a successful businessman continue to spend so much time
and risk huge chunks of his personal fortune on a seemingly
impossible goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the business part of me is willing to take risks,
knowing that any great thing is a long shot,'' Forbes explained on
a recent bus ride through New Hampshire, where he has tirelessly
campaigned for the first-in-the-nation primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sure thing. If you have faith in what you're
doing, you have an obligation to move on that faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the polls, Forbes' wealth makes him a significant factor
in the presidential race, if for no other reason than his deep
pockets and Bush's record fund raising helped narrow the Republican
field early.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties of the money game included former Vice President Dan
Quayle, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former American
Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, whose husband, Bob Dole,
accused Forbes of trying to buy the presidency during the 1996
primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers estimate that Forbes may spend as much as $50
million of his own money on this campaign, bringing his personal
outlay for two presidential campaigns to about $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis by The New York Times, Forbes'
expenditures are exceeding his cash flow, leading the newspaper to
conclude that the publisher has been quietly selling off some of
his shares in family-held Forbes Inc. to his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the newspaper reported, he has slipped from
being the company's majority shareholder to a major shareholder.
Forbes has declined to say how many shares he has sold or how much
he was paid for them, but he insists he's complied with campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume that Forbes is simply hoping that lightning
will strike, that Bush will stumble and that Forbes &UR;  &LR; will suddenly
become a major contender for the Republican prize.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts believe, moreover, that Forbes is an
ideologue who views a presidential race as an opportunity, win or
lose, to promote ideas that he holds dear. No one, they point out,
gets more publicity than a serious presidential candidate. And any
presidential candidate worth a reported $400 million or more has to
be taken seriously, until the voters have had a chance to prove
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A presidential candidate gets ink and air time that no
foundation can match,'' said University of Texas at Austin
government professor Bruce Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Some also believe that Forbes may be in the hunt for the long
haul, that he may be building a political base for a third shot at
the White House. At 52, he is young enough, they point out, to run
for president one or two more times.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he jumped into the presidential race four years ago
and is running a second time because no other Republican candidates
were committed to building upon the legacy of Ronald Reagan, one of
his political heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one was offering new ideas to take money and power out of
the hands of the Washington politicians and truly put it back in
the hands of the American people,'' he wrote in his book, ``A New
Birth of Freedom,'' published earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The book title is taken from the Gettysburg address of another
Forbes hero, Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Some people speculate that Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr. is
running for president as a symptom of a public midlife change, much
as his late father did before him.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Sr., a tireless promoter of the upscale
business magazine that bears the family name, was in his 50s before
he flamboyantly broadened his interests to include motorcycling,
hot-air ballooning and Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Steve, his decidedly &UR;  &LR; staid eldest son, has taken up running for
president as a different kind of hobby, according to this theory.
</P>
<P>
   But it should be noted that Forbes Sr. also was stricken with
the political bug, although at a younger age than his son. The
elder Forbes was a state senator for eight years in New Jersey and
lost two races for governor of that state in the 1950s, when he was
in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Family Business magazine shortly after his
father's death in 1990, Forbes said that his father, at one point,
also wanted to be president of the United States but turned his
energies to the magazine when he realized his political career
wasn't going to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was only 9 when his father lost his second gubernatorial
race, buried in a landslide by a popular Democratic incumbent, but
some of the memories stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember the picnics. You remember putting up posters and
bumper stickers and handing out literature and things like that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was disappointed he didn't win the general
election, but the campaign was exciting and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes became president and editor in chief of Forbes magazine
after his father's death and, from that forum, dabbled on the edges
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan appointed him to the board that oversaw Radio
Free Europe and Radio Liberty, key weapons in America's Cold War
arsenal. President Bush reappointed him to that post, and Forbes
helped Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, two members of Reagan's Cabinet,
organize a conservative grass-roots organization called Empower
America.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 interview with Family Business, however, Forbes
denied that he had political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I grew up with a politician, I saw that to be serious
about politics, you give up a lot of your privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is your boss, every holiday you're working the
events. The phone is always ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the same interview if he wanted to be president, Forbes
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to give it to me, sure, I'll take it. But how many
make it to the Holy Grail?''
</P>
<P>
   But after Kemp and other potential Republican candidates to his
liking decided to sit out the 1996 primaries, Forbes decided to
jump in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jude Wanniski, a supply-side economist and former Wall Street
Journal editorial writer, claims credit for nudging Forbes into
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation came from a good friend of his _ me _ telling
him the roster (of candidates) was incredibly thin,'' Wanniski
said.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a long memorandum to Forbes, proposing a presidential
race for the publisher four years ago, after Kemp had ruled himself
out. Wanniski and Forbes, who lived a few miles from each other in
New Jersey, had been longtime friends and had often discussed
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   But they had a falling-out after Forbes became a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes lost in 1996 because ``he rejected my advice'' and
listened to the wrong people, Wanniski said.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't involved in Forbes' current campaign but has advised
Quayle and Pat Buchanan, who recently jumped from the GOP to seek
the Reform Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his future may hold, Forbes' interest in politics and
economics began in his childhood in New Jersey, where he still
lives.
</P>
<P>
   He told one interviewer several years ago that he started
reading The New York Times and following the stock market when he
was 12 or 13.
</P>
<P>
   As a son of privilege, Forbes at a young age met a number of
famous and influential people from the worlds of business and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   He and his four siblings helped their father entertain corporate
chiefs during lunch and dinner cruises on the magazine's yacht, the
Highlander.
</P>
<P>
   One of his childhood friends was Christine Todd, now New Jersey
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Forbes and Whitman don't always see eye to eye on
politics. Forbes advised Whitman during her first gubernatorial
race in 1993, but they have drifted apart on social issues. Whitman
favors abortion rights, while Forbes, eager to win the support of
social conservatives, has made opposition to abortion an important
part of his current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just last month, Forbes held a rally in Trenton to support
a bill before the New Jersey Legislature that would require
students to recite a passage from the Declaration of Independence
at the start of each school day. Whitman opposes the bill because
she believes that it has marginal educational value.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman declined to comment on Forbes' presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes that he is a very bright man, but there are some
issues on which they differ,'' the governor's spokeswoman, Jane
O'Connor, said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was only 17 when he wrote his first article for the
family's magazine. The contribution, which his father carried as
part of his ``Fact and Comment'' column, was a report from the 1964
Republican National Convention in San Francisco, which nominated
Barry Goldwater for an impossible challenge to President Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the young people around my age were Goldwater
supporters. And they weren't kooks,'' the young Forbes wrote,
without revealing his own preference in candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them had at least one conspicuous button and when
it came to noisemaking, they were tops.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also published his observations of the 1968
conventions, including what he called the ``fierce Democratic melee
in Chicago.'' Forbes, then a 21-year-old Princeton student, called
legendary Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, who unleashed the city's
police on young anti-war protesters, a ``unique antique.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Princeton with a history degree in 1970
and serving a five-month active duty commitment to the New Jersey
National Guard, he became a fact-checker and researcher in the
magazine's editorial department and quickly worked his way up the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not the kind of guy who said, `Let's go get a beer.' He
was very awkward socially,'' recalled a former writer for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The former staffer said he finds Forbes' presidential ambitions
``befuddling.'' But, he added, ``He was always interested in
economic issues, and the stage for it is politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who soon began getting regular column space of his own,
developed a reputation as an able prognosticator of presidential
election results and economic trends. By 1989, he had been a
four-time winner of the prestigious Crystal Owl award, presented
annually to the reporter making the most accurate economic
predictions for the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not actively involved in running the magazine
during his presidential race, he retains the title of president and
editor in chief and still regularly writes a column.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent column, he criticized the ``inconsistent,
floundering regime'' of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and
endorsed an instant video replay as a way to resolve controversial
calls by umpires during Major League Baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Forbes) has a very good mind. He just wasn't
blessed with Malcolm's (his father's) gift of gab,'' the former
Forbes staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been characterized as stiff and owlish, but his
speaking style on the campaign trail is hardly any worse than
Bush's, Al Gore's or Bill Bradley's. None of the leading contenders
of either major party is golden-throated.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's one-liners, most of which he says he writes
himself, are generally well-received. ``It makes you wonder what
global warming can do to a man's mind,'' is one of his favorite
digs at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' gestures during his speeches often are mechanical, but
that doesn't seem to bother supporters like April Carter, 42, an
aircraft engine factory worker from Chichester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is huge. I just sense it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, however, may
not agree. Forbes' negative TV ads against Dole during the primary
season are believed to have contributed to the nominee's general
election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, trying to position himself as a viable, conservative
alternative to Bush for Republican voters in 2000, Forbes has
recently gone on the offensive against the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes recently began running a TV spot in New Hampshire,
blasting Bush for suggesting that the Social Security retirement
age could be raised to bolster the troubled system. And he was
quick to criticize Bush's proposal to cut income taxes, rather than
overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes promotes his own tax proposal _ which would impose a 17
percent flat tax on all income above $36,000 for a family of four,
abolish capital gains taxes and eliminate many loopholes and
deductions _ as a boon for middle- and low-income Americans. What
he doesn't often say, however, is that his plan also could be worth
untold millions in tax savings to his own company.

 Herbert Mitgang, a former member of the editorial board of The New
York Times, is the author of ``Abraham Lincoln: A Press
Portrait.''  
 By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago Tuesday, on Dec. 14, 1799, the first
president of the United States died at the age of 67 in his bed at
Mount Vernon. George Washington's doctors said the cause was
``inflammatory quinsy,'' a severe infection of the throat, but to
this day controversy has surrounded his death.
</P>
<P>
   That debate _ did Washington die because of medical malpractice?
_ is vividly evoked, though not resolved, in an article in the
current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Dr. David Morens, an epidemiologist with the
National Institutes of Health in Maryland, pulls together details
about Washington's treatment from dozens of published medical and
historical sources over nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to do is describe the medical events and also
set Washington's final days in a social and cultural context,''
Morens, 51, said in an interview. ``My study shows that accusations
of malpractice were very much in the air during and immediately
after the great man died.''
</P>
<P>
   Morens writes that when Washington's throat swelled so painfully
that he could not swallow, he asked his doctors to bleed him. At
the time it was standard medical practice, but the amount of blood
removed was staggering _ 80 ounces, or 5 pints, in a single day _
and many people questioned whether he had been bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   While Morens' article does not come down firmly on one side or
the other, he said in the interview: ``I would probably not call it
medical malpractice in the context of today's usage. It's hard to
know what his doctors meant by `inflammatory quinsy' in that
premicrobe time. I believe the symptoms point to the modern
diagnosis of acute bacterial epiglottitis. No autopsy was
performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Morens said, the bloodletting itself probably did not
kill Washington. The retired president was a big man _ 6 feet 3{
inches tall. (That was also the height of Abraham Lincoln, who once
described himself as 6 feet 4 inches ``nearly.'')
</P>
<P>
   The article notes that in 1799, Dr. Benjamin Rush, a renowned
physician, signer of the Declaration of the Independence and
onetime surgeon general of the Continental Army, was defending
himself against allegations of malpractice because of excessive
bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   He sued a journalist who accused him of killing patients. Rush
won his case _ on Dec. 14, as it happened _ but the verdict did not
allay the popular suspicion that bleeding could be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bloodletting did not die out as a regular practice until
the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   On Washington's fateful day, Albin Rawlins, one of his overseers
and a bloodletter, was summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of that morning and afternoon he removed 12
ounces of blood, then 18 ounces, another 18 ounces and a final 32
ounces into a porcelain bleeding bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth bloodletting, the patient improved slightly and
was able to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   By about 10 p.m., his condition deteriorated, but he was still
rational enough to whisper burial instructions to Col. Tobias Lear,
his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:20 p.m., Dr. James Craik, 69, an Edinburgh-trained
physician who had served with Washington in the French and Indian
Wars, closed Washington's eyes. Another Edinburgh-trained
physician, Dr. Gustavus Richard Brown, 52, was also present. The
third physician, Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick, 37, who had been appointed
coroner the previous year, stopped the clock in Washington's
bedroom at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With perfect resignation and in full possession of his
reason,'' Lear wrote afterward, ``he closed his well-spent life.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the three doctors were not unanimous about the best
means to treat Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dick argued that further bleeding might weaken the patient.
Nevertheless, Craik ordered the fourth bleeding. Dick rejected
Craik's diagnosis of inflammatory quinsy and suggested other
possibilities, including cynanche trachealis, an obstruction of the
passage leading to suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   But these differences appeared after the fact, in response to
public criticism. The article hints that the doctors were
protecting their personal reputations to avoid charges of
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morens' article does not deal with them, some of
Washington's contemporaries raised questions about his health and
state of mind after his arduous military service and two
presidential terms. In 1818, Thomas Jefferson reminisced about
Washington's last years at Mount Vernon:
</P>
<P>
   ``General Washington's memory was already sensibly impaired by
age, the firm tone of mind for which he had been remarkable was
beginning to relax, its energy was abated; a listlessness of labor,
a desire for tranquillity, had crept on him, and there was a
willingness to let others act and even think for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, James Thomas Flexner, a biographer of
Washington, said it was still unclear exactly what disease had
killed him, but Flexner dismissed the idea of malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the years doctors have speculated on Washington's
illness,'' he said. ``One guess is diphtheria, another a virulent
streptococcus infection of the throat. Either disease, in the state
of medicine at that time, would have been fatal, regardless of the
treatment prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington was old and sick by then,'' Flexner declared. ``It
was perfectly clear that he knew he was dying, and he was getting
ready to die. The doctors did what they did in those days. To
believe otherwise is moonshine.''

OUTING THE INSIDE LINGO OF PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 19)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Dumpster-dipping &LR;  is what advocates of privacy call ``the act
by information pirates of sifting through trash bins and garbage
cans for credit-card numbers, Social Security numbers and
unshredded trade secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Skip-tracers &LR;  are the new breed of bounty hunters, who use
their knowledge of databases, motor-vehicle license records (Texas
and Florida drivers are most vulnerable) and credit-card purchases
to track down deadbeats or forgetful consumers who have moved and
left behind debts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Header information &LR;  is data that most people would consider
confidential at the top of a credit report, which the Federal Trade
Commission says may be disclosed by any credit bureau with no
restrictions. This includes your name, address, phone number
(listed or not), Social Security number and mother's maiden name.
One credit bureau is demanding in court that even more personal
data be included under  &UR; header information &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cookies &LR; , a term coined in 1703 and rooted in the Dutch for a
small cake, has a meaning no longer limited to a product sold by
Girl Scouts or lasciviously applied to older attractive women.
``How can a company follow you all over the Internet without your
knowledge?'' asked Lesley Stahl of CBS on a recent ``60 Minutes''
privacy expose. ``By placing a tracking device called a  &UR; cookie &LR; 
inside your computer while you're online.''
</P>
<P>
   That small file often surreptitiously created on your operating
system is a kind of digital tattoo, enabling a company to create a
dossier on your browsing history. It may then sell the track marks
of your habits and interests to advertisers, prospective employers
or _ who knows? _ outfits whose databases are easily penetrable by
the basest stalkers. (One of these days a software genius will
market a privacy program called  &UR; Cookie Cutter &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spam &LR;  _ the canned luncheon meat that is so often derogated but
which I found every bit as delicious as C rations _ had its name
lifted in 1970 by Monty Python's Flying Circus. The new sense _
``unsolicited commercial e-mail sent far and wide'' _ was born in a
skit in which a waitress tells a customer that the morning special
is ``lobster thermidor a crevette with a Mornay sauce served in a
Provencal manner, with shallots and aubergines garnished with
truffle pate, brandy and with a fried egg on top and ...  &UR; Spam &LR; !''
</P>
<P>
   When the customer asks, ``Have you got anything without
 &UR; Spam &LR; ?'' the waitress replies, ``Well, there's
 &UR; Spam &LR; -egg-sausage-and- &UR; Spam &LR;  _ that's not got much  &UR; Spam &LR;  in it.''
The breakfast customer's vain attempt to order something else is
then drowned out by a group of Vikings in horned helmets chanting,
`` &UR; Spam &LR; ,  &UR; Spam &LR; ,  &UR; Spam &LR; !'' That led to the current Internet sense
of the term as ``unwanted and oppressive advertising messages.''
</P>
<P>
   For these etymologies of privacy lingo, I am indebted to Robert
Ellis Smith, editor of Privacy Journal (P.O. Box 28577, Providence,
RI 02908; $118 per year). His Web site is
www.townonline.com/privacyjournal, and it had better not have a
 &UR; cookie &LR;  in it.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the most critical and confusing term in the
battle between those who would not intrude on individual privacy
and those who see  &UR; cookies &LR;  and dossierization as a shopper's
blessing:  &UR; opt in &LR;  vs.  &UR; opt out &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   To  &UR; opt &LR;  is from the Latin  &UR; optare &LR; , ``to choose.'' But  &UR; opt &LR; 
suggests a slightly more impulsive quality to the choice. In
``Comfortable Words,'' Bergen Evans described the subtle difference
in a blaze of usagist brilliance: ``Confronted with a choice
between  &UR; choose &LR;  and  &UR; opt &LR; , my impulse is to  &UR; opt &LR;  for  &UR; choose &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Now to the slight difference in a phrase _ until recently
considered slang, but now Standard English _ that could make a huge
difference in our lives. `` &UR; Opt in &LR;  is the equivalent of giving
consent,'' Smith says. ``When  &UR; opt in &LR;  is required by law, the
collector of information must seek and secure the affirmative
approval of a person before disclosing it or using it for other
purposes.'' The Privacy Act requires this with regard to federal
records, with several exceptions, like criminal investigations, the
Census Bureau or orders of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``By contrast,  &UR; opt out &LR;  is merely a check off,'' the privacy
maven points out. ``The consumer must be given the opportunity _
but must take the initiative _ to say that he or she does not want
personal information disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Opt in &LR;  puts the burden on the collector, to get the
individual's approval. But  &UR; opt out &LR;  puts the burden on the
individual, to click on a box that says, ``No _ you cannot disclose
my personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know enough to care, or are easily duped into
not checking the box by offers of gifts or services _ and thereby
unwittingly make their purchasing decisions and their lives an open
book.  &UR; Opt in &LR;  requires getting the customer to say yes, and
positive approval is hard for the data collector to obtain;  &UR; opt
out &LR;  merely requires giving the customer a chance to say no, which
is harder for the mild-mannered customer to say.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's act permitting the merger of banks, brokers and
insurance companies, the few privacy advocates in the Senate, like
the Republican Richard Shelby and the Democrat Pat Leahy, fought
for  &UR; opt in &LR; , but lobbyists for the banking industry blocked not
only  &UR; opt in &LR;  but also the even more permissive  &UR; opt out &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In general political terminology,  &UR; opt out &LR;  has a wider meaning
of ``to withdraw from politics.'' It was first used in this sense
by Kevin Phillips in a 1971 article about Vice President Spiro
Agnew in The New York Times Magazine: ``By next summer, if the vice
president is a political liability, he will  &UR; opt out &LR;  of a
re-election bid long before anyone has to `dump' him.''
</P>
<P>
   This type of self-removal from the fray is exemplified by the
prissy citizen who claimed that apathy was not the cause of
refusing to go to the polls. ``I never vote,'' the  &UR; opter-out &LR; 
said. ``It only encourages them.''

 &HT;    Hospital employees' Parrothead stunt puts fun in fund-raising
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The story of how six physical therapists at Miami
Valley Hospital filled charitable Christmas baskets by dressing up
in food costumes is not so obvious as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't actually fit in the baskets.
</P>
<P>
   It was last summer that the PTs and three friends dressed up as
a picnic meal for their annual trip to see Jimmy Buffett in
Cincinnati. The previous year, they had talked about ``doing
something a little different,'' as Dona Dersarkisian puts it.
Dressing up as the entree and condiments in Buffett's song,
``Cheeseburger in Paradise,'' seemed different enough, so they
spent 20 to 30 hours making costumes for their field trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we were listening to Buffett music as we were making
them,'' Lisa Holscher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I like mine with lettuce and tomato,
</P>
<P>
   Heinz 57 and french-fried potatoes,
</P>
<P>
   Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, good God Almighty, which way do I steer
</P>
<P>
   For my cheeseburger in paradise?''
</P>
<P>
   The walking buffet _ Buffett? _ table caught the eyes of some
photographers in Cincinnati, naturally, and one of them happened to
work for Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured we might be in a picture in the magazine,'' said
Holscher, the french fries. ``But the photographer said he showed
the picture to Buffett later in Boston, and Buffett loved the
picture. So he sold it to Buffett.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographer eventually called one of the therapists'
friends to say the picture would be on the cardboard insert for
Buffett's new CD, ``Buffett Live Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays.''
The live collection of classics and new songs came out last month.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to understand at this point in the story that
Miami Valley Hospital, like many companies, gives holiday baskets
to needy families and nursing homes each December. Each department
takes responsibility for raising the money to fill a family's
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they get a little creative and competitive,''
spokeswoman Julie McEwan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something other than just bake sales,'' said
Heather Koch, the lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to put on their costumes, go to the hospital
cafeteria and autograph their CD pictures for anyone making a
donation. ``Usually it was $2 to $5,'' said Scott Johnson, the
cheeseburger patty. They've signed more than 100 and also raised
more than $150 by raffling off a basket full of Parrothead
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to Christmas time, the more creative the idea,
the more funds that are raised,'' said Dersarkisian, the kosher
pickle. ``We've probably been the zaniest fund-raiser so far. We've
certainly gotten our share of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The PTs and occupational therapists together are assembling
baskets for two families, one of which the PTs already know. The
family spent a lot of time in therapy after a serious accident
earlier in the year. Families are nominated by hospital employees
and volunteers and then chosen by the holiday basket committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get information about the families and go shopping,''
Dersarkisian said. ``We get them dietary supplies that wouldn't be
covered by food stamps, toys, games, clothes, coats, whatever their
needs happen to be.'' For one of the families this year, that means
kitchen supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital will kick in a ham and some bread, milk and fruit
for each of the 145 baskets, and the departments will deliver their
baskets on Thursday. ``It's nice to see their faces,'' Holscher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The therapists are wondering how they'll follow all this next
year. Fruitcakes? Margarita fixings? ``We're going to have to do
something,'' Holscher said. ``We want to see if we can make it up
on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To contribute to Miami Valley Hospital's holiday basket
committee, contact Patricia Tremblay at (937) 208-2368 or Lisa
Holscher of the cheeseburger and therapy department at (937)

 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a turn of events that might have delighted Dr. Jonas Salk.
Nearly 40 years after the United States abandoned his injectable
polio vaccine in favor of the oral version created by his rival,
Dr. Albert Sabin, the pendulum has swung back. Starting in 2000,
the government has declared, the Sabin vaccine will be dropped and
replaced by a series of old-fashioned polio shots that will use a
stronger version of what is essentially the Salk vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   To the public, Salk, who died in 1995, has always been the hero
who conquered polio. Even though his vaccine, licensed in 1955, was
replaced by the Sabin vaccine starting in 1961, it was the Salk
version that halted the frightening epidemics that had gripped the
nation in the 1930s,  &UR; ' &LR; 40s and early  &UR; ' &LR; 50s, killing thousands of
children and leaving many more with lasting paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   The two men clashed personally as well as scientifically, and
Sabin, who died in 1993, never relented in his bitterness toward
Salk. So it is tempting to regard the resurgence of the polio shot
as Jonas Salk's last hurrah, the final proof that he was right
after all.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is more complicated than that. Researchers say
that both vaccines played important roles, and that it was the
resounding success of the Sabin vaccine in much of the world that
made it possible for the United States to return to the Salk
variety. And that change means that medicine is coming close to a
goal that would delight the fathers of both vaccines: the worldwide
eradication of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of global elimination of polio,'' said Dr.
Georges Peter, a professor of pediatrics at Brown University and
chairman of the national vaccine advisory committee. ``It's one of
the great triumphs of 20th-century medicine. We hope that in the
next 5 to 10 years, polio vaccine will no longer be necessary,
similar to the situation with smallpox.'' But as long as it is
still possible to catch polio somewhere in the world, countries
will continue to vaccinate.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization resolved in 1988 to wipe out polio
by the end of 2000, and officials say it is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have what you guys call a fighting chance to do it
by the end of next year,'' said Dr. Rudi Tangermann, a medical
officer at the health organization's Expanding Immunization Program
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are already working together to take inventories of
laboratories that have stocks of the polio virus being used for
research, with the goal of making sure that they are either
destroyed or moved to a few secure containment sites like the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Although
bioterrorism becomes possible in an unvaccinated world, researchers
say the polio virus is not an ideal weapon: It is neither deadly
enough nor easily enough transmitted to bring about large-scale
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization estimates that there were just
5,000 cases of polio this year, a drop of more than 90 percent
since 1989. The disease has already been eliminated from many parts
of the world. The Western Hemisphere, for instance, was declared
polio-free in 1994. In the United States, isolated cases occurred
in 1986 and in 1993, but they were brought in from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Polio, however, is still present in parts of Africa, southern
Asia and the Indian subcontinent. (The number of infected people,
who can spread the disease, is higher than the 5,000 known cases of
polio because only a small percentage of those who become infected
actually get sick.)
</P>
<P>
   The elimination strategy consists of broad and repeated
immunization campaigns and intense surveillance to make sure the
disease is gone. Scientists say it is safe to assume that it has
been eradicated when no more cases occur: the virus needs human
hosts _ there is no known animal host _ and once they have all been
immunized, it has no place left to go.
</P>
<P>
   These immunization drives rely on the Sabin vaccine, which is
given orally and uses a live but weakened form of the polio virus
to stimulate immunity. (The Salk vaccine uses killed virus.) It is
much easier to give an oral vaccine than a shot, but that is not
the only reason the Sabin vaccine is favored in areas where polio
still exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In endemic areas, the oral vaccine is the vaccine of choice,''
said Dr. Rebecca Prevots, an epidemiologist in the National
Immunization Program at the CDC. ``It contains live virus, and it
can spread from a vaccinated person to an unvaccinated person, and
it will confer some immunity to the unvaccinated person. You can
immunize more people than you're actually vaccinating. You get more
bang for the buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Prevots said, is that the oral vaccine
creates strong immunity in the intestine, whereas the Salk vaccine
has a weaker effect. Intestinal immunity is of great value because
the polio virus enters the body through the digestive tract and is
shed in stools, which can infect others. If people given the Sabin
vaccine are exposed to polio, the immunity in their gut will stop
them from excreting the live virus. But those given the Salk
vaccine, even though they do not get sick themselves if exposed to
polio, can still shed the virus and pass the disease to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oral vaccine raises intestinal immunity in the whole
population, and it can stop transmission of the wild polio virus
quickly,'' Prevots said.
</P>
<P>
   Once polio has been eliminated, as it has in the United States,
the oral vaccine is no longer needed, and its risks actually begin
to outweigh its benefits. Because it contains live virus, it
carries a small but real risk of causing polio in the child given
the vaccine or an adult exposed to that child: about eight cases a
year in the United States, one for every 2.4 million doses, have
been caused by the vaccine. The Salk vaccine carries no such risk.
</P>
<P>
   It is that risk that has prompted the United States to switch
back to the Salk vaccine, a move that researchers say could have
taken place several years ago.

   ``The major reason for the reluctance to withdraw the oral
vaccine sooner has been concern about the global village in which
we live,'' said Peter, the chairman of the vaccine advisory panel.
``We're just a few hours by plane from countries where polio is
still circulating.''
</P>
<P>
   If the immunization efforts succeed in eliminating polio by the
end of 2000, researchers say it will take several more years of
careful surveillance to make sure that the last few hot spots are
truly clear of the disease. If they are, the world may be certified
polio-free by 2005, and if that occurs, vaccination may end by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, as it did for smallpox, we're going to
start saving a lot of money,'' said Tangermann, of the World Health
Organization. ``The savings will be in the billions.''

POTENT VIRUS THREATENS BABIES' BREATHING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A highly contagious respiratory virus that often overwhelms
pediatric clinics in winter has arrived in force, federal officials
say, and is sending twice as many babies to the hospital as
scientists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, specialists are urging parents and pediatricians to
be especially vigilant for breathing difficulties in babies at risk
for the virus: twins and other multiples, premature babies and
those born with lung or heart disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Why the virus seems rampant this year is unclear, but
pediatricians suspect one important reason may be the rising
numbers of babies under under 6 months of age in day-care centers.
The doctors say these very young children come in frequent contact
with other babies who may be infected, or with workers who may
touch one child and pass the virus to another.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly known as RSV, for respiratory syncytial virus, it
infects nearly all young children sooner or later. But normally,
its effects are indistinguishable from the common cold and it goes
away without harm.
</P>
<P>
   In some babies, however, it rapidly penetrates even the smallest
inner branches of the lungs' airway systems and may result in
inflammations and blockages. And that can cause permanent lung
damage and even death if not controlled soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
in The Journal of the American Medical Association that more than
100,000 hospitalizations a year are related to RSV _ one and a half
to two times the expected number. CDC officials think the virus
causes about 500 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Frogel, chief of pediatrics at Schneider Children's
Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., calls the current peak season,
which generally runs from November through April, one of the worst
he has seen. And Dr. Alan H. Cohen, a pulmonologist at Morehouse
School of Medicine, says it has reached epidemic proportions in the
Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians advise parents and those who come close to babies
at high risk to be doubly certain to wash their hands with warm
water before and after touching them, to discourage visitors who
have colds and to keep the babies away from crowds. Child-care
workers are warned to be alert for wheezing and other breathing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen offers these warning signs: ``Look for flaring of the
nostrils, grunting, inability to drink, to hydrate. Take off the
shirt. Look at the neck for contracting muscles, for tugging above
and at the chest. If belly muscles are tightening with each breath,
the child is going into respiratory failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Frogel said in an interview that many doctors themselves needed
to be trained in RSV, management and in detecting the virus.
Techniques developed over the past few years can determine quickly
whether the child has been infected, he said, including methods of
discovering antigens in the babies' nasal mucus, and blood monitors
that detect whether oxygen levels are high enough.
</P>
<P>
   And the pediatricians say there is a highly effective new drug
that should be given once a month to all high-risk babies, even
though it is expensive, at $1,000 an injection. The drug,
palivizumab, whose trade name is Synagis, was approved by the
federal Food and Drug Administration last year. Fogel said that he
gave it to 269 high-risk children last year and that so far none
have shown symptoms of the infection. Cohen put 320 on the drug and
only 5 became infected.
</P>
<P>
   The medication is a monoclonal antibody, developed artificially
by genetic engineering, which acts like an antibody of the human
immune system. It lies in wait in a baby's body, then attaches to
the invading virus and neutralizes it before it can begin
replicating.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug is effective for only a month and is not powerful
enough to combat the virus after it has entered the body and
proliferates, inflaming the inner airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that point,'' said Dr. David K. Shay, a pediatrician and
epidemiologist with the CDC's viral division, ``the inflammation
has already occurred and it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, MedImmune of Gaithersburg, Md., said the
drug's high cost reflected extraordinary expenses incurred in
genetically engineering and producing it, and in long clinical
trials needed to make certain the drug was safe. Doctors said the
costs of treating the children were being covered by most insurance
companies and by Medicaid.

 &HT;    Forecast gets gloomier after Dolphins lose in Meadowlands
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Legend has it that Jimmy Hoffa is buried
in one end zone of Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he might have gotten some company.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins' 34th season isn't dead. Not yet. But a few
weeks from now, Dolphins fans may look at this once-promising year
and say it is planted in the east end zone of the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Keyshawn Johnson caught two fourth-quarter
touchdown passes from Ray Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   That is where safety Otis Stoutmire celebrated after returning a
Dan Marino interception 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Dolphins hopes of bouncing back from what
happened one week earlier _ a loss to Indianapolis in a battle for
first place in the AFC East _ disintegrated into a 28-20 loss to a
team that began the day reeling from a loss to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ready to lay down,'' linebacker Zach Thomas said,
sitting in front of his locker, staring at the ground. ``I promise
you that. We just kept letting them hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins now have lost their past three games and four of
the past five to fall to 8-5. They began the day clinging to the
sixth, and final AFC East playoff spot. They had a chance to move
past Buffalo when the Bills lost 19-17 to the Giants in an early
game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this will be remembered as a day that the Jets, a team
whose roster has been depleted of stars, turned to one that was
still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   They gave Johnson the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He caught a career-high 11 passes for 144 yards. His 26-yard
touchdown catch on the first play of the fourth quarter tied the
score at 13-13. And his 24-yard touchdown with 9:34 remaining gave
the Jets their first lead _ one that they never let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew I'd have the opportunity to catch a lot of
balls,'' Johnson said. ``You should be able to beat man-to-man.''
</P>
<P>
   But should Johnson, who Sunday reached the 1,000-yard receiving
mark for the second consecutive season, have man-to-man coverage?
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the many questions Dolphins' fans will be asking
after this loss.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Dolphins were focused on stopping a
receiver. The other one.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Wayne Chrebet has been the player who burned the
Dolphins. Chrebet began the day with four touchdowns against Miami.
Johnson had three. Plus, as cornerback Sam Madison pointed out, the
tapes they had watched showed the Jets going to Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn is their go-to guy, but over the last couple weeks we
saw Chrebet catches more passes and making big plays,'' Madison
said. ``They had been featuring him. We thought they would do that.
But they had a different gameplan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chrebet-or-Johnson emphasis might have been moot if the
Dolphins had been able to stop running back Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   With 11:29 remaining in the fourth quarter and the score tied,
the Jets were faced with a fourth-and-1 at the Dolphins 32-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Bill Parcells decided to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in this season when one would have bet the
Dolphins defense would have made Parcells pay.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing Denver 113 yards on the ground in the season
opener, the Dolphins held their next six opponents to less than 100
yards. They headed into their Nov. 7 game against Tennessee having
allowed an average of 76.7 yards per game. Then they allowed five
consecutive opponents to rush for at least 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they ended that streak. They held the Jets to 95 yards
on 24 carries. But when they really needed a stop, they didn't get
it.
</P>
<P>
   On that fourth-and-1, Martin didn't just get a yard, he got 9.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, defensive end Daryl Gardener knocked Lucas
woozy with a helmet-to-helmet hit. Lucas was helped off the field.
As Rick Mirer ran one play, handing off to Martin, Lucas convinced
Parcells he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked me right in the eye and said, `I'm all right. Don't
worry about it,''' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas trotted back onto the field. The fans roared.
</P>
<P>
   On his next play, he threw deep to Johnson in the left corner of
the east end zone. Johnson broke free from Madison, grabbed the
ball and basically gave the Jets their third consecutive victory
against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Thomas pointed to what happened on fourth down as an
example of what is right with the Jets (5-8) and wrong with the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that can go for it on fourth down because they
have nothing to lose,'' he said. ``I feel like now we should play
like that. Just go all out, man. Let's put it back together. But
it's not going to be that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It was just five weeks ago that the Dolphins were 7-1, sitting
atop the NFL. Now they appear to have contracted an
all-too-familiar disease _ December-itis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins now are 5-8 in December since Jimmy Johnson arrived
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this latest case will be fatal remains to be seen. But
after Sunday's game, Johnson offered a blunt assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't win doing what we're doing,'' he said.

<P>
   The poor Stone Age woman of our kitschy imagination. When she
isn't getting bonked over the head with a club and dragged across
the cave floor by her matted hair, she's hunched over a fire,
poking at a roasting mammoth thigh while her husband retreats to
his cave studio to immortalize the mammoth hunt in fresco. Or she's
Raquel Welch, saber-toothed sex kitten, or Wilma Flintstone, the
original soccer mom &UR; , &LR;  but whatever her form, her garb is the same:
some sort of animal pelt, cut nasty, brutish and short.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to three anthropologists, it is time to toss such
hidebound cliches of Paleolithic woman on the midden heap of
prehistory. In a new analysis of the renowned ``Venus'' figurines,
the hand-size statuettes of female bodies carved from 27,000 to
20,000 years ago, the researchers have found evidence that the
women of the so-called upper Paleolithic era were far more
accomplished, economically powerful and sartorially gifted than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle but intricate details on a number of the figurines offer
the most compelling evidence yet that Paleolithic women had already
mastered a revolutionary skill long thought to have arisen much
later in human history: the ability to weave plant fibers into
cloth, rope, nets and baskets.
</P>
<P>
   With a flair for textile production came a novel approach to
adorning and flaunting the human form. Far from being restricted to
a wardrobe of what Dr. Olga Soffer, one of the researchers, calls
``smelly animal hides,'' Paleolithic people knew how to create fine
fabrics that very likely resembled linen. They designed string
skirts, slung low on the hips or belted up on the waist, which
artfully revealed at least as much as they concealed. They wove
elaborate caps and snoods for the head, and bandeaux for the chest
_ a series of straps that amounted to a cupless brassiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the textiles they had must have been incredibly fine,
comparable to something from Donna Karan or Calvin Klein,'' said
Dr. Soffer, an archaeologist with the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists and anthropologists have long been fascinated by
the Venus figurines and have theorized endlessly about their origin
and purpose. But nearly all of that speculation has centered on the
exaggerated body parts of some of the figurines: the huge breasts,
the bulging thighs and bellies, the well-defined vulvas. Hence,
researchers have suggested that the figurines were fertility
fetishes, or prehistoric erotica, or gynecology primers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they have emotionally charged thingies like breasts
and buttocks, the Venus figurines have been the subject of more
spilled ink than anything I know of,'' Dr. Soffer said. ``There are
as many opinions on them as there are people in field.''
</P>
<P>
   In their new report, which will be published in the spring in
the journal Current Anthropology, Dr. Soffer and her colleagues,
Dr. James M. Adovasio and Dr. David C. Hyland of the &UR;  &LR; Mercyhurst
Archaeological Institute at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa., point
out that voluptuous body parts notwithstanding, a number of the
figurines are shown wearing items of clothing. When they zeroed in
on the details of those carved garments, the researchers saw proof
of considerable textile craftsmanship, an intimate knowledge of how
fabric is woven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholars have been looking at these things for years, but
unfortunately, their minds have been elsewhere,'' Adovasio said.
``Most of them didn't recognize the clothing as clothing. If they
noticed anything at all, they misinterpreted what they saw, writing
off the bandeaux, for example, as tattoos or body art.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrutinizing the famed Venus of Willendorf, for example, which
was discovered in lower Austria in 1908, the researchers paid
particular attention to the statuette's head. The Venus has no face
to speak of, but detailed coils surround its scalp. Most scholars
have interpreted the coils as a kind of paleo-coiffure, but
Adovasio, an authority on textiles and basketry, recognized the
plaiting as what he called a ``radially sewn piece of headgear with
vertical stem stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Willendorf's haberdashery ``might have looked like one of those
woven hats you see on Jamaicans on the streets of New York,'' he
said, adding, ``These were cool things.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Venus of Lespugue, an approximately 25,000-year-old
figurine from southwestern France, the anthropologists noticed a
``remarkable'' degree of detail lavished on the rendering of a
string skirt, with the tightness and angle of each individual twist
of the fibers carefully delineated. The skirt is attached to a
low-slung hip belt and tapers in the back to a tail, the edges of
its hem deliberately frayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That skirt is to die for,'' said Dr. Soffer, who, before she
turned to archaeology, was in the fashion business. ``Though maybe
it's an acquired taste.''
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of what such an outfit might have looked like,
she said, imagine a hula dancer wrapping a 1930s-style beaded
curtain around her waist. ``We're not talking protection from the
elements here,'' Dr. Soffer said. ``This would have been ritual
wear, if it was worn at all, a way of communicating with higher
powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other anthropologists point out that string skirts, which appear
in Bronze-Age artifacts and are mentioned by Homer, may have been
worn at the equivalent of a debutantes ball, to advertise a girl's
coming of age. In some parts of Eastern Europe, the skirts still
survive as lacy elements of folk costumes. (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The researchers presented their results earlier this month at
a meeting on the importance of perishables in prehistory that was
held at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ``One of the most
common reactions we heard was, `How could we have missed that stuff
all these years?''' Dr. Adovasio said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret W. Conkey, a professor of anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley, and co-editor, with Joan
Gero, of ``Engendering Archaeology'' (Blackwell Publishers, 1991)
said, ``They're helping us to look at old materials in new ways, to
which I say bravo!''
</P>
<P>
   Not all scholars had been blinded by the Venutian morphology.
Dr. Elizabeth Wayland Barber, a professor of archaeology and
linguistics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, included in her
1991 volume ``Prehistoric Textiles,'' a chapter arguing that some
of the Venus figurines were wearing string skirts. The recent work
from Dr. Soffer and her colleagues extends and amplifies on the Dr.
Barber's original observations.
</P>
<P>
   The new work also underscores the often neglected importance of
what Dr. Barber has termed the ``string revolution.''
Archaeologists have long emphasized the invention of stone and
metal tools in furthering the evolution of human culture. Even the
names given to various periods in human history and prehistory are
based on heavyweight tools: the word ``Paleolithic'' _ the period
extending from about 750,000 years ago to 15,000 years ago _
essentially means ``Old Stone Age.'' Duly thudding and clanking
after the Paleolithic period were the Mesolithic and Neolithic, or
Middle and New Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the
Industrial Age.
</P>
<P>
   But at least as central to the course of human affairs as the
invention of stone tools was the realization that plant products
could be exploited for purposes other than eating. The fact that
some of the Venus figurines are shown wearing string skirts, said
Dr. Barber, ``means that the people who made them must also have
known how to make twisted string.''
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of string and the power to weave, people
could construct elaborate yet lightweight containers in which to
carry, store and cook food. They could fashion baby slings to
secure an infant snugly against its mother's body, thereby freeing
up the woman to work and wander. They could braid nets, the better
to catch prey animals without the risk of hand-to-tooth combat.
They could lash together wooden logs or planks to build a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The string revolution was a profound event in human history,''
Adovasio said. ``When people started to fool around with plants and
plant byproducts, that opened vast new avenues of human progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, the researchers argue that women are likely
to have been the primary weavers and textile experts of prehistory,
and may have even initiated the string revolution in the first
place _ although men undoubtedly did their share of weaving when it
came to making hunting and fishing nets, for example. They base
that conclusion on modern crosscultural studies, which have found
that women constitute the great bulk of the world's weavers,
basketry makers and all-round mistresses of plant goods.
</P>
<P>
   While vast changes in manufacturing took the luster off the
textile business long ago, with the result that such ``women's
work'' is now accorded low status and sweatshop wages, the
researchers argue that weaving and other forms of fiber craft once
commanded great prestige. By their estimate, the detailing of the
stitches shown on some of the Venus figurines was intended to
flaunt the value and beauty of the original spinsters' skills. Why
else would anybody have bothered etching the stitchery in a
permanent medium, if not to boast, whoa! Check out these wefts!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made immortal in stone,'' Dr. Soffer said. ``You don't
carve something like this unless it's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The detailing of the Venutian garb also raises the intriguing
possibility that the famed little sculptures, which rank right up
there with the Lascaux cave paintings in the pantheon of Western
art, were hewn by women _ moonlighting seamstresses, to be precise.
``It's always assumed that the carvers were men, a bunch of guys
sitting around making their zaftig Barbie dolls,'' Dr. Soffer said.
``But maybe that wasn't the case, or not always the case. With some
of these figurines, the person carving them clearly knew weaving.
So either that person was a weaver herself, or he was living with
her. He's got an adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Durable though the Venus figurines are, Adovasio and his
co-workers are far more interested in what their carved detailing
says about the role of perishables in prehistory. ``The vast bulk
of what humans made was made in media that hasn't survived,''
Adovasio said. Experts estimate the ratio of perishable objects to
durable objects generated in the average culture is about 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reconstructing the past based on 5 percent of what was
used,'' Dr. Soffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the items that have endured over the millennia
are things like arrowheads and spear points, archaeologists
studying the Paleolithic era have generally focused on the ways and
means of that noble savage, a k a Man the Hunter, to the exclusion
of other members of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, in Paleolithic studies we hear about Man the
Hunter doing such boldy wonderful things as thrusting spears into
woolly mammoths, or battling it out with other men,'' Adovasio
said. ``We've emphasized the activities of a small segment of the
population _ healthy young men _ at the total absence of females,
old people of either sex and children. We've glorified one aspect
of Paleolithic life ways at the expense of all the other things
that made that life way successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest examples of fabric yet discovered are some
carbonate-encrusted swatches from France that are about 18,000
years old, while pieces of cordage and string dating back 19,000
years have been unearthed in the Near East, many thousands of years
after the string and textile revolution began.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to study ancient textiles in the absence of
textiles, Dr. Soffer, Dr. Adovasio and Dr. Hyland have sought
indirect signs of textile manufacture. They have pored over
thousands of ancient fragments of fired and unfired clay, and have
found impressions of early textiles on a number of them, the oldest
dating to 29,000 B.C. But the researchers believe that textile
manufacture far predates this time period, for the sophistication
of the stitchery rules out it's being, as Dr. Soffer put it, ``what
you take home from Crafts 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Adovasio estimates that weaving and cord-making probably goes
back to the year 40,000 B.C. ``at a minimum,'' and possibly much
further.
</P>
<P>
   Long before people had settled down into towns with domesticated
plants and animals, then, while they were still foragers and
wanderers, they had, in a sense, tamed nature. The likeliest sort
of plants from which they extracted fibers were nettles. ``Nettle
in folk tales and mythology is said to have magic properties,'' Dr.
Soffer said. ``In one story by the Brothers Grimm, a girl whose two
brothers have been turned into swans has to weave them nettle
shirts by midnight to make them human again.'' The nettles stung
her fingers, but she kept on weaving.
</P>
<P>
   But what didn't make it into Grimms' was that when the girl was
done with the shirts, she took out a chisel, and carved herself a
Venus figurine.

   WASHINGTON _ In a report hailed by mental health advocacy
groups, Surgeon General David Satcher warned Monday that most
mentally ill Americans fail to receive treatment despite two
decades of revolutionary advances in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the 51st on national health issues by surgeons
general but the first dealing with mental illness, notes that
diseases such as depression, schizophrenia and eating disorders can
be as disabling and serious as cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``While mental disorders may touch all Americans, either
directly or indirectly, all do not have equal access to treatment
and service,'' Satcher said at a White House news conference. ``We
need to ensure that mental health services are as widely available
as other services in the continuously changing health care delivery
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe and effective options are available to treat mental
disorders that affect one in five Americans, Satcher said, yet
nearly half of all Americans with severe mental illness fail to
seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report does not advocate specific policy changes,
it notes that ``the complex and fragmented mental health service
delivery system'' creates barriers to treatment. It also points to
financial barriers such as lack of health insurance ``parity'' for
mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-page publication defines mental disorders as diagnosable
conditions that impair thinking, feeling and behavior and interfere
with a person's capacity to be productive and enjoy fulfilling
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The definition encompasses mental and brain problems of varying
severity: depression, schizophrenia, manic depressive (bipolar)
illness, anxiety disorders, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, autism and others.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Satcher in releasing the report were Tipper Gore, wife
of Vice President Al Gore, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala and Larry Fricks, a Georgia state Division of Mental
Health official.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks brought a group of about 100 representatives of mental
health advocacy groups to their feet in a standing ovation with a
description of his own recovery from mental illness, as well his
grandmother's unsuccessful effort to cope with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks said the report's ``most important impact'' would be to
help eliminate the stigma of mental disease ``so that people like
my grandmother will not waste their lives in self-imposed
isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said Mrs. Gore, who serves as President Clinton's
adviser on mental health, originally suggested a surgeon general's
report on mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health groups expressed hope it would stimulate greater
public spending on mental health problems and greater public
awareness of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon general puts mental health where it belongs: as a
cornerstone of public health,'' said Michael Faenza, president of
the National Mental Health Association. ``This historic report
makes clear that mental health is integral to individuals' and the
nation's health and should not be relegated to the sidelines of
health care and public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the report will not be worth the paper it is
printed on if its messages are not put into practice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill, said the report documented a health crisis but
added that it would be ``waste of taxpayer dollars unless it
becomes a foundation for action. What matters most is deeds, not
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Beson, president of the St. Cloud, Minn.-based National
Association for Rural Mental Health, said, ``Our hope is that this
report will raise the level of dialogue throughout the country on a
variety of mental health issues. We hope one of them will be rural
mental health, which is an area that doesn't get a lot of attention
and is extremely lacking in resources.''

TURNOUT SEEN AS CRUCIAL FOR BOTH CANDIDATES IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tuesday's mayoral contest between incumbent
Willie Brown and Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano could
hinge on who gets more voters to the polls at a time of year when
people may be thinking more about holiday shopping than politics.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the election lies in a handful of precincts and with
the Chinese-American voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The polls indicate that Brown is likely to win his second term
as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is not without weaknesses. The voters in the
neighborhood that gave him the most solid support, Bayview, turned
out in the smallest numbers for the Nov. 2 general election. And
the mayor faces ongoing criticism about his handling of the
troubled public transportation system and chronic homelessness in
one of the city's most prosperous eras.
</P>
<P>
   Brown campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston said interviews with
supporters who did not vote in November revealed that they did not
think Brown needed their help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said they thought that Mayor Brown had the
election wrapped up,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also needs the city's conservative west side and the
Marina district, where voters traditionally flock to the polls but
not in support of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, they went for former Mayor Frank Jordan and
businessman Clint Really, who both failed to win a spot in the
run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has to convince people in these areas to vote for him,
the more conservative of the two candidates in the run-off, rather
than sit out the election.
</P>
<P>
   The support of Chinese-Americans, who helped Brown in November,
could help boost turnout rates on the west side, said David Lee, a
specialist in demographic politics in San Francisco who heads the
Chinese-American Voter Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asians are really a kind of anchor from Brown's perspective,''
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown and Ammiano are Democrats, the incumbent is
viewed as much more friendly to businesses and developers.
</P>
<P>
   Amman's campaign is focusing on newly registered and people who
did not care much for politics before now but are swept up in
Amman's grass-roots movement.
</P>
<P>
   He won the second-place spot on the ballot through an
unprecedented write-in campaign in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner could be the candidate who turns out the people who
don't normally vote,'' said Robert Barnes, a Brown supporter and
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Amman's camp is expecting the occasional voters to flood the
polls, as they did for Amman's write-in bid.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign especially targeted the youthful neighborhoods of
Lower Haight and the Mission, where Ammiano carries solid support
in elections. But it also is where voter registration is very low.
</P>
<P>
   In a massive registration drive last month, Amman's campaign
claimed to have signed up more than 10,000 residents. There are
467,295 voters registered now, compared to 453,151 for the Nov. 2
election.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 45 percent of registered voters turned out in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Nishioka, acting director of the city Department of
Elections, predicts that 50 percent of registered voters will cast
ballots in the run-off election, based on the number of absentee
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In the last-minute blitz to get voters to the polls, the
candidates held rallies over the weekend and sent volunteers
knocking on doors.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mabel Teng, who supports Brown, held a
get-out-the-vote rally with Chinese-Americans on the steps of City
Hall Friday, and Supervisor Barbara Kaufman recorded a message sent
to phones around the city urging people to vote for Brown.

TREATMENTS: ZINC SUPPLEMENTS, FOR THE LIFE OF A CHILD 
PATTERNS: OF RATS, MAZES AND CELLULAR PHONES 
CAUSE AND EFFECT: THE MANY FACES OF HOLIDAY DEPRESSION 
OUTCOMES: WHEN TIME HEALS A DAMAGED HEART
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In America, zinc supplements have mainly been discussed in
recent years as a potential cure for the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   But in developing nations, according to an article published in
the December issue of The Journal of Pediatrics, zinc supplements
could offer the most cost-effective way of reducing the two leading
causes of childhood death: pneumonia and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Zinc deficiency is common among the world's poor. Exactly what
role the mineral plays in the body is not clear, but a lack of it
appears to hamper the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of zinc is that it can be added to diets
relatively inexpensively, for example, by adding it to bread or
other foods. The extra zinc, researcher said, reduced diarrhea,
respiratory illnesses and skin disorders by 56 percent among
Turkish schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   For a broader look at the effect of zinc supplements, members of
the Child Health Research Project _ a collaborative effort by the
World Health Organization, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard _
analyzed data from 10 controlled trials in countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   They found that zinc reduced the number of cases of childhood
diarrhea by 25 percent; by comparison, the WHO has estimated that
high-quality improvements in water and sanitation would reduce the
incidence by 27 percent, but at a far greater cost.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on pneumonia was even more striking, reducing cases
by 41 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Michael Hambidge and Dr. Nancy
Krebs of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in
Denver noted that zinc deficiencies might be corrected either by
fortifying food during manufacturing or by using plant breeding
techniques to increase the mineral content of grains and legumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enormous appeal of correcting zinc deficiency is that in
normalizing the function of cells in multiple tissues, it enhances
the child's ability to combat disease states and not just single
infectious organisms,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' they added, ``on a worldwide public health level, it
is likely to be more economically feasible than vaccines directed
against specific organisms.''
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Of Rats, Mazes and Cellular Phones
</P>
<P>
   The question of cell phones and their radiation lingers on. In
1993, an expert panel was to settle the issue, but then left a big
question mark.
</P>
<P>
   The panel rejected heavily publicized claims that cell phones
promoted brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it suggested that much remained to be learned
about the effects of radiation emitted by phones on the human
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a rat study has raised the possibility that the radiation
might adversely affect learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, to be published in the January issue of the
journal Bioengineering, Dr. Henry Lai, a bioengineering professor
at the University of Washington in Seattle, looked at the effects
of microwave radiation on long-term memory formation.
</P>
<P>
   Lai trained two groups of rats to swim through a tank of water
to a submerged platform. Since the water had been made murky, they
had to first learn, then memorize the location of the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Rats that were exposed for an hour to pulsed microwaves similar
to the radiation emitted by cell phones were ``much slower in
finding the platform during the training sessions,'' Lai said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the platform was removed, and the rats were sent back for
another swim. The rats that were not exposed to the radiation
generally swam around where the platform had been, as if
``scratching their heads, saying `We thought it was here,''' Lai
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rats exposed to radiation swam around more randomly, Lai
said, suggesting that the maps they had made in their heads was not
as clear.
</P>
<P>
   CAUSE AND EFFECT: The Many Faces of Holiday Depression
</P>
<P>
   The thoughts of editors of medical journals apparently turn to
depression around this time of year, when more people are known to
get depressed. A survey of recent research articles and conference
reports found several, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Among people over 70, depression increases the risk of
developing a wide range of diseases as much as smoking does, a
University of Michigan study of 6,000 older Americans found. The
results were presented at the annual meeting of the Gerontological
Society of America. Earlier studies had linked depression to higher
rates of cancer and cognitive decline; this research found that
depression lifted overall rates of ``disease burden'' as much as
smoking and more than obesity, though not as much as lack of
physical strength.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of smoking, a Johns Hopkins University study
published in The American Journal of Public Health found that
teenagers who smoked were at greater risk for depression. But, the
study found, depression did not appear to prompt young people to
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   _ For people with Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, depression is a
better predictor of coronary heart disease than high blood sugar,
according to a University of Pittsburgh study to be published in
the January issue of the journal Atherosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Another study found this: Teen-age girls care an awful lot about
what other people think of them; teen-age boys, not so much. That
higher rate of what University of New Hampshire researchers call
emotional reliance was found to be associated with higher rates of
depression for young women in a survey of 1,393 people in Toronto.
The results were published last week in The Journal of Health and
Social Behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, Charles Darwin wrote, ``Infants, when suffering even
slight pain or discomfort, utter violent and prolonged screams.''
The observation, reported recently in the British Medical Journal,
came in connection with a study looking at what clinical trials
could reliably establish about the best ways to calm them down.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has been fueled by the growing number of premature
babies kept alive by intensive _ and often painful treatment in
neonatal units, and by the recent recognition that even very
premature infants can feel pain.
</P>
<P>
   The study by pediatricians at Poissy Hospital in France examined
the analgesic powers of sweet solutions (sucrose and glucose) and
pacifiers compared with placebos.
</P>
<P>
   The solutions and pacifiers were found effective, according to
pain ratings made on the basis of facial expression, limb movements
and crying. But the most effective measure was a pacifier alone.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why pacifiers work is a mystery. But the researchers
speculated that the sensory input from sucking may override or
distract from pain signals, or that infants may be comforted by the
fact that the pacifier gives them some control over what they are
experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   OUTCOMES: When Time Heals a Damaged Heart
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the popular diet drug combination known as fen-phen was
pulled off the market after Mayo Clinic researchers found an
increase in heart valve disease among people taking the
medications. In a follow-up study published last week, researchers
from the clinic concluded that the valve damage appeared to improve
after patients stopped taking the pills.
</P>
<P>
   The new study looked at 30 men and women who had been taking
either fen-phen (fenfluramine and phentermine) or a placebo for an
average of 41 weeks as part of an unrelated study of the diet
drugs. Their hearts were examined by echocardiogram shortly after
they stopped taking the medicines and about six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the patients taking fen-phen were found to have some
sign of heart valve disease, said Dr. Donald Hensrud, a Mayo Clinic
nutrition specialist who led the new study, which was published in
the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. But the researchers found that ``heart
valve disease did not get worse after patients stopped taking the
medications,'' Hensrud said. In fact, all of the patients whose
valves were affected showed improvement in the six-month follow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new findings should be reassuring for those Americans
who took fen-phen,'' he said. Hensrud said that the study's patient
pool was too small to allow for sweeping generalizations. But he
said the findings were consistent with patients' reports that they
had fewer symptoms associated with valve disease after the drugs
were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he urged those who took either drug to consult their
doctors.

<P>
   The new 8200 series, introduced at the Kenzo show, takes the
fashion statement still further. The three-ounce 8210 phone has six
easily interchangeable faceplates.
</P>
<P>
   But that's already yesterday's news. Like any good designer,
Nuovo said, he lives five years out. To demonstrate, he reached
into his briefcase and pulled out a pair of prototypes. Impossibly
thin and predictably futuristic, these two concept phones have
everything: built-in cameras, fully readable Web pages, personal
organizers and a large dose of snazz.
</P>
<P>
   By the time those phones, or phones like them, are on the
market, Nuovo may well have left the world of communications
fashion. ``My dream is to someday have a jazz club in Monterey and
play _ that's something I passionately want to do,'' he said,
striking a restless note. ``The ultimate dream is to stay
creative.''

   Jack Dempsey, the brutal ``Manassa Mauler'' of the 1920s, not
only helped make boxing a big-time sport, but he also helped turn
sports into a big business. He belonged, along with Babe Ruth, Red
Grange, Bobby Jones and Johnny Weissmuller, to the so-called golden
age of sports, and he is remembered to this day for his
unaccommodated ferocity in the ring. Red Smith hailed him as ``a
tiger without mercy'' and ``187 pounds of unbridled violence.''
Joyce Carol Oates described him as ``the very embodiment of hunger,
rage, the will to do hurt; the spirit of the Western frontier come
East to win his fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new authorized biography, ``A Flame of Pure Fire,'' Roger
Kahn gives us a kinder, gentler Dempsey. Although Kahn _ a friend
of the fighter, who died in 1983 _ talks of Dempsey's ``snarling
intensity'' in the ring, he also deems him ``a cold professional, a
gorgeous craftsman.'' Kahn's Dempsey sometimes sounds more like his
famous rival, the bookish Gene Tunney. He describes Dempsey as ``a
thinking, even intellectual, boxer'' and observes that his diaries
reveal ``a thoughtful, introspective young man, and in a sense, the
champion as existentialist.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition Kahn tries to argue in this book that Dempsey ``all
by himself'' symbolized ``America in the Roaring 20s.'' ``Dempsey's
great years, across the bounding and increasingly unzippered days
from 1919 to 1927, play in a grand sense against a wild American
epoch,'' he writes. ``Prohibition was wild and the suddenly
fast-and-loose stock market was wild and down the road two great
show trials blossomed wildly into causes, still well remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two problems with this premise. In the first place
Dempsey is a somewhat dubious representative figure. Yes, he
embodied fame and glamour and the raucous, restless temper of the
times, but then so did a host of others. Second, Kahn's
determination to open out Dempsey's story into something larger
causes him to lard the boxer's tale with dozens of panoramic
asides, reminiscent of Frederick Lewis Allen's ``Only Yesterday.''
These asides _ about everything from Sacco and Vanzetti to Warren
G. Harding, from women's suffrage to Prohibition _ have little to
do with Dempsey, and they end up feeling irrelevant and
pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   When Kahn sticks to Dempsey's story and controls his own taste
for romance-novel prose (``Trouble was dark-haired and gorgeous''),
the results are decidedly better. Kahn succinctly sketches in
Dempsey's peripatetic and impoverished childhood in Colorado and
Utah and his hardscrabble adolescence working in the mines and
riding the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Under the name Kid Blackie, Dempsey began his career as a
barroom fighter in the mining camps of the West. ``Going for a
quick knockout was just common sense,'' Dempsey later explained.
``I had a little motto about getting rid of my opponents. `The
sooner the safer.'''
</P>
<P>
   This ``killer instinct,'' as boxing writers called it, would
come to the attention of a wider public in 1919, when the
24-year-old Dempsey took on the hulking Jess Willard, who
outweighed him by some 50 pounds, for the heavyweight crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dempsey circled left, bobbed and circled to Willard's right,
then closed, moving toward Willard's right near the center of the
ring,'' writes Kahn. ``Behind the fall step Dempsey landed a left
jolt to the jaw and then, in seconds, he loosed the most
devastating combination of punches in boxing history. He crashed a
right hook and a left hook into Willard's body and a short right to
the mouth. Now a full left hook to the cheekbone crashed on
Willard's face. This was a classic hook, a perfect hook, what
Dempsey called `an ideal whirl-powered shovel hook.' The blow
fractured Jess Willard's cheekbone in 13 places.''
</P>
<P>
   As such passages attest, Kahn is at his best in this volume
describing Dempsey's actual fights, capturing the thrashing, deadly
violence of the boxer in the ring. His account of Dempsey's
celebrated 1923 confrontation with Luis Firpo, Argentina's ``Wild
Bull of the Pampas,'' captures all the wild drama of that fight, in
which Dempsey was knocked out of the ring and recovered to hold on
to his title. His accounts of Dempsey's two losing showdowns with
Tunney (the second marred by the controversial ``long count'' that
gave Tunney a couple of extra seconds to recover) convey the
poignancy of a courageous fighter going down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey had always been a controversial figure, in large part
because of the perception that he was a coward and slacker for not
serving during World War I. But he found, in the wake of those two
fights, the sort of public acclaim that had long eluded him. ``I
want you to get to the people,'' he told Kahn, 45 years later,
``that losing was the making of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes in sports during Dempsey's career would bring boxing
into a new era. While his 1919 fight with Willard drew only 19,650
fans, the Tunney fight of 1926 would attract an estimated 135,000.
In Dempsey's seven years as heavyweight champion, Kahn observes,
boxing had gone from being a marginal sport, ``scorned as
immoral,'' to ``a sport that had the leaders of the country
tripping over one another in their rush for ringside seats.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dempsey, he would go on to a career on Broadway as an
actor and restaurateur: a folk hero of sorts and a model of the
modern athlete as celebrity.

   BKN-GARNETT _ Kevin Garnett has had a huge impact on the NBA
during his four short years in the league. When Garnett was
selected by the Timberwolves with the fifth pick of the 1995 draft,
he was the first high schooler to be selected in the draft in 20
years. That opened the door for others, including Kobe Bryant, to
go straight from high school to the NBA. Two years ago, Garnett
signed a $126 million contract which ultimately led to the league
locking out its players in hopes to limiting spiraling salaries. On
the court, he's helped Minnesota develop into one of the league's

facilities befitting a small college campus. They are appraised at
more than $5 million. It is the work of wildly energetic,
well-meaning boosters. They have built baseball and football
stadiums for their sons and renovated a country house to function
as the supporters' headquarters on 52 acres adjoining school
property, all owned by the private, nonprofit Westside Boosters
Inc. The generosity might have placed the school afoul of a federal
gender-equity law. (Fish/Milliron, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BKN-GARNETT _ Kevin Garnett has had a huge impact on the NBA
during his four short years in the league. When Garnett was
selected by the Timberwolves with the fifth pick of the 1995 draft,
he was the first high schooler to be selected in the draft in 20
years. That opened the door for others, including Kobe Bryant, to
go straight from high school to the NBA. Two years ago, Garnett
signed a $126 million contract which ultimately led to the league
locking out its players in hopes to limiting spiraling salaries. On
the court, he's helped Minnesota develop into one of the league's
top teams and the Timberwolves meet the Hawks tonight at Philips
Arena. (Bunn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EQUITY-BOOSTER _ MACON, Ga. _ When Westside High School opened
three years ago, the view from the back showed acres of barren
fields. This fall, those fields are adorned with athletics
facilities befitting a small college campus. They are appraised at
more than $5 million. It is the work of wildly energetic,
well-meaning boosters. They have built baseball and football
stadiums for their sons and renovated a country house to function
as the supporters' headquarters on 52 acres adjoining school
property, all owned by the private, nonprofit Westside Boosters
Inc. The generosity might have placed the school afoul of a federal
gender-equity law. (Fish/Milliron, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EQUITY-PORKBARREL _ With few exceptions, it is illegal for
school districts in Georgia to spend state tax dollars on

GOLLY! A YANK WROTE THOSE OH-SO-BRITISH MYSTERIES?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ohio)  By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Death by decapitation on a farm in a quiet Yorkshire
village, the impaling of a playwright in an isolated Scottish
hotel, the kidnapping and drowning of the daughter of a member of
Parliament _ Elizabeth George's intricately plotted mysteries take
her readers through the English countryside and a wide range of
professions and crimes. In the author's current best seller, ``In
Pursuit of the Proper Sinner,'' a case of a double murder on a moor
in Derbyshire deals more than passingly with a composer of the
Andrew Lloyd Webber school of musicals.
</P>
<P>
   In her 10 novels, Ms. George has proved herself a master of the
English mystery, with an ear for local language and an eye for the
inner workings of Scotland Yard. With each book, she has moved up
in the ranks of a team headed by P.D. James and Ruth Rendell, in a
tradition that stretches back to Agatha Christie and Dorothy L.
Sayers.
</P>
<P>
   More than six million copies of her books are in print in the
United States, and she has been translated into 10 languages. Ms.
George has die-hard fans as well as more casual readers who pick up
her books at airports and are so engrossed that they are still
turning pages on the way home in buses and taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to her work may be surprised to learn that Ms. George
is American, not English. Born in Ohio 49 years ago, she has lived
most of her life in California and is by her own description ``a
good Catholic girl'' who was married and divorced and writes
psychological detective stories.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to New York she was on a literary panel
with three authors of hard-boiled thrillers. Despite her demure
demeanor, she more than held her own as a writer who knows how she
creates her gripping, highly graphic novels.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, she was asked the obligatory question: Why
English? She groaned and said, ``I've answered that question in a
variety of ways over the years, mostly to entertain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 17, she went to England for several months, studied
Shakespeare and became a confirmed Anglophile. While still in
school, she started writing stories, not mysteries, with a
continuing cast of English characters.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college, she taught English and creative
writing. In 1983, she began her first mystery novel and because of
her attraction to England set it in that country. She has not
veered from that terrain.
</P>
<P>
   There are several touchstones in her books: at least one violent
death, a specific landscape and social or cultural background and
two detectives, Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sgt. Barbara Havers.
The mysteries have not yet been dramatized on television, although
two have been optioned by the BBC. But to the author's admirers,
her detectives are as familiar and as individual as Adam Dalgleish
or Endeavour Morse.
</P>
<P>
   Lynley and Havers are decidedly an odd couple of partners.
Lynley, who is the eighth Lord Asherton, is a handsome,
distinguished graduate of Eton and Oxford. He often quotes
Shakespeare, lives in an elegant house in Eaton Terrace and drives
a Bentley. Havers is short, plump and messy, a woman from a
working-class background who lives in a one-room flat in Bayswater.
Forthright and assertive, she often breaks rules.
</P>
<P>
   To Havers, Lynley is ``a miraculous combination of every single
thing that she thoroughly despised'' and ``so damnably charming
that she couldn't understand why every criminal . . . simply didn't
surrender to accommodate him.'' To Lynley, Havers is willful to the
point of insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all the obvious differences, however, each has a
pronounced respect for the other when the two of them are on a
case: Havers for Lynley's acuity, Lynley for Havers' intuition.
Assisting the two is Lynley's friend Simon St. James, an expert
forensic scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In an early unpublished novel, St. James was the sleuth. Ms.
George's original idea was to write detective stories in the manner
of Edgar Allan Poe or Agatha Christie, with an eccentric detective
(St. James) taking suspects into the library and revealing the
guilty party. When the manuscript was sent to a publisher, an
editor rejected it with a letter praising the writing but saying
that novels were no longer written in that old style.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. George modernized her approach, placing the emphasis more on
police procedurals. Looking for a new detective, she chose Lynley,
who had played a side role in the St. James mystery. She decided he
needed a partner and invented Havers.
(MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Her work habits are carefully prescribed. First she decides on
the killer, the victim and the motive, and she fills many notebooks
with close analyses of her principal characters. She keeps an
apartment in South Kensington, and in preparation for each book she
visits England for a relatively brief period and does assiduous
research on location. She writes an outline, followed by a first
draft, followed by another outline, always channeling in new ideas.
Before she starts a book, she knows exactly how it will end.
</P>
<P>
   On Page 900 of the rough draft of ``Deception on His Mind,'' she
changed her mind about the identity of the killer. She called her
agent to give her the news, and they agreed that the change made
the book into ``an Elizabeth George novel,'' meaning that the
motive was now more psychological.
</P>
<P>
   She explained: ``My motives are usually rooted deeply in
psychology versus a more overt motive like greed or blackmail. It's
usually a need that's been denied, a nurturing that's being
sought.'' In each book she gives the reader a hint in her choice of
epigraph. For ``In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner,'' the quote is
from Shakespeare: ``How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to
have a thankless child.''
</P>
<P>
   Let that be a clue to solving the latest Elizabeth George
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at Lynley,'' she said, ``I realized I had
created a character who was fairly outrageous on the believability
scale. There is only one earl that I know of on the police force in
all of Great Britain. So I created a character to dislike him
before he came on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to encourage the reader to have some sympathy for
Lynley.
</P>
<P>
   The original model for Lynley was the actor Nigel Havers. ``In
`Chariots of Fire,' he played the young nobleman who ran the
hurdles,'' Ms. George said. ``His butler placed champagne glasses
on the hurdles to keep him from knocking them over. Nigel Havers
has the aristocratic bearing I was looking for, but I made Lynley
taller and bulkier. Then I named Barbara Havers in homage to Nigel
Havers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. George's first published novel, ``A Great Deliverance''
(1988), the two detectives clicked. The author brought them back
for a second turn and soon the series was born. In contrast to
James and others who write individual mysteries, Ms. George writes
books that overlap and are the equivalent of one continuing novel.
The books are usually more than 600 pages.
</P>
<P>
   With each new story the characters grow and change, and the
reader learns more about their personal lives. After 10 books,
there is a rather complete picture of Lynley and Havers _ and also
of St. James, his wife and Lady Helen Clyde, who finally married
Lynley in the ninth book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. George pays homage to Margery Allingham's ``Traitor's
Purse'' as the mystery that had the greatest effect on her, making
her realize she wanted to write about ``a detective as a vulnerable
human being instead of as a godhead.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, every character has to have a ``core need in life'' and
also ``a pathological maneuver,'' obsessive behavior that could be
considered a flaw. Analyzing her detectives, she said that
``Lynley's core need is forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous sense of guilt permeates every area of his
life,'' she said, because of his wealth and social position and
because he was the driver of a car in an accident that crippled St.
James. Lynley's flaw is his ``hair-trigger temper.'' The reason he
chose to be a police officer is that ``it's a way to level the
playing field between his life and other people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Havers' core need is for equality. Her flaw? ``At the extreme,
it's probably a paranoid suspicion. This casual disrespect is a
front for the tremendous sense of inadequacy that she feels.'' The
reason she joined the police force? ``She's always been interested
in crime,'' Ms. George said.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``In that, she's very similar to me. I can remember
reading my first murder story in The San Francisco Examiner when I
was 7 or 8. I've always found human psychopathology fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Havers are very similar in attitude, she said. Both have
an innate disregard for lords and ladies, who often are the subject
of disdain in the novels. Physically, the author and character
couldn't be more different, and whereas Havers speaks bluntly, Ms.
George is certainly a match for Lynley in erudition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what her core need is, Ms. George said, ``My writing
students got it in one guess: competence, perfection, the need to
be good at something. Psychologists would say there are only four
basic needs: to be genuine, competent, spontaneous and to do your
duty. Nobody would ever argue that I was spontaneous. I can be, but
I have to be competently spontaneous.'' Her obsession? ``Beating
myself up for not being perfect.''

 &HT;    BARAK MAKES PITCH TO ISRAEL ON THE 'HEAVY PRICE' OF PEACE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday urged his
country to prepare for the ``heavy price'' of a peace agreement
with Syria _ a possible withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spoke in a special address to the Israeli parliament that
was followed by a 47-to-31 vote of endorsement for peace talks,
which are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first official indication of Israel's openness to
concessions that might be necessary in making peace with Syria, one
of the country's oldest and most important enemies.
</P>
<P>
   With his speech, the vote and the demonstration outside of
several thousand Golan Heights supporters, the debate that some
Israeli newspapers have already dubbed ``The Battle for the Golan''
was underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace agreement we want to reach with Syria will be such
that it will put an end to conflict and ensure peace and security
between the two nations,'' Barak told the parliament. ``If we miss
this opportunity, God forbid, it might cost us in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak denied accusations that he had already promised Syrian or
American mediators that Israel would give up the Golan in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to stress instead, the ``historic'' chance the talks
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a revolution in the relationship between Israel and
the Arab countries,'' Barak said. ``Our supreme responsibility is
to act today so that we will not dig new rows of graves tomorrow in
a conflict that could have been ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their border has been quiet since the 1973 war, Syria and
Israel have been in an official state of war for decades. Israel
captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967, and the return of
the plateau _ on Israel's northeastern edge _ is the key issue in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Syria seeks the return of the entire Golan. Israel seeks
assurances that Syria will reign in guerillas who Israel is
fighting in the war in southern Lebanon. It also seeks normal
relations with Syria, a pull back of Syrian troops from the Israeli
border, and international monitors or other ways to insure security
between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to take any Syrian deal to a public vote.
Opinion polls in recent days have shown Israelis evenly split on
whether to give up the Golan in return for a peace deal. One poll
even showed that a quarter of Golan residents could agree to a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, Barak met with Nadia Cohen, widow of Eli
Cohen, an Israeli spy who was tortured and executed by Syria in
1965. She said she wished Barak well in the talks and said she
hopes they will lead to the return of Eli Cohen's remains.
</P>
<P>
   But, others oppose Barak's efforts and that opposition has
quickly turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Police Monday were reportedly investigating the posting of signs
accusing Barak of treason, the same accusation hurled at Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the months leading up to his
assassination in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis compare the possible evacuation of some 18,000
Jews living in 33 settlements on the Golan to the Nazi practice of
sweeping Jews out of their neighborhoods and countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan Heights has supporters beyond those that live there.
While some say the high ground is not strategically important in
these days of missile warfare, others believe it is vital to the
country's security. Still others say a withdrawal would encourage
Arab countries to press for more land.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration outside the parliament Monday, several
thousand people chanted, ``No moving from the Golan!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to turn this country upside down,'' said
demonstrator Pircha Lottner, 71, of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not extremists. We want peace, but there is no way we
want to leave our homes,'' said Golan resident Avner Talmon, 45.
</P>
<P>
   But, one public opinion expert here said the nearly even poll
numbers over a Golan withdrawal, even before a deal is signed,
indicate the odds are in Barak's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak has his trump card. He will tell people that it will end
all the wars,'' said Yehuda Ben Meir, a researcher on Israeli
attitudes about peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   An actual agreement, which negotiators say could occur within
months, would likely include potent public relations opportunities,
such as a Barak visit to the Syrian capital, Damascus, and a
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prime minister's residence Monday night, several
hundred peace activists voiced their support for the talks.
Carrying signs saying, ``Peace with Syria now,'' they invoked the
name of Rabin and offered a preview of the pro-peace referendum
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the Golan is more than a home. It is a lifetime
achievement,'' said Yigal Kipnis, a resident of the Golan for 21
years. ``But we never put our own interests above the interests of
the nation. Real and full peace is the aim.''

ANARCHISTS UNMASK A WORLD OF CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ A Seattle TV reporter with blond, frosted
highlights and a preppy leather jacket is interviewing two
anarchists in front of the Out of the Fog Organic Coffee House.
</P>
<P>
   He leans in, attentive and sincere, as his subjects try to
explain themselves. The two are part of the community who led the
Nov. 30 rampage in Seattle, day one of the World Trade Organization
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Their ski-masked faces were splashed across TV screens and front
pages _ there because they had brazenly smashed windows and
graffitied their way through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Since the WTO mayhem, the attention the press has focused on
them is forcing anarchists here to adopt a strangely tolerant
stance toward the media.
</P>
<P>
   Answers are being condensed to sound bites: ``Property
destruction does not equal violence.'' ``Peaceful protests aren't
effective.'' ``Trans-global corporations are killing the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an awkward process at best for Eugene's anarchist
community, because each of them defines and lives out anarchy in
his or her own way _ be it smashing a window, handing out free food
or creating public art. For the majority, environmental concerns,
not rioting, matter most. The economic changes they seek are tied
to issues like sustainable farming and forest preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezing all this into a brief interview is tough enough, but
what sort of sound bite would work when Glamour magazine calls,
asking to speak to a female anarchist between the ages of 20 and
35?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanna know what shade of lipstick I wear when I'm smashing the
state?'' jokes Shelley, who was called the day before because she
fit the demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley, 34, is a petite anarchist with short-cropped hair and a
wit inversely proportional to her size. She says she read the riot
act to the writer, telling her what she thought of fashion
magazines. ``I really don't think I gave her much of an
interview,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She also tells the story of what happened the last time a glossy
fashion magazine came around: The magazine had featured a group of
women from The Ruckus Society (a Berkeley-based group specializing
in non-violent protest). But Shelley was aghast at what she saw.
``When the article came out with the photo, they'd air-brushed all
their underarm hair out!''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley helps run Out of the Fog, which is where young
anarchists/environmentalists/outsiders hang out. The mouth of the
moment is Tangent, a 20-year-old with clear green eyes and his fair
share of piercings, including a piece of carved madrone, a
half-inch in diameter, through his left earlobe.
</P>
<P>
   He's staying in Eugene now, but has spent most of the last year
in the Willamette National Forest, where he's done stints as a
tree-sitter _ living in old-growth trees to protect them from being
cut down. One of 10 children, Tangent doesn't say much about his
family. He's barely spoken to his parents in the past year because
he says they have drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tangent didn't join his friends in their trek to Seattle, but
says he supports their destruction of corporate storefronts, like
McDonald's and The Gap. He says he's interested in humanity and
preserving life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do consider myself an anarchist to a certain extent, but to
be an anarchist is to disagree with all views. I don't disagree
with all establishmental views,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One thing most in the community believe in is the concept of
free food.
</P>
<P>
   About three days a week at 4 p.m., vegetarian and vegan food is
served to whoever shows up, no questions asked. The food is
prepared by a different household in the community each day.
</P>
<P>
   `LEFTIER THAN THOU'
</P>
<P>
   It's meal time (also known as Food Not Bombs) at Washington
Jefferson Park, also known as Carbon Monoxide Park due to its
proximity to heavy traffic. The hungry, some anarchists among them,
have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Pi, a girl with a Cheshire Cat grin is working on a bowl of tofu
stir-fry. She says she was in Seattle during the WTO meeting and
may be willing to talk about it, but not at the park.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the house she's sharing with four friends, Pi starts
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in the DAN (Direct Action Network) space was
very tense. ... There was the sense of getting ready for something
big, something large. A fair amount of paranoia, actually,'' says
the 21-year-old from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   She goes on to describe conflicts between some of the anarchists
and other protesters. ``There was an ideological tension. A lot of
people were wearing `This is a non-violent protest' T-shirts, and
there were stickers that went up like, `Non-violence is a position
of privilege.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of talk before heading to Seattle of rioting,
but Pi thinks it was mostly ``leftier-than-thou'' rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She's an advocate of property destruction, which she doesn't
consider as violence. ``Violence is only something that is done
from one person to another person.'' Even then, allowances can be
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be violent towards a Nazi, I'm going to pat
you on the back ... because their very existence is violent,'' she
says, adding that she feels the same about police.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Pi believes the property destruction in Seattle
diminished rather than emphasized that point of the WTO protests.
``I do know that in the long line of protests that I've been to ...
this is the only one that I've ever seen non-violence be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Pi invites her friend, Phineas, a 25-year-old from Kansas City,
Mo., to come into the room. Phineas is wild-haired and soft-spoken,
his thin frame holding up a pair of black overalls.
</P>
<P>
   He says his actions were justified because the corporations
targeted rape the environment and exploit workers. ``These
companies are really hurting families ... they aren't able to keep
themselves fed and clothed, while we here get all the benefits of
their pain and torture.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he went to the WTO protests with a very clear political
agenda and was not among those looting stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very improper. Why would I want to break windows and
grab products for myself that I consider to be nasty and awful? I'd
rather burn those products.''
</P>
<P>
   Pi says she knows anarchists who took part in the looting simply
because it felt right to be taking something away from a big
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING OFF GARBAGE
</P>
<P>
   Ideological splintering is acceptable in the community because
it fits the meaning of anarchy: No leaders. Everyone does their own
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Which, by the way, means that while most anarchists respect John
Zerzan, a local anarchist author, they by no means consider him
their guru or spokesman. Some have trouble reconciling his
anti-technology/anti-capitalism views with the fact that his works
are marketed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Older activists have a different take on the anarchist culture
in Eugene, a culture that has been thriving since the '60s and
accounts for the city's reputation as a liberal haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a diversity of people doing different things,''
says Mawb, 48, who has been active in the Eugene scene since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's more to the anarchist-activist life here than
just black masks and broken windows. There's the Jawbreaker co-op
art space, the Center for Appropriate Transport (where kids and
adults can learn how to build and maintain bicycles) and the Free
Skool, where community members share whatever knowledge they have
in various areas. Mawb says most people in the community have one
thing in common: ``We make a point of living off the garbage of
this incredible wealthy country.''
</P>
<P>
   Recycling and trash bin-diving are part of this community's
daily activities. These things become a necessity when an activity
like tree-sitting precludes any means of earning dollars, and a
good number of tree-sitters rely on trash containers for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   There are about six ``sits'' in the area. A couple are in the
Willamette forest, including the Red Cloud Thunder sit in Fall
Creek, about 40 minutes outside of Eugene. Tangent offers a guided
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The air there is crisp and clear. The only sounds are of
squirrels and other forest critters. That is, until Tangent yells
his greetings to the trees, each with its own name.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Ygdrassil, the Norse word for `tree of life.' Calima is
obvious, the goddess Cali. Happy is happy; Fanghorn is out of a
book. And this is my friend's wife. Yup, he married a tree,'' says
Tangent.
</P>
<P>
   He points to Grandma, a 100-year-old Douglas fir his friend,
Lorax, a red-haired, blue-eyed, drum-thumping 24-year-old, has been
in wedded bliss with since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of affectionate cussing echoes from the sits above,
each 165 feet to 190 feet high. After all, Tangent has come bearing
two boxes of food.
</P>
<P>
   A line comes down with a black backpack attached. Tangent loads
up bread and yells ``K1!'' The backpack makes its way up. This is
how they survive _ friends bring them supplies when they can and
send them up. The sits are built on platforms, connected with
traverse lines that sitters use to go from sit to sit.
</P>
<P>
   A masked, dark-eyed 19-year-old named Atticus comes down from
his tree and pulls Tangent aside. Atticus tells Tangent that he'd
like to make one thing clear: The tree-sitters here had nothing to
do with the WTO. They did not abandon the trees they're working to
preserve in order to take part in the protest. After all, not all
tree-sitters are anarchists; some are just radical
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The sits are stocked, further arrangements are made and the
visit is over.
</P>
<P>
   ARRESTED BY THE FBI
</P>
<P>
   Hitching a ride from Fall Creek back into Eugene are Red and
Midnight. Red, a long and lean 16-year-old from Northern
California, has had a very busy couple of weeks. First, there was
the WTO protests. Then there was being arrested and detained for
three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say if I was or wasn't (rioting), but I got
arrested for doing something _ four counts of malicious mischief.
They said they saw me breaking four windows.''
</P>
<P>
   He went into town with the Black Bloc, the now infamous group of
30 to 50 black-clad anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   Red says he was standing in front of the U.S. Bank building on
Seattle's Pine Street on Nov. 30 when two men from the FBI choked
him with his necklace and threw him to the ground. The agents were
wearing black masks and black, hooded sweat shirts _ just like the
Black Bloc members. He says the two flashed their badges before
dragging him ``kicking and screaming'' to the fourth floor of the
Westin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He says they roughed him up in the elevator, shoving him
head-first in the corner, popping his neck and hurting his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had, like, six guys on top of me in that small elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to the former Sand Point naval station for
processing and then to a juvenile facility. Red says he was
released without charges being pressed. He figures it was because
the undercover FBI agents who arrested him didn't have time to file
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Although Red says he was mistreated, he doesn't seem surprised
or outraged. This probably has something to do with how anarchists
view authority. Just ask the local police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that it plays into the anarchist philosophy to
establish a relationship with authority,'' says Eugene police Capt.
Thad Buchanan, who joined the force in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police department has always had a relationship with
political activists. Surely in the 1960s it probably wasn't all
that great, but in the time that I've been here and up until a few
years ago, we've always had very good success,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan says efforts to establish a relationship with the
anarchists haven't been well-received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day, we co-exist,'' he says. ``We both live and work in
the same general vicinity. ... The occasional clashes generally
come when they openly and consciously decide to violate the law on
a fairly significant level.'' He mentions protests that have
resulted in broken windows and blocked traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell whether the look on Buchanan's face is that of
frustration or resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he seems to know that the Eugene police are at an
impasse with the anarchists _ whoever they are.

   Using a technique akin to overlaying thousands of faint X-ray
images to create one sharp picture, astronomers have discovered
that typical galaxies may be twice as large and contain twice as
much mass as suggested by previous measurements. The new
observations, which have emerged from a five-year census of the
heavens called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, indicate that an
average galaxy extends invisibly for well over a million
light-years into space and weighs the equivalent of at least 5
trillion Suns.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the glittering disk of stars in a typical galaxy
like the Milky Way, where Earth is located, stretches only about
50,000 light-years from center to edge and contains about 100
billion stars. The finding raises the possibility that the Milky
Way and its nearest galactic neighbor _ Andromeda, more than 2
million light-years away _ actually brush against each other in the
remote darkness of space.
</P>
<P>
   The observations probed not the bright disk but the mysterious
cloud of nonluminous or ``dark'' matter, called a halo, that
surrounds the disk. Although the dark matter is invisible and
scientists have been unable to determine its precise nature, they
know of its existence because of the gravitational pull it exerts
on ordinary matter _ the stars and gas in galaxy disks.
</P>
<P>
   The Sloan measurements relied on another effect of a halo's
gravity: Like a lens or a clear marble, it bends light rays that
pass through it. One consequence is that extremely distant
background galaxies, as seen through a foreground galaxy's halo,
appear distorted. Because the effect is so minute, however, the
Sloan astronomers observed it in about 30,000 foreground galaxies
and added the data together.
</P>
<P>
   Then, working backward to deduce what kind of halo would produce
those distortions, the astronomers found that the dark matter
trails deep into space, even farther than earlier studies by other
methods had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result from the Sloan analysis is that the haloes of
galaxies are enormous,'' said Dr. Tereasa Brainerd, an astronomer
at Boston University, whose earlier work helped develop the
technique, ``perhaps extending 10 to 20 times the size of the
visible regions of the galaxies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vera Rubin, the astronomer at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington who discovered that galaxies must contain dark matter,
added that the Sloan observations had taken a ``conceptually
brilliant'' idea, whose application had been disappointing in the
past, and turned it into a practical technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, when I would talk about dark matter, I had to
explain why it hadn't been seen that way,'' Dr. Rubin said, adding
that the technique was ``observationally very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's report on the finding, which has been submitted to
the Astronomical Journal, is also likely to be seen as an early
sign that the unusual $80 million project will help change the way
astronomy is done. The report has been posted on the Los Alamos
National Laboratory's preprint server
(xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9912119).
</P>
<P>
   The Sloan survey is an ambitious effort to collect and
categorize hundreds of millions of objects over a vast swath of the
northern sky. To complete the project _ which involves nine
institutions in the United States, Germany and Japan _ scientists
and engineers have constructed a special telescope, the largest
electronic camera ever built, and other apparatus at Apache Point,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than picking out interesting objects and studying them
one by one, the Sloan telescope sweeps across the sky, scooping up
high-quality data on everything in its field of view. Later, any
astronomer who wishes to do so can obtain data on particular
objects and then analyze them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten into a mode in our country, and pretty much
worldwide, of using a telescope for a night or three nights,
looking at an object and going home,'' said Dr. Tony Tyson, the
astronomer at Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies who first
proposed the idea of using the lensing of background galaxies to
determine the size of halos.
</P>
<P>
   With its entirely different philosophy, Tyson said, the Sloan
survey ``is going to come up with some fantastic answers by the
time the experiment is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the galaxy results have emerged from just 3 percent of
the data that the survey is expected to compile over the next five
years. And that is not the only discovery to pop out of the data,
which is eventually expected to yield a tremendous haul of
celestial oddities, a detailed ``field guide'' to all the varieties
of ordinary objects in the heavens, and a three-dimensional map of
a million galaxies in the Milky Way's corner of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago
and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, who is the Sloan
survey's spokesman, said: ``It's kind of like a wall of water
coming at you. When you feel the spray, you won't have much time to
catch your breath before the wall of water comes.'' He added that
with the first results, ``we're feeling the spray.''
</P>
<P>
   The results on galaxy halos give some insight into the
multifarious ways in which astronomers will be using the coming
tidal wave of Sloan data.
</P>
<P>
   In the more than two decades since Dr. Rubin discovered the
galactic dark matter from studying the rotation patterns of spiral
galaxies, astrophysicists and cosmologists have learned indirectly,
through studies of pristine traces of the Big Bang in distant space
and other methods, that at least 90 percent of the matter in the
universe is dark.
</P>
<P>
   Some astronomers have suggested on general grounds that all the
dark matter might be found in galaxy halos, while others have
theorized that it might be spread out in the space between
galaxies. But turning up direct evidence has proved elusive. Since
galaxy disks are comparatively small, it is difficult to use their
motions as probes of anything but the inmost portions of the
surrounding halos.

 &HT;    BARAK MAKES PITCH TO ISRAEL ON THE 'HEAVY PRICE' OF PEACE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday urged his
country to prepare for the ``heavy price'' of a peace agreement
with Syria _ a possible withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spoke in a special address to the Israeli parliament that
was followed by a 47-to-31 vote of endorsement for peace talks,
which are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first official indication of Israel's openness to
concessions that might be necessary in making peace with Syria, one
of the country's oldest and most important enemies.
</P>
<P>
   With his speech, the vote and the demonstration outside of
several thousand Golan Heights supporters, the debate that some
Israeli newspapers have already dubbed ``The Battle for the Golan''
was underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace agreement we want to reach with Syria will be such
that it will put an end to conflict and ensure peace and security
between the two nations,'' Barak told the parliament. ``If we miss
this opportunity, God forbid, it might cost us in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak denied accusations that he had already promised Syrian or
American mediators that Israel would give up the Golan in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to stress instead, the ``historic'' chance the talks
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a revolution in the relationship between Israel and
the Arab countries,'' Barak said. ``Our supreme responsibility is
to act today so that we will not dig new rows of graves tomorrow in
a conflict that could have been ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their border has been quiet since the 1973 war, Syria and
Israel have been in an official state of war for decades. Israel
captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967, and the return of
the plateau _ on Israel's northeastern edge _ is the key issue in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Syria seeks the return of the entire Golan. Israel seeks
assurances that Syria will reign in guerillas who Israel is
fighting in the war in southern Lebanon. It also seeks normal
relations with Syria, a pull back of Syrian troops from the Israeli
border, and international monitors or other ways to insure security
between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to take any Syrian deal to a public vote.
Opinion polls in recent days have shown Israelis evenly split on
whether to give up the Golan in return for a peace deal. One poll
even showed that a quarter of Golan residents could agree to a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, Barak met with Nadia Cohen, widow of Eli
Cohen, an Israeli spy who was tortured and executed by Syria in
1965. She said she wished Barak well in the talks and said she
hopes they will lead to the return of Eli Cohen's remains.
</P>
<P>
   But, others oppose Barak's efforts and that opposition has
quickly turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Police Monday were reportedly investigating the posting of signs
accusing Barak of treason, the same accusation hurled at Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the months leading up to his
assassination in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis compare the possible evacuation of some 18,000
Jews living in 33 settlements on the Golan to the Nazi practice of
sweeping Jews out of their neighborhoods and countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan Heights has supporters beyond those that live there.
While some say the high ground is not strategically important in
these days of missile warfare, others believe it is vital to the
country's security. Still others say a withdrawal would encourage
Arab countries to press for more land.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration outside the parliament Monday, several
thousand people chanted, ``No moving from the Golan!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to turn this country upside down,'' said
demonstrator Pircha Lottner, 71, of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not extremists. We want peace, but there is no way we
want to leave our homes,'' said Golan resident Avner Talmon, 45.
</P>
<P>
   But, one public opinion expert here said the nearly even poll
numbers over a Golan withdrawal, even before a deal is signed,
indicate the odds are in Barak's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak has his trump card. He will tell people that it will end
all the wars,'' said Yehuda Ben Meir, a researcher on Israeli
attitudes about peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   An actual agreement, which negotiators say could occur within
months, would likely include potent public relations opportunities,
such as a Barak visit to the Syrian capital, Damascus, and a
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prime minister's residence Monday night, several
hundred peace activists voiced their support for the talks.
Carrying signs saying, ``Peace with Syria now,'' they invoked the
name of Rabin and offered a preview of the pro-peace referendum
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the Golan is more than a home. It is a lifetime
achievement,'' said Yigal Kipnis, a resident of the Golan for 21
years. ``But we never put our own interests above the interests of
the nation. Real and full peace is the aim.''

 UNDATED: surrounding halos. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Penny Sackett of the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in the
Netherlands, who recently published a review on the topic, said
that a different kind of observation, involving small ``satellite''
galaxies that felt the tug of a larger galaxy's halo, could probe
its existence farther into space.
</P>
<P>
   That study, led by Dr. Dennis Zaritsky of the University of
Arizona, suggested that halos extend to at least 600,000
light-years, but could not rule out the possibility that they go
farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a situation where maybe they're large, and maybe
they're not so large,'' Dr. Sackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The work that formed the basis for the new Sloan report, which
was led by Dr. Philippe Fischer and Dr. Timothy McKay, both of the
University of Michigan, sought to probe the dark matter halos more
directly and deeper into the space around galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers turned to the effect called gravitational
lensing. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, gravity
bends light just as an ordinary glass lens does. The effect was
first seen in 1919, when astronomers saw a slight deflection in the
apparent position of a star over the limb of the Sun during an
eclipse, an early step in verifying the now-accepted theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that it's well understood, instead of using the lensing to
test the theory, we use the lensing to measure the mass of
objects,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   When rays from a distant source of light pass through a
distributed mass, like a halo, rather than past its edge, the
source gets smeared into little arcs rather than simply deflected.
So the Sloan team searched their data for relatively nearby
galaxies with more distant galaxies behind them, lying along almost
the same line of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers immediately faced a colossal technical
challenge: The expected smearing would be so slight that it would
stretch out any individual background galaxy by only about half a
percent. Because galaxies are irregularly shaped anyway, the only
option was to add up the tiny smearing in a statistical sample of
many background galaxies shining through many halos.
</P>
<P>
   And it is in exactly such a study that the Sloan survey excels,
since it collects great numbers of both kinds of galaxies: those in
the foreground whose halos do the lensing, and those in the
background whose shapes are slightly smeared. In the early data,
the team found an average of 50 background galaxies whose light
pierced the halo of each of 30,000 foreground galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the Sloan wins out _ it's simply the vast number
of objects in their data set,'' said Dr. Brainerd of Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that typical halos extended to at least 1.3
million light-years into space from the luminous galactic disks,
more than double the previous limit.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the results only deepen the mystery of the dark
matter. They shed no new light on exactly what it is, although
Turner said that the new findings were consistent with the dark
matter's being a strange sort of subatomic particle left over from
the explosive birth of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the light the results should shed on the
formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, they also let scientists
complete a bit of cosmic bookkeeping, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Unrelated studies of elements that were produced through nuclear
reactions in the Big Bang, the explosion in which the universe is
thought to have been born, combined with observations of large
galaxy clusters, have allowed cosmologists to estimate the total
amount of matter in the universe. Astronomers have had a hard time
finding that much matter in the heavens, but the larger halos may
mean that all the matter has now been accounted for. The vast
majority of that matter appears to be of the dark variety,
inhabiting the halos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now balance the books and say that we know that the
dark matter in the universe is associated with galaxies,'' Turner
said. ``It's a bit mind-blowing. The halos of galaxies are really
big.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite excited about this result,'' said Dr. Joshua
Frieman, a Sloan collaborator at Fermilab. ``Considering it's based
on a few percent of the total amount of data we'll have, it's a
real indicator of what we'll be able to accomplish in this area of
the survey.''
</P>
<P>
   That same statistical power is what astronomers in other fields
of study will be looking forward to mining as the Sloan survey
scans the heavens, Dr. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the University of Chicago and Fermilab,
institutions taking part in the Sloan survey include Princeton,
Johns Hopkins, the Institute for Advanced Study, the U.S. Naval
Observatory, a collaboration called the Japan Participation Group,
the University of Washington, the Max Planck Institute for
Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, and several institutions involved
in only selected portions of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Already, said Dr. Donald York, a collaborator at the University
of Chicago, who is a founder of the project, discoveries in the
Sloan data have doubled the number of extremely distant quasars, or
beacons near the edge of the visible universe that burn with the
intensity of hundreds of billions of Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say it took 35 years to find the first dozen and six
months to find the second dozen,'' York said of the discoveries,
which have emerged as the Sloan telescope has operated only
sporadically as part of a commissioning period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a look at the way astronomers of the future will
work,'' Dr. Rubin said.

ZONE GROWING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By LIZ MURRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Dead Zone'' that is formed in the Gulf of Mexico by
pollutants from the Mississippi River was larger than ever this
year, say researchers at the Louisiana Universities Marine
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The zone, an area too overrun with pollution to support any
marine life, is at its worst in hot weather and covered an
estimated 7,728 square miles when measured in July, said Dr. Nancy
Rabalais, a marine ecologist at the consortium. That is roughly the
size of New Jersey, and 700 square miles larger than its previous
maximum size in 1995, Dr. Rabalais said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon was first reported in 1974 by Dr. R. Eugene
Turner, director of the Coastal Ecology Institute at Louisiana
State University, who discovered the deadly depletion of oxygen at
the gulf's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause of the problem is pollution flowing in from the
Mississippi in the form of excess nutrients, particularly nitrogen
from agricultural runoff. These discharges promote an overgrowth of
algae in the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   When these algae die, they sink to the bottom, where bacteria
begin decomposing them, using up oxygen in the process. As a
result, all life must either relocate or perish.
</P>
<P>
   Furthering the trouble, fresh water continues to flow in,
forming a separate layer on top of the thicker, salty gulf waters.
This prevents air from reaching the gulf's floor.
</P>
<P>
   The new measurement of the dead zone, based on water samples and
instrument readings, has been made part of a report by a federal
task force charged with drafting a management plan for nutrient
issues in the Mississippi River basin. The proposed report is open
for public comment until Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is clear that levels of nitrogen must be reduced to
help solve the problem, researchers are still debating how to do
it. Some say that although the nitrogen appears to be coming mainly
from the middle and upper parts of the Mississippi watershed, it
may be more feasible to regulate runoff in smaller amounts in other
places. Others argue that pollution from a dominant source like the
middle Mississippi must first be controlled.

EXPLORING LAKE IS LIKE VISITING ANOTHER PLANET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian, American and French scientists are closing in on the
secrets of a lake that lies under the two-mile thickness of ice
covering the South Polar Plateau _ a lake thought to resemble
similar bodies of water elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Vostok, as it is called, is about the size of Lake Ontario
and may be something like an ocean of liquid water believed to lie
beneath the ice covering Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, scientists from the University of Hawaii and Montana
State University reported in the journal Science that they had
found an assortment of bacteria in samples of ice recovered by a
drilling machine from a depth of 11,700 feet below the surface _
bacteria that were apparently trapped in ice just above the water
level as some of the water refroze. These bacteria evidently
survived for millions of years in frigid cold and total darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists interpreted their discovery to mean that bacteria
might be capable of surviving in the depths of subglacial oceans on
Europa, also cut off from warmth, light and a steady supply of
nutrients. Lake Vostok, they said, ``is one of the last unexplored
oases for life on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vostok drillers have been careful to avoid penetrating the
entire thickness of ice and inadvertently contaminating the lake
beneath with surface-dwelling bacteria. Until scientists can devise
some certain way of drilling into the lake without contaminating
it, the drill will go no deeper than 393 feet above the liquid
water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the scientists reported, ice they recovered from that
depth contained a diverse group of bacteria which, although cut off
from the outer world for millions of years, are biologically
similar to known organisms.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jude Wanniski, a supply-side economist and former Wall Street
Journal editorial writer, claims credit for nudging Forbes into
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation came from a good friend of his _ me _ telling
him the roster (of candidates) was incredibly thin,'' Wanniski
said.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a long memorandum to Forbes, proposing a presidential
race for the publisher four years ago, after Kemp had ruled himself
out. Wanniski and Forbes, who lived a few miles from each other in
New Jersey, had been longtime friends and had often discussed
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   But they had a falling-out after Forbes became a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes lost in 1996 because ``he rejected my advice'' and
listened to the wrong people, Wanniski said.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't involved in Forbes' current campaign but has advised
Quayle and Pat Buchanan, who recently jumped from the GOP to seek
the Reform Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his future may hold, Forbes' interest in politics and
economics began in his childhood in New Jersey, where he still
lives.
</P>
<P>
   He told one interviewer several years ago that he started
reading The New York Times and following the stock market when he
was 12 or 13.
</P>
<P>
   As a son of privilege, Forbes at a young age met a number of
famous and influential people from the worlds of business and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   He and his four siblings helped their father entertain corporate
chiefs during lunch and dinner cruises on the magazine's yacht, the
Highlander.
</P>
<P>
   One of his childhood friends was Christine Todd, now New Jersey
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Forbes and Whitman don't always see eye to eye on
politics. Forbes advised Whitman during her first gubernatorial
race in 1993, but they have drifted apart on social issues. Whitman
favors abortion rights, while Forbes, eager to win the support of
social conservatives, has made opposition to abortion an important
part of his current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just last month, Forbes held a rally in Trenton to support
a bill before the New Jersey Legislature that would require
students to recite a passage from the Declaration of Independence
at the start of each school day. Whitman opposes the bill because
she believes that it has marginal educational value.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman declined to comment on Forbes' presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes that he is a very bright man, but there are some
issues on which they differ,'' the governor's spokeswoman, Jane
O'Connor, said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was only 17 when he wrote his first article for the
family's magazine. The contribution, which his father carried as
part of his ``Fact and Comment'' column, was a report from the 1964
Republican National Convention in San Francisco, which nominated
Barry Goldwater for an impossible challenge to President Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the young people around my age were Goldwater
supporters. And they weren't kooks,'' the young Forbes wrote,
without revealing his own preference in candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them had at least one conspicuous button and when
it came to noisemaking, they were tops.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also published his observations of the 1968
conventions, including what he called the ``fierce Democratic melee
in Chicago.'' Forbes, then a 21-year-old Princeton student, called
legendary Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, who unleashed the city's
police on young anti-war protesters, a ``unique antique.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Princeton with a history degree in 1970
and serving a five-month active duty commitment to the New Jersey
National Guard, he became a fact-checker and researcher in the
magazine's editorial department and quickly worked his way up the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not the kind of guy who said, `Let's go get a beer.' He
was very awkward socially,'' recalled a former writer for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The former staffer said he finds Forbes' presidential ambitions
``befuddling.'' But, he added, ``He was always interested in
economic issues, and the stage for it is politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who soon began getting regular column space of his own,
developed a reputation as an able prognosticator of presidential
election results and economic trends. By 1989, he had been a
four-time winner of the prestigious Crystal Owl award, presented
annually to the reporter making the most accurate economic
predictions for the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not actively involved in running the magazine
during his presidential race, he retains the title of president and
editor in chief and still regularly writes a column.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent column, he criticized the ``inconsistent,
floundering regime'' of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and
endorsed an instant video replay as a way to resolve controversial
calls by umpires during Major League Baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Forbes) has a very good mind. He just wasn't
blessed with Malcolm's (his father's) gift of gab,'' the former
Forbes staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been characterized as stiff and owlish, but his
speaking style on the campaign trail is hardly any worse than
Bush's, Al Gore's or Bill Bradley's. None of the leading contenders
of either major party is golden-throated.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's one-liners, most of which he says he writes
himself, are generally well-received. ``It makes you wonder what
global warming can do to a man's mind,'' is one of his favorite
digs at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' gestures during his speeches often are mechanical, but
that doesn't seem to bother supporters like April Carter, 42, an
aircraft engine factory worker from Chichester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is huge. I just sense it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, however, may
not agree. Forbes' negative TV ads against Dole during the primary
season are believed to have contributed to the nominee's general
election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, trying to position himself as a viable, conservative
alternative to Bush for Republican voters in 2000, Forbes has
recently gone on the offensive against the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes recently began running a TV spot in New Hampshire,
blasting Bush for suggesting that the Social Security retirement
age could be raised to bolster the troubled system. And he was
quick to criticize Bush's proposal to cut income taxes, rather than
overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes promotes his own tax proposal _ which would impose a 17
percent flat tax on all income above $36,000 for a family of four,
abolish capital gains taxes and eliminate many loopholes and
deductions _ as a boon for middle- and low-income Americans. What
he doesn't often say, however, is that his plan also could be worth
untold millions in tax savings to his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is often joined on the campaign trail by his wife, the
former Sabina Beekman, a minister's daughter whom he met at a New
York debutante party during his senior year at Princeton. They have
five daughters.
</P>
<P>
   No one except Dwight Eisenhower has been elected president in
modern times without first holding a lower elective office. But
Eisenhower was a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes insists he is not discouraged by history _ or his low
poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more real-world executive experience than all of these
other candidates put together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that he has traveled the world extensively and
visited with many foreign leaders as a businessman, journalist and
chairman of the Radio Free Europe board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll match my knowledge of the world with anyone else,'' he
said.

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ And now, for their next act, the Oakland
Raiders pray for losses.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of losses. Buffalo losses. Seattle losses. New England
losses. Kansas City losses.
</P>
<P>
   As for the day of Dec.26, when Buffalo plays New England and
Kansas City plays Seattle? The Raiders pray for losses all around.
Four losses for those four teams, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a lot depends on what other teams do now,'' Raiders
fullback Jon Ritchie said. ``I'm not going to lie. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how tough: The Raiders are 6-7 and enjoy a tiebreaker
advantage only over Buffalo, which is 8-4. In other words, for the
Raiders to pass Seattle and Kansas City in the AFC West, those
teams have to finish 8-8. Seattle already has eight wins, and
Kansas City has seven. So is Seattle going to go 0-4 and Kansas
City 1-3, and are the Raiders going to win their last three games,
starting next Sunday against Tampa Bay, a defense that has allowed
the fewest points of any NFC team?
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath.
</P>

   So the other hope is this: Buffalo goes 1-3 over its last four
games (against the New York Giants, at Arizona, at New England and
against Indianapolis) and the Raiders not only beat Tampa Bay, but
win road games at San Diego and at Kansas City _ oh, and New
England (7-5) flames out, too _ and the Oakland Raiders break a
six-year playoff drought.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about it, Ritchie could barely answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the prognosticator, I'm the player,'' Ritchie said.
``I know one thing, and that's to play and practice hard, and to
continue to improve. There's only one thing I can control, and
that's whether we win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   How can anyone expect the Raiders to go 3-0 down the stretch
when all they have done all year is show an amazing ability to hurt
themselves, an almost fascinating inconsistency that is so regular,
you'd have to call it consistency?
</P>
<P>
   Never more than two wins in a row. Never more than two losses in
a row. Never a record more than one game above or below .500.
Losses that can be boiled down to one play, every week, losses that
can be boiled down to missed field goals at Denver, against Kansas
City at the Coliseum, and at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Losses that, on average, were only by 4.4 maddening points, and
never by more than a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they face the specter of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
coming next, a team that makes its very existence thriving off of
other teams' mistakes, a turnover-hungry crew that is still playing
every game for its playoff existence and will be motivated, not
flat, at the Coliseum on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Raiders can look back on this season as the season of
the unforgiving schedule. Maybe if they hadn't had to fly to
Tennessee on a Thursday following a Sunday game, maybe if they
hadn't had to open at Green Bay and then play at Minnesota, Seattle
and Buffalo in four of the first six weeks, their season would have
started better than 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Ritchie said. ``It's a difficult
schedule. No one can be happy with a schedule like that, but it
shouldn't affect the way we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie made that comment just minutes after the 21-14 loss at
Tennessee, another example of a Raiders game gone awry: a Rich
Gannon fumble at the 7-yard line, a Darrien Gordon muffed punt that
cost the Raiders a comeback try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have won the (Tennessee Titans) game, we were
in a position to win it,'' Ritchie said. ``We had to finish out,
and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A familiar refrain, uttered in locker rooms at Mile High
Stadium, Lambeau Field and the Kingdome. And to think, this is a
Raiders team that has defeated Minnesota on the road, Buffalo on
the road, and beaten probable division winner Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the thoughts that caused Gannon to utter the word
``frustrating'' so many times after the Titans loss, it was as if
it were the only word he could say. Those are the thoughts that eat
away at the Raiders this weekend, as they take a Sunday off and
watch their brethren play around the league.
</P>
<P>
   And root for the Cardinals over the Bills. And root for the
Chargers over the Seahawks. And root for ... ah, you get the idea.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A dreary day is expected across New England and the Middle
Atlantic states. A complex storm moving east from Delaware will act
as a pivot for a wedge of very mild, moist air to be lifted over a
dome of chilly air over Quebec. The result will be a cold, soaking
rain from Lake Erie to Cape Cod. As much as three inches of rain
will be blown by onshore gale-force winds. Pockets of colder air
over the higher terrain of northern Pennsylvania and upstate New
York may lead to accumulations of ice or wet snow.
</P>
<P>
   Drier yet cooler air will cover much of the Southeast and Gulf
States with high pressure building across northern Florida. A few
showers will persist in south Florida ahead of a cold front. A flow
of mild air into Texas will cause clouds to develop along the
coast. Low clouds will linger along the west slopes of the
Appalachians from northern Georgia to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and low clouds are expected into the central Lakes. A push
of polar air into the Plains will produce scattered snow showers in
the Missouri Valley. Low pressure forming over the southwest Plains
will force chilly, moist air to ascend the east slopes of the
southern Rockies leading to a brief period of snow. Colder air will
return to the Rockies on gusty winds.
</P>
<P>
   Fine late-autumn weather will dominate the Southwest, though
canyon winds will still be gusty in southern California. Milder air
from the Pacific will be lifted over the Cascades, allowing snow
levels to rise. Farther inland, residual cold air will promote snow
showers in the higher terrain. Rain and gusty winds will effect the
Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fullest Moon
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a cheap advertisement, but the full moon next
week will be bigger and brighter than any moon that we have seen
this century. An unusual coincidence of the shape of the lunar
orbit and the winter solstice, which occurs on December 22, will
make the moon appear 14 percent larger and about 7 percent
brighter. Despite the beginning of winter in the northern
hemisphere, the Earth is actually several million miles closer to
the sun at this time of the year and this will add more radiance to
the full moon. Should a strong coastal storm develop, then tidal
flooding could become very serious.

THE HEALING ARTS, CAST IN SHADES OF GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   All the talk about medical errors in Washington these days
leaves the impression that now that the problem is finally
acknowledged, a solution is already in sight. Like an alcoholic at
his first AA meeting, we have finally stood up and said the words
out loud: Bad errors happen in medical practice. There are drugs
with look-alike labels and sound-alike names, there are nurses who
mistake micrograms for milligrams and doctors who mistake left for
right. The message seems to be that once systems like the ones
safeguarding aviation and other high-risk industries are in place,
medical care will become safe at last.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so. The truth is that unlike aviation or any
other industry, medicine is a world etched in perilous shades of
gray. Very little is black or white, right or wrong. Once systems
are in place to fix stupid human mistakes, equally dreadful errors
of judgment that are far harder to deflect will endure.
</P>
<P>
   A patient who was admitted to a New York City hospital a month
ago is an instructive case study in medical error, the kind that
will require more than systems analysis and punitive Medicare
sanctions to correct. He is an 80-year-old man with diabetes who
developed diarrhea early this fall. After a week he started to feel
woozy and went to his local hospital _ call it Acme Medical Center
_ to get checked out.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors at Acme did all the right things. The patient was
severely dehydrated, and they gave him some fluid intravenously;
they ran tests to see if an infection was causing the diarrhea and
examined his colon in case a tumor or other anatomic abnormality
was responsible. They found nothing wrong, gave him pills to slow
the diarrhea and sent him home. The diarrhea stopped on its own a
few days later.
</P>
<P>
   A week passed. The patient noticed that his forearm was sore at
the site where his intravenous line had been placed. The pain
worsened and he ran a slight fever. He went back to Acme.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors there could see that he clearly had an infection in
his arm _ a complication of intravenous therapy that occurs in
American hospitals hundreds of thousands of times a year. Most of
the time these infections go away by themselves. Rarely, they
progress, spreading through the bloodstream to cause
life-threatening abscesses in the brain, the bones or the heart.
Anything that impairs the body's immune defenses, like diabetes,
may increase the risk of the infection's spreading.
</P>
<P>
   The Acme doctors put the patient in the hospital and gave him
the most powerful antibiotic they could. At the end of a week, the
arm was fine. The patient was desperate to go home. Usually at
least two weeks of antibiotics are given to make sure these
infections do not progress. Some doctors recommend four weeks to
reduce the small remaining risk still further. But insurers can be
loath to pay for extra hospital days just for a little added
certainty. Furthermore, the antibiotics were now making the
patient's stomach rumble, and he was morbidly afraid his diarrhea
would return. His doctors could have arranged for him to get
another few weeks of antibiotics at home, but he vigorously
protested.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later the patient stumbled in the street, fell down
and couldn't get up. An ambulance took him back to Acme.
</P>
<P>
   He was found to have a high fever and pneumonia. Inexplicably,
he was also having trouble moving his legs. On his third day in the
hospital he suddenly couldn't move them at all. An MRI scan showed
a large infection in his upper spine, with a fist-sized abscess
encasing two vertebrae and pressing down on the spinal cord itself,
paralyzing his legs. He had become a textbook example of one of the
worst and rarest complications of an infected intravenous line.
</P>
<P>
   The patient is still hospitalized. He has been receiving
antibiotics for almost a month now. His fever is gone, but he still
cannot move his legs. Scans show that the abscess in his spine is
getting larger. It is close enough to his heart and lungs that an
operation to drain it would be complicated and very risky. The
hospital surgeons are unwilling to take those risks. But leaving
the abscess undrained is also risky _ it is growing dangerously
close to a big blood vessel in the chest. If it bursts into that
blood vessel, the patient will die.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the bad luck from bad systems and bad medical
practice in this dreadful tangle of medical error would take the
wisdom of Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Can we assign the blame for the whole cascade of events to an
unknown nurse or medical technician who placed the patient's first
intravenous line, deciding that they must not have used good
aseptic technique during the procedure? This is a temptingly simple
solution, but studies have shown that even when intravenous lines
are placed with immaculate technique, a small but finite risk of
infection persists.
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to blame instead the doctors at Acme for not
insisting that the patient get more antibiotics for his arm
infection? They, too, were playing the roulette wheel of medical
risk. The chances were pretty good that their patient's infection
would subside without incident. But more antibiotics would have
made those chances much better _ so do we blame them for failing to
understand important gradations of risk? For understanding them but
not making the patient understand them? For not bullying him into
submission even if he couldn't understand, making him stay when he
wanted to leave?
</P>
<P>
   Do we decide to whirl around and just blame the patient, for
taking unnecessary risks with his own health? Do we instead blame
the philosophy that guides medical practice these days, for giving
him the legal and moral autonomy to do so? Do we blame medical
insurers, for encouraging early hospital discharges, making it so
very difficult nowadays to be careful with patients who need a
little extra care? Do we pass a little blame on to the nursing
profession, for not routinely sending visiting nurses to drop in on
discharged patients, so that trouble is detected sooner rather than
later?
</P>
<P>
   Or do we shake our fists in the air and blame bad karma and
angry gods?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we have outgrown this last option. But at least we
should be aware that while acknowledging that medical errors occur
is a first step in getting rid of them, the path toward making
medical care a safe haven is likely to be long and winding indeed.

SHOOTING CREATES TENSION ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD ACUNA, Mexico _ Viewed through Mexican eyes from an
outcropping above the Rio Grande, the Vega Verde subdivision in Del
Rio, Texas, is an isolated bit of American fantasyland of
comfortable homes, satellite dishes, recreational vehicles and
pacing watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   And when three dirt-poor young Mexicans waded the river last
month to burglarize a secluded home on Vega Verde Road, they were
following in the footsteps of many thieves before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going over to rob them, but we didn't have any time,''
Martin Cerdo Martinez said. ``We saw the man running out of his
truck. We ran and got out to the middle of the river, and then we
heard the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The three crossed the Rio Grande on Nov. 1, but only two came
back. Eleven days later, the body of the missing youth, Luis
Armando Chavez Vaquera, 16, turned up downriver with a bullet hole
through the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, the obscure border incident outside Del Rio
has become a sensitive international issue, prompting high-level
calls by Mexico for intervention from Texas and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   It has also illustrated the jarring contrasts and inevitable
conflicts between the lives of Mexicans and Americans who are
neighbors here, separated only the modest stream called the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves a youngster, a juvenile of 16 years. We feel it is
a very delicate situation, and we don't want it generalized along
the border,'' said Carlos Sada, Mexico's consul-general in San
Antonio. ``If everyone begins taking justice into their own hands,
then the law of the Wild West comes into the scenario, and that law
is totally abolished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexicans are angered and confused because the man the
would-be burglars accuse in the shooting has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, a suspect would be immediately jailed until he
could demonstrate he is innocent. Some people don't understand
there is a different legal system in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man has denied the shooting. Victor Garcia, the man's
lawyer, said he advised his client to leave Del Rio for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are awaiting results of DNA testing to confirm
the identity of the badly decomposed body, but have few doubts that
it is that of Chavez Vaquera.
</P>
<P>
   The dead teen's family members feel that authorities on both
sides of the Rio Grande are trying to avoid investigating the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Maria del Carmen Vaquera, the dead boy's mother, said ``what we
want first is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it would be justified to shoot someone in the home, but
he was shot in the river, on the Mexican side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But where Mexicans see cold-blooded murder, Americans who live
on the isolated river road and are victims of repeated thefts, see
an act of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on this side who knows the situation is sympathetic''
to the gunman, said Tommy Vick, who lives along the river in Del
Rio. ``That's the only thing you can do, stand up to them, or
they'll take everything you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the best place in the world to live if that
wasn't Mexico,'' Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been broken into numerous times over the last eight to
10 years. I've lost $15,000 to $20,000 in merchandise. We caught a
burglar in our home one time, and after we turned him over to
police, they just turned him loose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few houses downriver from Vick, Virginia Mohr lives with a
loaded .12-gauge shotgun hung above the inside of the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but I know how to use it. I think
you'll probably find a shotgun in every house on the river,'' Mohr
said.
</P>
<P>
   The residents along Vega Verde Road say calling the Val Verde
County Sheriff or U.S. Border Patrol to deal with such incidents is
pointless.
</P>
<P>
   With only 10 deputies to patrol a 3,300-square-mile county,
Sheriff D'Wayne Jernigan said responding in time to calls from the
river neighborhood is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, we can't protect them. Usually we have
only one deputy on (road) duty at any time,'' he said.

 &HT;    Banks pronounced ready for Jan. 1
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All of the nation's 10,200 banks, thrift institutions
and credit unions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
are ready for 2000, federal and state regulators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts don't expect problems, and depositors' accounts
at FDIC banks are insured up to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Tanoue, president of the FDIC, and Jack Guynn, president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said any glitches that
occur Jan. 1 will be minor bumps in the road, not disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern expressed to date _ whether or not consumers
will be able to use automated teller machines as usual _ has been
put to rest, said Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have been to ATM machines that did not work. It was
not Y2K then, and it won't be Y2K now, if it happens,'' she said.
``Just go up the street to another ATM.''
</P>
<P>
   In a three-year effort that involved thousands of examiners
visiting each bank at least twice, systems have been upgraded,
replaced and tested. Codes have been rewritten when problems
appeared, Tanoue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a one-shot deal. We have greater reliability
than ever and better contingency systems (for all kinds of power
outages, including those caused by weather),'' Tanoue said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been an increased demand for cash over 1998,
people have not been withdrawing huge amounts, Guynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks have stockpiled (cash), so it is there if people
want it, but some have even started sending the money back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers think banks are prepared, according to a Gallup
Poll commissioned by federal bank regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bridges, commissioner of Georgia's Department of Banking
and Finance, said consumers have not been making the wholesale
withdrawals that some banks expected.
</P>
<P>
   According to Seidman, there are no total industry cost estimates
for Y2K preparation. Her agency has spent $100 million. The Federal
Reserve has shelled out $125 million. Some of the money was for
scheduled, non-Y2K-related upgrades.

BY GEORGE, GROUP GETS INTO THE SPIRIT OF HONORING WASHINGTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ His picture, similar to the one on dollar bills,
seemed out of place on the local newspaper's obituary page Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was: ``General George Washington,'' dead now for
200 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would catch the eye,'' chuckled Frank Gibson, a
retiree who helped organize a totally serious church service
Tuesday night to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of
Washington's death in 1799.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the memorial service for the father of the
United States was right there on page 6B of Monday's Austin
American-Statesman, a Cox newspaper with a daily circulation of
about 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The service is expected to draw some of Washington's distant
relatives, a minister from Houston and Sons of the American
Revolution from around the state and nation, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Washington is sort of the patron saint of the SAR. He's
our No. 1 man,'' said Gibson, president of the state chapter of the
SAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it's the 200th anniversary of his death, we decided to
have a memorial service for him,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The religious observance at Covenant Presbyterian Church will
include hymns, a sermon, a eulogy by former Texas Supreme Court
Justice Jack Hightower, and a remembrance by a descendant of one of
Washington's staff officers and a Daughter of the American
Revolution, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two ``collateral'' descendants of the general, who had no
children, also are expected, said Gibson, an elder at the church.
</P>
<P>
   If the 7 p.m. CST service lasts until 9:30, the
approximate &UR;  &LR; local time of Washington's demise at Mount Vernon,
Va., the church bells will be tolled in his honor, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was only appropriate that we honor his death,
the same way we honor his birth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had been retired from public service about two years
when he succumbed to what some historians say was strep throat, a
bacterial infection. On the day before his death, Washington
followed his usual routine of logging weather observations _ it was
near freezing and damp _ riding horseback and doing other chores at
Mount Vernon. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But he failed to remove wet clothes that afternoon and by early
the next morning, his throat had swollen, making it hard to breath,
historians say. Their accounts say Washington ordered an aide to
drain blood in a failed bid to feel better before doctors arrived.
He died several hours later, and the nation remained in mourning
more than two months _ until his Feb. 22 birthday. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As citizens did then, those honoring Washington on Tuesday will
wear black arm bands, said John Knox, who leads the Austin chapter
of the Sons of the American Revolution. He'll don a Revolutionary
War uniform first thing in the morning to lead a Cub Scout troop's
flag-raising ceremony in the general's honor.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said SAR members in the Dallas suburb of Plano are also
planning ceremonies Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without George Washington taking the steps he took, we
wouldn't be here today,'' Knox said. &UR;

   NEW YORK _ The Museum of Modern Art, which abruptly lost its
only two van Gogh drawings last year, once again has one in its
collection. The museum's chairman, Ronald Lauder bought an
unusually large and turbulent van Gogh drawing of olive trees last
week at Sotheby's in London for $8.5 million, a record price for a
van Gogh drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director, Glenn D. Lowry, confirmed the gift from
Lauder. The drawing will go on view early in the new year, museum
aides said. The acquisition helped fill, at least in part, a gap
created in the Modern's collection by an unusual stipulation in the
will of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, one of the museum's founders, who
died in 1948. She bequeathed the Modern two van Gogh drawings
valued together at $40 million: ``Hospital Corridor at St. Remy,''
an 1889 gouache that Vincent van Gogh made for his brother, Theo,
while the artist was a patient there, and ``Streets at Stes.
Maries,'' an 1888 image of a row of cottages along a street leading
to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   But her will specified that after 50 years, when in her
estimation the drawings would no longer be considered new, the
Modern would have to surrender the two Van Goghs and two works by
Seurat to rival institutions (the van Goghs to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and the Seurats to the Art Institute of Chicago) that
did not have the same exclusive commitment to art of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we gave up the great van Gogh drawings to the
Met, we were going to have to go out and find one or two to replace
them, which wasn't going to be easy,'' Lowry said. He added that
Lauder's gift was ``a complete home run.''
</P>
<P>
   His purchase of the drawing, ``Olive Trees With the Alpilles
Range in the Background'' of 1889, had been planned since the
museum learned it was coming on the market, Lowry said. Officials
at the Modern wanted it not simply because of its extraordinary
penmanship and size (it measures 18{ by 24{ inches), he said, but
also because van Gogh executed the drawing while working on a
painting with the same title that was left to the Modern in March.
The other drawing was bequeathed by Betsy Cushing Roosevelt
Whitney, the New York socialite and philanthropist who with her
husband, John Hay Whitney, the financier, publisher and former
ambassador to Britain, had amassed one of the nation's most
important private art collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drawing has an energy that the painting doesn't,'' said
Lowry. ``It is not a study for the painting but was done at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   That drawing had belonged to Max Silberberg, a German
industrialist who was forced by the Nazis to sell it along with 143
other works.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Greta Silberberg, his 85-year-old daughter-in-law,
recovered the painting in a legal case against the German National
Gallery, where it had been hanging. After the drawing was returned
to her, she put it up for sale. Ms. Silberberg said she planned to
use the money partly to finance a search for the other missing
works.

<P>
   PARIS _ For many French movie directors it is a familiar
problem: how to explain Hollywood's domination of the French box
office without conceding that local moviegoers prefer American
films. In the past they argued that American imports benefited from
better marketing and distribution. Now some are blaming betrayal
closer to home. French film critics, they say, seem bent on killing
off the French movie industry,
</P>
<P>
   That artists resent criticism is hardly exclusive to France or
to cinema. Yet after the first shots were fired at French movie
critics in October, there was something peculiarly French about the
furious battle of words that followed. Where else would major
newspapers dedicate entire pages to covering _ even fomenting _ a
cultural conflict? Isn't a dialectical confrontation between
patriotism and freedom just the stuff of Left Bank cafes?
</P>
<P>
   The respective charges in the dispute seem straightforward
enough. The offended directors say that influential critics at
leading newspapers give ample space and generous reviews to
Hollywood blockbusters while treating many French films with
gratuitous venom.
</P>
<P>
   The critics respond that many French directors are, as one
critic put it, ``spoiled children'' who enjoy government subsidies
and a protected market and expect to be applauded simply because
they are French.
</P>
<P>
   The background to the quarrel, though, is more complex. France
is the only European country where a major movie industry has
survived the American movie offensive of the last two decades.
While film production in Italy, Germany and Britain imploded (the
British industry is now showing some signs of recovery), successive
French governments continued to support filmmaking here, notably by
insisting that 40 percent of movies shown on television be French.
</P>
<P>
   As a legacy of the New Wave movement of the late 1950s and
1960s, cinema in France is still treated more as art than as
business.
</P>
<P>
   Most graduates of France's main film school dream of
intellectual kudos before a share of gross profits. Their likely
role model is Jean-Luc Godard rather than James Cameron. And in a
world where the auteur-director is king (and the producer is his
servant), making films becomes almost a birthright guaranteed by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, then, measured by output, France's record is
good. The number of new releases with total or majority French
financing rose from 97 in 1995 to 148 last year; the number of
French cinema-goers also rose during the same period from 140
million to 170 million. But here's the crunch: The French share of
this market fell from 35 percent in 1995 to 27 percent last year,
while the American share rose from 54 percent to 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at 1998 (1999 statistics are not yet available)
gave further cause for concern. Although running far behind
``Titanic,'' three popular French comedies _ ``Le Diner de Cons''
(``The Dinner Game''), ``Les Visiteurs 2'' and ``Taxi'' _ ranked
second, third and fourth in box-office revenue here. Yet they
accounted for 45 percent of the entire take of 148 French movies,
and only three other new French releases made it into the top 40.
So, while more French films are being made, fewer French are seeing
them.
</P>
<P>
   The need for an explanation _ for a scapegoat, perhaps _ was
evident, but the timing of the directors-critics squabble was
accidental. On Oct. 13, Patrice Leconte, a veteran director, sent a
private letter to fellow members of the Society of Auteurs,
Directors and Producers expressing outrage at the way French films
were treated by the Paris press and suggesting an informal meeting
of directors to debate the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that copies of the letter were mistakenly faxed
to the very newspapers he had in mind. And just one sentence in the
letter sufficed to set off conflict. ``Some reviews, which resemble
premeditated assassinations, send chills down my back,'' Leconte
wrote, ``as if the writers' purpose was to kill off all commercial
French cinema designed for a mass audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Leconte, whose popular comedies include ``Les Bronzes'' and
``Ridicule,'' followed up with an interview in the left-of-center
daily Liberation in which he described Liberation, Le Monde and
Telerama as the ``Bermuda Triangle'' of French cinema. ``Since the
fall, all French films have flopped,'' he said. ``I see this
auguring the collapse of French cinema in its entirety. And in
this, French critics are playing the role of gravediggers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other newspapers and magazines, including those singled out by
Leconte for their reviews, promptly joined the fray. And the
coverage only added to the confusion: Some critics thought that
other critics went too far in their abusive language; some
directors thought critics should be ignored rather than attacked;
everyone agreed that the French movie industry was in trouble;
everyone had a different opinion about why.
</P>
<P>
   The critics who felt criticized, of course, also had a chance to
reply. ``Leconte reproaches us for being more indulgent with the
average American movie,'' Olivier Seguret, Liberation's chief film
critic, noted during a round table of movie critics. ``Perhaps he's
right. Take a film like `There's Something About Mary,' a simple
comedy that made me laugh a lot. Obviously it's not a masterpiece.
But would a similar French film please me as much? It is perhaps a
truth that is unpleasant to hear, but isn't the average American
film better than the average French film?''
</P>
<P>
   Serge Kaganski of Les Inrockuptibles, an alternative magazine,
quickly answered. ``I think that the average American film is far
better than the average French film,'' he said, adding that Leconte
``and his friends'' would be wise to look more closely at their own
films. He nonetheless conceded that French films might be treated
more harshly simply because familiarity breeds, well, irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Le Nouvel Observateur, Jerome Garcin in turn
demolished Leconte's suggestion that critics consider themselves
partners rather than enemies. ``Partners!'' he explained. ``In
other words, associates. Colleagues. Collaborators. And why not
shareholders who take a share of profits like distributors?''
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that the tiff coincided with a particularly
sensitive moment, when French cultural officials were worrying that
the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle would bring
new pressure on France to abandon its quota system and other
measures protecting its movie industry. As it happens, the meeting
failed to start a new round of trade liberalization, and what is
known as the French ``cultural exception'' survived.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But when some 60 movie directors met here Nov. 4 at Leconte's
suggestion, they were still busily wrapping themselves in the
French flag and eager to denounce critics as fifth columnists.
</P>
<P>
   From the closed-door meeting emerged the idea of a directors'
declaration naming irresponsible critics that would be distributed
to moviegoers outside theaters. Several directors agreed to draft
such a text based on notes prepared by Bertrand Tavernier, a vocal
nationalist on the movie question.
</P>
<P>
   Before the declaration could be approved and signed, it was
published by both Le Monde and Liberation. Its contents caused more
waves. Reflecting the spirit of the Nov. 4 meeting, it stressed
that the unidentified directors did not object to constructive
criticism, but it offered endless examples of what it called ``hate
and scorn'' by critics. ``Criticism is in crisis,'' it said, ``in
crisis of intelligence and competence, bereft of analysis and
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   The directors suggested a pact of coexistence, but their main
suggestion was tantamount to asking critics to surrender their
freedom in the name of patriotism. ``We would wish that no negative
review of a film be published before the weekend that follows its
theater release,'' the draft declaration said. Since movies are
usually released on Wednesdays in France, the theory was that word
of mouth could neutralize poor reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was not well received. ``The proposal is frightening
and inadmissible,'' Liberation fumed. ``You have read correctly.
They want to prohibit only `negative' reviews. The rest are
welcome.'' All that was missing, the newspaper said, was the
composition of the censorship committee that would decide what was
negative. ``Should we extend this system to sculpture, painting,
literature?'' it asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Auteurs, Directors and Producers quickly
distanced itself from the draft declaration, saying that it would
never have carried the society's letterhead. Even more
embarrassing, a statement denouncing the draft was signed by
another 60 directors, among them Bertrand Blier, Cedric Klapisch,
Yves Robert and Agnes Varda. ``We think this directors-critics
polemic is pointless,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Tavernier was willing to defend the draft. ``Even with its
imperfections and errors, it moves things along,'' he said in an
interview with Liberation early this month. The point, he said, is
that many critics had little inkling of the damage they caused with
what he called ``killer words,'' words that particularly affected
serious directors whose natural audience read reviews. And
newspaper attacks on the French movie industry, he added, only
aided American critics of France's ``cultural exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, the furor is over, presumably until the movie
attendance figures for 1999 are released early next year. And what
was its legacy? It showed that French movie critics could be
vicious in their reviews, but it did not prove that they were
responsible for the crisis in French cinema. Rather, perhaps
unfairly, it created the impression that some French directors
believe their right to make films also includes the right to be
praised.

 &HT;    Insurers often look askance at mental care
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wayne Fisher, director of the Marcus Behavior Center in Atlanta,
treats youngsters with severe behavioral problems. Some of them _
infants and toddlers _ won't eat. Others, usually adolescents, are
violent. But Fisher has found a therapy, called applied behavior
analysis, that works well for both groups.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about the same length of time. It costs the same. And,
most importantly, it has about the same success rate _ around 80
percent, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the bills are submitted to health insurance companies,
the similarities end. While insurers accept the cost of the
infants' care in about 90 percent of cases, they approve the price
of the adolescents' care only about 20 percent of the time, Fisher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the adolescents' problems fall into the murky realm
of mental illness, a field of medicine where routine discrimination
is condoned and defended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that as people become more aware of the situation,
families who have a mentally ill member can push harder to get the
services they need,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the mentally ill say that, while the U.S. surgeon
general's report issued Monday is a step in the right direction,
it's unlikely to change the daily hassles faced by one in four
American families every year when members need mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how frustrating it is to deal with the
financial and insurance end of things,'' said Suzanne Broder, whose
36-year-old son, Chris Byrd, is diagnosed with schizo-affective
disorder. ``It's an extremely unfair situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because most employers and insurers still don't offer
equal benefits, or ``parity,'' when it comes to mental illness.
Although a person might have a $1 million lifetime benefit for
medical bills such as heart surgery or leukemia treatment, it's
rare that he or she would have such a benefit for schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, for example, held private insurance for more than a
decade, but he had no outpatient mental health benefits and a
$10,000 lifetime cap on inpatient services. That was exceeded
during his first hospitalization and, since then, his family has
spent at least another $10,000 on unreimbursed services.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has tried to rectify the problem, with
the passage of the Mental Health Parity Act. And 26 states,
including Georgia, have put parity laws on the books. But the
bottom line is that all these laws, often hard-won in legislative
battles, are narrow in focus and don't mandate much. Most require
only that employers already offering mental health benefits be sure
the benefits are equal to traditional medical policies. And, in a
continuing problem for health consumers, the state laws don't
affect the almost 40 percent of workers who are employed by
companies that are self-insured. Those businesses, often large
corporations, are exempt from state mandates under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made much progress in this area,'' said Lei
Ellingson, assistant director of the Carter Center's mental health
program. ``Although we are finally getting some data to debunk the
theory that (parity) would be astronomically expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and employers have maintained for years that adding
mental health mandates would be too costly. The Health Insurance
Association of America has reported that any mental health mandates
would bring dramatic hikes in premiums and a 6 percent increase in
the number of uninsured, because many employers would stop offering
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But other studies, including a 1997 report in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, have concluded that insurance
mandates would increase the number of uninsured by only 0.04
percent and suggested that the cost of mental health benefits has
actually been declining.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because many workers are still hesitant to take
advantage of mental health benefits through employers, out of
concern that their bosses will find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still worried about confidentiality,'' said Pamela
Greensberg, executive director of the American Managed Behavioral
Healthcare Association. ``I think Congress needs to enact
regulations protecting medical records so everyone can feel a
little more comfortable getting the services they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, families and the doctors and other therapists who
treat them have to fend for themselves. And experts on all sides
recommend that people comb through their health insurance policies
to find the fairest deal they can in an unfair world. For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check out the co-payments and deductibles. If you discover
that you have a $500 deductible for mental health care and a $100
deductible for traditional medical treatment, you probably should
seek out another health care plan. And if your insurance is
employer-based, you should find out whether it complies with parity
laws.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you can choose the provider you want, rather than be
forced to pick a doctor or therapist from a list. And make sure the
insurer offers a range of mental health providers, such as
psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Understand the kind of provider you need. If you rely on
medications, you'll probably need regular contact with a
psychiatrist, who can prescribe drugs. On the other hand, if you're
dealing with grief, a divorce or other issues that don't require
medicine, a social worker or psychologist might be the most
appropriate provider.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you're having problems with your insurance coverage, call
the Georgia Mental Health Insurance Advocacy Center Hotline
(404-978-0316 in metro Atlanta, 1-800-933-9896 elsewhere) or
contact the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Georgia
(770-234-0855 or

 &HT;    Mental health care in Georgia: Head goes here on so many
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In six cemeteries at Central State Hospital in
Milledgeville, Ga., _ once known as the Georgia Lunatic Asylum _
almost 30,000 mentally ill patients buried in the first half of
this century finally have achieved equality in death.
</P>
<P>
   They were equally nameless, with only numbered iron stakes and
metal discs marking their graves. Many lost even that distinction
when groundskeepers in the 1960s yanked up the stakes and cast them
into thick underbrush. That made it impossible to identify the
patients, because the hospital failed to keep records of the burial
plots, though it detailed how many sheets were cleaned and how many
beans were harvested in its gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 1980s that deceased patients merited
headstones in the hospital's newest cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unknown humans, shunned when living, deprived of their very
names in death _ and literally only known to God'' is how Joe
Ingram, the hospital's lead attendant for 50 years, described the
patients in a historical account titled ``But for the Grace of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia advocates for the mentally ill, the markers are a
silent reminder of one of modern medicine's darkest corners. As
U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on Monday unveiled a historic
report on the mental health of Americans, advocates noted that the
status of mentally ill Georgians is much improved from what it once
was, thanks to scientific research, better medical treatment,
bulldog advocacy and strong legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many good things have happened recently to help
Georgia's consumers,'' said Cynthia Wainscott, executive director
of the National Mental Health Association of Georgia. ``We are
definitely seeing improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   But people with mental illnesses still encounter plenty of
problems and an abiding social stigma that victims of other
illnesses don't face, advocates note. Public and political
attention to mental health issues has not kept pace with growing
attention to AIDS, cancer, heart disease and other physical
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Georgia Department of Human Resources' budget
for mental health services, which include programs for mental
retardation and substance abuse, has been reduced by 11 percent _ a
total of more than $30 million _ over the past four years. The
state still doesn't offer enough residential and community day
programs, advocates say, with many of the mentally ill simply
landing in homeless shelters, hospitals or jails. And when surveyed
this year, more than 300 Georgia mental health care users and their
family members gave community mental health services an average
grade of ``D'' when asked to rank the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about the (surgeon general's) report is it
is an answer to our cry for attention,'' said Shannon Scheels, the
Georgia executive director of the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill. ``Mental illness is real, it can be treated and there
is new hope for the future. If we had any complaints, it would only
be why did this acknowledgement take so long?''
</P>
<P>
   Until this decade, Scheels said, mental illness was not
routinely recognized as a biological condition, but rather
something akin to a character flaw. An abundance of scientific and
medical research in recent decades has challenged that view, with
many studies linking mental illnesses to brain function and
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   But while science has shown that early diagnosis and treatment,
ranging from drugs to counseling and other therapies, can be very
effective in combating mental illness, the traditional stigma
associated with mental problems persists. And while treatments for
heart disease and cancer are routinely covered by insurers and
government agencies, they rarely pay for mental health care with
the same loosened purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   Significant strides made In recent years, Georgians have made
significant strides in gaining equality in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Legislature enacted a parity act. Under that
law, if an employer offers mental health benefits, they must be
equal to other medical coverage. For example, if there's a $1
million lifetime benefit for traditional medical coverage, the same
must exist for mental health coverage. But the law is limited: Like
other states' parity acts, it does not apply to companies that are
self-insured, meaning it doesn't protect workers for most large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Medicaid began to offer its members access to newer
medications, under new federal regulations. Now, doctors who don't
prescribe the latest drugs, which have fewer side effects, must
explain why.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgia is cited as a national model for its ``20 by 2000''
program. The program was designed to get 20 percent of people with
mental illnesses or retardation who attend state-sponsored day
programs into jobs, such as sales representatives, clerks,
receptionists or drivers, said Larry Fricks, director of the Office
of Consumer Relations in the Department of Human Resources' mental
health division. This year, that equals more than 4,000 Georgians
with mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks, who himself was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, also
known as manic-depression, in 1989, told his story of struggle with
mental illness in Washington on Monday, as part of the surgeon
general's press conference. ``People used to think if you had a
mental illness, you couldn't work,'' Fricks said. ``We've learned,
with the proper medication, work is a treatment, and you'll have
fewer symptoms and move into crisis less frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the state also has shifted its resources.
Traditionally, the bulk of state money for mental health has been
spent on hospital care, which served almost 20,000 patients last
year. Now, most funds are being spent on community programs, with
more than 23,000 participating in day programs and almost 24,000
living in state-supported residential programs. Thirteen regional
boards also oversee the 212 community centers' activities, with
half of those boards including consumer advocates and patients'
family members. Problems still abound
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates say that daily life remains a challenge for
Georgians with mental illness and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all looks so much better on paper and in theory than it
sounds when you answer our statewide helpline and hear the problems
on the other end,'' Sheels said.
</P>
<P>
   Treating the mentally ill often involves a complicated network
of caseworkers, medication, therapy and support systems that extend
far beyond clinic walls. Often, agencies and individuals are simply
asked to do too much with too little funding or resources, experts
say. Too often, they say, the mentally ill are discharged from
hospitals too soon or released from jail without any treatment.
Because there is such a scarcity of community programs, those most
in need of care often become homeless or repeatedly return to
hospitals and jails.
</P>
<P>
   Scheels said one indicator of the need is the calls taken at
NAMI's statewide helpline. More than half of callers are seeking
community support. And she points to a NAMI survey about
satisfaction with community mental health services. On nine factors
_ ranging from housing to vocational rehabilitation to case
management _ respondents gave an average score of 1.75 on a 1-to-5
scale, with 1 being the lowest grade.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates say progress is being made, with efforts under way
to fix the wrongs _ even the historic ones. Last week, the
Smithsonian Inst in Washington asked Georgia officials to
let it use one of the iron stakes from Central State Hospital,
along with a description of the person it represents, as part of a
display celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network began
tracking down Central State patient names and burial locations _ a
mammoth task considering that not only were numbered markers tossed
aside, but the same numbers were often used and then reused for
different people.
</P>
<P>
   The group also hopes to erect a bronze angel to guard over the
graves. ``And to remind society,'' Fricks said, ``to never, ever
allow something like this to happen again.''

 &HT;    Newsweek salutes WWII's ordinary Americans
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a refreshingly unique look back at the century, Newsweek
($3.50) uses quotes and vintage cartoons to pay tribute to the
ordinary Americans who made history. As editor at large Kenneth
Auchincloss notes in his introduction, the greatest heroes of the
last 100 years were the GIs of Bill Mauldin's World War II
cartoons. ``They are definitely not Rough Riders, or Sergeant York,
or John Wayne. Yet Willie and Joe .... became the indelible symbol
of the U.S. war effort.'' Among the other ``ordinary''Americans on
Newsweek's list of heroes are the suffragists, the foot soldiers of
the civil rights movement, the antiwar brigades, the feminists and
the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Highs and lows: Excerpts from Time's ($3.50) exclusive cover
story on the Columbine High School tapes have already been widely
reported, but the entire package should be must reading for any
parent. Also of note are Time's annual lists of the best and worst
in entertainment and sports. Top choices include ``All About My
Mother'' (cinema), ``The Sopranos'' (television), Rage Against the
Machine (music), ``Personal Injuries'' and ``Home Town'' (books),
``The Iceman Cometh'' (theater) and the USA women's soccer team
(sports).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Portrait of a year: Life ($4.99) provides some unforgettable
images of 1999, from the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and the
shootings at Columbine High School to the women's soccer team's
victory and the retirement of Wayne Gretzky. Accompanying the
photographs are the personal stories of Patrick Ireland, the boy
who flung himself out of the window at Columbine, and 6-year-old
Zyrjete Korqa, who fled Kosovo to find refuge in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The price of prosperity: Maybe it's not our imagination after
all. Americans are working harder and longer, according to U.S.
News &AMP; World Report ($3.50). Studies show that between 1977 and
1997, the average workweek lengthened from 43 to 47 hours and the
number of workers putting in 50 hours or more a week jumped from 24
percent to 37 percent. The upside is that prosperity is at an
all-time high. The downside? Few families are able to sit down to a
quiet, home-cooked dinner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pulp goddess: Before Danielle Steel and Jackie Collins there
was Jacqueline Susann, the best-selling author of ``Valley of the
Dolls.'' On the eve of a new Bette Midler film about Susann, Vanity
Fair ($3.95) profiles the woman who launched the forerunner of
today's book tour and shamelessly promoted her steamy novels. When
the manuscript for ``Valley of the Dolls'' was submitted to Berney
Geis, the editorial staff marched into his office and begged him
not to publish this ``literary trash.'' His wife overruled them,
however, and told Geis, ``I feel like I picked up the phone and I
was listening in on a conversation of women talking about how their
husbands are in bed. Who would hang up on a conversation like
that?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Going Hollywood? Speculation already abounds about the
successor to Jack Valenti when he retires as head of the Motion
Picture Association of America. One possibility, according to The
New Yorker ($3), is Bill Clinton. Valenti acknowledges that the job
calls for someone who is adept at politics or diplomacy like Henry
Kissinger _ or Clinton. The president would be ``great,'' Valenti
says, ``but he does bring a little baggage with him.'' The job does
have perks that would appeal to Clinton because, Valenti adds, ``if
you're in the insurance business or run the New York Stock
Exchange, you're not around beautiful women every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: In an interview with Ebony ($2.50), Puff Daddy,
the head of Bad Boy Entertainment, discusses his new love, Jennifer
Lopez, his new album, ``Forever'' and his new clothing line, Sean
John.... What is it like to be touched by an Oprah? People ($2.99)
talks with the authors whose lives have been changed by the TV
host. North Carolina writer Kaye Gibbons used part of the windfall
from Oprah's Book Club to spend a year and a half just being a
mother to her three girls. Alabama novelist Melinda Haynes, who
initially intended to keep living in her five-room trailer, soon
abandoned that notion when ``Mother of Pearl'' became a best
seller. ``I suddenly wanted a house with a doorbell,'' she says.

 &HT;    Insurers often look askance at mental care
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wayne Fisher, director of the Marcus Behavior Center in Atlanta,
treats youngsters with severe behavioral problems. Some of them _
infants and toddlers _ won't eat. Others, usually adolescents, are
violent. But Fisher has found a therapy, called applied behavior
analysis, that works well for both groups.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about the same length of time. It costs the same. And,
most importantly, it has about the same success rate _ around 80
percent, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the bills are submitted to health insurance companies,
the similarities end. While insurers accept the cost of the
infants' care in about 90 percent of cases, they approve the price
of the adolescents' care only about 20 percent of the time, Fisher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the adolescents' problems fall into the murky realm
of mental illness, a field of medicine where routine discrimination
is condoned and defended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that as people become more aware of the situation,
families who have a mentally ill member can push harder to get the
services they need,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the mentally ill say that, while the U.S. surgeon
general's report issued Monday is a step in the right direction,
it's unlikely to change the daily hassles faced by one in four
American families every year when members need mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how frustrating it is to deal with the
financial and insurance end of things,'' said Suzanne Broder, whose
36-year-old son, Chris Byrd, is diagnosed with schizo-affective
disorder. ``It's an extremely unfair situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because most employers and insurers still don't offer
equal benefits, or ``parity,'' when it comes to mental illness.
Although a person might have a $1 million lifetime benefit for
medical bills such as heart surgery or leukemia treatment, it's
rare that he or she would have such a benefit for schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, for example, held private insurance for more than a
decade, but he had no outpatient mental health benefits and a
$10,000 lifetime cap on inpatient services. That was exceeded
during his first hospitalization and, since then, his family has
spent at least another $10,000 on unreimbursed services.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has tried to rectify the problem, with
the passage of the Mental Health Parity Act. And 26 states,
including Georgia, have put parity laws on the books. But the
bottom line is that all these laws, often hard-won in legislative
battles, are narrow in focus and don't mandate much. Most require
only that employers already offering mental health benefits be sure
the benefits are equal to traditional medical policies. And, in a
continuing problem for health consumers, the state laws don't
affect the almost 40 percent of workers who are employed by
companies that are self-insured. Those businesses, often large
corporations, are exempt from state mandates under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made much progress in this area,'' said Lei
Ellingson, assistant director of the Carter Center's mental health
program. ``Although we are finally getting some data to debunk the
theory that (parity) would be astronomically expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and employers have maintained for years that adding
mental health mandates would be too costly. The Health Insurance
Association of America has reported that any mental health mandates
would bring dramatic hikes in premiums and a 6 percent increase in
the number of uninsured, because many employers would stop offering
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But other studies, including a 1997 report in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, have concluded that insurance
mandates would increase the number of uninsured by only 0.04
percent and suggested that the cost of mental health benefits has
actually been declining.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because many workers are still hesitant to take
advantage of mental health benefits through employers, out of
concern that their bosses will find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still worried about confidentiality,'' said Pamela
Greensberg, executive director of the American Managed Behavioral
Healthcare Association. ``I think Congress needs to enact
regulations protecting medical records so everyone can feel a
little more comfortable getting the services they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, families and the doctors and other therapists who
treat them have to fend for themselves. And experts on all sides
recommend that people comb through their health insurance policies
to find the fairest deal they can in an unfair world. For example:

<P>
   &QR;  Check out the co-payments and deductibles. If you discover
that you have a $500 deductible for mental health care and a $100
deductible for traditional medical treatment, you probably should
seek out another health care plan. And if your insurance is
employer-based, you should find out whether it complies with parity
laws.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you can choose the provider you want, rather than be
forced to pick a doctor or therapist from a list. And make sure the
insurer offers a range of mental health providers, such as
psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Understand the kind of provider you need. If you rely on
medications, you'll probably need regular contact with a
psychiatrist, who can prescribe drugs. On the other hand, if you're
dealing with grief, a divorce or other issues that don't require
medicine, a social worker or psychologist might be the most
appropriate provider.

 &HT;    Mental health care in Georgia: Head goes here on so many
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In six cemeteries at Central State Hospital in
Milledgeville, Ga., _ once known as the Georgia Lunatic Asylum _
almost 30,000 mentally ill patients buried in the first half of
this century finally have achieved equality in death.
</P>
<P>
   They were equally nameless, with only numbered iron stakes and
metal discs marking their graves. Many lost even that distinction
when groundskeepers in the 1960s yanked up the stakes and cast them
into thick underbrush. That made it impossible to identify the
patients, because the hospital failed to keep records of the burial
plots, though it detailed how many sheets were cleaned and how many
beans were harvested in its gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 1980s that deceased patients merited
headstones in the hospital's newest cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unknown humans, shunned when living, deprived of their very
names in death _ and literally only known to God'' is how Joe
Ingram, the hospital's lead attendant for 50 years, described the
patients in a historical account titled ``But for the Grace of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia advocates for the mentally ill, the markers are a
silent reminder of one of modern medicine's darkest corners. As
U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on Monday unveiled a historic
report on the mental health of Americans, advocates noted that the
status of mentally ill Georgians is much improved from what it once
was, thanks to scientific research, better medical treatment,
bulldog advocacy and strong legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many good things have happened recently to help
Georgia's consumers,'' said Cynthia Wainscott, executive director
of the National Mental Health Association of Georgia. ``We are
definitely seeing improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   But people with mental illnesses still encounter plenty of
problems and an abiding social stigma that victims of other
illnesses don't face, advocates note. Public and political
attention to mental health issues has not kept pace with growing
attention to AIDS, cancer, heart disease and other physical
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Georgia Department of Human Resources' budget
for mental health services, which include programs for mental
retardation and substance abuse, has been reduced by 11 percent _ a
total of more than $30 million _ over the past four years. The
state still doesn't offer enough residential and community day
programs, advocates say, with many of the mentally ill simply
landing in homeless shelters, hospitals or jails. And when surveyed
this year, more than 300 Georgia mental health care users and their
family members gave community mental health services an average
grade of ``D'' when asked to rank the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about the (surgeon general's) report is it
is an answer to our cry for attention,'' said Shannon Scheels, the
Georgia executive director of the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill. ``Mental illness is real, it can be treated and there
is new hope for the future. If we had any complaints, it would only
be why did this acknowledgement take so long?''
</P>
<P>
   Until this decade, Scheels said, mental illness was not
routinely recognized as a biological condition, but rather
something akin to a character flaw. An abundance of scientific and
medical research in recent decades has challenged that view, with
many studies linking mental illnesses to brain function and
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   But while science has shown that early diagnosis and treatment,
ranging from drugs to counseling and other therapies, can be very
effective in combating mental illness, the traditional stigma
associated with mental problems persists. And while treatments for
heart disease and cancer are routinely covered by insurers and
government agencies, they rarely pay for mental health care with
the same loosened purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   Significant strides made In recent years, Georgians have made
significant strides in gaining equality in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Legislature enacted a parity act. Under that
law, if an employer offers mental health benefits, they must be
equal to other medical coverage. For example, if there's a $1
million lifetime benefit for traditional medical coverage, the same
must exist for mental health coverage. But the law is limited: Like
other states' parity acts, it does not apply to companies that are
self-insured, meaning it doesn't protect workers for most large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Medicaid began to offer its members access to newer
medications, under new federal regulations. Now, doctors who don't
prescribe the latest drugs, which have fewer side effects, must
explain why.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgia is cited as a national model for its ``20 by 2000''
program. The program was designed to get 20 percent of people with
mental illnesses or retardation who attend state-sponsored day
programs into jobs, such as sales representatives, clerks,
receptionists or drivers, said Larry Fricks, director of the Office
of Consumer Relations in the Department of Human Resources' mental
health division. This year, that equals more than 4,000 Georgians
with mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks, who himself was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, also
known as manic-depression, in 1989, told his story of struggle with
mental illness in Washington on Monday, as part of the surgeon
general's press conference. ``People used to think if you had a
mental illness, you couldn't work,'' Fricks said. ``We've learned,
with the proper medication, work is a treatment, and you'll have
fewer symptoms and move into crisis less frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the state also has shifted its resources.
Traditionally, the bulk of state money for mental health has been
spent on hospital care, which served almost 20,000 patients last
year. Now, most funds are being spent on community programs, with
more than 23,000 participating in day programs and almost 24,000
living in state-supported residential programs. Thirteen regional
boards also oversee the 212 community centers' activities, with
half of those boards including consumer advocates and patients'
family members. Problems still abound
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates say that daily life remains a challenge for
Georgians with mental illness and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all looks so much better on paper and in theory than it
sounds when you answer our statewide helpline and hear the problems
on the other end,'' Sheels said.
</P>
<P>
   Treating the mentally ill often involves a complicated network
of caseworkers, medication, therapy and support systems that extend
far beyond clinic walls. Often, agencies and individuals are simply
asked to do too much with too little funding or resources, experts
say. Too often, they say, the mentally ill are discharged from
hospitals too soon or released from jail without any treatment.
Because there is such a scarcity of community programs, those most
in need of care often become homeless or repeatedly return to
hospitals and jails.
</P>
<P>
   Scheels said one indicator of the need is the calls taken at
NAMI's statewide helpline. More than half of callers are seeking
community support. And she points to a NAMI survey about
satisfaction with community mental health services. On nine factors
_ ranging from housing to vocational rehabilitation to case
management _ respondents gave an average score of 1.75 on a 1-to-5
scale, with 1 being the lowest grade.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates say progress is being made, with efforts under way
to fix the wrongs _ even the historic ones. Last week, the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington asked Georgia officials to
let it use one of the iron stakes from Central State Hospital,
along with a description of the person it represents, as part of a
display celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network began
tracking down Central State patient names and burial locations _ a
mammoth task considering that not only were numbered markers tossed
aside, but the same numbers were often used and then reused for
different people.
</P>
<P>
   The group also hopes to erect a bronze angel to guard over the
graves. ``And to remind society,'' Fricks said, ``to never, ever
allow something like this to happen again.''

 &HT;    MENTAL HEALTH GROUPS HAIL SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a report hailed by mental health advocacy
groups, Surgeon General David Satcher warned Monday that most
mentally ill Americans fail to receive treatment despite two
decades of revolutionary advances in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the 51st on national health issues by surgeons
general but the first dealing with mental illness, notes that
diseases such as depression, schizophrenia and eating disorders can
be as disabling and serious as cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``While mental disorders may touch all Americans, either
directly or indirectly, all do not have equal access to treatment
and service,'' Satcher said at a White House news conference. ``We
need to ensure that mental health services are as widely available
as other services in the continuously changing health care delivery
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe and effective options are available to treat mental
disorders that affect one in five Americans, Satcher said, yet
nearly half of all Americans with severe mental illness fail to
seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report does not advocate specific policy changes,
it notes that ``the complex and fragmented mental health service
delivery system'' creates barriers to treatment. It also points to
financial barriers such as lack of health insurance ``parity'' for
mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-page publication defines mental disorders as diagnosable
conditions that impair thinking, feeling and behavior and interfere
with a person's capacity to be productive and enjoy fulfilling
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The definition encompasses mental and brain problems of varying
severity: depression, schizophrenia, manic depressive (bipolar)
illness, anxiety disorders, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, autism and others.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Satcher in releasing the report were Tipper Gore, wife
of Vice President Al Gore, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala and Larry Fricks, a Georgia state Division of Mental
Health official.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks brought a group of about 100 representatives of mental
health advocacy groups to their feet in a standing ovation with a
description of his own recovery from mental illness, as well his
grandmother's unsuccessful effort to cope with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks said the report's ``most important impact'' would be to
help eliminate the stigma of mental disease ``so that people like
my grandmother will not waste their lives in self-imposed
isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said Mrs. Gore, who serves as President Clinton's
adviser on mental health, originally suggested a surgeon general's
report on mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health groups expressed hope it would stimulate greater
public spending on mental health problems and greater public
awareness of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon general puts mental health where it belongs: as a
cornerstone of public health,'' said Michael Faenza, president of
the National Mental Health Association. ``This historic report
makes clear that mental health is integral to individuals' and the
nation's health and should not be relegated to the sidelines of
health care and public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the report will not be worth the paper it is
printed on if its messages are not put into practice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill, said the report documented a health crisis but
added that it would be ``waste of taxpayer dollars unless it
becomes a foundation for action. What matters most is deeds, not
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Beson, president of the St. Cloud, Minn.-based National
Association for Rural Mental Health, said, ``Our hope is that this
report will raise the level of dialogue throughout the country on a
variety of mental health issues. We hope one of them will be rural
mental health, which is an area that doesn't get a lot of attention
and is extremely lacking in resources.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, software engineer Eric Raymond was a
lonely voice crying in the wilderness. Last week, the Malvern, Pa.,
resident became rich enough to buy his own forest.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stallman, the renowned Cambridge, Mass. software
designer, also could have cashed in, but he turned down the chance
as a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Stallman are friends, rivals, and leaders of the
most powerful movement in the computer business this year, one that
poses a serious threat to the power of software titan Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``open source'' or ``free software,'' depending on
whether you ask Raymond or Stallman. And the differences in those
two terms helps explain why Raymond is a millionaire and Stallman
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman, the intellectual godfather of the movement, helped to
create the world's best-known open source product, the GNU/Linux
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman believes that all software should be ``free.'' That
doesn't mean he objects to selling software. Stallman means that
once someone buys a program, he should be able to make as many
copies as he likes and give them away without fear of being charged
with software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Stallman says that all software should
include the ``source code'' _ the actual instructions as written by
the programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all commercial software comes in machine-readable form,
but source code isn't included because that would let users see how
the program works. Stallman says that software users have a
fundamental right to this knowledge, and he absolutely refuses to
use any software that doesn't include source codes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he turned down the chance to invest in two red-hot
GNU/Linux companies: Red Hat Inc., a North Carolina firm that
distributes and services a version of GNU/Linux; and VA Linux
Systems Inc., a California company that makes computers that run
GNU/Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies include some ``non-free'' software with their
products, and Stallman felt that ownership of their stock would
fatally compromise his principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't entirely happy with what these companies were doing,
and it would put me in a compromised position,'' Stallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond has a far more flexible view of the world. He helped
coin the term ``open source'' because he believes that calling it
``free software'' scares off corporate investors. Raymond doesn't
mind the inclusion of closed source software with GNU/Linux
systems, and so he gladly accepted 150,000 shares of VA Linux stock
and a seat on the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux went public Thursday, and its stock enjoyed the biggest
first-day run-up in stock-market history, rising from 30 a share at
the opening to close at 239 1/4. In 6 1/2 hours, Raymond earned a
paper fortune of roughly $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning surge in GNU/Linux-related stocks is based on the
perception that computer-industry leaders now take open-source
software very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software has always been cheap; Red Hat's version of
GNU/Linux can actually be downloaded over the Internet for free.
And open source has a strong reputation for high quality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, over half the world's Web servers use Apache, a
free open-source program for distributing Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   But now numerous companies hope to make money by providing
service and support to users of open-source products. That's the
business model for Red Hat. Buy the company's software, and you're
paying for customer support to keep your GNU/Linux system running.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy operating systems,'' said Red Hat chief
executive Matthew Szulik. ``They buy solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux systems can be difficult to set up. VA Linux Systems
solves that problem by peddling powerful computers with open-source
software preinstalled and ready to run. The company's server
computers are popular with businesses that want to establish
high-quality Web sites running Apache and GNU/Linux.
</P>
<P>
   But VA Linux will face tough competition. Nearly every major
computer maker, including IBM Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., now
sells machines with GNU/Linux preinstalled.
</P>
<P>
   Another of last week's hottest newly public firms, Acton-based
Andover.net, runs a network of advertiser-supported Web sites that
provide information, software, and advice to the open-source
community.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known of the company's sites is Slashdot, where
open-source users from around the world share information and
debate ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of market opportunities whenever there's a new
operating system,'' said Andover.net chief executive Bruce
Twickler. Just as the rise of Windows led to lucrative sales of
Windows-oriented magazines and books, Twickler thinks the rise of
GNU/Linux and other open-source software will ensure a large
on-line audience for Andover.net's sites.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market agrees. Andover.net went public on Wednesday at
18 a share. The stock rose as high as 83 5/8 and closed Friday at
67 1/2, giving the firm a market capitalization of just over $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman, whose firm belief in free software started it all,
says he's not sorry to have missed out on the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if I'm broke,'' he says. And while he's not sorry
to see his friend Raymond cashing in, he regrets Raymond's
willingness to compromise on the principles of free software.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's setting a bad example,'' Stallman says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Raymond says his new wealth won't change him much,
because he doesn't much care about money anyway. He's a musician
and an avid gun buff who holds ``Geeks With Guns'' parties for
other programmers at shooting ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay published Friday on Slashdot (www.slashdot.org),
Raymond said he plans to buy a cell phone, a new flute, ``and maybe
a nice hotrodded match-grade .45 semi for tactical shooting. But
really I don't want or need a lot of stuff. I'm kind of Buddhist
that way.''

and just two days before talks begin in Washington _ Israel's

``Catch-22,'' the darkly comic 1961 novel that became a universal

He was 76. The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Valerie, said.
By Richard Severo and Herbert Mitgang.
</P>
<P>
   NY-TRANSIT-STRIKE (New York) _ As the city opened its emergency

Giuliani said Monday that he would wait 24 more hours before going
to court to try to stop the threatened walkout. By Elizabeth
Bumiller.

   NY-LOUIMA-VOLPE (New York) _ After tearfully pleading for mercy

brutalization that he said also harmed the city as a whole. By

bonuses, up 20 percent from last year. Pay packages above $10
million are no longer rare. Yet among Wall Street professionals
whose incomes still astound the rest of America, the mood has
changed. One top trader bemoans the ``opportunity cost'' of
remaining a financier in the Internet age. (The Marketplace

DSL DEVELOPER GETS $70 MILLION CAPITAL INFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen and a Denver
telecommunications investor are putting $70 million into
HarvardNet, a growing competitor for Bell Atlantic offering Digital
Subscriber Line fast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The investment will cover HarvardNet's cash needs for six to
nine months as it continues building out a DSL network throughout
Bell Atlantic territory. It has helped the Charlestown, Mass.
company hold off an initial public offering planned in August
before the market for technology stocks briefly soured.
</P>
<P>
   DSL technology exploits unused capacity on standard copper
telephone wires to allow Internet access 50 to 200 times faster
than dial-up modems, without requiring expensive new wiring. Bell
Atlantic has said it will have the service available throughout
Eastern Massachusetts by month's end, but has faced scattered
complaints of bureaucratic delays and installation headaches.
</P>
<P>
   HarvardNet sells to small and medium-sized businesses. It has
rolled out service in more than 100 New England communities and
recently became the first DSL provider on Cape Cod. It has 700
customers to date and expects thousands within months.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who has been a bullish investor in both DSL and cable
modem technology for fast Net access, and Denver-based Donald L.
Sturm of The Sturm Group will invest $70 million in the firm and
take three seats on the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the fortunate position of picking who we want to
invest,'' HarvardNet president Mark Washburn said Monday. While
``more than a handful'' of parties wanted to take a stake in the
company, ``We picked the investors that were more than just
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's Vulcan Ventures Inc. in Bellevue, Wash., has stakes in a
host of Internet content and delivery companies, No. 4 US cable
television company Charter Communications, and telecommunications
firms such as NorthPoint Communications and Allegiance Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Sturm, as a top executive with Nebraska construction company
Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., led the company's efforts to invest in MFS
Communications, a fiber-optic carrier that MCI WorldCom bought in
1996 for $14.4 billion. Sturm is a top investor in MCI WorldCom and
Level 3 Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While working to add DSL equipment to all 630 Bell Atlantic
``central offices'' from Maine to Virginia, HarvardNet is also
building four ``web-hosting'' sites, the first of which has opened
in Charlestown, where it rents equipment and services for companies
to maintain a World Wide Web page. Three more are planned in New
York, Philadelphia and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn said the company will have equipment in 129 central
offices by the end of the month. ``As of today our focus is (only)
on Bell Atlantic territory'' from Maine to West Virginia, Washburn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn said the company estimates it will cost $300 million to
finish its network and that it will need another $200 million from
investors. Company spokeswoman Susan Shelby said the company
withdrew its planned $125 million IPO in September, but plans to
reapply to sell shares sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   One current limitation to DSL is that subscribers must be within
three miles of a phone company central office that Bell Atlantic,
HarvardNet or another company has outfitted with the necessary
equipment. Even then, some subscribers within three miles of a
central office cannot get the service because of limitations in the
Bell Atlantic network.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors backing HarvardNet, which does not expect to
become profitable for some time, include Fidelity Investments'
venture arm, Osborn Capital and Media/Communications Partners of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $70 million investment, Sturm and colleague Eric
Grabli and Vulcan's Dino Vendetti will be joining HarvardNet's
board of directors.

CMGI, COMPAQ TO DEVELOP NET SERVICES FOR SHANGHAI

<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. is staking another early claim in the Chinese Internet
market, as it joins with Compaq Computer Corp. to form a joint
venture with a Shanghai Internet firm.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI and Compaq have signed a memorandum of understanding with
Shanghai Information Investment Inc., a venture firm funded by the
Chinese government. SII holds controlling stakes in Internet
backbones and broadband services in Shanghai. Now SII will join
with CMGI and Compaq to create a joint venture that will run a
variety of Internet services in China. The three firms also plan to
invest in attractive Chinese Internet startups, just as CMGI has
invested in dozens of such companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No money has changed hands yet, and Bill White, CMGI's executive
vice president of marketing said that the final shape of the
alliance hasn't been settled. But White said the deal will help
secure the Andover, Mass. company's access to an Internet market
that eventually could become the biggest on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful in China, you need partnerships to help you
negotiate the government and commercial relationships,'' said
White.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup survey taken in September found that only one in 10
Chinese has ever used a computer, and only 14 percent of Chinese
citizens have even heard of the Internet. But that still works out
to about 175 million people, a huge market by any standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is an ideal market for companies to get into,'' said
Steven B. Frankel, an analyst with Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston.
``You want to be there ahead of saturation.''
</P>
<P>
   This is CMGI's second China deal of the year. In September, the
company gave $350 million in stock for shares of equal value in
Pacific Century CyberWorks Limited of Hong Kong. As with the SII
deal, CMGI will work with Pacific Century CyberWorks to seek out
promising Internet investments in China.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI stock soared $17 9/16 to $211 5/8 on the Nasdaq stock
exchange. Compaq stock was unchanged at $25 1/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    Home Depot says yes to Apex Supply buy
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot has agreed to buy Atlanta-based Apex Supply
Co., a longtime distributor of plumbing and related products.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said Monday it would pay cash for Apex's 21 locations
in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Terms of the deal weren't
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition makes clear Home Depot's intentions to court the
professional builder market. In recent years, the Atlanta-based
retailer has been expanding services to small and medium-sized
contractors to augment its core home improvement business.
</P>
<P>
   With Apex, Home Depot can reach a much larger commercial
customer. For example, Apex sells plumbing products to major
builders of apartment complexes, office buildings and shopping
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are customers we normally don't see in a Home Depot
store,'' said Andy McKenna, senior vice president of strategic
business development. ``The focus inside the store has been the
smaller contractor, but this enables us to go beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its strength in plumbing, Apex is a major
Southeastern distributor of heating and air conditioning products.
It also sells appliances and cabinets to professional builders.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities called the
acquisition a smart move. ``In the total scheme of Home Depot, this
is not a large acquisition, but it allows them to test and
understand the professional market better,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first place (professionals) go is a supply house,'' Hood
noted. ``The relationships the supply houses have established with
the professionals are very difficult to break...''
</P>
<P>
   At Apex, such relationships have been developed by the Rodbell
family, who founded the company 50 years ago. The Rodbells will
continue to manage the company but will report to McKenna.
</P>
<P>
   While Apex will keep its name and operate as a subsidiary of
Home Depot, eventually the retailer hopes to incorporate some of
Apex's business into the stores.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Home Depot will be able to fill special orders on
some products faster, and it may stock some Apex products in Home
Depot stores. Large contractors would continue to get their
products directly from Apex, McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   This is Home Depot's second acquisition of an Atlanta-based
company this year. In June, the retailer bought specialty retailer
Georgia Lighting.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sexual abuse of children would not seem the most
obvious choice of subject for a playwright looking for material for
a rollicking new comedy _ unless, of course, one is a devoted
follower of ``Sally Jessy Raphael,'' ``Oprah'' and the other
confessionals that have become the staple of daytime talk
television.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the delicacy of the topic, Jonathan Tolins plunges
headlong into those murky waters in ``If Memory Serves,'' a spoof
with serious pretensions about recovered memory and our twin
national penchants for celebrity and the public washing of dirty
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Tolins, whose ``Twilight of the Golds'' offered a superficial
treatment of a family's latent homophobia a few seasons back,
trains his sights this time on a young man coming to grips with the
possibility that his mother, a famous if faded television star, did
more than kiss him on the forehead when she came to tuck him in bed
at night. Or not. Or does it even matter?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Memory Serves'' ostensibly evolves around the character of
Diane Barrow (aptly cast and ably played by Elizabeth Ashley), once
a household name and face via her '70s sitcom, in which she played
a single parent who successfully juggled a career and motherhood,
but who is now reduced to flogging her workout video and watching
herself in late-night reruns with cold cream on her face. But it is
her son Russell Burke (Sam Trammell) who is the real protagonist.
Russell, who has dropped out of college to find himself (he
actually says, ``I need to figure things out''), ends up in
therapy, where he begins to recall his mother's hitting him in the
head with one of her Emmys and some nighty-night kisses that
weren't all that motherly.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scenes serve as a rather prosaic introduction to
some rather stereotypical characters _ a martini-swilling gossip
columnist (Marilyn Sokol); a performance artist (Melanie Vesey) who
hopes her tale of rape by her stepfather for ``Victims Know More''
will make her famous; Diane's swishy gay secretary (Jeff Whitty);
Diane's current young hunk of a boyfriend (Ron Mathews); and
Diane's hard-drinking ex-husband (Tony Campisi). There is another
son, a married computer freak otherwise out of the picture. There
is also Russell's shrink and an ex-maid (both played by Lynda
Gravatt) whose mysterious departure from the Burke household's
employ in Russell's youth may hold a key to what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   After some stale warm-up banter that is supposed to set a comic
tone, Tolins tries to steer his play into more serious territory.
What is to be said about a culture that uses sexual abuse of
children as entertainment? Is personal scandal acceptable if it
leads to an interview by Barbara Walters or a movie contract?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the play never fulfills its ambition. No sooner
does Tolins sidle up to one of these somber issues than he backs
away with a joke. (As Russell begins to get close to a vital
memory, a vision in which his mother quotes the famous line from
``Tea and Sympathy'' _ ``One day when you look back on this, and
you will ...'' _ dissolves the scene.) Occasionally, the playwright
ventures on even thinner ethical ice in suggesting that Diane
should be forgiven simply because she is a television star and
national icon.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``If Memory Serves'' is undone by the very standards
it attempts to satirize _ the shallowness of television morality.
If, as the play suggests at one point, discovering the truth
through psychoanalysis provides troubled souls a denouement for
their lives, then the second act for Tolins can only end with a
movie-of-the-week deal on which all can live happily ever after on
the residuals.
</P>
<P>
   The play has been given a smooth staging, and under Leonard
Foglia's sharp direction the action moves fast enough that one
doesn't immediately notice all the potholes and cracks in the
ethical argument over which Tolins is leading the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ashley is still a commanding presence, and she gives the
role of Diane the same vivacity she has always brought to the
stage. Husky-voiced and doe-eyed, tossing her head back to address
the flies as much as any person in her line of vision, Ms. Ashley
presents a larger-than-life star whose main concern about any
scandal is what it will do to her ratings. Trammell is a model of
confusion as Russell. Elsewhere in the generally solid cast, Ms.
Sokol's cameo as a hypocritical Hollywood agent is funny, and
Whitty manages to turn the cliche of Diane's secretary (a young gay
man who likes Judy Garland) into at least a sympathetic caricature.

&HT;        NASA WHISTLEBLOWER TOOK CONCERNS TO WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 - A NASA space shuttle expert worried for
eight years that one of the agency's centers was putting the
shuttle fleet at risk by failing to clarify and update safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Now those worries are getting the highest sort of attention -
from White House investigators. The case is the first in the
agency's history to be filed with the White House Office of Special
Counsel, a body that hears whistleblower claims for federal
agencies. The counsel forwarded the case for President Clinton's
review last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mary D. Harris, an electrical engineer at Johnson Space Center
in Houston, had a dilemma she called a ``Catch-22'': while she
couldn't prove there was a safety hazard in an area called
Electromagnetic Interference, she couldn't find any documentation
to prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Electromagnetic interference is a barrage of noise vibrations
caused by radar, radio and other signals. All the shuttle's parts
must be able to withstand the noise vibrations that are floating
around the earth's atmosphere. The problem is similar to the reason
airline passengers are barred from using electronic devices that
might interfere with the airplane's radar and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Harris claimed neither she, nor her colleagues, could prove how
much electromagnetic interference the shuttle could withstand
before a part failed because the tests hadn't been conducted in
years, and much of the documentation about it was missing from
NASA's records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under what category does not knowing fall under? Safe? Or
Unsafe?'' Harris wrote in a memo forwarded to NASA investigators in
June. ``My own personal vote is to put not knowing in the unsafe
category. But I don't make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went outside of NASA and I hollered and I screamed,'' Harris
said in a phone interview from Houston. ``If something goes wrong,
no one can say I didn't do what I was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA investigators who looked into Harris' claims said in a
written response that some of Harris' arguments were sound, but
concluded at no time was the shuttle in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was worried that the radio signals could threaten the
shuttles' critical pieces - parts such as the computers and engine
components - possibly leading to premature aborting of the mission,
within minutes after launch.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said going to the special counsel was a last resort. As
early as 1989, Harris asked for a computer system to gauge how much
interference the parts could withstand. Two years later, she raised
her concerns to NASA safety officials at JSC, as well as
headquarters, but was never satisfied with their responses.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said she thought officials didn't share her concerns
because she thought they didn't believe conducting EMI tests was a
lucrative investment. Harris said if EMI did cause a launch
failure, ``they will ask me as an EMI expert why I didn't say
anything.'' She added, ``If they think they can survive without [an
EMI test], then remove it from the books and management will take
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't claim anyone had broken a law or rule. But Harris
fretted that NASA made only two EMI assessments of the shuttle
since the 1970s, the most recent after the 1986 Challenger
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of cell phones and satellite
communications, the amount of interference has increased in recent
decades. And the shuttles themselves have changed too.
</P>
<P>
   NASA investigators concluded that despite the uncertainty of its
levels, electromagnetic interference has posed no danger to the
shuttle. They drafted a response and sent it to the White House
counsel this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost 100 flights, there have never been any fundamental
EMI problems,'' said Keith Hudkins, a deputy chief engineer at NASA
who headed an investigation into Harris' allegations. That is, no
shuttle has ever malfunctioned or suffered damage from the radio
waves.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA agreed that the processes to evaluate interference were
lacking. The investigators said new tests should be applied to
future additions of parts, called for updating regulations, and
recommended that an assessment of EMI be made.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to her allegations, NASA admitted to
faulty record keeping about EMI. Although some decades-old
information appears to be lost, the agency pledged it would improve
its future documentation about EMI.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harris' complaint, ``it wasn't a high priority, there
wasn't pressure either way,'' Hudkins said. ``It is time to do it
again. We want to know the environment around our landing sites and
assure ourselves that the changes are within acceptable limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for not conducting tests more often is partly because
finding the effects of interference is no small task. It's easier
for airplanes to be tested for EMI than for a shuttle, whose flight
cannot be exactly replicated in a lab test, Hudkins said.

   One change, Hudkins said, could be adding shielding to keep
noise transmission from hurting the part. NASA will also contract
an outside group to fly planes around launch site with receivers to
test frequencies as high as 160 miles high in the environs around
the launch pad.

`ADAM BAUM AND THE JEW MOVIE': AN ECHO AT FULL VOLUME (AT LEAST) 
</HEADLINE>
 ART- NYT  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The curtain opens and the actor Ron Leibman,
impeccably attired for business, is sitting at an
impressive-looking desk working the phone. Braying, bellowing,
howling into the phone _ two phones, at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Ring any bells?
</P>
<P>
   In Daniel Goldfarb's ``Adam Baum and the Jew Movie,'' Leibman's
star turn as Sam Baum, a 1940s movie mogul in denial of his Jewish
identity, will remind many theatergoers of his Tony-winning
portrayal of Roy Cohn, the right-wing lawyer in denial over his
homosexual identity in Tony Kushner's ``Angels in America.'' Both
characters are manipulative, bullying, verbally shrewd and
egregiously self-absorbed. Both have now had their hubris brought
extravagantly to life by Leibman, whose evident delight in testing
the boundary between more than enough and too much makes him
perhaps the most effective scenery chewer on the American stage.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that in ``Angels,'' Roy Cohn was a detail in a
much larger tapestry, and in ``Adam Baum,'' a pointed but
unbalanced comedy that opened for a three-week run at the
McGinn/Cazale Theater on Dec. 12, Sam is really all there is. The
play has two other characters _ Baum's 13-year-old son, Adam, and a
writer named Gar Hampson whom Baum has hired to write a script
about anti-Semitism in America _ but they pale in his presence.
It's Sam who has the wit and the charisma, Sam who has the
interesting conflict, Sam who has the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Baum, a character based on Samuel Goldwyn, is the kind of
man for whom possessions are power and who offers to share them _
from Egyptian cotton shirts to cashews _ because it gives him
leverage, implies a debt.
</P>
<P>
   There's something just a tad threatening in everything he says
and does; when he gives his son a belly kiss, the desperation of a
father's love is palpable. Teaching Adam (Adam Lamberg), a
sweet-tempered boy prone to being teased in school, to shake hands
properly _ ``Look me in the eye, reach your hand out like a knife,
and then take my hand and shake it one, two, three'' _ he is
passing on a lesson in establishing the upper hand. It's a comic
set piece, but it's strident underneath. For Sam, human relations
are a fierce business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when they call you names at school,'' he tells his son,
``you look them in the eye, shake their hands, and they will learn
to fear and respect Adam Baum.''
</P>
<P>
   He represents a particular kind of American Jew, the stereotype
that is usually, if inaccurately, called self-hating. An Eastern
European immigrant who believes himself to be assimilated, Sam
either can't or won't hear his own thick accent and won't let his
son wear a yarmulke when he isn't in the synagogue. It's Sam's idea
that Americans _ real, Plymouth Rock-type Americans _ think of Jews
as soft, sensitive intellectuals who are committed to arcane
foreign rituals and determined to remain a tribe in the New World.
He deplores this view and feels that the way for Jews to earn
respect in America is to prove they understand the free enterprise
system and beat the Gentiles at their own game: capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   That is ostensibly why he wants to make a movie about
anti-Semitism _ because Darryl Zanuck, the Gentile head of a rival
studio, is developing his own ``Jew movie,'' ``Gentleman's
Agreement.'' It is why he hires a Gentile to write it _ because he
wants the Jews in it to seem like real Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is why he forbids Hampson even to mention World War II in his
script, an elephantine omission in 1946, when the play is set. And
it is also why, when Hampson turns in a script full of reverence
for Jewish tradition and portrays anti-Semitism as a national trait
(the president is a Jew-hater), Sam is appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gar, you have written this script as a Jew and not as a
Gentile,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his heart of hearts, there is more to Sam's Jewish
identity; this become evident in the second act, which takes place
on the day of Adam's bar mitzvah. As it happens, though, the hidden
part of Sam is the less interesting part. As written by Goldfarb,
who studied with Kushner at Juilliard, it is the antic, striving
Sam Baum that is the most captivating element of this play. And
Leibman takes full advantage as he cajoles Hampson _ with flattery
and insult, cooing and screaming _ to make changes in the script,
and bludgeons his son with affection.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big performance _ too big, probably, for the tiny stage
in this 99-seat house. And certainly too big for his onstage
colleagues to match. As Adam, Adam Lamberg is appropriately cute
and awkward (particularly in his hilariously loud, plaid bar
mitzvah suit that his father loves so much); he's supposed to be
overwhelmed by Sam, and he is. But Hampson is another story; the
irony is that in a play about a Gentile writing about Jews, the
Jewish playwright has missed the boat on his own Gentile character.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson is amusingly clueless; he gives Adam _ oy! _ a hammer
and a wrench as a bar mitzvah gift. Nonetheless determined to write
a ``true'' script, he has done his research on the Old Testament.
But his reverence for the dignity of the Jews is expressed in an
anachronistic tone that is tainted with a contemporary kind of
learned tolerance. He never apprehends that Sam's bullying, his
lording of his material success is an expression of his Jewish
pride. He openly disdains it. He's politically correct, smugly so.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a function of the age of the playwright, who is 26,
but the role isn't helped by the actor Christopher Evan Welch,
whose portrayal of Hampson is awfully slack; the character remains
polite and stammering for too long to suit the drama, too
unresistant to the battering he gets from Sam, too wimpy to possess
the artistic integrity the script attributes to him. (He's supposed
to be a hack, perhaps, but a passionate hack.) And when he finally
gets his dander up in a climactic second-act confrontation with Sam
and his own innate anti-Semitism is exposed, the anger is
manufactured, thin. When Sam tells him, exhausted from their
argument, ``I respect your strength; I do,'' you wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   It's a missed opportunity. The play succeeds as a character
portrait, but for the drama to be fulfilling, both Sam and Leibman
need a stronger foil in Hampson. What is he anyway? Chopped liver?
</P>

 &HT;    To-be freshmen testers match U.S. average, but overall average
critically poor
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The state's incoming public college freshmen recorded
a first this fall: they were the first class in University System
of Georgia history to match the national average on the Scholastic
Assessment Test.
</P>
<P>
   First-time freshmen entered the system this fall having scored
an average of 1,016 out of a possible 1,600 on the SAT, the same as
the national average, according to figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the statewide average for Georgia high schoolers
who took the SAT this year _ not just those who entered a state
public college _ was 969 this year. That average is the second
lowest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The SAT is used by college officials to help them determine who
gets admitted to their schools.
</P>
<P>
   University officials touted the SAT scores as a sign that
Georgia colleges are getting better-prepared students, including
teens who in the past might have gone out-of-state to school but
are staying because of the HOPE scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   However, other figures showing a drop in SAT scores for incoming
freshmen at two-year colleges suggest those campuses are
increasingly becoming the home for many less-qualified students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear factor is we are directing underprepared students to
two-year institutions,'' said system spokeswoman Arlethia
Perry-Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year college average dropped from 885 to 879 this fall,
while the system-wide average rose from 1,013 to 1,016.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Tech, the average for first-time college freshmen
jumped from 1,296 to 1,303, while at the University of Georgia, it
rose from 1,186 to 1,190, according to University System of Georgia
figures. Georgia State's SAT for incoming freshmen rose from 1,048
to 1,050. In 1991, it was 987.
</P>
<P>
   The average score topped 1,000 for the first time at Valdosta
State University and Georgia College and State University.
</P>
<P>
   The SAT gains came at the same time the number of first-time
freshmen rose 6.9 percent, from 30,093 in the fall 1998 to 32,180
this fall. Total enrollment in the system this fall grew 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This data documenting our highest-ever SAT scores and a
burgeoning freshman class demonstrate the success of two very
powerful policies _ the Board of Regents' 1996 decision to raise
the bar with our admissions requirements and the significant impact
of the HOPE scholarship program that keeps the best and brightest
in Georgia,'' said University System Chancellor Stephen Portch.
``Many Georgia high school students have responded to our call for
a higher level of preparation by taking the right courses and
studying hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Students who graduate high school with a 'B' average are
eligible for HOPE, which pays tuition, fees and some book costs.
However, most students fail to maintain the 'B' average in college
and lose the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The SAT scores are good news for Portch, who acknowledged
earlier this month that some four-year schools would not meet the
Board of Regents' mandate to eliminate remedial classes by 2001 for
incoming freshmen who don't meet system admissions requirements.
Thousands of students are still entering the system needing
remedial help.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming freshmen at Clayton College and State University
recorded the largest single-year SAT gain this fall, rising from
943 to 988.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's Acting President Mike Vollmer attributed the
improvement to the school's decision to implement tougher
admissions standards a year ahead of the 2001 Board of Regents
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``By implementing the 2001 admissions standards a year early,
that has raised the bar at Clayton State,'' Vollmer said.

JUSTICES MAY FAVOR LAW LIMITING ACCESS TO ACCIDENT RECORDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday resuscitated a Kentucky
privacy statute that prevents the names and addresses of
car-accident victims from being given to chiropractors, auto-repair
shops and other business solicitors.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas statute, with some similarities, is in limbo due to a
state court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in a brief instruction, told the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati to reconsider its decision to strike
down the Kentucky law as an unconstitutional restraint on the right
of businesses to speak freely.
</P>
<P>
   The high court also instructed the 6th Circuit to consider, in
its deliberations, the justices' Dec. 7 ruling that a similar
California law is constitutional. That California statute, designed
to protect the privacy of people arrested, prohibits police from
giving the addresses of arrestees to anyone who plans to sell the
information or use the data to market services to them.
</P>
<P>
   By linking the Kentucky law to the valid California statute, the
justices indicated in their instruction that laws limiting access
to accident records might also be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling that the Kentucky law is constitutional would bode well
for the 1997 Texas statute, now in legal limbo. The Texas law, like
Kentucky's, would limit public access to the addresses of people
involved in car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas statute, which has not taken effect due to a
state-court challenge, would require people seeking accident
information to provide the name of a person involved in the
collision as well as the date or location of the mishap. The law is
designed to safeguard the privacy of accident victims and protect
them from being inundated with business solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Daily Newspaper Association and the Texas Press
Association have challenged the law as violating the First
Amendment right of free press.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County District Judge Paul Davis Jr. has enjoined the
state from enforcing the law until he issues a ruling on its
constitutionality. He will hear arguments on the law's validity
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1994 Kentucky law, police may give accident reports
only to victims, their lawyers and their insurers. Media outlets
are permitted to get the reports if they use the information for
its news value only.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, chiropractors and a publisher challenged the law as
restricting their free speech.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 6th Circuit agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the 6th Circuit rejected arguments from the
law's supporters that it was necessary to protect the privacy of
accident victims. If privacy were truly the statute's goal,
lawmakers would have barred news organizations from having access
to the accident records, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The law's supporters then appealed to the Supreme Court.

   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows

proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.

   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;

all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.

<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL;

   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

 TITLE: ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War: 
 The World War II Editorial Cartoons of
 Theodor Seuss Geisel''  
 Text by Richard H. Minear  (The New Press,
 $25)
 &HT;     By DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:

Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.

   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch

   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

JOSEPH HELLER, `CATCH-22' AUTHOR, DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla.)  (Eds: A shorter version of this obituary, slugged OBIT-HELLER-S,
will be sent also.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO and HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Heller, the author of ``Catch-22,'' the darkly comic 1961
novel whose title became a universal metaphor not only for the
insanity of war but for the madness of life, died on Sunday night
at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Valerie, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22'' was Heller's first book, preceding such
well-regarded novels as ``Something Happened, ``Good as Gold'' and
``God Knows,'' as well as two memoirs and several plays. But as
good as his other works were, they were always viewed less
favorably than ``Catch-22,'' which became an American classic,
selling more than 10 million copies in the United States, read in
many of the world's languages, and turned into a 1970 film by Mike
Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist E.L. Doctorow told The Associated Press on Monday:
``When `Catch-22' came out, people were saying, `Well, World War II
wasn't like this.' But when we got tangled up in Vietnam, it became
a sort of text for the consciousness of that time. They say fiction
can't change anything, but it can certainly organize a generation's
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22'' was based on Heller's experiences as a bombardier
with the 12th Air Force in the Mediterranean in World War II. The
novel is about a bombardier named John Yossarian, who believes his
ambitious, mean-spirited commanding officers are more dangerous
than the Germans. To avoid flying more missions, Yossarian concocts
a mysterious liver ailment, sabotages his plane and tries to get
himself declared insane.
</P>
<P>
   Yossarian discovers that, in the military rule book, anyone who
is declared insane must be excused from flying death-defying
missions. The catch (catch 22) is that one must ask to be excused.
But anyone who is smart enough to show ``rational fear in the face
of clear and present danger'' obviously is sane and must continue
to fly.
</P>
<P>
   In his novel, Heller went beyond a simple anti-military stance.
Some critics found a condemnation of capitalistic practices in the
character of Milo Minderbinder, a money-grubbing former mess-hall
officer whose pursuit of profits causes suffering and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the meaning of ``Catch-22'' in his book, ``Bright
Book of Life: American Novelists and Storytellers From Hemingway to
Mailer,'' the critic Alfred Kazin said that Heller's novel ``is
really about the Next War, and thus about a war which will be
without limits and without meaning, a war that will end when no one
is alive to fight it. The theme of `Catch-22' is the total
craziness of war, the craziness of all those who submit to it, and
the struggle of one man, Yossarian, who knows the difference
between his sanity and the insanity of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was first published, ``Catch-22'' was not an instant
success, although the novelist Nelson Algren, writing about it in
The Nation, called it ``the best American novel to come out of
World War II'' and ``the best American novel to come out of
anywhere in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other reviewers felt like Richard G. Stern, the author of
``Golk,'' who wrote a short review for The New York Times Book
Review under the headline ``Bombers Away.'' Stern said the book had
``much passion, comic and fervent, but it gasps for want of craft
and sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pine of the Library Journal agreed with him, calling the
book ``tedious'' and recommending it only for libraries with large
collections of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   With poor reviews from some of the most influential organs,
``Catch-22'' got off to such a slow start that it might have faded
away completely had it not been for strong recommendations by
people who had read it and passed it along to friends. One such
reader was S.J. Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the book and the rule were both to be called
``Catch-18,'' but that came close to the title of a book written by
Leon Uris. So Heller changed both to ``Catch-22'' and it is that
tag that has entered the dictionaries and the language.
</P>
<P>
   In time Yossarian became everybody's favorite survivor; by the
mid-1960s, Newsweek was referring to the ``Heller cult,''
consisting mostly of young people addicted to the book.
</P>
<P>
   A number of college students who did not want to be conscripted
to fight in the war in Vietnam started wearing Army field jackets
around campus with Yossarian name tags. John Chancellor, then an
NBC anchorman, recalled having bumper stickers printed with the
legend ``Yossarian Lives,'' which he gave to anyone who would take
them. Heller himself spent the '60s touring college campuses,
speaking out against the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Heller reintroduced John Yossarian in ``Closing Time,'' a 1994
novel that Simon &AMP; Schuster called ``the sequel to `Catch-22,'''
although Heller preferred to call it a complement to the original.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Yossarian were many of the old favorites from the
original work, especially Milo Minderbinder, the ultimate
manipulator of people and institutions, now a billionaire arms
merchant; Milo's foulmouthed sidekick, ex-Pfc. Wintergreen; and the
meek chaplain, renamed Tappman (```Chaplain, Tappman, Chaplain
Tappman, Albert Tappman, Chaplain?' chattered Chaplain Albert
Tappman garrulously'') who becomes a sequestered secret weapon when
he is discovered by his physicians to be urinating heavy water.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Closing Time,'' Yossarian, twice divorced and living
uneasily in New York, is working for Minderbinder as an
Establishment lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   When an interviewer told him he had never written anything as
good as ``Catch-22,'' Heller, a man who knew his worth, replied,
``Who has?''

   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL;

the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL;

seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

 UNDATED: ``Who has?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Heller was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn,
in New York City, on May 1, 1923, the son of Isaac Donald Heller,
who drove a delivery truck for a wholesale baker, and Lena Heller.
It was Isaac Heller's second marriage and Joseph had a
half-brother, Lee, 14 years his senior, and a half-sister, Sylvia,
seven years older, the children from the first marriage. After the
elder Heller died, Lee became a surrogate father to Joey, as he was
called, and to Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of his father's death was complications from a
bleeding ulcer; Joey was 5 years old when it happened. Of his
father, Heller wrote in his 1998 memoir, ``Now and Then: From Coney
Island to Here'' (Knopf): ``I simply lost interest in him after he
was gone.'' Heller continued: ``I've never grappled much with the
idea of trying to find out more about him .... I know him by his
absence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he made no attempt for 30 years to find out the cause of
his father's death until he had gone to a psychiatrist because of
the break-up of his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Joey's mother raised her family as well as she could, taking in
boarders. Joey gained a reputation as a smart-aleck, adept at
delivering acerbic one-liners and playing practical jokes on his
friends. His mother used to tell him, ``Joey, you got a twisted
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   He engaged in the time-honored Brooklyn shenanigans on Surf
Avenue and attended P.S. 188. He also read and enjoyed ``Tom
Swift'' and ``The Rover Boys.'' But when he was about 10, an older
cousin got him to read a child's version of Homer's ``Iliad.''
Later in life he said that after he read it, he decided that if he
ever grew up, he would become a writer.
</P>
<P>
   In her review of ``Now and Then'' for The New York Times,
Michiko Kakutani wrote, ``A fan of Heller's fiction will see how
the sense of loss animating novels like `Something Happened' and
`Closing Time' grew out of his own nostalgia for the vanished world
of his youth, and understand how his heroes' preoccupation with
mortality had roots in his father's premature death and his own
close encounters with death during World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``We see how Heller drew upon his own Coney
Island childhood for sections of `Good as Gold' and `Closing
Time.'''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1941, Heller graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School.
He had worked a bit during his school years, delivering telegrams.
But he continued to want to be a writer. He wrote some short
stories that were published and well received but soon he was
caught up in the war.
</P>
<P>
   He first got a job as a blacksmith's helper at the Norfolk Navy
Yard in Virginia. After the United States entered World War II , he
enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He did this with some of his
friends from Brooklyn, who made a grand gesture of taking the oath
of enlistment in Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to armorer's school and would have been very happy
to remain there; people who made armor and affixed it to war
machines did not usually go into combat. But he heard a rumor that
armorers were being turned into gunners and gunners' lives were
``worth no more than three days.'' So he went to cadet school and
became a bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant and, like Yossarian in
``Catch-22,'' was sent on bombing runs over France and Italy.
Yossarian was stationed on Pianosa, an imaginary island off the
Italian coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Heller was stationed on
Corsica, which happened to be in about the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Heller knew no fear until he flew his 37th mission. ``Until
then, it was all play,'' he wrote in The New York Times Magazine in
May 1995. ``I was so brainwashed by Hollywood's image of heroism
that I was disappointed when nobody shot back at us,'' he recalled.
``I was a jackass. I thought it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't any fun at all when he saw planes flown by his
friends destroyed in combat. And then his own B-25 was hit by flak,
wounding the top turret gunner. After that, he said, ``I wanted
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller used that incident for the disturbing scene in
``Catch-22'' in which Yossarian tries to save the fatally wounded
radio gunner, Snowden, bandaging the wrong wound as Snowden dies.
(``I'm cold,'' Snowden whimpers, ``I'm cold.'' ``There, there,''
Yossarian says. ``There, there.'')
</P>
<P>
   Heller later wrote: ''On another mission to Ferrara, one I don't
think I was on, a radio gunner I didn't know was pierced through
the middle by a wallop of flak _ it was always flak that destroyed,
for there were no German fighter planes attacking us the whole time
I was there _ and he died, moaning, I was told, that he was cold.
For my episodes of Snowden in the novel, I fused the knowledge of
that tragedy with the panicked co-pilot and the thigh wound to the
top turret gunner in my own plane on our second mission to Avignon.
The rest of the details are pretty much as I related, except that I
did not, like Yossarian, discard my uniform or sit naked in a tree,
and I was not given a medal while undressed.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1945, he was discharged after having flown on 60
missions. Using the benefits of the GI Bill of Rights, he studied
first at the University of California, then transferred to New York
University, where he earned a Phi Beta Kappa key and graduated in
the class of 1948 with a major in English. He then earned a
master's in literature from Columbia, won a Fulbright Scholarship
and studied at Oxford University in England in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States, he got a job teaching freshman
writing at Penn State University. He then worked for Time
magazine's advertising department from 1952 to 1956 and did the
same thing for Look magazine from 1956 to 1958. He served as a
promotion man for McCall's magazine from 1958 to 1961 and also
worked briefly for Remington Rand, the typewriter manufacturer, in
the advertising department.
</P>
<P>
   Through these years he kept writing, and his stories were
published from time to time in Esquire, the Atlantic Monthly and
Cosmopolitan. During the 1950s, he had written a short story that
was evocative of his experiences in the Air Force and in his spare
time he expanded it, slowly building it into the novel that was
called ``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller said that it took him eight years to write ``Catch-22.''
He acknowledged the influence of Celine, Nathanael West, Vladimir
Nabokov, William Faulkner and in particular Franz Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the book was published he could not sustain
himself with what he earned as a writer. He lectured at colleges
and was a professor of English at the City College of New York. In
the 1960s, he taught fiction and dramatic writing at Yale.

1999 ON TRACK TO BE 2ND WARMEST YEAR IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year is shaping up to be the second warmest in
the United States and the fifth warmest in the world, following
last year's record high both nationally and globally, the top
government weather experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Karl, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's National Climatic data center, said 1999
``continues a trend toward long-term (global) warming,'' This
decade has produced five of the warmest years in the United States,
he said in releasing a NOAA report.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, world temperatures have risen by .06 of a degree
Centigrade or .11 of a degree Fahrenheit per decade in the last
century, the report said. A major warming period lasted from 1910
to 1945, and the current warming trend began in 1976, it added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of 1999's heat occurred last month when parts of the Upper
Midwest recorded temperatures in the high 80s. Alaska experienced
unusual 90-degree temperatures in August. Many parts of the nation
_ Midwest, South and East _ suffered through triple-digits in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite severe droughts in some parts of the country this summer
and autumn, rainfall is nearly normal nationally in the United
States, the report said. At the end of November, average U.S. rain
and snowfall totaled 30.6 inches _ about an inch below normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the year was one of the driest this century,
but then we got some very severe flooding,'' said Jack Kelly, Jr.,
director of the National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA.
Much of the flooding occurred along the East Coast in the aftermath
of several hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this year the United States had a record number of five
Category 4 hurricanes, in which the wind blows between 131 to 155
mph. Hurricanes are ranked from one to five based on wind speed,
with Category 5 (wind blowing more than 155 mph) the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The year was also notable for 200 tornadoes in January alone. On
May 3 and 4, 74 tornadoes tore through Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas,
killing about 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is vulnerable to extreme weather events,'' Kelly
said. In fact, the United States has more severe weather than any
other country in the world mainly because of the number of
tornadoes that strike here. No other country experiences such a
strong clash between cold air and warm air systems that can produce
severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA also released the 15 most dramatic weather-related events
of the century:
</P>
<P>
   _The Galveston (Texas) hurricane in September 1900 in which more
than 8,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
   _The tri-state tornado in March 1925 _ the deadliest such storm
in U.S. history _ which cut a 219-mile swath in Missouri, Illinois
and Indiana, killing 695 people.
</P>
<P>
   _The so-called Dust Bowl of the 1930s, in which drought and wind
caused severe dust storms in the Plains states, prompting hundreds
of thousands of people to move.
</P>
<P>
   _The Florida Keys hurricane of September 1935, a Category 5
storm that killed more than 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   _The New England hurricane of September 1938, which submerged
downtown Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   _The great Okeechobee flood and hurricane of September 1938, in
which a Category 4 storm killed more than 1,800 people in Florida
and another 1,600 in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   _The so-called ``storm of the century'' of November 1950 in
which snow and hurricane-force winds hit the Midwest and East
Coast, killing 383.
</P>
<P>
   _Hurricane Camille in August 1969, a Category 5 storm, which
struck Mississippi with more-than-200-miles-an-hour winds. It
killed 256 people and caused $1.4 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   _The ``super tornado outbreak'' of April 1974 in which more than
170 tornadoes hit states from the Great Lakes to Alabama during a
17-hour period. The outbreak killed 315 people and injured 6,142.
</P>
<P>
   _The New England blizzard of February 1978, which paralyzed New
England for a week and brought Boston a record 38 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
   _The El Ninos of 1982-83 and 1997-98, in which warmer-than-usual
water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean disrupted weather patterns
in the United States, often resulting in stronger storms.
</P>
<P>
   _Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, which was the nation's
costliest storm, hitting heavily populated South Florida. It caused
$25 billion in damages and killed 23 people.
</P>
<P>
   _The ``super storm'' of March 1993, which paralyzed the entire
East Coast from Florida to Maine, killed 79 people and injured more
than 600.
</P>
<P>
   _The great Midwest flood of the summer of 1993 after record
winter snows and spring rains caused severe flooding along with
Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   _The Oklahoma-Texas-Kansas outbreak of 74 tornadoes on May 3 and
4 of this year, which, among other things, destroyed parts of
Oklahoma City.

 UNDATED: at Yale.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He also wrote a few television plays and, later in the '60s and
early '70s, worked on movie scripts. Among those in which he had a
hand were ``Casino Royale'' (Columbia, 1967) and ``Dirty Dingus
Magee,'' (MGM, 1970), both of them spoofs.
</P>
<P>
   Heller used dialogue from his novel in several adaptations for
the theater. A two-act play, ``We Bombed in New Haven,'' was
produced at the Yale Repertory Theater in 1967 and reached Broadway
the following year for a brief run. ``Catch-22,'' a one-act play,
was produced at the John Drew Theater in East Hampton in 1971.
``Clevinger's Trial,'' based on Chapter 8 of ``Catch-22,'' was
produced in London in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1974 _ 13 years after publication of ``Catch-22'' _
did he produce another novel, ``Something Happened.'' It was about
alienation in the American business community and it focused on Bob
Slocum, a sad, lackluster careerist with no true friends, dogged by
a feeling of always being trapped.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Aldredge , writing in The Saturday Review, said Slocum
``is haunted by the sense that at some time in the past something
happened to him, something that he cannot remember but that changed
him from a person who had aspirations for the future, who believed
in himself and his work, who trusted others and was able to love,
into the person he has since unaccountably become, a man who
aspires to nothing, believes in nothing and no one, least of all
himself, who no longer knows if he loves or is loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years after ``Something Happened,'' Heller's third novel,
``Good as Gold,'' was published. It was a cynical look at the
workings of the federal government, in which an aide to the
president says, ``Just tell the truth ... even if you have to lie''
and the president himself spends most of his first year in office
writing ``My Year in the White House.'' Into the maw of public
service comes Bruce Gold, an English professor who wants to become
the first ``real'' Jewish secretary of state. The fact that Henry
Kissinger has already served in that capacity does not deter him,
because he feels that Kissinger could not possibly be Jewish, since
he was a party to the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   R.Z. Sheppard, writing in Time magazine, called the book ``a
savage, intemperately funny satire on the assimilation of the
Jewish tradition of liberalism'' into the American mainstream. ``It
is a delicate subject,'' Sheppard wrote, ``off-limits to non-Jews
fearful of being thought anti-Semitic and unsettling to successful
Jewish intellectuals whose views may have drifted to the right in
middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God Knows,'' published in 1984, made some of the best-seller
lists for a time. It was basically the story of King David told in
the voice of Mel Brooks. Richard Cohen, writing in The Washington
Post, said the book was ``more of a nightclub shtick than a
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to see my people as living in a vacuum, not anarchy,
but living in a void of meaning _ even my King David, who despairs
because God doesn't talk to anyone,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, while trying to cope with the dissolution of his 1945
marriage to the former Shirley Held, Heller noticed he had trouble
swallowing, and then found he could not pull a sweater over his
head. The mysterious malady turned out to be Guillain-Barre
syndrome, a life-threatening neurological disease involving partial
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Certain he was near death, he spent two months in Mount Sinai
Hospital and four months of rehabilitation at the Rusk Institute at
New York University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he married Valerie Humphries, the nurse who had
helped restore him fully to health at Mount Sinai. He also got
through his illness with the help of his friends, especially Speed
Vogel, a retired textiles executive and former herring taster at
Zabar's specialty-food store, and Mario Puzo, the novelist, who
lent him money after it became known that Heller had let his health
insurance lapse.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of his illness, Heller wrote ``No Laughing
Matter,'' with Vogel. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, writing in The New
York Times, said he thought the Heller-Vogel collaboration was
``not only richly amusing, it is positively cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Heller published ``Picture This,'' in which he reflects
on such historical figures as Rembrandt, Socrates, Plato and the
American presidents of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rayner, of The Times of London, said that Heller
attacked his main themes _ ``power and intellect are incompatible,
that politicians wage disastrous wars for no good reason ... and
that humanity learns nothing from its mistakes _ and gets away with
it most of the time, for the simple reason that he is funny .... He
refuses to take institutions seriously; or rather ... he takes them
so seriously they become hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, a handsome man with a great shock of curly white hair,
enjoyed sampling Chinese food around New York with such friends as
Brooks and Puzo, who were used to his barbed wit and crotchety
ways. Barbara Gelb once described her friend for The New York Times
Book Review:
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years now, I have managed to overlook his frequent
sulkiness, his gluttonous table manners and his tendency to growl
No before he even knows what the question is. I have stayed on good
terms with him largely because I relish his aberrant sense of humor
and his skewed way of looking at life _ an outlook he insists has
changed little since he wrote `Catch-22.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my novels, there's concern with the way people use and
misuse language to obscure and confuse and build barriers,'' he
said. ``The way that words are corrupted or the way words
contradict themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Valerie, he is survived by a daughter,
Erica Heller of New York; a son, Theodore of New York, who is a
novelist; and a sister, Sylvia Heller of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Heller's agent, Deborah Karl, said he had completed a novel
called ``Portrait of an Artist as an Old Man,'' to be published
next fall by Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Asked once what his biggest fears were, Joseph Heller replied,
``I fear death, nursing homes and vaccinations.'' But he came to
grips with death, he said, explaining, ``Everyone else seems to get
through it all right so it couldn't be too difficult for me.''

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION

EDITORS: THIS REVIEW  ORIGINALLY MOVED IN NOVEMBER. 
REVIEW OF:  ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

CALIF. FIRM TO INVEST $1 BILLION, MAINLY IN E-COMMERCE STARTUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting, which has helped fund more than two-dozen
Internet companies, announced an ambitious program Monday to invest
$1 billion over the next five years, primarily in
business-to-business electronic-commerce startups.
</P>
<P>
   Called Andersen Consulting Ventures and based in Palo Alto,
Calif., the new unit will receive $500 million from Andersen
Consulting and $500 million from some yet-to-be-named investment
banks and venture capital firms, said Jackson L. Wilson, who will
head the venture firm. He previously was managing partner for
global markets at Andersen Consulting, one of the largest
information technology and management consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson previously invested $40 million in startups, and the $1
billion in new funding is expected to catapult Andersen to third
place among venture capital firm, behind Accel Partners, also in
Palo Alto, and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers of Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Wilson will forge relationships with venture
capital firms, investment banks, and other e-commerce providers in
North America, Europe, and Asia, regions in which the creation of
e-commerce ventures and dot-com companies is accelerating. The
focus, he said, will be on launching on-line ventures that bring
buyers and sellers together to create marketplaces in such areas as
plastics, global chemicals, and computer products.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new venture money will also go to Andersen
Consulting employees who want to start e-commerce businesses,
rather than continue as consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this bold investment initiative, we are sending a strong
message to our clients, alliance partners, and our employees that
Andersen Consulting intends to lead in the new eEconomy,'' said a
statement released by Joe W. Forehand, managing partner and chief
executive of Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   To differentiate itself from venture capital companies, Andersen
Consulting Ventures plans to offer a combination of cash and
consulting expertise and provide consultants to help startup
companies, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to bring something different to the party,'' said
Wilson, 52, who plans to open a Northeast office in either New York
or Boston next year.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the venture unit plans to invest between $5 million
and $25 million in each startup for equity stakes of 2 percent to
51 percent. Wilson said he also envisions investing in incubator
businesses, which house and nurture startups, but he declined to be
more specific.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the early companies Andersen Consulting invested
in was ShopLink.com of Westwood, Mass., which provides on-line
grocery shopping with weekly deliveries in more than 70
Massachusetts communities. It competes against Streamline.com, also
in Westwood; HomeRuns of Newton, a unit of supermarket chain
Hannaford Bros.; and PeaPod, based in Chicago, which is working
locally with Stop &AMP; Shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got pulled into the ShopLink deal at an early stage, and it
is very promising,'' said Wilson. So far, it is the company's only
New England venture and one of its last business-to-consumer deals,
he said.

JOSEPH HELLER, 76; FAMED FOR WAR NOVEL `CATCH-22' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes excerpt; e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Heller, whose black-comic novel of World War II,
``Catch-22,'' contributed an enduring phrase to the English
language, died Sunday at his East Hampton, N.Y., home of a heart
attack. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a calamity for American letters,'' Kurt Vonnegut said
Monday, reacting to news of the death of his friend and fellow
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22,'' which draws on Mr. Heller's own experiences flying
60 combat missions as an Army Air Force pilot, encapsulated the
absurdity of war in the form of a supposed military edict of that
name, whereby insane men are excused from combat but the act of
requesting permission not to fight proves one's sanity _ and
fitness to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) defines
Catch-22 as ``a condition or consequence that precludes success, a
dilemma where the victim cannot win.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the book's enduring appeal (it has sold some 10 million
copies since 1961) is its having come to be seen to represent any
individual trapped in a can't-win situation owing to bureaucratic
rule or regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the book remains relevant in so many ways,'' Mr.
Heller said last year, ``because it deals not so much with the war
situation but our societal situation (in) which people are at the
mercy of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Mr. Heller's other books enjoyed the success of
``Catch-22.'' Drawing on writers as diverse as Kafka, Celine, and
Nathanael West, it presents an unrelentingly absurdist vision of
war. Characters bear such names as Major Major, Milo Minderbinder,
and Captain Aardvark. Airmen hire themselves out to bomb their own
base. And its hero, Yossarian, is forthright about his desire ``to
live forever or die in the attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The book received mixed reviews on initial publication. The
novelist Nelson Algren hailed it as ``the strongest repudiation of
our civilization to come out of World War II.'' But The New Yorker
called it ``a debris of sour jokes, stage anger, dirty words,
synthetic looniness.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether synthetic or natural, that very quality of looniness _
along with its anarchistic rage _ helped make ``Catch-22'' a
central text of the '60s. For many readers, the Vietnam War seemed
like Mr. Heller's vision writ large and all too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy,''
Mr. Heller once said. ``Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts
_ and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane
society?''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Heller was born on May 1, 1923, in the Coney Island
section of Brooklyn, N.Y. His father was a deliveryman. After
working in the Norfolk (Va.) Navy Yard, Mr. Heller enlisted in the
Army Air Force. He served in Italy and rose to the rank of
lieutenant. ``I was so brainwashed by Hollywood's image of heroism
that I was disappointed when nobody shot back at us,'' he once
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller went to the University of Southern California and New
York University under the GI Bill. He earned his BA from the latter
institution in 1948, an MA from Columbia University in 1949, and
spent a year at Oxford University on a Fulbright Scholarship. He
also wrote short stories, several of which were published in The
Atlantic Monthly and Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   After two years teaching English composition at Pennsylvania
State University, Mr. Heller became an advertising copywriter. ``I
didn't want to be in advertising all my life,'' he said, ``or in
any other job . . . and I looked on the writing of a novel as a way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   That novel was ``Catch-22,'' and Mr. Heller spent eight years
working on it. His next novel, ``Something Happened,'' a bleak
satire of business life, took him 13 years. Part of that delay was
attributable to Mr. Heller's writing several plays, screenplays,
and even TV scripts (under the name Max Orange) for the situation
comedy ``McHale's Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller published four other novels: ``Good As Gold'' (1979),
``God Knows'' (1984), ``Picture This'' (1988), and ``Closing Time''
(1994), in which Yossarian and several other characters from
``Catch-22'' appear.
</P>
<P>
   He published two nonfiction works: ``No Laughing Matter''
(1986), with Speed Vogel, an account of his harrowing, if
ultimately successful, battle with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a
paralyzing nerve disorder; and ``Now and Then: From Coney Island to
Here'' (1998), a memoir.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently completed the final revisions for his last
novel, ``Portrait of an Artist as an Old Man.'' It is scheduled to
be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller leaves a wife, Valerie Humphries, and two children
from his first marriage, Erica Jill and Theodore Michael.
</P>

   &QL; 
THE TERM ``CATCH-22'' ENTERS THE LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   (Excerpted from ``Catch-22,'' by Joseph Heller.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean there's a catch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's a catch,'' Doc Daneeka replied. ``Catch-22.
Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified
that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that
were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was
crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon
as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more
missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he
didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he
was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane
and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute
simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some catch, that Catch-22,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best there is,'' Doc Daneeka agreed.

REPORT HIGHLIGHTS STATUS OF MANUFACTURING IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' manufacturing output has risen 20
percent since bottoming out in 1992, but the number of jobs in
manufacturing has not returned to the levels reached in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the state's manufacturing sector released Monday by
MassInsight, a Boston consulting firm, spotlights one aspect of a
state economy in the midst of a dramatic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The report touted improvements in the manufacturing sector and
said that with its highly educated work force the state has
distinct advantages in attracting or keeping today's cutting-edge
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers investing in technology have more complicated
work processes _ whether they're in textiles or plastics or in new,
high-tech manufacturing businesses _ and need high-skilled workers
to make their plants go,'' said Williiam Guenther, president of
MassInsight. ``That means places like Massachusetts are back in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But technology-based increases in productivity have also helped
to restrain job creation after the collapse of the once-dominant
minicomputer and defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   According to MassInsight, the state's manufacturers produced
nearly $33 billion in goods in 1997, the last year for which data
is available. That surpasses production during the peak years, 1987
through 1989. It is a sharp improvement from the state's $27.4
billion production level in 1992, when old-line manufacturers were
in the midst of layoffs and downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   But employment among manufacturers is nowhere near the levels of
the 1980s. The state had 448,300 manufacturing jobs in 1998; in
1982 through 1985, more than 600,000 people were employed in the
goods-producing sector.
</P>
<P>
   And they were good jobs: Manufacturing jobs pay, on average,
about $50,000 annually, compared with about $36,000 earned by other
workers on the state, MassInsight said.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Guenther noted that manufacturing employment
has stabilized. The decline in payrolls halted in 1996, and
payrolls began rising in 1997 and in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although Massachusetts has fewer manufacturing jobs than in the
past, Guenther said a trend in which companies locate plants near
the engineers who design and improve them would work to the state's
advantage in the future.
</P>
<P>
   And 450,000 manufacturing jobs ``is a lot of jobs,'' Guenther
said. ``Some people assumed we were going to become an all-service
economy not only here but in the United States. The headline is:
Not so.''

HEARING OPENS ON WHETHER TRIPP WILL STAND TRIAL FOR TAPING
LEWINSKY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Some of the prosecutors who helped direct
the independent counsel's investigation of President Clinton told a
court hearing Monday that they never promised Linda Tripp immunity
from prosecution in Maryland for illegally taping telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the three prosecutors said they told Ms. Tripp that if
she turned over the tapes and cooperated with them in investigating
the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, they would make it
almost impossible for Maryland authorities to win a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' accounts came on the first day of a hearing to
determine whether Mrs. Tripp must stand trial here in Howard
County, a suburb of Baltimore, on charges of violating a state law
against secretly recording telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   While the impeachment battle has long since been concluded, Mrs.
Tripp remains enmeshed in the drama she helped create. She has been
indicted on two felony counts for which she could face up to 10
years in jail for taping Ms. Lewinsky as the latter talked about
her relationship with the president. Maryland is one of several
states that prohibit tape recording telephone conversations without
the other person's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Bennett, who had been a deputy independent counsel, told
the court Monday that he had tried to explain to Mrs. Tripp that
the immunity agreement he offered her did not bind the state of
Maryland but only the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, he made it clear that it would be
extremely difficult for Maryland to prosecute her because the tape
recordings and everything else connected with them would have been
produced to the independent counsel, Ken Starr, under a grant of
immunity guaranteeing they could not be used against her in any
legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a constitutional matter we could not prevent Maryland from
bringing a prosecution,'' he said. ``What we could do is make it a
very, very difficult if not insurmountable for the state to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the scenario described by Bennett, the state would have to
demonstrate that it learned of Mrs. Tripp's taping through some
other means than the activities of the independent counsel,
including his report to Congress asserting Clinton had committed
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp herself was absent for Monday's hearing and is not
expected to be present at any time during the week, even if Ms.
Lewinsky testifies. Her lawyer, Joseph Murtha, Monday asked and
received permission from Judge Diane O. Leasure for Mrs. Tripp to
be absent during the entire hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha read aloud an affidavit given by Mrs. Tripp in which
she insisted that she only cooperated with Starr's office because
of assurances that she was totally safe from any prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and another former member of Starr's staff, Stephen
Binhak, both told the court that when Mrs. Tripp first informed the
independent counsel's office in January 1998 that she had made tape
recordings on her home telephone she was concerned that she might
have violated Maryland's laws. Binhak said it was one of the main
topics of conversation when he, Bennett and others from the office
went to Mrs. Tripp's home in Columbia, Md., on Jan. 16 to discuss
taking control of the tape recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Binhak said he explained that the federal government and the
state of Maryland were separate entities and one could not bind the
other. ``I told her we would do all we could to make it an
evidentiary problem for the state of Maryland,'' he said. But, he
added, ``I don't think she was grasping the technicalities. She
believed we would literally just be able to stop the state from
bringing an indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules that the immunity conferred on Mrs. Tripp by
lawyers from Starr's office does not extend to Maryland, state
prosecutors face a second, more daunting hurdle. They will try to
show this week that they and members of the grand jury learned of
Mrs. Tripp's taping through means other than Starr's activities.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutors fail to win either argument, they have
acknowledged they will be left with little evidence with which to
bring their case against Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also told the court Monday that in the first few days
after news of the Lewinsky investigation appeared in the media, he
received a frantic telephone call from the elected prosecutor of
Howard County, Marna McLendon, on Jan. 26, 1998. He said Ms.
McLendon told him she was coming under tremendous pressure to
investigate Mrs. Tripp under the state's wiretap laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``She indicated that she was under pressure that was becoming
unbearable to her,'' he said, including much from local Democrats.
``There was political pressure to bring an indictment.''

   Joseph Heller, whose black-comic novel of World War II,
``Catch-22,'' contributed an enduring phrase to the English
language, died Sunday at his East Hampton, N.Y., home of a heart
attack. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a calamity for American letters,'' Kurt Vonnegut said
Monday, reacting to news of the death of his friend and fellow
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22,'' which draws on Mr. Heller's own experiences flying
60 combat missions as an Army Air Force pilot, encapsulated the
absurdity of war in the form of a supposed military edict of that
name, whereby insane men are excused from combat but the act of
requesting permission not to fight proves one's sanity _ and
fitness to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) defines
Catch-22 as ``a condition or consequence that precludes success, a
dilemma where the victim cannot win.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the book's enduring appeal (it has sold some 10 million
copies since 1961) is its having come to be seen to represent any
individual trapped in a can't-win situation owing to bureaucratic
rule or regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the book remains relevant in so many ways,'' Mr.
Heller said last year, ``because it deals not so much with the war
situation but our societal situation (in) which people are at the
mercy of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Mr. Heller's other books enjoyed the success of
``Catch-22.'' Drawing on writers as diverse as Kafka, Celine, and
Nathanael West, it presents an unrelentingly absurdist vision of
war. Characters bear such names as Major Major, Milo Minderbinder,
and Captain Aardvark. Airmen hire themselves out to bomb their own
base. And its hero, Yossarian, is forthright about his desire ``to
live forever or die in the attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The book received mixed reviews on initial publication. The
novelist Nelson Algren hailed it as ``the strongest repudiation of
our civilization to come out of World War II.'' But The New Yorker
called it ``a debris of sour jokes, stage anger, dirty words,
synthetic looniness.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether synthetic or natural, that very quality of looniness _
along with its anarchistic rage _ helped make ``Catch-22'' a
central text of the '60s. For many readers, the Vietnam War seemed
like Mr. Heller's vision writ large and all too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy,''
Mr. Heller once said. ``Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts
_ and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane
society?''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Heller was born on May 1, 1923, in the Coney Island
section of Brooklyn, N.Y. His father was a deliveryman. After
working in the Norfolk (Va.) Navy Yard, Mr. Heller enlisted in the
Army Air Force. He served in Italy and rose to the rank of
lieutenant. ``I was so brainwashed by Hollywood's image of heroism
that I was disappointed when nobody shot back at us,'' he once
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller went to the University of Southern California and New
York University under the GI Bill. He earned his BA from the latter
institution in 1948, an MA from Columbia University in 1949, and
spent a year at Oxford University on a Fulbright Scholarship. He
also wrote short stories, several of which were published in The
Atlantic Monthly and Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   After two years teaching English composition at Pennsylvania
State University, Mr. Heller became an advertising copywriter. ``I
didn't want to be in advertising all my life,'' he said, ``or in
any other job . . . and I looked on the writing of a novel as a way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   That novel was ``Catch-22,'' and Mr. Heller spent eight years
working on it. His next novel, ``Something Happened,'' a bleak
satire of business life, took him 13 years. Part of that delay was
attributable to Mr. Heller's writing several plays, screenplays,
and even TV scripts (under the name Max Orange) for the situation
comedy ``McHale's Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller published four other novels: ``Good As Gold'' (1979),
``God Knows'' (1984), ``Picture This'' (1988), and ``Closing Time''
(1994), in which Yossarian and several other characters from
``Catch-22'' appear.
</P>
<P>
   He published two nonfiction works: ``No Laughing Matter''
(1986), with Speed Vogel, an account of his harrowing, if
ultimately successful, battle with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a
paralyzing nerve disorder; and ``Now and Then: From Coney Island to
Here'' (1998), a memoir.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently completed the final revisions for his last
novel, ``Portrait of an Artist as an Old Man.'' It is scheduled to
be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller leaves a wife, Valerie Humphries, and two children
from his first marriage, Erica Jill and Theodore Michael.

THE TERM ``CATCH-22'' ENTERS THE LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   (Excerpted from ``Catch-22,'' by Joseph Heller.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean there's a catch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's a catch,'' Doc Daneeka replied. ``Catch-22.
Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified
that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that
were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was
crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon
as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more
missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he
didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he
was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane
and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute
simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some catch, that Catch-22,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best there is,'' Doc Daneeka agreed.

JUSTICES LET STAND VERMONT'S TUITION-REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM 
 
STEVE LASH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for
Vermont to keep providing tuition assistance to private, secular
schools, while withholding similar aid from parochial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Religious-school parents had unsuccessfully challenged the state
funding program as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that Vermont's refusal to assist sectarian schools
in the same way it aids other private institutions amounted to
religious discrimination, in violation of the parents' First
Amendment right to practice their religion free of governmental
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vermont Supreme Court, in a decision the federal
justices let stand, ruled that the state's decision to withhold
tuition assistance to parochial schools was required by the
constitutional mandate that government not endorse religion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. high court's refusal, without comment, to hear the case
neither set a national precedent nor settled the growing political
debate regarding whether states should provide tax breaks, or
``vouchers,'' to parents who send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of voucher programs, mostly Republicans, view them as
an effective way to give parents greater choice in deciding where
their children are educated.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, largely Democrats, regard vouchers as an
abdication of government's primary responsibility to use tax
revenue to improve the public school system, not to subsidize
private institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by declining to hear the case, sidestepped the
opportunity to resolve the constitutional conflict between the
opposing state obligations of ensuring people the right to practice
their faiths freely and of not endorsing religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont parochial-school parents, in their unsuccessful
appeal to the justices, pressed the court to favor the First
Amendment right to free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious expression _ including choosing to educate one's
child in a religious tradition _ has long been valued, not feared,
in our constitutional tradition,'' wrote the parents' lawyer,
William Meub of Rutland, Vt., in a legal brief to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed for many low-income parents, choosing how to educate
their children may be one of the few available vehicles for
expressing publicly their beliefs about matters of ultimate
concern,'' Meub added. ``Vermont's unjustified exclusion of
religious schools from its (tuition) program effectively precludes
low-income parents from enjoying the fulfillment and satisfaction
such expression brings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell countered that the
First Amendment prohibits states from giving tuition assistance to
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to send one's child to a sectarian school does not
include the right to have the government pay for religious
education,'' Sorrell wrote in a brief to the justices. ``The state
has no obligation to subsidize a religious education. On the
contrary, it is barred from doing so by the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case was a Vermont statute that calls for school
districts in the state either to provide a public high school or
pay the tuition for a student to attend a private, neighborhood
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's tuition-reimbursement program, which dates back 130
years, is aimed at high school students whose local school
districts do not operate a public high school. State law allows
such school districts to pay tuition for students to attend a
public or private high school.
</P>
<P>
   Of Vermont's 290 school districts, 88 paid tuition for all or
some of their high school students in the 1995-96 school year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Chittenden, Va., School Board authorized that
tuition be paid for students attending private parochial schools,
including Mount St. Joseph Academy, a Catholic high school in
nearby Rutland. But the Vermont education department intervened and
withheld state money to the school district, saying that its
planned tuition payments for parochial schools would be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of academy students then sued the state, arguing that
its refusal to pay tuition violated their religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But a state trial court sided with Vermont, ruling that tuition
payments to religious schools would violate the constitutional
separation of church and state. The Vermont Supreme Court agreed.

BOSS'S PET A PAIN FOR CO-WORKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q -- There is one person we work with who does practically no
work at all. She's often absent, and when she's here, she's either
on the phone or wandering around doing nothing. We have talked to
her, but she ignores us. We discussed this with our manager, but he
hasn't done a thing about it. What else can you suggest? N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Your manager has a pet, and you have a pet peeve. When a
co-worker is doing virtually no work and yet is granted the most
favored employee status, your options as a non-pet are rather
limited.
</P>
<P>
   You have already taken the two most important steps, namely
approaching the pet and your manager. The fact that you were
ignored by both is quite telling. Your associate appears to have no
concern for you and the rest of the team, and she most likely
figures that her relationship with the manager gives her all the
social interaction she needs, along with a dose of power.
</P>
<P>
   Your manager's lack of follow-up when you advised him of the
situation indicates that his work priorities seem to be rather
muddled as well.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you need to decide how much you are going to let
this situation bother you. If you and the rest of the team get
along well and are able to work productively and sense a good deal
of achievement and growth, then perhaps you should just ignore the
pet and her master.
</P>
<P>
   Your other option is to approach senior management. Topsiders
are typically interested in correcting situations that interfere
with employee satisfaction and productivity. Such topsiders are
often concerned that pet situations can lead to exposure and
various claims of inequitable treatment, particularly by non-pets
and former pets.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We have been having a high degree of turnover among our
younger employees, and I am wondering if this is just a common
occurrence with Generation X. If so, what are some good ways to
retain them? B.K.
</P>
<P>
   A -- It is easy to think that Generation X actually means
Generation Exit, but there is more to this generation's work ethic
than that. They may well be more mobile than their predecessors,
and it is important to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Research is finding that Gen Xers seek interesting, challenging,
flexible and growth-oriented jobs that provide learning
opportunities as well as balance between work life and personal
life. While they have interest in making money, money per se is not
their primary objective. At the same time, Gen Xers do like to see
a link between their pay and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings indicate that many Gen Xers enjoy working as part
of a team, but they want autonomy and the opportunity to think
creatively. It is important that they sense that their work has
meaning and significance. They also want to be part of the
decision-making process, and they seek frequent feedback on their
performance _ in fact, some say on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that these types of work elements are
important not only for many Gen Xers, but for many employees from
any generation.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I have an employee who keeps telling me how to manage, and
he likes to use management vocabulary, such as saying that I need
to have more employee empowerment. Then he offers ``suggestions''
about priorities, assignments and how to do my job. How do I get
him to back off? A.M.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Before trying to get this employee to back off or get off
your back, it is important to step back and look carefully at his
behavior. If he is truly spending too much time trying to do your
job rather than his, then he needs to be given some specific advice
as to his own job priorities, responsibilities and objectives. He
needs to understand that you are still open to his ideas and
inputs, but his own work comes first.
</P>
<P>
   It also sounds like he is approaching you with an air of
arrogance and elitism. If this is actually the case, you should
give him some advice as to the way to present his thoughts in a
more persuasive and compelling manner. He needs to understand that
his style may be preventing the substance from being heard.
</P>
<P>
   If you actively close the door on him, you may be inadvertently
sending a message to the rest of the team that you are not
receptive to their ideas, and this clearly works against effective
management today. And, it plays right into what he has been telling
you.
</P>
<P>
   Since he is playing manager right now, he is presumably
interested in becoming a real manager at some point in the future.
Unless he wants that to be in the very distant future, he should
listen to your ``suggestions.''

STATE MENTAL HEALTH CHIEF URGES PARITY IN TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the first-ever US Surgeon General's report on mental
health, the nation's top public health official Monday said that
one out of five Americans experiences a mental illness in any one
year, yet the majority of those who need treatment do not seek it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping this report will do for mental health what previous
surgeon generals' reports have done in raising awareness about
smoking and exercise, Massachusetts mental health officials and
advocates Monday welcomed the 450-page volume as important evidence
that mental illness should be viewed as treatable and covered by
insurance the same way physical illness is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pay attention. . .when the surgeon general speaks,''
said Marylou Sudders, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health
commissioner, who attended the White House news conference
releasing the report. Surgeon General David Satcher ``gives stature
to an issue that many of us have believed in and have worked on,''
Sudders said. ``He has given it this incredible national
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The report uses the latest statistics and research to argue that
the effectiveness of treatments for mental illness rivals that of
treatments for physical illness, and Satcher joined mental health
officials and advocates in criticizing the lack of parity in
insurance coverage for mental illness around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parity calls for equality between mental health and other
health coverage,'' according to the report. ``We have allowed
stigma and a now unwarranted sense of hopelessness about the
opportunities for recovery from mental illness to erect. . .
barriers. It is time to take them down,'' said Satcher in his
preface to the report.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen states have passed so-called mental health
parity legislation in the last several years, and Massachusetts is
the only New England state that has not yet done so. A parity bill
was approved by the Massachusetts Senate in October and is now in
House Ways and Means, but has met objections from about a half
dozen patient advocacy and civil rights groups concerned about its
effect on patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now's the time for Massachusetts,'' said Sudders, who added
that she believes the parity bill as written should pass, while
other legislation should be used to take care of concerns about
confidentiality. ``There's strong support for this bill to pass.
I'm hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups that support parity in Massachusetts object to the
bill for repealing the state's pioneering confidentiality law,
which limits insurers' access to mental health records. ``We hold
back our full support because it is framed in this trade-off
language,'' said Paul K. Ling, a Quincy psychologist who leads the
Consortium for Psychotherapy, which advocates for quality care and
is one of the groups objecting to the bill as written, along with
the Andover-based National Coalition for Patient Rights and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, however, like the Massachusetts Association for
Mental Health, throw their full support behind the bill as written.
``It's not an issue for me,'' said Bernard J. Carey, executive
director of the nonprofit advocacy group. Insurers say they favor
the current version of the mental health parity bill because it
allows them to determine whether a treatment is medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But both Carey and Ling agreed on the significance of the
Surgeon General's report in calling for breaking down the insurance
barriers and removing the social stigma.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general's report reviewed hundreds of studies, many
of them published recently, and concluded that while in the United
States, ``mental disorders collectively account for more than 15
percent of the overall burden of disease from all causes and
slightly more than the burden associated with all forms of
cancer,'' nearly two-thirds of people with diagnosable mental
illness do not seek treatment. At the same time, the report
reviewed the scientific literature on the growing effectiveness of
treatments for everything from depression to bipolar disorder
(formerly known as manic depression).
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is so good, the treatments are so well-documented,
there's enough there for people to take action and to discuss,''
said Judith Kurland, New England regional director for the US
Department of Health and Human Services, who reviewed the report
put out by Satcher. ``Usually when the surgeon general issues a
report, it's to say, `Here's what we know, here's the state of the
art, here's the action we must take.' He's pretty clear about
saying, `We have to provide parity and coverage, we have to provide
greater access','' Kurland said.

BOSTON, US CHAMBERS SPLIT ON RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Siding with Bay State universities instead of its
own sister organization, the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce
said Monday it strongly disagrees with an effort by the US Chamber
of Commerce to broaden a law that requires scientists to reveal the
details of federally funded research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seriously concerned that the US chamber's position
would stifle intellectual inquiry and impede the development of new
technologies,'' said Paul Guzzi, president of the Boston chamber.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a new law that allows anyone to file a request under
the Freedom of Information Act to obtain ``all data'' produced by
researchers on federal grants, including those at hospitals and
universities. The act has given citizens access to federal
documents for 22 years, but until now it did not extend to
nongovernment workers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law last year. But the White House Office of
Management and Budget later ruled that it applied only to a limited
range of research information, and not to any research conducted
before the law took effect last month.
</P>
<P>
   The US chamber says the OMB illegally narrowed the scope of the
law. Last week, it filed three Freedom of Information requests,
including two directed at Harvard University scientists, that are
designed to provoke a lawsuit over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Boston chamber criticized that effort, saying the
new law, if interpreted broadly, could force researchers to break
confidentiality agreements with their research subjects or business
partners and add costs as researchers are forced to respond to
repeated request for information.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the group said, the law may discourage
collaboration between industry and university or hospital
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The two chambers of commerce have independent boards and
funding. William Kovacs, a US chamber vice president, said the
Boston group was siding with its own members, which include Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   The law was largely prompted by a Harvard study that linked
increased air pollution to higher death rates and which was cited
by the US Environmental Protection Agency in setting tougher
clean-air regulations. Those rules would cost industry $50 billion
to $150 billion a year, though they have been suspended pending a
review by the courts, Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very important to see the data that supports
multibillion-dollar regulations,'' Kovacs said, ``and we don't see
any reason why the Boston chamber would want to keep this secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard researchers submitted their data to peer review and
to a review panel funded by both the EPA and business groups. But
releasing it to the public, they have said, would violate
confidentiality agreements with their research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The US chamber says that confidential information is routinely
withheld during Freedom of Information requests and would not be
released under the new law.

SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER TAKING A GENTLER MANNER TO TALKS WITH
ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-ISRAEL) 
(ms) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ In his only previous encounter with an Israeli
prime minister, back in 1991, Farouk al-Sharaa waved an old British
poster that identified the Israeli, Yitzhak Shamir, as wanted for
crimes of terrorism. The one time that Sharaa addressed the Israeli
public directly, in 1995, he spoke in an angry tirade.
</P>
<P>
   But now Sharaa, who is 61 and has been Syria's foreign minister
for the last 15 years, is seen as embodying his country's hopes for
a swift peace. On Wednesday in Washington, he will become the
highest-ranking Syrian ever to meet with an Israeli leader, and as
the two sides resume talks for the first time in nearly four years,
Sharaa is expected to present a gentler face than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa, who left Syria Monday for talks with Israel's current
prime minister, Ehud Barak, has said he is heading for Washington
``serious about making peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The new language appears to reflect broader changes that seem to
have persuaded Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, that a settlement
with Israel is less a threat than an opportunity. Apart from Assad,
al-Sharaa is seen here as the man who speaks with more authority
than anyone else, and the fact that he will represent Syria in the
talks is regarded as a sign of determination to put the long
Syrian-Israeli conflict to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to peace, there are only two people who really
matter today _ Assad himself and Sharaa,'' said a prominent Syrian
who would speak only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A calm, elegant and engaging man who speaks English well,
al-Sharaa was named foreign minister in 1984 in large part,
diplomats here say, because his manner was seen as likely to win
support in the West. His predecessor, Abdulhalim Khaddam, now a
vice president, was known for a hectoring style.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa is generally regarded as among the most able of Arab
foreign ministers. But he has always been a loyalist and has never
allowed his own personality to eclipse that of Assad. Until now,
his only encounters with Israelis have been hostile, reflecting the
deep tensions between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 episode, al-Sharaa was the head of Syria's
delegation to the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, the
American-sponsored gathering that set current peace efforts in
motion. His display of the old British poster came after Shamir's
denounced Syria as a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   Many Syrians still describe the confrontation with great pride,
but American officials who had worked overtime to persuade Syria to
attend the gathering regarded it at the time as a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder, they have said, that when it came to the
quest for a Syrian-Israeli peace, the two sides carried so much old
bitterness that they were in effect starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa's only direct comments to the Israeli public came four
years later, when peace talks were already under way but mutual
distrust had allowed only scant progress. At the urging of American
officials, who had argued that Syria should make its case directly
to ordinary Israelis, al-Sharaa granted an interview to Israeli
television, becoming the highest-ranking Syrian official ever to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   But the sharp criticism he voiced of Israel and its policies was
widely seen as counterproductive to the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1998, Shara spoke with bitterness again. Angry at
the fact that the peace talks that broke down in 1996 had not been
reconvened, al-Sharaa criticized the ``ineffective role'' played by
the Clinton administration, which at the time seemed to be giving
low priority to Israeli-Syrian peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States bears a considerable part of the
responsibility of allowing this process to reach a dead end,''
al-Sharaa said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa, who is a Sunni Muslim, was born in 1938 in the
southern city of Dara. He earned a bachelor's degree in English
literature from the University of Damascus in 1963, and later
studied international law at the University of London.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named ambassador to Italy in 1976, he spent 13
years as a manager and official of Syrian Arab Airlines. He was
appointed minister of state for foreign affairs in 1980, and became
foreign minister four years later. Al-Sharaa suffered an aneurysm
this fall, and was taken to Beirut, the Lebanese capital, where he
underwent heart surgery. But he appears to have made a swift
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   And his demeanor has turned particularly upbeat in recent days,
with the decision by the two sides to resume talks in an atmosphere
so optimistic that both Israel and Syria have said a deal could be
reached in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa was initially seen in the West as more a spokesman
than a decision-maker. As recently as the early 1990s, foreign
visitors who met in small groups with Assad noted that al-Sharaa
tended for the most part to listen in silence or to take notes for
his boss.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, according to well-connected Syrians and
Damascus-based diplomats, al-Sharaa's stature has swelled. He is
one of the few Syrian officials with whom the reclusive Assad, 69,
is believed to meet regularly, instead of merely consulting by
phone. And although al-Sharaa still defers to the president, he now
often completes his boss' thoughts, and has otherwise become a
vocal participant in the discussions with foreign representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Syria and Israel held direct talks, ending in
1996, the Syrian team was led by Walid Moallem, the ambassador in
Washington. Moallem, who is scheduled to leave his post soon, is
generally respected, but the fact that his rank did not regularly
allow him direct access to Assad was seen by some experts as a
factor in slowing the pace of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, al-Sharaa is described by diplomats here as a man
who truly acts as Assad's right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks is expected to be held in Blair House,
the presidential guest quarters across the street from the White
House, and will almost certainly be behind closed doors. In
announcing last week that the two sides would resume direct
negotiations, President Clinton suggested that further discussions
would probably shift to an undisclosed location in the Middle East
after al-Sharaa and Barak returned to their capitals.
</P>
<P>
   But Syrian officials, have insisted that the talks continue in
the Washington area, where they hope the that administration
officials might prove more likely to put pressure on Israel for
compromises on key disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in Syria say they understand that the State
Department is now seeking a suitable location for further talks
somewhere in the Virginia countryside.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who might head the Syrian delegation in any
further talks. Other members of the Syrian team that left Damascus
with al-Sharaa Monday included Youssef Shakour, a deputy foreign
minister and former chief of staff of the Syrian Army; Riad
al-Daoudi, the foreign minister's legal adviser, and Maj. Gen.
Ibrahim al-Omar, representing the Syrian Army.

SHUTTLE LAUNCH TO HUBBLE SET FOR THURSDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA has replaced a bent fuel line on the space shuttle
Discovery and plans a Thursday launch on a much-delayed mission to
repair the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery and a crew of seven astronauts are to lift off at 9:18
p.m. EST from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission
countdown was to begin early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to launch the mission last week were halted before a
countdown could begin when workers discovered a bent 6-foot-long
line that recirculates chilled liquid hydrogen between the rocket
engines and the shuttle's large external fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers authorized the launch attempt after the line
was successfully replaced and tested.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a 10-day mission will place Discovery and its crew in
space over Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Once Discovery reaches the Hubble, astronauts John Grunsfeld,
Mike Foale, Claude Nicollier and Steve Smith have prepared for a
series of four spacewalks to replace the space telescope's six
gyroscopes, a crucial component of the observatory's pointing
system, and make other repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble observations were halted Nov. 13 following the failure of
a fourth gyro.
</P>
<P>
   While the gyro replacements are the mission's highest priority,
Discovery's crew also plans to replace the telescope's flight
computer, a data recorder, a data transmitter and another pointing
system component called the fine guidance sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have approved a rare mission over Christmas, shuttle
managers have said Discovery must be back on the ground by Dec. 28
to avoid any Y2K glitches, though none is anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet that restriction, Discovery must lift off by
Saturday night or wait until January.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was initially planned for mid-October. However, all
missions were halted when the July launching of the shuttle
Columbia experienced an electrical short moments after lift off.
</P>
<P>
   The short was traced to damaged insulation on wiring in
Columbia's fuselage. The finding prompted inspections and repairs
to all of the shuttles, including Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Other setbacks required the replacement of a shuttle rocket
engine and wiring outside the fuselage linking the external tank
and the solid rocket boosters.

BOSTON, US CHAMBERS SPLIT ON RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Siding with Bay State universities instead of its
own sister organization, the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce
said Monday it strongly disagrees with an effort by the US Chamber
of Commerce to broaden a law that requires scientists to reveal the
details of federally funded research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seriously concerned that the US chamber's position
would stifle intellectual inquiry and impede the development of new
technologies,'' said Paul Guzzi, president of the Boston chamber.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a new law that allows anyone to file a request under
the Freedom of Information Act to obtain ``all data'' produced by
researchers on federal grants, including those at hospitals and
universities. The act has given citizens access to federal
documents for 22 years, but until now it did not extend to
nongovernment workers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law last year. But the White House Office of
Management and Budget later ruled that it applied only to a limited
range of research information, and not to any research conducted
before the law took effect last month.
</P>
<P>
   The US chamber says the OMB illegally narrowed the scope of the
law. Last week, it filed three Freedom of Information requests,
including two directed at Harvard University scientists, that are
designed to provoke a lawsuit over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Boston chamber criticized that effort, saying the
new law, if interpreted broadly, could force researchers to break
confidentiality agreements with their research subjects or business
partners and add costs as researchers are forced to respond to
repeated request for information.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the group said, the law may discourage
collaboration between industry and university or hospital
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The two chambers of commerce have independent boards and
funding. William Kovacs, a US chamber vice president, said the
Boston group was siding with its own members, which include Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   The law was largely prompted by a Harvard study that linked
increased air pollution to higher death rates and which was cited
by the US Environmental Protection Agency in setting tougher
clean-air regulations. Those rules would cost industry $50 billion
to $150 billion a year, though they have been suspended pending a
review by the courts, Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very important to see the data that supports
multibillion-dollar regulations,'' Kovacs said, ``and we don't see
any reason why the Boston chamber would want to keep this secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard researchers submitted their data to peer review and
to a review panel funded by both the EPA and business groups. But
releasing it to the public, they have said, would violate
confidentiality agreements with their research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The US chamber says that confidential information is routinely
withheld during Freedom of Information requests and would not be
released under the new law.

JOSEPH HELLER, `CATCH-22' AUTHOR, DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla.)  (Eds: A longer version slugged OBIT-HELLER has moved.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO and HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Heller, the author of ``Catch-22,'' the darkly comic 1961
novel whose title became a universal metaphor not only for the
insanity of war but also for the madness of life itself, died on
Sunday night at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Valerie, said.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Catch-22,'' Heller would go on to write such
well-regarded novels as ``Something Happened,'' ``Good as Gold''
and ``God Knows,'' as well as two memoirs and several plays. But as
acclaimed as his other works were, they were always viewed less
favorably than ``Catch-22,'' which became an American classic,
selling more than 10 million copies in the United States, read in
many of the world's languages, and turned into a 1970 film by Mike
Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22'' was based on Heller's experiences as a bombardier
with the 12th Air Force in the Mediterranean in World War II. The
novel is about a bombardier named John Yossarian who believes his
ambitious, mean-spirited commanding officers are more dangerous
than the Germans. To avoid flying more missions, Yossarian concocts
a mysterious liver ailment, sabotages his plane and tries to get
himself declared insane.
</P>
<P>
   Yossarian discovers that, in the military rule book, anyone who
is declared insane must be excused from flying death-defying
missions. The catch (catch 22) is that one must ask to be excused.
But anyone who is smart enough to show ``rational fear in the face
of clear and present danger'' obviously is sane and must continue
to fly.
</P>
<P>
   With poor reviews from some of the most influential organs,
``Catch-22'' got off to such a slow start that it might have faded
away completely had it not been for strong recommendations by
people who had read it and passed it along to friends. One such
reader was S.J. Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   In time Yossarian became everybody's favorite survivor; by the
mid-1960s, Newsweek was referring to the ``Heller cult,''
consisting mostly of young people addicted to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Heller reintroduced John Yossarian in ``Closing Time,'' a 1994
novel that Simon &AMP; Schuster called ``the sequel to `Catch-22,'''
although Heller preferred to call it a complement to the original.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Yossarian were many of the old favorites from the
original work, especially Milo Minderbinder, the ultimate
manipulator of people and institutions, now a billionaire arms
merchant. Yossarian, twice divorced and living uneasily in New
York, is working for Minderbinder as an Establishment lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Heller was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn,
in New York City, on May 1, 1923, the son of Isaac Donald Heller,
who drove a delivery truck for a wholesale baker, and Lena Heller.
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph was 5, his father died as a result of complications
from a bleeding ulcer. Of his father, Heller wrote in his 1998
memoir, ``Now and Then: From Coney Island to Here'' (Knopf): ``I
simply lost interest in him after he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he made no attempt for 30 years to find out the cause of
his father's death until he had gone to a psychiatrist because of
the break-up of his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Heller's first job was as a blacksmith's helper at the Norfolk
Navy Yard in Virginia. After the United States entered World War
II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to armorer's school and would have been very happy
to remain there; people who made armor and affixed it to war
machines did not usually go into combat. But he heard a rumor that
armorers were being turned into gunners and gunners' lives were
``worth no more than three days.'' So he went to cadet school and
became a bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant and, like Yossarian in
``Catch-22,'' was sent on bombing runs over France and Italy.
Yossarian was stationed on Pianosa, an imaginary island off the
Italian coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Heller was stationed on
Corsica, which happened to be in about the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Heller knew no fear until he flew his 37th mission. ``Until
then, it was all play,'' he wrote in The New York Times Magazine in
May 1995. ``I was so brainwashed by Hollywood's image of heroism
that I was disappointed when nobody shot back at us,'' he recalled.
``I was a jackass. I thought it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't any fun at all when he saw planes flown by his
friends destroyed in combat. And then his own B-25 was hit by flak,
wounding the top turret gunner. After that, he said, ``I wanted
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1945, he was discharged after having flown on 60
missions. Using the benefits of the GI Bill of Rights, he studied
first at the University of California, then transferred to New York
University, where he earned a Phi Beta Kappa key and graduated in
the class of 1948 with a major in English. He then earned a
master's in literature from Columbia, won a Fulbright Scholarship
and studied at Oxford University in England in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States, he got a job teaching freshman
writing at Penn State University. He then worked for Time
magazine's advertising department from 1952 to 1956 and did the
same thing for Look magazine from 1956 to 1958. He served as a
promotion man for McCall's magazine from 1958 to 1961 and also
worked briefly for Remington Rand, the typewriter manufacturer, in
the advertising department.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Valerie, Heller is survived by a
daughter, Erica Heller of New York; a son, Theodore of New York,
who is a novelist; and a sister, Sylvia Heller of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Heller kept writing as he went from job to job,
and his stories were published from time to time in Esquire, the
Atlantic Monthly and Cosmopolitan. In the 1950s, he wrote a short
story that was evocative of his experiences in the Air Force and in
his spare time he expanded it, slowly building it into the novel
that was called ``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   When an interviewer told him, late in his life, that he had
never written anything as good as ``Catch-22,'' Heller, a man who
knew his worth, replied, ``Who has?''

ABSENCE OF DIGNITARIES AT HIS FUNERAL IS SEEN AS BOOST TO TUDJMAN'S
PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Croatia's first president, Franjo Tudjman, was
buried Monday in a somber ceremony, mourned by tens of thousands of
the Croats to whom he helped deliver independence and by a
less-than-stellar panoply of foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands lined the streets in a light rain as the funeral
cortege moved from the presidential palace, on one of Zagreb's
hills, to the Mirogoj cemetery, on another. Tudjman's oak coffin,
covered with a Croatian flag, rested on a gun carriage drawn by a
jeep. The ceremony, which had a military cast, was capped by a
Roman Catholic service for this onetime Communist general in Tito's
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was removed from the coffin by a military honor guard
and folded, displaying its red-and-white checkerboard pattern.
Tudjman's widow, Ankica, took the flag, sobbing, and held it
against the black veil in front of her face, hiding her tears.
</P>
<P>
   But given Tudjman's authoritarian rule and his reluctance to
cooperate with the United Nations' tribunal on war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia, the level of representation here by foreign
countries was noticeably low. The few heads of state present
included President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and the Croat member
of Bosnia's three-member presidency, Ante Jelavic, and there were
heads of government from Hungary, Macedonia, Slovenia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries generally sent lower-level diplomats, or _
like the United States _ were represented only by their
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   This calculated snub could backfire in the coming parliamentary
and presidential elections and help Tudjman's party, the Croatian
Democratic Union, or HDZ, warned Davor Butkovic, a political
analyst writing in the daily newspaper Jutarnji List. ``Such a
demonstration of distaste for Tudjman will not only strengthen and
unite the voting base of the HDZ, which is anti-European anyway,
but may seriously affect those who are still undecided,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Notes of condolence came from some former colleagues and enemies
including President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, President
Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro and the Bosnian Muslim leader, Alija
Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's death and the parliamentary election planned for Jan.
3, which a six-party opposition coalition is expected to win, are
likely to set Croatia in a more Western-oriented, democratic
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tudjman's critics here have praised him for his role in
founding Croatia from the wreckage of Tito's Yugoslavia, and they
say his position in history is secure.
</P>
<P>
   But Tudjman, who was 77 years old, also conspired with Milosevic
to divide Bosnia between them. His army was responsible for one of
the largest and most rapid sieges against an ethnic population in
modern Europe, during the Bosnian war: the expulsion in August 1995
of at least 150,000 Croatian Serbs, driving them into Bosnia and
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman ruled like an autocrat with a single party, after the
model of Tito himself. After 1993, and especially in the period
after his stomach cancer was diagnosed in late 1996, officials say,
he grew increasingly remote, impatient and averse to hearing bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Jadranko Crnic, the chairman of the Constitutional Court until a
week ago, said it was not proper to criticize Tudjman too harshly
so soon after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Croatia needs to move in a more democratic direction,''
said Crnic in an interview. ``Everyone in every political party
should accept the idea that there should never again be a president
with as much power as he had under the current constitution.
Everyone should agree that power should flow from the Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Crnic remembered how Tudjman criticized him sharply for not
putting his hand over his heart during the playing of the national
anthem _ a gesture here of devotion to Tudjman's ruling Croatian
Democratic Union, not to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told him as chairman of the court I could favor no
party,'' Crnic said. ``And he was very angry with me. So we kept
our distance from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and officials have described Tudjman's
tantrums and obsessions with Western ``plots'' supposedly designed
to undermine Croatia's independence and to keep it out of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian intelligence services have a large role here, state
television is under the control of the ruling party and the
independent press is harassed. But perhaps more important for the
West has been Tudjman's reluctance to cooperate fully with the war
crimes tribunal in The Hague and to hand over indicted individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman also discouraged the Bosnian Croats, who can vote in
elections here, from cooperating fully with the Bosnian Muslims in
the federation that the United States cobbled together before the
Dayton peace accords, which stopped the civil war in Bosnia in late
1995. Tudjman's party has important political support from these
voters in the Croatian diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections should also be held within 60 days of
Tudjman's officially declared time of death, at 11:15 p.m. on Dec.
10. But even Crnic said the constitution is a bit unclear about
whether presidential elections, likely to include two rounds of
voting, must be finished in 60 days or simply called by then.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The opposition, led by the Social Democratic leader, Ivica
Racan, and the Social Liberal leader, Drazen Budisa, has promised
better cooperation with the war crimes tribunal and is being openly
supported by the United States. Budisa is considered likely to be
the main opposition candidate for the presidency, while Racan is
likely to become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Racan, the former leader of the Communist Party, is highly
respected here as a man with democratic instincts, who supported
elections here in 1990 rather than cracking down with the force of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the two opposition leaders have done little to press their
case in the last two weeks, said a former adviser to Tudjman and
political analyst, Slaven Letica. ``The opposition has been doing
nothing and expects to win anyway,'' Letica said. ``They missed the
last five years, doing nothing except negotiating with the
leadership of Tudjman's party, and many of them acquired the same
bureaucratic mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Letica said, he predicts that the opposition parties will
win almost twice as many seats as Tudjman's party, but not enough
for a two-thirds majority that would guarantee constitutional
change. And any new government will inherit a poisoned chalice of
economic recession, high unemployment and taxes, bloated state
industries and a large national debt, requiring painful political
choices to turn the economy around.

JOSEPH HELLER, AUTHOR, COINER OF `CATCH-22,' DEAD AT 76
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Heller, one of this century's most important writers who
died on Sunday of a heart attack at age 76, didn't invent the
satiric novel. But ``Catch-22,'' Mr. Heller's acknowledged World
War II classic published in 1961, may have perfected the form _
and, in its way, forever overshadowed Heller's brilliance as a
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his five subsequent novels, two autobiographies and
three stage plays had their own literary wonders to offer, but Mr.
Heller was destined to be known almost exclusively for his first
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Closing Time,'' Mr. Heller's sequel to ``Catch-22's''
tale of bombardier Capt. John Yossarian and his motley associates,
failed to crack the top rungs of national bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers who loved `Catch-22' didn't want the characters
changing even a little,'' said Kenneth Kirkland, a publishing
industry analyst in New York City. ``Joe Heller wrote such a
perfect first book that he didn't leave himself or Yossarian room
to grow with readers after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas novelist/musician Kinky Friedman, a longtime friend, said
Mr. Heller ``has now flown his last mission. He had a lot of
friends, enjoyed a lot of food and had a lot of fun in his life. He
enjoyed his celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller, born in Brooklyn to poor Jewish parents, graduated
from high school in 1941 and soon after enlisted in the Army Air
Force. Sent to Corsica during World War II, he flew 60 missions as
a B-25 bombardier before returning to the United States and
attending college on the G.I. Bill. Afterward, he taught college
literature courses before becoming an advertising copywriter for
Time and Look magazines, and serving as promotion manager for
McCall's.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller's ambition was to write full time. While still
working at the magazines, he began selling short stories to
Esquire, Atlantic Monthly and other publications. In 1961,
``Catch-22,'' his first novel, was published but gained little
attention from critics or sales in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   But, in 1962, author S.J. Perelman praised the book in an
interview with the old New York Herald-Tribune. Gradually, word of
mouth and more frequent media attention helped ``Catch-22'' gain a
worldwide audience, particularly on college campuses. Eventually,
``Catch-22'' sold more than 10 million copies and the book's title
entered modern jargon.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Yossarian and other combat fliers faced an odd
military regulation. Anyone crazed by battle fatigue could ask to
be relieved of combat flight duty. But anyone asking to be excused
from dangerous missions had to be sane. Other no-win situations in
the book were also described as ``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, The User's Webster Dictionary defines ``Catch-22'' as ``a
situation in which one is victimized either way, as when an
applicant is refused jobs because he lacks job experience and lacks
experience because he is refused jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Income from the book and appearances on the lecture circuit left
Mr. Heller time to write as he pleased. Fighting writer's block and
a fear of disappointing fans, he wrote plays _ ``We Bombed in New
Haven'' and a stage adaptation of ``Catch-22,'' as well as
``Clevinger's Trial,'' based on scenes from the novel, before
finally publishing ``Something Happened'' in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something Happened,'' a wrenchingly accurate first-person
account of a business executive's life, was brilliantly realized.
Critics swooned, but readers were surprised by the tale's lack of
humor, even humor of a darker nature. ``Something Happened'' didn't
fail completely _ it sold respectably enough to make bestseller
lists _ but, despite its near-unparalleled excellence, it was soon
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heller kept trying. ``Good as Gold'' in 1979 was a clumsy
attempt to satirize U.S. government in general and Henry Kissinger
in particular; ``God Knows'' in 1984 was a muddled exploration of
biblical history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Mr. Heller was found to have Guillain-Barre syndrome, a
paralyzing disease of the nervous system. The severe illness
required a long convalescence, which he recounted in ``No Laughing
Matter.'' The book included material about Mr. Heller's divorce
from his first wife and the courting of his second, a nurse who was
assigned to his case.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman recalled visiting Mr. Heller in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Radio personality Don ``Imus and I went to see him, and Imus
brought a copy of ``Something Happened'' with him,'' Friedman said.
``Heller looked at ``Something Happened'' and said, `That's my
favorite book of mine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Mr. Heller was back with ``Picture This,'' another
novel that failed to satisfy readers addicted to Yossarian. Word
soon spread through the publishing industry that Mr. Heller was
finally working on a ``Catch-22'' sequel; critics predicted that,
whether written badly or well, the book would sell impressively.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Closing Time'' didn't. A story that transposed Yossarian
and a few other ``Catch-22'' characters to modern-day New York City
and the business rat race there, ``Closing Time'' became considered
the publishing dud of 1994, at least based on low sales. The book
failed to crack any prestigious bestseller list. Critics offered
lukewarm praise, noting the author's apparent certainty that modern
civilization, along with Yossarian &AMP; Co., was pretty much doomed.
</P>
<P>
   While Mr. Heller's health had improved _ he was able to conduct
numerous interviews to publicize ``Closing Time'' _ there was still
a sense, in his public comments as well as his work, that time was
limited.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mr. Heller published ``Now and Then: From Coney Island
to Here,'' a scintillating autobiography that alternately evoked
chuckles and tears. In the book, Mr. Heller honestly addressed his
perceived deficiencies as a son, husband, father and author, and
the elegiac tone hinted ominously at a writer's public farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be remembered for his classic books, his dark _ some
would say wicked _ wit and his bright _ some would say sacred _
wisdom,'' Friedman said. ``I say Joseph Heller is brother to
Yossarian.''

 &HT;    Profit cuts of tobacco companies coming from foreign farming
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An alliance of anti-smoking public-health groups says
tobacco farms from Kentucky to Georgia are making less money
because of Big Tobacco's shift to foreign markets not because of
the multibillion-dollar settlement with 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be released today by the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, researchers argue that, even before the national
settlement, the nation's largest tobacco companies started shifting
to overseas farms.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies disputed the report and officials said quota
cuts are the cost of litigation. Higher prices, companies say, have
led to dramatic drops in domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But the 89-page report, co-sponsored by the American Cancer
Society and the American Heart Association, says farmers are
hurting primarily because business is going abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco litigation is like a drop in the bucket of the
ocean in terms of the current plight of the family farmer,'' Matt
Myers, president-designate of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
said Monday. ``Most of the decline in the use of American tobacco
documented by this report occurred before the tobacco industry's
settlement with the states.''
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Kentucky tobacco farmer Henry West has watched the
basic quota for burley tobacco drop more than 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like a suburbanite whose home falls in price, a tobacco farmer
who loses quota watches his most valuable asset depreciate. With
federal price supports, farmers can make up to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfriendly circumstances in this country have contributed
to (Big Tobacco) moving production to other parts of the world,''
West said in an interview Monday. ``I'm sure they don't have that
same attitude in other parts of the world. In fact, they look
forward to the jobs that it creates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Marlboro, for example. Marlboro made here is more likely
to have our tobacco in it. But Marlboro made in Moscow, or
wherever, is less likely to have our tobacco _ and that takes its
toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the nation's biggest tobacco companies agreed to pay
a $206 billion settlement to 46 states. Another $5.15 billion was
set aside to compensate growers over 12 years for an anticipated
decrease in cigarette demand.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the U.S. Justice Department brought suit against
Big Tobacco in an attempt to to recover hundreds of billions of
federal health care dollars spent to treat illnesses blamed on
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the real threat to farmers, claims the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the 6- to 10-percent decline in U.S. consumption, which
we expected to see in 1999 as a result of the settlement, will have
only a small impact on the family farmer because of how much
American tobacco is not used in domestic cigarettes,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said the purpose of the report, which relied on statistics
from cigarette companies and the U.S. Agriculture Department, was
to underscore the ``hidden changes'' between Big Tobacco and
domestic growers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Philip Morris, the country's largest cigarette maker,
discounts the report.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pheil, director of communications for Philip Morris USA,
said the company's mix of domestic and foreign tobacco in U.S.
cigarettes has remained at 3-to-1 for years. There's been a
``significant decline'' in consumption since last year's
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``is a manifestation of the anti-smoking forces
trying to drive a wedge between tobacco growing communities and the
tobacco companies,'' Pheil said. But Terry Harper of Georgia, a
fourth-generation tobacco farmer, believes foreign markets are the
root of his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' Harper said Monday. ``This is our borrowing
power at the bank. That's our asset.'' Three years ago, Harper
invested $70,000 on tractors and barns _ specialized equipment that
can't be used elsewhere on the farm. He uses only about 40 percent
of the equipment today because of decreased demand. West, the
Kentucky tobacco farmer, doesn't smoke. But he can agree with
public-health agencies that children shouldn't light up.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, though, should be free to make up their own minds, he
says. West, like other farmers, are into tobacco for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what pays our bills,'' West said. ``It's what puts food
on the table.''

<P>
   MAKHACHKALA, Russia _ Russian forces advanced to the outskirts
of Grozny Monday, as the senior Kremlin policymaker on Chechnya
predicted that the city would be seized within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fighting was a fresh indication that the battle for the
Chechen capital has entered a decisive phase even as thousands of
civilians remained trapped in the city.
</P>
<P>
   After a lull of several days, the Russian military resumed
artillery barrages against Grozny. Russian forces had suspended air
and artillery attacks against the city to encourage civilians to
flee. But to keep military pressure on the Islamic militants there,
the Russians now intend to stop the bombardment for several hours a
day and then start up their attacks again.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Vladmir Shamanov, commander of the Western Group of
forces in Chechnya, said the Russian troops had no plans to stage a
frontal assault on the city. But he also disclosed that Russian
soldiers would conduct reconnaissance and commando operations
inside Grozny to help Russian troops infiltrate and occupy the
city.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that efforts to establish a foothold on the outskirts
of the city were already under way. Russian troops briefly seized
the airport in the Khankala district on the city's edge, but by
Monday night the rebels seemed to have the airfield under their
control, according to reports from the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to establish a foothold on the outskirts and get
the civilians out by military transport,'' Shamanov said. ``After
they are out, reconnaissance and other special operations will be
carried out over two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the Russian military would be able to
help Grozny's civilians leave the city before its capture.
</P>
<P>
   In the fighting elsewhere in Chechnya, the Russian Air Force
said it had lost one aircraft, but insisted that this was the
result of a mechanical failure. Islamic militants said they had
shot the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying conflict has provoked alarm in the West that
many civilian lives will be lost. The Russians have established two
escape routes for civilians to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure how many civilians are still in Grozny,
but estimates range up to 50,000. With the city surrounded by
Russian armor and bands of militants roaming the streets, however,
many people appear too frightened to try leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian officials and the rebels say civilians have been
killed in the fighting _ Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in
parliament Monday that 68 civilians were killed in recent days _
but each side has blamed the other for the casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Vollebaek, the chairman of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe and Norway's foreign minister, has begun a
visit to the region to assess the situation. Russia agreed to the
visit last month at a European security conference in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek will arrive on Tuesday here in Makhachkala, the
capital of Dagestan, a small Caucasus republic that borders
Chechnya and is part of Russia. Dagestan was invaded by
Chechen-based Islamic rebels in August, the first blow in what has
become a raging war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vollebaek plans to visit Russian-controlled areas
of Chechnya and the neighboring republic of Ingushetiya, where
thousands of refugees are still living in squalid camps, before
returning to Europe to brief the OSCE and NATO on his findings.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that the Russian government will be
influenced by any Western calls for restraint now that it senses it
has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the rebels to surrender, the Russian Parliament on
Monday passed a law providing an amnesty to any rebels who turn
themselves in by Feb. 1. Putin said the move was an important part
of the Kremlin's strategy to prevail in the conflict while limiting
Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Grozny, however, is unlikely to wait that long.
Nikolai Koshman, the Russian deputy prime minister who oversees
Chechnya policy, said he expected Russian forces to capture the
city within seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate may be optimistic; Grozny is a big city and may
contain die-hards. But Shamanov has vowed that the Islamic rebels
in Grozny will not survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has had two basic objectives: isolating the
rebels in Grozny to force their capitulation, and chasing the rest
of the rebel force into the mountains to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have made steady progress toward both ends.
Grozny appears to be surrounded, and Russian forces have taken key
towns in the south. Urus-Martan has fallen to the Russians, and
Shali has been encircled.
</P>
<P>
   When possible, Russian forces have sought to intimidate towns
into surrendering. At the southern town of Chiri-Yurt, militants
said they were ready to give in, according to reports from
Chechnya. Towns that have become bases of rebel resistance, perhaps
even against the will of many of their inhabitants, have been
pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task was to create an outer circle around Grozny and to
destroy or push the remnants of the bandits to the mountains,''
Shamanov said, using the military's term for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of combatants in the conflict have
varied. The Russian military has refused to say how many of its
troops are involved, but it is believed to exceed 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev said the rebel force consisted
of 2,000 militants in Grozny and another 2,000 in the south. That
is far fewer than the 15,000 men the rebels were once said to have.
Either way, however, they are badly outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little prospect of a political compromise that might
avert Russia's military seizure of Grozny. With an eye to Western
public opinion, the Kremlin has said it is willing to talk as long
as its demands are met: the handover of the Chechen warlords who
led the attack on Dagestan and the release of hundreds of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a Russian audience, Putin indicated on Sunday that
he did not expect a political solution. ``We have no choice but to
carry this anti-terrorist operation through,'' he said.

JUSTICES LET STAND VERMONT'S TUITION-REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Refiling for those needing) 
 
STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for
Vermont to keep providing tuition assistance to private, secular
schools, while withholding similar aid from parochial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Religious-school parents had unsuccessfully challenged the state
funding program as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that Vermont's refusal to assist sectarian schools
in the same way it aids other private institutions amounted to
religious discrimination, in violation of the parents' First
Amendment right to practice their religion free of governmental
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vermont Supreme Court, in a decision the federal
justices let stand, ruled that the state's decision to withhold
tuition assistance to parochial schools was required by the
constitutional mandate that government not endorse religion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. high court's refusal, without comment, to hear the case
neither set a national precedent nor settled the growing political
debate regarding whether states should provide tax breaks, or
``vouchers,'' to parents who send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of voucher programs, mostly Republicans, view them as
an effective way to give parents greater choice in deciding where
their children are educated.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, largely Democrats, regard vouchers as an
abdication of government's primary responsibility to use tax
revenue to improve the public school system, not to subsidize
private institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by declining to hear the case, sidestepped the
opportunity to resolve the constitutional conflict between the
opposing state obligations of ensuring people the right to practice
their faiths freely and of not endorsing religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont parochial-school parents, in their unsuccessful
appeal to the justices, pressed the court to favor the First
Amendment right to free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious expression _ including choosing to educate one's
child in a religious tradition _ has long been valued, not feared,
in our constitutional tradition,'' wrote the parents' lawyer,
William Meub of Rutland, Vt., in a legal brief to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed for many low-income parents, choosing how to educate
their children may be one of the few available vehicles for
expressing publicly their beliefs about matters of ultimate
concern,'' Meub added. ``Vermont's unjustified exclusion of
religious schools from its (tuition) program effectively precludes
low-income parents from enjoying the fulfillment and satisfaction
such expression brings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell countered that the
First Amendment prohibits states from giving tuition assistance to
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to send one's child to a sectarian school does not
include the right to have the government pay for religious
education,'' Sorrell wrote in a brief to the justices. ``The state
has no obligation to subsidize a religious education. On the
contrary, it is barred from doing so by the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case was a Vermont statute that calls for school
districts in the state either to provide a public high school or
pay the tuition for a student to attend a private, neighborhood
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's tuition-reimbursement program, which dates back 130
years, is aimed at high school students whose local school
districts do not operate a public high school. State law allows
such school districts to pay tuition for students to attend a
public or private high school.
</P>
<P>
   Of Vermont's 290 school districts, 88 paid tuition for all or
some of their high school students in the 1995-96 school year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Chittenden, Va., School Board authorized that
tuition be paid for students attending private parochial schools,
including Mount St. Joseph Academy, a Catholic high school in
nearby Rutland. But the Vermont education department intervened and
withheld state money to the school district, saying that its
planned tuition payments for parochial schools would be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of academy students then sued the state, arguing that
its refusal to pay tuition violated their religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But a state trial court sided with Vermont, ruling that tuition
payments to religious schools would violate the constitutional
separation of church and state. The Vermont Supreme Court agreed.

HEARING OPENS ON WHETHER TRIPP WILL STAND TRIAL FOR TAPING
LEWINSKY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Drops `illegally' from lede.) 
 (ms) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Some of the prosecutors who helped direct
the independent counsel's investigation of President Clinton told a
court hearing Monday that they never promised Linda Tripp immunity
from prosecution in Maryland for taping telephone conversations
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the three prosecutors said they told Ms. Tripp that if
she turned over the tapes and cooperated with them in investigating
the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, they would make it
almost impossible for Maryland authorities to win a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' accounts came on the first day of a hearing to
determine whether Mrs. Tripp must stand trial here in Howard
County, a suburb of Baltimore, on charges of violating a state law
against secretly recording telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   While the impeachment battle has long since been concluded, Mrs.
Tripp remains enmeshed in the drama she helped create. She has been
indicted on two felony counts for which she could face up to 10
years in jail for taping Ms. Lewinsky as the latter talked about
her relationship with the president. Maryland is one of several
states that prohibit tape recording telephone conversations without
the other person's consent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prosecutors, Jackie Bennett, who had been a deputy
independent counsel, told the court that he had tried to explain to
Mrs. Tripp that the immunity agreement he offered did not bind the
state of Maryland but only the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, he made it clear that it would be
extremely difficult for Maryland to prosecute her because the tape
recordings and everything else connected with them would have been
produced to the independent counsel, Ken Starr, under a grant of
immunity guaranteeing they could not be used against her in any
legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a constitutional matter we could not prevent Maryland from
bringing a prosecution,'' he said. ``What we could do is make it a
very, very difficult if not insurmountable for the state to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the scenario described by Bennett, the state would have to
demonstrate that it learned of Mrs. Tripp's taping through some
other means than the activities of the independent counsel,
including his report to Congress asserting Clinton had committed
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp herself was absent for Monday's hearing and is not
expected to be present at any time during the week, even if Ms.
Lewinsky testifies. Her lawyer, Joseph Murtha, Monday asked and
received permission from Judge Diane O. Leasure for Mrs. Tripp to
be absent during the entire hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha read aloud an affidavit given by Mrs. Tripp in which
she insisted that she only cooperated with Starr's office because
of assurances that she was totally safe from any prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and another former member of Starr's staff, Stephen
Binhak, both told the court that when Mrs. Tripp first informed the
independent counsel's office in January 1998 that she had made tape
recordings on her home telephone she was concerned that she might
have violated Maryland's laws. Binhak said it was one of the main
topics of conversation when he, Bennett and others from the office
went to Mrs. Tripp's home in Columbia, Md., on Jan. 16 to discuss
taking control of the tape recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Binhak said he explained that the federal government and the
state of Maryland were separate entities and one could not bind the
other. ``I told her we would do all we could to make it an
evidentiary problem for the state of Maryland,'' he said. But, he
added, ``I don't think she was grasping the technicalities. She
believed we would literally just be able to stop the state from
bringing an indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules that the immunity conferred on Mrs. Tripp by
lawyers from Starr's office does not extend to Maryland, state
prosecutors face a second, more daunting hurdle. They will try to
show this week that they and members of the grand jury learned of
Mrs. Tripp's taping through means other than Starr's activities.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutors fail to win either argument, they have
acknowledged they will be left with little evidence with which to
bring their case against Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also told the court Monday that in the first few days
after news of the Lewinsky investigation appeared in the media, he
received a frantic telephone call from the elected prosecutor of
Howard County, Marna McLendon, on Jan. 26, 1998. He said Ms.
McLendon told him she was coming under tremendous pressure to
investigate Mrs. Tripp under the state's wiretap laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``She indicated that she was under pressure that was becoming
unbearable to her,'' he said, including much from local Democrats.
``There was political pressure to bring an indictment.''

BARAK OVERCOMES STIFF RESISTANCE IN KNESSET TO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Giving up war-won land in the Golan Heights for
peace with Syria will be painful, but is a price worth paying,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak insisted Monday before a stormy session
of Israel's parliament as he sought a declaration of support for
the dramatic diplomatic initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Knesset, voting 47-31 with 24 abstentions, gave
its blessing over the talks in Washington Wednesday, the highest
level negotiations in a half century of conflict between the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our supreme responsibility is to act today so that we will not
dig new rows of graves tomorrow in a conflict that could have been
ended,'' Barak said in a hoarse voice over bursts of angry shouts
from the opposition. He stopped intermittently to glare at hecklers
while the speaker of the Knesset banged a gavel and tried to
restore order.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak spoke some 5,000 Golan settlers and their supporters
demonstrated on a cold, rainy hilltop outside the parliament
building. Later thousands of activists for Peace Now held a counter
demonstration supporting Barak's intiative.
</P>
<P>
   The sincere optimism that seems to have swept through the Middle
East after this breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian track of the
peace process has been met with the mounting tension within Israel
over whether the Jewish state should give back land that it paid
for with the lives of young soldiers in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast
wars.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that even if Barak can reach a deal with the Syrians,
he will have to work perhaps even harder to sell the deal to his
constituents back home. Barak has reaffirmed a campaign promise
that he would not sign any final peace agreements unless Israel had
a chance to vote on it in a public referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing the challenge he faces, seven members of Barak's
own 68-member coalition voted against the symbolic measure and 19
abstained, including all 17 members of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak dismissed the less-than-overwhelming Knesset endorsement
as a ``temporary stage'' on the way to a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we succeed in bringing before the nation a peace agreement
with Syria that will strengthen Israel's security . . . it will
pass by an overwhelming majority,'' he said in a statement
following the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary hawk and opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, addressing
the Knesset after Barak, fumed that Syrian President Hafez Assad
was a ``dictator whose path was ending'' and accused Barak of
gambling away Israel's security for his own political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is being asked to pay by giving up strategic assets
while getting nothing in return,'' Sharon added.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was raucous although relatively restrained by Israeli
standards, especially considering the profound issue at hand.
Giving back the Golan Heights where some 18,000 Israelis have lived
for a generation will not be an easy task for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four years since peace talks collapsed between
Israel and Syria, Barak and Assad have taken a dramatic step
forward by agreeing to resume negotiations _ and holding them on a
higher level than they ever have been in the 51-year history of the
state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will meet Wednesday and Thursday with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk Sharaa, who will be representing the aging and
ailing Assad, 69, who analysts say is anxious to reach a peace deal
to put the nation's affairs in order before his politically
inexperienced son Bashar takes over.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are expected to be grueling. Even though the two sides
are expressing optimism, their final positions seem far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Syria insists that Israel, which captured the strategic Golan
Heights in 1967 and held onto it in bloody fighting in 1973, pull
its troops back to the pre-war 1967 borders which would end at the
northern shores of the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has publicly balked at such borders as jeapordizing
Israel's military security and access to the Sea of Galilee,
one-third of Israel's water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is demanding that Syria demlitarize its border which is
now heavily fortified with tanks and more than six divisions of
soldiers. Israel is also insisting on establishing early warning
military monitoring posts in the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   A peace agreement between Israel and Syria would likely defuse
the conflict in Lebanon, the last active Arab-Israeli warfront in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon by July.

MOTHER RECEIVES 30 MONTHS FOR RENTING BABY TO SMUGGLERS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Honduran woman who rented her baby for use by
illegal immigrants wanting to pose as a family as they crossed the
Texas border from Mexico was sentenced to 30 months in federal
prison Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon sentenced Susana Clemintina
Espinal, 30, to prison for a year longer than the federal
guidelines recommendation and three years on supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Doug Davis said he had asked Harmon for the stiffer
penalty because ``Baby Stephanie'' was exposed to significant
danger as she was passed into strangers' hands for use as a
``prop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Espinal) didn't know these people, or if they would take
care of the baby or even if she'd get the baby back,'' said Davis.
``This was a 6-month-old, totally helpless baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinal pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to induce
undocumented immigrants to come to, enter or remain in the United
States. Immigrant smugglers paid her $200 to rent the baby for use
by undocumented persons attempting to enter this country in
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials said using infants as ``props'' has
increased as intensive border-control initiatives have made it
harder to slip into the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   To get their clients into the United States, smugglers pair
unrelated men and women and provide them with an infant so they
appear to be a family.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme is intended to take advantage of a Border Patrol
practice of not charging undocumented immigrants who get caught
with illegal entry _ an offense that may carry prison time _ if
they have a child in their care, said U.S. Attorney Mervyn
Mosbacker.
</P>
<P>
   Agents usually just escort families back across the border,
rather than hold them in detention facilities to await prosecution,
punishment and eventual deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers _ who charge as much as $2,000 for assisting in
illegal treks across the Texas border _ may have also believed that
a ``family'' would be less likely to arouse the suspicion by
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling scheme began to unravel in March when Border
Patrol agent Griselda Vidrio in Brownsville noticed a couple
crossing the border with the same baby she had seen earlier that
morning with another couple.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vidrio noticed that the ``mother'' seemed unaccustomed to holding a
baby and had brought only two diapers, one bottle of formula and no
extra clothes.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also recognized a red, beaded bracelet the baby was
wearing and recalled seeing the child with a man who said he and
his baby had survived Hurricane Mitch but that the child's mother
had perished.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned, the couple admitted they were not married and
that the child had been supplied by smugglers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The infant was ultimately taken into custody by INS officials,
who began to search for the parents. Espinal was identified as the
mother after she filed a missing person report with the Houston
Police Department. She stated then that her baby had been
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Espinal, convicted previously for possession of crack cocaine,
confessed after INS agents confronted her with pictures of the
child being used by two sets of ``parents,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said she rented ``Baby Stephanie'' to smugglers at
least three times.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is still in custody of Child Protective Services, Davis
said.

POWERFUL `LES MIZ' RETURNS TO L.A.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Les Miserables'' may be the perfect holiday show
for a secular age, a one-size-fits-all musical that translates
easily and transcends religious hair-splitting. Sort of like ``A
Christmas Carol,'' only with its own trademark logo.
</P>
<P>
   Like other great spiritual epics, ``Les Miz'' has saints,
sinners, martyrdom, sacrifice and redemption, plus comic relief, a
love interest or two, and a fistful of lovely melodies that seem to
grow richer with repeated listenings. It even has poor, misguided
Inspector Javert, hurling himself off a Paris bridge like a cross
between Milton's Satan and Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey in ``It's
a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Les Miz'' for you: high-minded ideals commingling with
old-fashioned melodrama, populist entertainment without pandering.
The thinking-person's tear-jerker.
</P>
<P>
   All those qualities are again present in the stirring and
sturdy, if not quite first-rate touring production of the show that
stormed into the Ahmanson Theatre Sunday night, where it will
remain through mid-February. Although the leads _ Ivan Rutherford
as crusading Christian humanist Jean Valjean and Stephen Bishop as
fanatical lawman Javert _ are worthy successors to Colm Wilkinson
and Terrence Mann, the company overall at times lacks a certain
crispness of execution, a sense of discovery that may be difficult
to replicate after more than a dozen years on Broadway and in
London. Musical tempos have been slowed down a shade, so that
lyrics are clearer, but some transitions among numbers now show
their seams more conspicuously than before.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the producers' assurances that this is the first
full-scale, hydraulically souped-up version of ``Les Miz'' to hit
Los Angeles in several years, those monumental John Caird sets
always look pretty much the same to me, rising out of the gloomy
Paris slums like a giant assemblage sculpture. As Spiro Agnew
might've observed, seen one barricade, you've seen 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   None of this really detracts, however, from the primal
storytelling power of this panoramic adaptation of Victor Hugo's
elephantine novel, nor from the literateness and melodic catchiness
of the Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg score. At
three-plus hours long, ``Les Miserables'' remains one of the most
satisfyingly complete mass entertainments ever devised. Director
Trevor Nunn's turntable staging still sweeps the action along,
pulling us through the stodgy early exposition and reaching its
stirring culmination with the backlit, slow-mo deaths of the
revolutionaries atop the barricades. If you don't get the shivers
at this stuff, you may want to check your pulse.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to invent a purer portrayal of Gallic
saintliness than Rutherford's Valjean, the ex-convict turned
people's hero, or to imagine a sweeter tenor than his on numbers
like ``Bring Him Home.'' His counterpoint Bishop conveys Javert's
transition from self-righteousness to self-doubt with a pro's
confident economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the secondary characters, Tim Howar (Marius) and Sutton
Foster (Eponine) make the most of their big numbers, the melancholy
``Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'' and the pop-torch belter ``On My
Own,'' respectively. As the predatory Thenardiers, J.P. Dougherty
and Aymee Garcia are rouged Daumier caricatures sprung to life.
</P>
<P>
   And while Joan Almedilla's Fantine is perhaps too much the
passive victim, Kevin Earley makes for a noble Enjolras, the
student leader, Regan Thiel brings a warm vibrato to the bland
Cosette role, and local lad Cameron Teitelman is the most
refreshingly uncloying Gavroche in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the years under its belt, ``Les Miz'' somehow always
arrives at the same place: an auditorium full of people clearing
their throats and wiping their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   By that final celestial chorus of ``Do You Hear the People
Sing?'' I lost my own Brechtian battle to hold my mucous membranes
at bay. Funny _ that always seems to happen whenever ``Les Miz''
comes to town. &QL;

EBAY SUIT TO TEST LEGALITY OF COMMERCIAL SITE LINKING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small Burlington, Mass. company that lists prices from dozens
of Internet auctions is being sued by eBay Inc., the world's
largest Internet auction service, in a case with major implications
for the conduct of business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether a Web site can profit from linking to
information contained on a different site.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders Edge Inc. is one of several Internet auction search
services. These Web sites let shoppers search for items at many
Internet auction sites at once, instead of having to make separate
visits to each site.
</P>
<P>
   Most auction sites welcome services like Bidders Edge, believing
that it will draw more visitors to their sites. But eBay, of San
Jose, Calif., already the industry leader, doesn't want another
company making a profit by offering information listed on the eBay
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a company that is attempting to benefit off the
investment that eBay has made over the past four years,'' said eBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove.
</P>
<P>
   The price, quantity and bidding data on its site are unique,
eBay says, adding that no other Web site can display this
information without eBay's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Two auction search companies, AuctionRover and iTrack, have
obtained licenses to include eBay listings in a separate area on
their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders Edge also met with eBay to negotiate a licensing
agreement, but found eBay's terms unacceptable. ``We just weren't
willing to sign something that didn't make sense for us,'' said
Bidders Edge's chief executive, James Carney.
</P>
<P>
   So eBay has filed suit in US District Court in San Jose under a
California statute originally written to fight ``cracking,'' or
breaking into computer. This, eBay contends, is exactly what
Bidders Edge is doing by displaying eBay auction information on the
Bidders Edge site. The suit accuses Bidders Edge of a host of
illegal activities, including tresspassing, copyright infringement
and false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Bidders Edge executives argue that there are hundreds of
search services on the Internet that create indexes of data stored
at other firms' Web sites. None of them could continue to operate
if they had to get permission from hundreds of thousands of Web
sites before indexing them.
</P>
<P>
   Carney said that small, privately held Bidders Edge is prepared
to fight the matter out in court, even though his company is
dwarfed by eBay and its market capitalization of $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be going to this level if we didn't think we had a
reasonable chance,'' Carney said.

`STUART LITTLE' NESTS ON EDGE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine starting a project that will cost tens of
millions of dollars to complete and that depends on technology that
hasn't even been created yet. And if you fail, the result will be
painfully obvious to millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, that's pretty much what Columbia Pictures and
producer Douglas Wick did when they began serious production work
on ``Stuart Little,'' a mostly live-action movie that opens Friday,
featuring a computer-generated, remarkably believable image of a
talking mouse as its lead character.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started on Stuart, we were moving into an unknown
technology,'' director Rob Minkoff said. ``We didn't know if we
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of techno-artistic high-wire act is almost required
these days if you want to do something memorable, said John
Dykstra, the film's senior visual-effects supervisor, and now an
independent effects consultant who has won both Oscars and Emmys
(``Star Wars,'' ``Battlestar Galactica'') for his wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively accurate statement that if you go into a
film that's meant to give you something you haven't seen before
without using unknown technology, you'll be obsolete before the
film comes out,'' Dykstra said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge appealed to Sony Imageworks, the corporate sibling
of Columbia Pictures that created all the film's special effects,
even to the point of little details such as how to finance a few
dozen more of the 651 visual-effects shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most extensive projects anyone has ever
done, not in terms of shot volume, but in terms of its
intricacies,'' said Imageworks spokesman Don Levy. ``Its goal was
to create a digital star of a live-action film and integrate it
into the film in a realistic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, corporate parent Sony saw it all as one big, happy
synergy, and invested a ``huge amount'' of money on research and
development by its special-effects house to help create a special
movie by one of its studios, Wick said. And despite the risks,
Imageworks went way beyond the call of duty to help make the
project work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge opportunity for them to really strut their stuff
and do something that's never been done before,'' Wick said. ``It's
their calling card, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is quite a calling card. Imageworks has been showing off
bits and pieces of the work for months now to people, at insider
events such as the Visual Effects Society's first festival this
summer and the SIGGRAPH conference on computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hunch that `Stuart' is going to be real successful,''
said Chris Wedge, director of last year's Oscar-winning animated
short, ``Bunny.'' ``From what I've seen, they've done it with a lot
of sweetness. I'm glad someone is doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``Stuart'' as the next step in a series of increasingly
convincing computer-generated characters in movies.
</P>
<P>
   It started, of course, with the dinosaurs of ``Jurassic Park''
and its sequel, but kicked into high gear this year with several
notable computer-created characters.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the bandaged bad guy in ``The Mummy,'' then the
annoying but well-crafted Jar Jar Binks in ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace,'' and the toy collector and dachsund in the
all-animated ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of these movies used recent computer-animation improvements
that do a much better job of rendering clothing and fur in more
lifelike ways. And to a large extent, they have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But as Dykstra, Levy and others pointed out, those characters
were largely caricatures or pure fantasy, so audiences had little
from their own experience with which to compare them. They are also
all supporting characters, so less depends on them for the film's
success. That's not the case here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my point of view, as a step (in the development of
animation), we certainly stand on the shoulders of our precedents,
but there was a huge movement made here,'' Dykstra said.
</P>
<P>
   'Stuart' is the first major film to feature a wholly
computer-generated character in the leading role, and to base him
on something most audience members have seen before, a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Making something that looks like a believable mouse on screen is
a challenge, ``Bunny'' creator Wedge said, but one that can be done
if you just keep looking hard at nature's models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trick, but an easy trick,'' Wedge said. ``You just
compare what you're doing to a real mouse and keep saying, `What's
wrong with this picture?' You keep comparing all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. It's sort of like looking at a block of stone, and
removing all the things that don't look like a human. Easy for
Rodin, maybe, and for Oscar winners. But it still takes some long
slog-work, especially if you're creating your high-tech hammer and
chisel as you go.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart's look is the product of close collaboration between
animation supervisor Henry F. Anderson III and director Minkoff,
best-known as co-director of Disney's animated mega-hit ``The Lion
King,'' and who worked with Anderson as though he were a lead
animator in a Disney film.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart's visualization started with E.B. White's book and its
wonderful line drawings by Garth Williams, though their ``very
2-D'' look reduced their usefulness in a 3-D character's creation,
Minkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be somewhat like a mouse, which I believe was
(`Stuart Little' author) E.B. White's quote,'' said Dykstra. ``But
we didn't want to have a mouse with a little boy's head on it. It's
like trying to design a movie star by starting with his face.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of sketches by Imageworks designers led to somewhere
between 30 and 50 clay models of various possible Stuarts, with the
final few candidates laboriously digitized into the computer with
special penlike devices that map the contours of a 3-D object. Once
the models had become digital, they were further tweaked to get the
final details right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to find the appropriate blend,'' Minkoff said. ``He's
not really a mouse. He's very skinny. Are Stuart's eyes
realistic?''
</P>
<P>
   That last is a big question, because mice don't have irises. And
trying to show expressions, and the direction of a glance, are much
more difficult artistically without a little thing like a pair of
irises, Dykstra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he looks, how would he get directional sight?'' Dykstra
said. ``There was a huge requirement that the character have
subtlety, because he has a form that people have familiarity with.
All his emotions have to come across in body language as well as
facial features.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant there were dozens of other considerations, as the
designers tweaked Stuart's appearance from many angles, with many
expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to look good from the front when he smiled, and from
the side when he smiled,'' Dykstra said. ``We would turn him in
profile and say, `Oh, my God, he looks like a bear!' You take the
character and put him through his paces in one version, then repeat
yourself. He was very much created like a traditional animation
character. They run a cycle, change leg lengths and run the same
cycle again.''
</P>
<P>
   They used the relatively new 3-D animation technique of inverse
kinematics to keep the character from looking, in Dykstra's words,
``too cartoony.'' IK essentially creates an internal ``skeleton''
based on a series of rules guiding how body parts move. That
skeleton limits the range of motion of, say, the elbow as it
interacts with the shoulder and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   And getting details such as the eyes and body movements right
were only part of the challenge. The creators also had to develop
software that renders Stuart's fine white fur and whiskers
convincingly, and hangs appropriately textured clothing on him. And
to add to the challenge, the software had to create fur that looked
wet, that sticks up like the hackles on a dog, and that ripples in
a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, there came another challenge: dropping the
character into a scene and lighting him correctly. The
computer-generated character has to show the reflected light from
all the real-life objects in the scenes in which he is inserted,
and in turn, his reflection has to show on all those objects,
Dykstra said.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting set of calculations can be dizzying to figure out
and fill in, but without that work, a viewer's eye can tell
something doesn't look quite right, or believable, Dykstra said.
</P>
<P>
   But what's great about ``Stuart'' is that it !ital!does!off!
look believable. The film's biggest achievement is how easy it is
to accept him as a real, if sometimes too sweet, character.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about the technology in this film is that it was
all used in the service of something warm and real like this mouse,
not some spaceship,'' said actress Geena Davis, who plays Stuart's
mother. ``Little kids will think it's real.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carpet maker Beaulieu of America Inc. has entered the
hard surfaces business.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalton, Ga.-based company said Monday it acquired L.D.
Brinkman Co. and Hollytex Inc. of Lewisville, Texas, along with the
parent company, Pro Group Holdings Inc. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions will add about $400 million in revenue and
2,500 employees, said Piet Dossche, president of Beaulieu's
residential division. Beaulieu had revenue of $1.5 billion in 1998
with about 11,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas companies will become subsidiaries of Beaulieu.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Brinkman gets Beaulieu into the fast-growing
sector of hardwood floors, laminates, ceramic tiles and vinyl. With
30 locations, Brinkman calls itself the country's largest
floor-covering distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This automatically positions us as a total flooring company,''
Dossche said. Brinkman's strongest lines include well-known brands
such as Pergo and Congoleum.
</P>
<P>
   Hollytex adds a high-end carpet line to Beaulieu's portfolio.
Hollytex makes tufted broadloom carpet and rugs for residential and
commercial use at mills in Oklahoma. Its products are distributed
through Brinkman.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Beaulieu is the fourth-largest maker of carpet
and woven area rugs.

BRADLEY'S IOWA PRESENCE LEADS ANALYSTS TO UPRGADE HIS CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Once viewed as a prohibitive underdog in
Iowa, former Sen. Bill Bradley has been pouring resources into this
state in preparation for next month's Democratic presidential
caucuses, betting that a strong showing here will send a powerful
message to party members nationwide that their nomination is truly
up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts had thought that Bradley would have
trouble competing in Iowa against Vice President Al Gore, his lone
rival for the Democratic nomination. Not only is Gore better known,
but he has the support of most of the state's Democratic unions and
top elected officials, vital resources in getting voters to the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has devoted enough time and money to the state to
cause many analysts to upgrade his chances of staying close to Gore
here. Most analysts say Bradley needs to finish only a strong
second here to build momentum for the New Hampshire primary, which
comes one week after the Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me six weeks ago, I would have said he had no
chance'' of winning, said Arthur Sanders, a professor of politics
at Drake University in Des Moines. ``But he's clearly struck a
chord. Now I'd say he's got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, more attention has been paid to New Hampshire by the
news media and, to some degree, the campaigns themselves, because
polls show the two men in a dead heat there. By contrast, most
polls have shown Gore well ahead in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk for Bradley in fighting all-out for Iowa: If he
raises expectations here and then fails to meet them, he could
deflate his momentum on the eve of New Hampshire. Worried about a
similar situation on the Republican side, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona has avoided Iowa altogether, arguing that he would have no
chance of catching Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradley campaign has clearly decided that the risk is
worth taking. The campaign has booked about $800,000 in television
advertising time for January, enough to ensure that its commercials
run every day across the state until caucus night, Bradley campaign
aides say. The campaign has already spent about $600,000 on
television advertising in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the Bradley camp has also made significant
strides in building a field organization, hiring 56 full-time
workers _ to Gore's 70 _ and recruiting volunteer coordinators for
all of Iowa's 99 counties and nearly half of its 2,143 precincts.
In January, the campaign plans to send several hundred volunteers
to Iowa from New Jersey, the state Bradley represented for three
terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Bradley plans to spend almost all of
January in Iowa, his aides say, doing the kind of person-to-person
campaigning that Iowans expect from presidential candidates.
Bradley has already spent twice as many days in Iowa this year as
Gore.
</P>

   ``It shows their confidence in their ability to run dead even
with the vice president in Iowa,'' said David O'Brien, a former
Clinton administration official and Gore supporter from Cedar
Rapids who is now supporting Bradley. ``They haven't given up on
winning here. And if he stays close, I think it sends a message
that Bradley is more electable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials acknowledge that Bradley is building a
sizable organization here. But they assert that Bradley's mostly
volunteer troops will be no match for Gore's better-financed army
of union and party activists.
</P>
<P>
   And the Iowa caucuses tend to reward the candidates with the
largest field organizations. Unlike primaries, where people can
vote at any time in the privacy of a booth, caucuses are evening
meetings where votes are cast in the open after lengthy debates. As
a result, caucusgoers tend to be only the most loyal party members.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has locked up the big institutions that have proved most
effective at getting those voters to the caucuses. Those include
the state's largest unions, representing auto workers, teachers and
other public employees, and its two Democratic members of Congress,
Sen. Tom Harkin and Rep. Leonard L. Boswell. While Gov. Tom Vilsack
is neutral, his wife has endorsed Gore, as have many of the
Democratic state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been through Iowa and spent a lot of time with the
people there, not just in the last few months, but the last seven
years,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary. ``As a result,
he's developed a tremendous foundation of support in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to Bradley say they believe that Gore's supporters
are unenthusiastic and that his sharp-elbowed attacks on Bradley
are rubbing Iowans the wrong way. They also say Bradley enjoys a
hometown advantage because he grew up in Missouri, and that a
growing number of rank-and-file union members are prepared to buck
their leadership. (Helping push that line is Bradley's Iowa
manager, Dan Lucas, a former AFL-CIO official who has met with 47
union locals in Iowa since joining the campaign last summer.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley's campaign is reaching out to
disenchanted Democrats, peace advocates, students, independents and
even moderate Republicans, who are allowed to change their
registration on caucus day. And he has been aggressively courting
state and local officials who could give his campaign added
credibility and organizational muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley is doing a good job of going after folks that
wouldn't typically go to caucuses,'' said Kim Warkentin, executive
director of the Iowa Democratic Party. ``Everywhere he goes he
draws a huge crowd of people. A lot of it has to do with the
celebrity quality about him. But he's also an honest person who
relates to people one on one, and that's the name of the game in
the caucuses.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bradley's efforts were on display this week in Cedar Rapids when
he made an unusual appeal to crossover voters at the local Rotary
Club, the members of which were mainly Republicans and
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this room is full of a lot of good Democrats,'' Bradley
said to much laughter. ``But if you're one of those revolutionary
Republicans, if you're one of those open-minded, independent
Republicans and you agree with what I've just said _ think about,
on that caucus night, the one sacrilege of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left, Bradley received a standing ovation. ``I trust this
guy,'' said James Sattler, a 42-year-old Republican who said he
might register Democrat and vote for Bradley, provided he thought
Bush was comfortably ahead in the Republican race. ``He speaks from
the heart. His message is honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Just six hours later, Bradley gave one of his most impassioned
speeches of the campaign to union workers at a Teamsters hall. The
Teamsters leadership has remained neutral in the race. He opened
with several light anecdotes about his days as a star Olympic and
professional basketball player, experiences that his aides say make
him attractive to working-class men. But he quickly turned serious,
calling for policies to help unions organize and punish companies
that violate labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to help working families in this country,
then you have to help unions in this country do the things that
unions do best, which is organize the unorganized,'' Bradley said.
``I want you to know where I'm coming from. I'm on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the candidate received a standing ovation that night,
many political analysts argue that Bradley will have trouble
encouraging large numbers of rank-and-file union members to buck
their pro-Gore leadership. And they say that Republicans like
Sattler are rare.
</P>
<P>
   But the analysts also say Bradley does not have to win in Iowa,
simply stay close to Gore. The question is how close. Many analysts
say Bradley needs to win at least 40 percent of the vote to be
viewed as having succeeded here. And that is a relatively high bar.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., won 31 percent in 1980, the most
for an insurgent candidate in the last three decades. But even that
was considered a poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the name of the game is beating expectations, Gore's aides
say Bradley should get well over 40 percent, while Bradley's aides
have tried to downplay their chances of getting that much. But at
times, Bradley's supporters cannot resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 40 percent is a good showing,'' said Connie Clarke,
one of Bradley's coordinators in eastern Iowa. ``But I really want
to win.''

COMMENTARY: THE MILLS OF CRUELTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ana Flores, as I shall call her, came to this country
from Guatemala. She has a green card, entitling her to permanent
residence. She lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington with her
two daughters, ages 9 and 8, both American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Over several years she complained to the police that her husband
was assaulting her. In June 1998, during one of their disputes, her
husband sat on Ana and hit her. Defending herself, she bit him. He
called the police, who arrested her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flores was charged with domestic assault. In a 10-minute
hearing, a Virginia judge urged her to plead guilty without a
lawyer. When she did, he sentenced her to six months' probation and
30 days in jail, to be suspended if she finished the probation. She
did. She is now separated from her husband.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 in the morning last Jan. 13 two agents of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service came to Ms. Flores' home and arrested
her for deportation. Why? The charging document, signed by James D.
Goldman, an assistant district director of the INS, cited a section
of the 1996 Immigration Act calling for deportation of anyone
convicted of ``a crime of domestic violence.''
</P>
<P>
   So for biting an abusive husband during a domestic dispute, Ms.
Flores is to be deported. She is due to appear before an
immigration judge on Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   In writing about the Immigration Service in recent years, I have
encountered much cruelty. But this case is beyond belief. Why would
the INS pursue such a grotesquely marginal case? I asked, and
officials are looking into it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month 28 members of the House wrote to the attorney
general, Janet Reno, and the commissioner of immigration, Doris
Meissner, urging the INS not to seek deportation in ``true hardship
cases.'' The letter was notable because it was signed by Rep. Lamar
Smith of Texas, a principal author of the stringent 1996 law, and
other Republican conservatives _ and by Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts and other Democratic liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been widespread agreement,'' the letter said, ``that
some deportations were unfair and resulted in unjustifiable
hardships.'' It called on the INS to issue guidelines for its
officials to exercise ``prosecutorial discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS has in fact been working on guidelines for some time, in
consultation with Smith and others. If the guidelines are issued,
and followed, they should do much to prevent such horrors as the
effort to deport Ana Flores.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutorial discretion alone cannot end the injustices
noted by the congressmen. For even if INS officials decide not to
proceed against someone who is technically deportable, that person
would remain in a legal limbo, ineligible to become a citizen and
unable to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If Ana Flores were free of the deportation order, for example,
and went to Guatemala to visit relatives, she would be asked on her
return whether she had ever been convicted of a crime. If she
answered honestly, she would be legally inadmissible. And the law
gives the INS no discretion in admission cases.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce unfairness, the 1996 Immigration Act needs to be
modified so that deportation does not follow automatically from a
long list of criminal offenses, some of them trivial. A crime like
domestic violence can be serious _ or not, as in the Flores case.
The seriousness of many offenses must be judged on the facts. The
attempt to eliminate judgment has proved to be a mistake with harsh
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The law should provide a regular process for deciding whether a
claim of hardship justifies calling off a deportation. There used
to be just such a process. Immigration judges had the power to stop
a deportation if it would be unjustifiably cruel. If the judge so
decided, the person no longer had a legal cloud hanging over her.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 1996 act eliminated that process, INS officials are
now expected to undertake a role they have never had before _
deciding whether justice is served by going after someone like Ana
Flores. And they must do so without a hearing, without knowing all
the facts. All they may have is a notice from state legal
authorities of people recently convicted and their crimes. The role
more appropriately belongs where the issue can be argued and
explored, in the immigration courts.

US TO REVIEW `DON'T ASK' AS GORE DENOUNCES POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William S. Cohen Monday ordered a
review of military bases to determine how the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays is being carried out, while Democratic
presidential frontrunner Al Gore issued a statement saying he would
end the policy if elected president, calling it an ``unacceptable
form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was responding to Representative Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, who raised the political stakes Monday by calling on
Gore to go beyond criticizing the policy and to advocate ending it.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the probe, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon
said Cohen shared the concerns of President Clinton, who on
Saturday said that the policy was ``way out of whack,'' having been
used to root out gays and lesbians serving in the military. Bacon
said a spot check of major bases and installations will be
conducted over the next 90 days and the results reported directly
to Cohen.``We are as determined as the president is to see that the
policy is implemented fairly,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The review comes on the heels of last week's murder conviction
of an Army private at Fort Campbell, Ky. for fatally beating a gay
soldier with a baseball bat, triggering fresh concern over the
treatment of gays and lesbians who, under the administration's
policy, are allowed to serve in the military so long as they keep
their sexual orientation a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, one of only three openly gay or lesbian members of
Congress, jumped into the what has become an election year debate
about the policy, complaining in an interview Monday that Clinton
hadn't gone far enough in his comments and that Gore should speak
out in favor of lifting the ban as has his Democratic rival Bill
Bradley and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a candidate for the US Senate
from New York. None of the GOP candidates for president support
lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Gore, a Vietnam veteran, had urged Clinton not to
accept the ``don't ask, don't tell'' compromise and to issue an
executive order that would lift the ban entirely on gays in the
military, advice that went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate for him to say what he said
previously, which is `don't ask, don't tell,' not only isn't
working the way it was supposed to, but even it was working the way
it was supposed to, it wouldn't be good enough,'' Frank said. ``He
ought to go a step further and join Hillary Clinton and Bill
Bradley and say it should be abolished altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gore said in the statement that in light of the
beating death of the soldier at Fort Campbell, ``I believe the
`don't ask, don't tell' policy should be eliminated. Gays and
lesbians should be allowed to serve their country without
discrimination. If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will make
those changes and propose legislation in Congress to eliminate this
unacceptable form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The violatile gays and the military issue had virtually
disappeared from the political radar after President Clinton
abandoned efforts in 1993 to fulfill a campaign promise to lift the
ban on gays in uniforms. But it has bounced back in the past week,
after a military jury at Fort Campbell convicted and sentenced a
private to life in prison for beating a gay infantryman to death
with a baseball bat as the victim slept.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, supports
gay people serving openly, going so far as to post his position on
his campaign's website. As a New Jersey senator, he supported a
1993 amendment to prevent ``don't ask, don't tell,'' from becoming
law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the First Lady, campaigning in New York, said the
policy was a political compromise that ``has not worked.'' She
said, ``I don't believe it is ultimately the policy that we should
have in our military.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday with CBS News, the president did not
commit to trying to end the policy, but to making it work. ``What
I'd like to do is to focus on trying to make the policy we
announced back in '93 work the way that it was intended to, cause
it's way out of whack now, and I don't think any serious person can
say it's not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, whose criticism of Gore first came in an interview
Saturday with gay author and columnist Michelangelo Signorile on
the GAYBC Radio Network, Monday said he was disappointed with
Clinton's answer and ``disappointed in the president, because I and
others have been telling him for years what he now acknowledges . .
. that it was not being enforced well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said acting Inspector General Donald
Mancuso, who reports directly to Cohen, would decide which bases to
send teams to do the spot checks. ``All of us have read in recent
days the very disturbing charges that have come out of Fort
Campbell, Kentucky. Many people have asked whether the charges made
about Fort Campbell may apply to other installations in the
military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, which lobbies on behalf of gays and lesbians
in uniform, however, expressed doubts about the Pentagon's
investigation. He said one question is whether gay people are going
to pariticpate in the review and whether they will be offered
assurances if they report harrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that anti-gay harassment is a problem and they know
what they need to do to fix it, but they are not doing it,'' Osburn
said of Pentagon officials. ``They continue to drag their feet. The
real issue here is we need leadership, not delays.''

   Israel will have to pay ``a heavy territorial price,'' Barak
acknowledged in an emotional plea for parliamentary support. But
failure to pursue peace with Damascus ``could cost us in blood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of confidence in the prime minister's negotiating plans
passed with 47 votes in favor, 37 against, and 24 abstentions _ a
victory, but far from the strong majority Barak expected. Three
parties in Barak's governing coalition pointedly refused to back
him on Monday night, pointing to potential trouble when a promised
national referendum is held on any final peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is to meet with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria
in Washington Wednesday and Thursday for the highest-level direct
discussions ever held between Syria and Israel. President Clinton
is expected to host the opening and closing sessions of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's appearance in Parliament on Monday was
widely considered his most important appearance since he took the
oath of office there five months ago. Calling this week's
negotiations ``an opportunity that cannot be squandered,'' he
argued that for the first time in its history, Israel has a chance
for a lasting peace with all of its immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Israel's perspective, real peace with Syria and the
Palestinians, if it can be achieved, is the pinnacle of the Zionist
vision,'' he said, ignoring opposition hecklers. ``It is a
revolution. It is a new era in Israel's relations with the Arab
world, and the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak implicitly conceded that the Golan Heights would be handed
back to Syria in a peace accord, as thousands of residents from the
northern border zone demonstrated angrily outside the Parliament.
The precise boundaries of withdrawal ``will be determined in
negotiations in accordance with the depth of peace and the quality
of security arrangements,'' he said, echoing the formula used by
the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Barak's mentor, in the last
attempt at a settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud bloc, followed
Barak to the podium. He predicted that any accord featuring a Golan
withdrawal would go down to defeat in a referendum. He tauntingly
read another statement by Rabin, this one from 1992, that ``it is
inconceivable that even in peace we would descend from the Golan
Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon charged that the government acquiesced to President Hafez
Assad's desire for ``American aid and modern American weapons'' and
President Clinton's hunger ``for a stunning achievement at any cost
before the end of his term in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had praised Clinton in his remarks for his ``personal
involvement and devotion to the cause of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned national vote on the Syrian peace accord would be
the first referendum in Israel's history. Lawmakers have yet to
determine how the balloting would be organized, or who will draft
the question that will be put to voters. Israel's attorney-general
rejected an opposition proposal that Arab citizens _ a sixth of the
electorate _ be excluded from the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The vote following Monday night's debate _ a simple yea or nay
response to the peace initiative outlined by the prime minister on
Monday night _ provided the first real test of Barak's coalition
strategy. For Barak's Labor allies, the results appeared worrisome.
He assembled a multiparty government to provide the broadest
possible majority for peace with Syria and the Palestinians, but on
Monday night he was left with an uncomfortably slim plurality.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest faction in Barak's ruling coalition _ the
Sephardic-dominated Shas party _ unexpectedly abstained from the
vote and openly criticized his ``unclear'' negotiating strategy.
Most members of two smaller conservative parties in the government
_ the National Religious Party, backed by settlers in the West
Bank, and Yisrael B'aliya, representing Russian immigrants _ voted
against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all three coalition factions then joined Sharon and
other opposition figures outside Parliament in a rally with
protesters from the Golan Heights. ``We feel that the Golan is our
home, and you cannot throw people out of their homes,'' Guy Neuman,
a demonstrator from Qatrin, the largest Golan town, told an Israeli
television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, anticipating opposition attacks, portrayed himself as a
patriot and career military man who had devoted his life to
Israel's defense. He reminded his audience that he had fought
against the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the 1967 war. ``I
am fully familiar with every valley and every rock in the Golan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied to the Parliament by Nadia Cohen, the widow
of Eli Cohen, an Israeli agent who has executed by Syria in 1965
for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen, who is seeking the return from Damascus of her
husband's interred remains, publicly endorsed Barak's peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary interest is Israel's security,'' Barak said. ``The
agreement that we aspire to reach with our Syrian neighbors is one
that will also put an end to our conflict with Lebanon, and will
include diverse and effective systems to preserve security and
peace between our countries at all times. Such an agreement is not
beyond reach.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a meeting earlier on Monday, he told Cabinet colleagues that
while Israel had made no new commitments to Syria before this
week's talks, it ``would not erase'' any promises made in previous
negotiations during the administrations of Rabin and former Prime
Ministers Shimon Peres, and Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians and Israelis have profoundly different recollections of
those past pledges, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians have said the Rabin government was prepared to
withdraw to Israel's 1967 borders _ that is, to the eastern
shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. Israeli negotiators deny making
such a promise. And former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims
to have extracted Syrian permission for a permanent Israeli
presence atop Mount Heron, the Golan's high point _ an assertion
dismissed by diplomats in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations with Syria will be difficult and paved with
crises,'' Barak told his Cabinet ministers, according to state
radio reports. ``I have no illusions about the nature of the Middle
East, and I have no doubt that only the overall strength of Israel
will ensure that agreements are honored.``

MASSMUTUAL IS INTERESTED IN TRAVELERS' CARE DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MassMutual, the Springfield, Mass. insurer, is considering
buying the long-term-care business of Travelers Group, the giant
insurance company that is part of Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. said its
chairman, Thomas B. Wheeler, would retire at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for MassMutual declined to say Monday whether the
company was in talks with Travelers, but he confirmed that
MassMutual was interested in the unit, which sources said was for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard that Travelers is marketing their long-term-care
division,'' said the spokesman, Eustis Walcott. He said MassMutual
had not received a formal proposition from Travelers but that
``when we do, we'll look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hartford, Conn. spokesman for Travelers, Keith Anderson, would
neither confirm nor deny rumors about the company's long-term-care
operations, which provide insurance to groups and individuals
needing constant care in a nursing facility or at home due to
accident, illness, or old age. Anderson declined to say whether the
division was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of what the unit might fetch were not immediately
available. Long-term care accounts for a tiny portion of Travelers'
core businesses, which include life insurance, annuities, and
property and casualty insurance, and Travelers does not break out
revenues for the segment.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers Life &AMP; Annuity, the main unit of Travelers Group,
expects to earn $660 million for 1999, or about 7 percent of
Citigroup's projected total earnings of $9.2 billion. Travelers was
acquired by New York-based Citicorp in 1998 in a deal that created
the world's largest financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott said MassMutual, which launched its own long-term-care
business a few months ago, was interested in expanding in that
segment to diversify earnings. He declined to disclose revenues for
the new business. MassMutual is the nation's 11th largest life
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler is leaving after 37 years at the company. The
63-year-old outgoing chairman, who began his career as a sales
agent, will be succeeded by Robert J. O'Connell, 56, who is
president and chief executive. O'Connell assumed the CEO title from
Wheeler and the president title in January after 9 years at
American International Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wheeler, MassMutual saw its assets under management
increase tenfold, to nearly $200 billion. The company's main
businesses are life insurance, annuities, disability insurance, and
financial management. It owns Oppenheimer Funds Inc., David L.
Babson &AMP; Co Inc., and other asset management firms.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual, the second-largest insurer in Massachusetts, after
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co, is owned by its
policyholders. The company has not said whether it will seek to
convert to a public company owned by shareholders.

FAMED TV COUPLE TO SPLIT UP _ OFF AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEEDHAM, Mass. _ Natalie Jacobson and Chet Curtis, whose
partnership on and off the air has helped define Boston television
news for a generation, announced Monday that they have decided to
separate after almost 25 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The split creates a situation without precedent in local TV,
since Jacobson and Curtis said they plan to continue working
together as coanchors of the newscasts on WCVB-TV (Channel 5). In
fact, they did so Monday night, looking strained at times but
mostly betraying little sign that anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After the 6 p.m. news, in another unprecedented move, Channel 5
general manager Paul La Camera appeared on-air to tell viewers of
the separation.
</P>
<P>
   For many viewers who have come to view the marriage of ``Chet
and Nat'' as a homey fixture on an otherwise fast-changing TV
landscape, it probably came as a shock. Within an hour after La
Camera's announcement, more than 80 calls had poured in to the
Channel 5 switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson and Curtis declined Globe requests for interviews, but
earlier in the day, in a statement read to around 100 Channel 5
employees at a staff meeting called by La Camera, the pair called
it ``an amicable and mutual decision.'' They said they remain
``best friends'' who ``care deeply for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not explain why they have chosen to separate,
and did not indicate whether they plan to divorce. La Camera and
Channel 5 news director Candy Altman said the couple did not tell
them whether divorce is in the offing or not. Jacobson, 56, and
Curtis, 60, have an 18-year-old daughter, Lindsay Dawn. Curtis also
has two grown children from his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Jacobson and Curtis said that ``this obviously
has not been an easy decision, but we believe it is best for us.''
They called their choice to separate ``intensely personal'' and
said ``we will not make any further public statements.'' They added
that they hope colleagues will not ``feel you have to tiptoe around
us because of this change in our private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to Jacobson and Curtis, however, their private
lives have often attracted keen public interest, whether it was
major (the birth of their daughter) or minor (a change in
Jacobson's hair style last year). Given that Channel 5 became
Boston's dominant TV news station, in part, by projecting a
``family'' image built around Jacobson and Curtis, a key question
now is how viewers react to the split.
</P>
<P>
   The couple first told La Camera and news director Candy Altman
of their decision last Monday night after the 6 p.m. newscast. In
an interview Monday at Channel 5, La Camera said they opted to
postpone the announcement because the station was focusing on
covering the deaths of six firefighters in Worcester, and believed
it would have been ``inappropriate'' to publicize the separation at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson and Curtis coanchored several hours of live coverage of
the memorial service and procession for the firefighters last
Thursday, which La Camera cited as proof that ``whatever
difficulties may be occurring in their private lives, is in no way
has spilled over into their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they chose to announce their decision to separate
Monday, the couple is apparently still living together in their
Needham home. Curtis is expected to move out by year's end to an
apartment in a Boston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about marital problems had surfaced when Jacobson
and Curtis showed up at social events without each other. That
speculation intensified in June when Jacobson took a sabbatical
that lasted nearly four months.
</P>
<P>
   La Camera acknowledged that he was aware of the rumors, but he
said he did not question the anchors about them because their work
did not appear to be affected. ``If we had seen any indication in
their work, perhaps we would have,'' said La Camera.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that ``obviously, this must have had something to do
with the sabbatical,'' but he insisted that he still believes
Jacobson primarily took the sabbatical for the reasons she stated
at the time: to spend more time with her daughter and elderly
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never crossed our minds that we were betrayed or misled in
any way,'' said La Camera.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he and Altman offered strong words of personal support
for Jacobson and Curtis. Altman said she is ``saddened and
disappointed, and concerned for them.'' La Camera said his intent
is ``to be as loving and supportive as (I) can,'' adding
emphatically: ``This has nothing to do with ratings.'' He voiced
the hope that Channel 5 viewers will also be ``supportive and
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   For Channel 5, the months ahead loom as a test of that. The
station has numerous shelfs full of New England Emmys and other
broadcasting awards won with Jacobson and Curtis as their lead
anchors. In the past two years, while maintaining its No. 1
position during the morning, noon, and evening newscasts, the
station has repeatedly lost the 11 p.m. ratings race to rival
WHDH-TV (Ch. 7).
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson and Curtis coanchor the 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m.
newscasts. They anchored the 5 and 6 Monday night, but did not
anchor the 11 p.m. news. La Camera said that had nothing to do with
the separation, but rather reflected their custom during football
season, when Channel 5's broadcast of ``Monday Night Football''
pushes the news into the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   Their on-air partnership began in 1972, when they started
coanchoring Channel 5's midday newscast. They were married in May
1975. In 1978, each began coanchoring different newscasts with Tom
Ellis. By 1982, though, they were teamed up again on the 6 and 11
p.m. newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond reading and reporting the nightly news, Jacobson and
Curtis have carved out roles as Boston's unofficial First Couple.
They enlarged Channel 5's civic identity by attending numerous
charity affairs, coanchoring everything from the Boston Marathon to
the ``Salute to Symphony'' fundraiser for the Boston Symphony
Orchestra to the Jerry Lewis Labor Telethon to combat muscular
dystrophy.

US TO REVIEW `DON'T ASK' AS GORE DENOUNCES POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William S. Cohen Monday ordered a
review of military bases to determine how the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays is being carried out, while Democratic
presidential frontrunner Al Gore issued a statement saying he would
end the policy if elected president, calling it an ``unacceptable
form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was responding to Representative Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, who raised the political stakes Monday by calling on
Gore to go beyond criticizing the policy and to advocate ending it.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the probe, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon
said Cohen shared the concerns of President Clinton, who on
Saturday said that the policy was ``way out of whack,'' having been
used to root out gays and lesbians serving in the military. Bacon
said a spot check of major bases and installations will be
conducted over the next 90 days and the results reported directly
to Cohen.``We are as determined as the president is to see that the
policy is implemented fairly,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The review comes on the heels of last week's murder conviction
of an Army private at Fort Campbell, Ky. for fatally beating a gay
soldier with a baseball bat, triggering fresh concern over the
treatment of gays and lesbians who, under the administration's
policy, are allowed to serve in the military so long as they keep
their sexual orientation a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, one of only three openly gay or lesbian members of
Congress, jumped into the what has become an election year debate
about the policy, complaining in an interview Monday that Clinton
hadn't gone far enough in his comments and that Gore should speak
out in favor of lifting the ban as has his Democratic rival Bill
Bradley and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a candidate for the US Senate
from New York. None of the GOP candidates for president support
lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Gore, a Vietnam veteran, had urged Clinton not to
accept the ``don't ask, don't tell'' compromise and to issue an
executive order that would lift the ban entirely on gays in the
military, advice that went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate for him to say what he said
previously, which is `don't ask, don't tell,' not only isn't
working the way it was supposed to, but even it was working the way
it was supposed to, it wouldn't be good enough,'' Frank said. ``He
ought to go a step further and join Hillary Clinton and Bill
Bradley and say it should be abolished altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gore said in the statement that in light of the
beating death of the soldier at Fort Campbell, ``I believe the
`don't ask, don't tell' policy should be eliminated. Gays and
lesbians should be allowed to serve their country without
discrimination. If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will make
those changes and propose legislation in Congress to eliminate this
unacceptable form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The violatile gays and the military issue had virtually
disappeared from the political radar after President Clinton
abandoned efforts in 1993 to fulfill a campaign promise to lift the
ban on gays in uniforms. But it has bounced back in the past week,
after a military jury at Fort Campbell convicted and sentenced a
private to life in prison for beating a gay infantryman to death
with a baseball bat as the victim slept.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, supports
gay people serving openly, going so far as to post his position on
his campaign's website. As a New Jersey senator, he supported a
1993 amendment to prevent ``don't ask, don't tell,'' from becoming
law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the First Lady, campaigning in New York, said the
policy was a political compromise that ``has not worked.'' She
said, ``I don't believe it is ultimately the policy that we should
have in our military.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday with CBS News, the president did not
commit to trying to end the policy, but to making it work. ``What
I'd like to do is to focus on trying to make the policy we
announced back in '93 work the way that it was intended to, cause
it's way out of whack now, and I don't think any serious person can
say it's not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, whose criticism of Gore first came in an interview
Saturday with gay author and columnist Michelangelo Signorile on
the GAYBC Radio Network, Monday said he was disappointed with
Clinton's answer and ``disappointed in the president, because I and
others have been telling him for years what he now acknowledges . .
. that it was not being enforced well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said acting Inspector General Donald
Mancuso, who reports directly to Cohen, would decide which bases to
send teams to do the spot checks. ``All of us have read in recent
days the very disturbing charges that have come out of Fort
Campbell, Kentucky. Many people have asked whether the charges made
about Fort Campbell may apply to other installations in the
military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, which lobbies on behalf of gays and lesbians
in uniform, however, expressed doubts about the Pentagon's
investigation. He said one question is whether gay people are going
to pariticpate in the review and whether they will be offered
assurances if they report harrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that anti-gay harassment is a problem and they know
what they need to do to fix it, but they are not doing it,'' Osburn
said of Pentagon officials. ``They continue to drag their feet. The
real issue here is we need leadership, not delays.''

 &HT;    Ga. Southern hoping for a healthy Peterson
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This isn't the way Adrian Peterson had hoped to
prepare for the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Southern fullback has been forced to spend the last
two days recovering from an assortment of injuries and will be on
crutches until Wednesday, three days before the Eagles meet
Youngstown State in the Division I-AA national championship game in
Chattanooga. Peterson rushed for 183 yards and three touchdowns in
last week's 28-17 semifinal victory over Illinois State, but
sustained a turf toe injury and re-aggravated his injured right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the nation's best Division I-AA player is a
mere spectator as the program prepares for its seventh national
title game since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be on the crutches until Wednesday, then we'll take it
from there,'' Johnson said. ``I think he'll be ready to go
Saturday. In fact, I don't think we have enough people to keep him
out of that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 183-yard performance against Illinois State marked the 29th
consecutive game in his Georgia Southern career that Peterson has
topped 100 yards. He has also surpassed 5,000 career rushing yards
(5,063) and has 71 career rushing touchdowns, including a 161-yard,
two-touchdown performance in last year's 55-43 national
championship game loss to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, the Walter Payton Award winner as the top player in
Division I-AA, has been a key figure for the Eagles during their
three playoff victories. He has averaged more than 216 yards
rushing in the three wins, including a 333-yard, five-touchdown
performance in the quarterfinal victory over Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   While the health of Peterson remains the team's primary concern,
Youngstown State will have its top back completely healthy for the
title game. Youngstown senior Adrian Brown, a 6-0, 230-pounder,
rushed for 188 yards in leading the Penguins to a 27-24 semifinal
victory over Florida A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy,'' said Johnson, referring to Brown. ``We've got
to find a way to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Eagles' starters are currently healthy for
Saturday's game. Spearheaded by down linemen Voncellies Allen,
Eugene Phillips and Freddy Pesqueira along with linebacker Jason
Neese and cornerback Kiwaukee Thomas, the Eagle defense had its
best game of the playoffs against Illinois State, holding the
Redbirds to slightly more than two yards per carry on 32 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys up front did a great job of stopping the run,''
Johnson said. ``We played hard and ran to the ball. (Illinois State
backs) broke some tackles, but there was always somebody else
there.''

MASSACHUSETTS SENATE POSTING BILLS ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Legislature became a bit more
Internet-savvy last week. But the state still lags far behind most
other states in letting the public read proposed laws on line.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state Senate began posting the full text of its
bills on the Internet for the first time. But the House has yet to
follow suit, leaving Massachusetts as the only state where citizens
cannot read all bills for free via computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem that in a state that's often called the
birthplace of democracy we should be leaders, not laggards, in
making government accessible to people,'' said Rob Sargent,
executive director of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's move was ordered by Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham, who has long been more supportive of electronically
posting legislative information for the public than his House
counterpart, House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran. The Senate has made
its daily schedules and summaries of its floor activities available
online for months, and will soon begin asking Senators to file
their bills electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Legislature's Web site provides access to short
summaries and brief legislative histories of pending bills. But
critics say the site pales in comparison to those in other states.
A recent survey by the National Online Legislative Association
ranked the quality of Massachusetts's web site 45th among 50
states. (The site's Internet address is
www.magnet.state.ma.us/legis/).
</P>
<P>
   In the past, reading bills has meant visiting the State House in
Boston or mailing a self-addressed stamped envelope to the
Legislature's document room. To read House bills, citizens must
still visit or write to the document room.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with both the Legislature and the Internet say
there are no techological obstacles to placing all bills online,
although doing so would create some new work for the House and
Senate clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate Finneran, who does not use a computer, may be
unfamiliar with the Internet's potential. Critics suggest Finneran
is reluctant to open the legislative process to greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran did not say Monday whether the House would soon follow
the Senate's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working with the Senate Clerk and the House Clerk
to figure out the most efficient way of doing that,'' Finneran
said. ``When we make this move we don't want to do anything in an
inefficient way and find out we have missed opportunities to do
more and better things.''

 &HT;    Dog days for Wolves
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Life after Stephon Marbury has been bleak for the
Minnesota Timberwolves. The team widely regarded two years ago as
an up-and-comer is on a mercurial descent that has crash-and-burn
indicators.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly at the heart of their woes is the departure of
Marbury, the former Georgia Tech guard who forced the Timberwolves
to trade him by threatening to leave when he became a free agent.
To prevent losing him with no compensation, Minnesota moved Marbury
to New Jersey in a three-team trade that brought the Timberwolves
point guard Terrell Brandon from Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   From that March 11 deal to tonight's game against the Hawks at
Philips Arena, Minnesota's record is a disappointing 20-28.
Brandon, a one-time NBA all-star, is being criticized, basically,
for not being Marbury; the sensational Kevin Garnett is frustrated
at his recent play and the overall performance of the team. As a
result, the luster that once shone on the tandem of coach Flip
Saunders and vice president Kevin McHale is dulling. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, man,'' said Garnett (averaging 21.3 points, 11
rebounds), whose recent play has followed that of his
underachieving teammates; he had a stretch of 14 straight misses in
a recent game against Golden State. ``When it rains, it pours. I
haven't lost my confidence. Sometimes I might try to do too much. .
. . It ain't easy to deal with this, man. It's all within
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The thoughts in Minnesota seem to hang onto Marbury. He
facilitated the breaking up of him and Garnett, who were bound to
form one of the league's most lethal combinations. By replacing
Marbury with Brandon, the T'Wolves believed the drop-off would not
be noticeable once Brandon got familiar with his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   After starting 12-7 with Marbury last season, the Timberwolves
of Brandon went 13-18 to end the season. They lost in four games to
San Antonio in the playoffs' first round.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're 7-10 and all eyes are on Brandon, who signed for
$58.3 million over the next six years, another source of ire in the
cold Minnesota air.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at contracts and go by that, instead of what's
realistic,'' Brandon said. ``If you make the most money, then
that's who you should expect the most. You can never do enough
really. People want more. As teammates, we can't get caught up in,
`Who's fault is it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Brandon is not up to his previous all-star
level, although he averages 14.8 points and 8.1 assists. It's what
they have _ or have not _ gotten from anyone other than Garnett and
Brandon. The surrounding cast has been inconsistent, from guard
Anthony Peeler to forwards Joe Smith and Malik Sealy to big man
Dean Garrett to rookie Wally Szczerbiak to center Radoslav
Nesterovic.
</P>
<P>
   Which directs more burden toward Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (getting to him) a little bit,'' Saunders said. ``That's
natural. (Opponents have) done a better job of taking the ball out
of his hands. Early in the year, when they trapped Kevin, he moved
the ball and we knocked down shots. The last few games, we're not
knocking down shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McHale: ``Move the ball earlier, move the ball differently,
see the open guy _ that all comes with getting better. Anybody who
was a good post player went through that. Kevin has to learn how to
deal with it and help get us going.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help if Garnett has someone dependable playing
alongside him, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for Kevin to play well,'' Saunders said, ``the other
guys have to play better. It's that vicious cycle. He wants it so
bad _ that's where his greatest strength is his greatest weakness.
He wants to make it happen so quick. But whether it's golf or
whatever, the harder you swing, the worse your shot is. The harder
you try, the worse you become.''
</P>
<P>
   It can't get much worse for the Timberwolves, who have dropped
five straight and are 2-8 after a 5-2 start. Saunders said the team
is more in need of someone who forces his teammates to play with a
passion and anger than a scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a veteran guy, a John Starks-type guy, who, when
things get really tough, gets in there and takes a stand and says,
`It ends right now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the decline has hit more than the slumping Garnett and
underappreciated Brandon. McHale and Saunders, a pair of heroes for
a while, have been targets of discord as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, it always comes back to the people at the top,''
Saunders said. ``I see people at grocery stores these days, and
they avoid you like you have the plague. We're all embarrassed
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Garnett: ``From the outside looking in, I know it looks
kind of gloomy. We've still got 65 more games to go. If you give up
now, why play later?''
</P>

INTERNET RICHES HUMBLE AND WORRY TRADITIONAL WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 (This article was reported by JOSEPH KAHN, LAURA M. HOLSON and
PATRICK McGEEHAN and was written by Kahn.)  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even by the inflated standards of high finance, Wall
Street is overflowing with holiday cheer this year. Investment
banks have set aside $13 billion to pay bonuses, 20 percent more
than last year, with pay packages above $10 million no longer a
rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among Wall Streeters whose incomes once astounded Middle
America, the mood has changed. One industry veteran bemoaned the
``opportunity cost'' of remaining a financier in the Internet Age.
Others are leaving to join online start-ups, technology companies
and venture capital firms, the pillars of the new economy, where
they sometimes take home more than their old bosses from Day 1 _
and, they say, have more fun.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Wall Street became the surest
professional path to riches during the frenzied 1980s, those with
the biggest paydays are former investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Timothy Weller. He is the talk of the Street, but mostly
because he no longer works there. Last summer, Weller, 34, left
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, where he was a middle-ranking analyst
tracking the telecommunications business, to join Akamai
Technologies, which provides networking services for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, based in Cambridge, Mass., enticed him to sign on as
chief financial officer by selling him 1.05 million shares, valued
then at $2.63 million, and even lent him the money to buy them.
Gratification was quick: When Akamai went public in October, its
stock soared from $26 to $230. Weller's stake is now worth $240
million.
</P>
<P>
   Few bankers will reap such gains, but many are still taking
their chances on the Internet. One-time masters of the universe say
banking has become prosaic, with the heavy demands no longer
producing unrivaled rewards. Bankers now ogle online entrepreneurs
the way lawyers and accountants once envied Wall Streeters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that investment bankers were at the cutting
edge,'' said Mark Long, who as a banker for Credit Suisse First
Boston helped some of America's hottest Internet companies go
public. ``Today, bankers are just hired guns.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trip last summer to promote the Internet start-up
Intraware to potential investors, Long, 32, accepted his client's
offer to become a vice president, joining shortly before it went
public.
</P>
<P>
   If Intraware does well, Long stands to earn considerably more
than he did as a banker, thanks to stock options. But that is only
one reason he left. ``You get tired of sleeping 45 minutes a
night,'' he said, ``to sell someone else's business.''
</P>
<P>
   With profits for financial firms and bonuses for bankers at
all-time highs, there is certainly no looming crisis on Wall
Street. Even those who leave banking often do so with trepidation,
fearing that inflated Internet stocks could come crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is more a blow to the psyche. The pressure to earn
Internet windfalls shows up in little ways, as with the rising
stock analyst who says he has lost repeated bidding wars for Upper
East Side apartments and adds, only half in jest, that $10 million
does not buy much of a condo these days.
</P>
<P>
   The online lure is also enhanced by ex-bankers who have changed
careers seamlessly. Jeff Bezos worked on Wall Street until he
founded Amazon.com, and that trend keeps gathering steam. Bezos,
now many times a billionaire, hired a number of other former
bankers and made them Internet retailers. Analysts and deal makers
involved in technology, telecommunications and the Internet readily
change hats and become financial officers or strategic planners at
start-ups, often bringing along former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some defectors compete directly with their old firms. At least
three new online investment banks and several Internet
stock-and-bond trading companies, all planning to use the Internet
to steal business from traditional investment banks, are led by
people who learned the business from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lessin, chief executive of Wit Capital, an online
investment bank, and formerly a top officer at Salomon Smith
Barney, has poached a long list of bankers from Salomon, Merrill
Lynch and other firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm a banker but I get to wear casual clothes,''
said Kate Cornish, 28, who left Salomon for Wit a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Especially susceptible are those who are three to five years out
of business school _ on the cusp of devoting a career to a firm,
but young enough to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `I want to be a multimillionaire by the time I'm 30,
but if I stay at Morgan Stanley, it may take me until I'm 50,'''
said Joseph Perella, Morgan's head of investment banking.
Americans, he added, want ``instant gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction, Morgan Stanley has started offering stock to some
newly hired bankers. BancBoston Robertson Stephens, a leading
technology banking firm, has lost 10 bankers to Internet clients
this year. The firm recently took 300 employees to a weekend
retreat to help build esprit de corps and to aid retention, though
firm officials said it was not a response to this year's attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bank recruiters once acted like bouncers, accepting
only the best. Goldman Sachs still finds plenty of eager
applicants, says Peter Kiernan, a senior partner who oversees
hiring from business schools, but now, he said, ``if you expect to
back up a truck and load the top 10 people in a class, you're going
to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Business school graduates think entrepreneurial jobs are the
wave of the future, Kiernan said. He now tries to persuade people
that they can be entrepreneurs within an investment bank, which can
be a tough sell. ``One thing you don't do is try to sell against
the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Wall Street did not have to try so hard. With the
rapid growth of stocks and bonds and the explosion of mergers,
securities firms were seen as controlling the levers of America's
economy. Investment banking, offering top dollar, consistently
ranked as the No. 1 or No. 2 career choice for top business
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture followed the money. ``Wall Street,'' the movie,
and ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' the novel, created a stereotype of
sharklike bankers and traders whose only obstacle was their own
greed. In the early 1990s, investment banks were seen as the
engines of globalization, financing road projects in China and
privatizing phone companies in Brazil. While corporate America
merged and consolidated, bankers raked in record fees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet, like an electronic black hole, has stolen all
the gravity. Securities firms seem to have less to do with creating
Internet companies than they did with arranging restructurings or
sending capital abroad. And through the Silicon Valley
looking-glass, Wall Street egos can appear almost humble.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, wrote an
Op-Ed article in The New York Times last summer extolling the value
that entrepreneurs create in the economy and belittling the
``nonjobs'' of bankers. In ``The New New Thing,'' Michael Lewis,
who a decade ago chronicled Wall Street hubris in ``Liar's Poker,''
portrays today's financiers as desperate grovelers who shovel money
at Internet entrepreneurs in hopes of profiting from their creative
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem no different. They have pumped up the stocks of
Internet-friendly finance companies so much that a recent survey of
the wealthiest people in finance, compiled by Institutional
Investor magazine, found that the richest financiers often double
as Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the founder, chairman and chief executive of the
No. 1-ranked Internet broker, has seen his Schwab stock holdings
soar to almost $5.8 billion, making him the second-wealthiest
person in finance after Warren Buffett. J. Joe Ricketts, chairman
and co-chief executive of Ameritrade, the No. 7 Internet broker,
has stock holdings of almost $2 billion, eclipsing the combined
stock holdings of the leaders of Morgan Stanley, Merrill and
Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, headhunters rarely tried to lure bankers away
from Wall Street. But dot-com fever has changed that. When
Priceline.com decided in June to go after an investment banker to
fill a senior post at a unit it expected to take public shortly, it
asked Cynthia Remec, an executive recruiter, to round up candidates
the same day and set up interviews the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Remec frantically phoned 20 bankers to fill this tall order.
Within hours, to her surprise, she found 15 who were eager to hop
the train to Stamford, Conn., Priceline's headquarters, for an
interview. Priceline hired one of them, Anne Maffei, a former
banker at J.P. Morgan, as a senior executive at Webhouse.com, its
grocery-shopping affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and analysts on the front lines of the new economy
sometimes make especially easy pickings. Though the work hours of
Internet entrepreneurs are legendary, many bankers say the life
compares favorably with the burden of arranging a huge volume of
public offerings and mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like lead oar in `Ben Hur,''' said Bill Burnham, a
top analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston who left to join
Softbank Capital, an Internet-focused venture fund. ``No one works
harder than a tech banker or has less control over his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of stock options is also potent. Thomas Casey, 47, left
as co-head of global telecommunications and media at Merrill Lynch
to head corporate development, among other things, at Global
Crossing, a new telecom company that is building a fiber optic
network for Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the move was a roll of the dice. He left behind a
hefty pay package _ $3 million to $5 million a year at his level.
When he started at Global Crossing, he took a huge pay cut. But he
got options on 2 million shares when the stock was valued at $2 a
share. Those options are now valued at nearly $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Wall Street, you are not going to be so rich that your
children and grandchildren would never have to work again,'' Casey
said. ``But you have that opportunity if you go to a start-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said money was only one motivation. ``Ultimately, I wanted
to be in a position where I participated directly in creating
something substantial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some Wall Street firms are responding aggressively.
Nearly all the big ones have taken stakes in online trading
companies, including an array of virtual stock-trading forums known
as electronic communications networks. Most now allow clients to
buy and sell securities on the Internet. Several analysts predict
that Wall Street's willingness to compete online will slow the
growth of purely online rivals _ and perhaps stem the outflow of
seasoned bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But John Hewitt, a longtime Goldman vice president who helped
execute that firm's efforts to modernize its technology, still sees
the biggest securities firms as being stuck in another era. He
recently left Goldman to become president of Knight/Trimark, which
has used technology and low fees to lure stock-trading business.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, 48, said he long expected to retire as a Goldman
employee. But the more he learned about the Internet, he said, the
more it gnawed at him _ to the point that he raised his hand for
the Knight/Trimark job during a business dinner with Ken Pasternak,
the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Wall Street firms, Goldman included, have become so
successful that they have a vested interest in the status quo,''
Hewitt said. ``The more I thought about it, the more I felt I had
to go somewhere that had a sense of speed and that wasn't afraid of
the future.''

PANAMA SEES MIXED MESSAGES IN LOW-KEY CANAL CEREMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ With a mixture of national pride and
nostalgia, this nation receives control of the Panama Canal Tuesday
in a ceremony marking the end the Yankee era begun after the United
States finished the waterway that revolutionized world trade.
</P>
<P>
   But an apparent misunderstanding between the once-close partners
has commenced amid the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The official observance at the giant Miraflores Locks, where
various heads of state will be in attendance, will be devoid of
high-ranking members of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the absence takes luster and importance away from
the historic event, set in motion by the 1977 treaties signed by
President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian military strongman Omar
Torrijos to give the canal to Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   The country of 2.8 million has lived with U.S. bases and
soldiers since the canal was completed in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, many see it as a slap in the face and lack of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians wonder if it is an accidental diplomatic gaffe or a
message that the United States is relegating the country to
backwater status now that the military is leaving. Although the
official handover is Tuesday, it doesn't take effect until noon
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said Monday that relations
with the United States remained excellent but said Panama was
disheartened by the U.S. representation at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America, not just Panama, is disappointed. The United
States is missing out on this opportunity. It shows the lack of
(American) diplomatic attention to the region,'' Aleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main trading partner of the United States is Latin America
and we can't see how they cannot be present at such a historic
event,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   King Juan Carlos of Spain will attend and so will five Latin
American presidents, including Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton is staying home, and his emissary,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also canceled late last
week, citing Middle East concerns.
</P>
<P>
   So Carter, hailed here as a champion of human rights who
understood the U.S. military should leave Panama, is the main man.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the U.S. delegation are Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater and Commerce Secretary William Daley. The
highest-ranking diplomat is Peter Romero, the acting assistant
secretary of state for Western Hemispheric Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Panama, which has been administering the canal this past decade
in a transition that began in 1979, also has been buffeted by
remarks in the U.S. Congress that the country is unprepared to
manage and protect the 50-mile-long channel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is offended that many Americans believe a threat
from Communist China is imminent because Panama signed a 20-year
contract with a Hong Kong-based sea ports conglomerate, Hutchinson
Whampoa Ltd., that will control the canal's Atlantic and Pacific
ports. Hutchinson has interests throughout the world, including the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said the
agreement with Hutchinson posed a serious threat to U.S. security
and meant China could expand its communist web in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very sad to hear the amount of lies being told at these
congressional hearings. These lies are told over and over again,
and people start to believe them,'' said Aleman, who added that
Rohrabacher was ``not mentally fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but these are ignorant people who don't know
what is going on this country,'' the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman added he would like in the coming years to renegotiate
the Neutrality Treaty by which the United States has the right to
intervene militarily should the canal come under any menace.
</P>
<P>
   Panama does not have a military since the U.S. invasion
dissolved the 16,000-strong Panamanian Defense Forces of Gen.
Manuel Noriega 10 years ago. The national police will be in charge
of canal security in the event of any threats, which people here
say is much less with the U.S. troops gone.
</P>
<P>
   But guerrilla activity in neighboring Colombia makes many here
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no force to defend ourselves against terrorists or
guerrillas filtering in from the Colombian jungle,'' said Jose Luis
Martinez, an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not ready to live without the American soldiers,''
he added, echoing the opinion of many working-class Panamanians who
would have liked U.S. soldiers to stay in the country _ at least
for a while longer.

 &HT;    Winter meetings produce blockbuster 4-team trade
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ No team in baseball has transformed itself
since season's end like Colorado, a process that continued Monday
with a trans-continental escapade involving four teams, nine
players and all four time zones.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest winter meetings trade since the days Ted Turner
would rule the hotel cocktail lounge, the Rockies acquired four
more players, including starting pitchers Scott Karl from Milwaukee
and Rolando Arrojo from Tampa Bay. That brings to 15 the number new
players, via trade or free agency, that new Colorado general
manager Dan O'Dowd has acquired since Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team as it stood in the division didn't work,'' said
O'Dowd. ``It didn't work for two reasons. One, there was a bad mix
in the clubhouse; the guys just didn't click. And two, as much as
the club led the league in runs scored, it had back-to-back poor
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's not an aberration. That's a pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was not cheap. Colorado had to send third baseman Vinny
Castilla to Tampa Bay as well as catcher Henry Blanco and
right-hander Jamey Wright to the Brewers. But the Rockies also
picked up third baseman Jeff Cirillo and cash in exchange from
Milwaukee as well as infielder Aaron Ledesma from the Devil Rays.
To complete the deal, Colorado sent minor pitcher Justin Miller to
Oakland, which in turn dealt right-hander (and LaGrange native)
Jimmy Haynes to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was thought to be the biggest at the winter meetings
since the 11-man, three-team extravaganza of Dec. 8, 1977, when
Turner helped concoct the Willie Montanez-John Matlack-Al Oliver
trade between the Braves, Texas and New York Mets. And this one was
almost bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out being a relatively simple process involving the
Rockies and the Brewers,'' Milwaukee GM Dean Taylor said. ``But it
became complicated because the Brewers were looking for two
pitchers. We felt strongly about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complication was Dan had to go out and acquire a second
pitcher for us. We gave him five names and he went to work on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays later punctuated the day with announcing it had
signed free agent outfielder Greg Vaughn to a multi-year contract,
placing him in the middle of an order that already includes Jose
Canseco, Fred McGriff and Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're heading in the right direction with the moves
we made today,'' said Tampa Bay GM Chuck La Mar, whose club is
132-192 in its first two years of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Braves report
</P>
<P>
   GM John Schuerholz meets with two more clubs this morning but
</P>
<P>
   don't anticipate any action. While the Braves are said to have
shown some interest in left-hander Kenny Rogers, San Diego's bid
for second baseman Bret Boone is officially dead and there was no
progress in retaining free agent outfielder Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a (dollar) number we would consider signing him,''
Schuerholz said, ``and a lot of numbers at which we would be
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Betemit verdict
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, vice president for major league operations,
expects to issue a ruling on the Adrian Beltre early-signing case
by week's end, when the Los Angeles Dodgers are expected to be
found guilty of signing the third baseman before his 16th birthday.
Alderson anticipates ruling on a similar case involving Braves
prospect Wilson Betemit ``if not by the first of the year, then
very shortly thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence the Braves signed Betemit out of the Dominican
Republic two months before his 15th birthday and 14 months before
clubs are permitted to sign foreign free agents. While Alderson
indicated the Betemit case is not more complicated than Beltre's,
he said, ``It's just at a different part of the pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   With a fully stocked 40-man roster, the Braves could not
participate in Monday's Rule 5 draft and went almost ignored by
other clubs throughout the process. The only player lost from the
system was right-hand prospect Aaron Taylor, who was taken from
Class A Macon by the Seattle organization in the AA Draft. . . .
The New York Yankees rewarded Game 3 World Series hero Chad Curtis
by sending him to Texas in exchange for minor league pitchers Sam
Marsonek and Brandon Knight. . . . Ex-Braves closer Brad Clontz
continued his national tour with his trade from Pittsburgh to
Arizona. The Diamondbacks mark Clontz's fourth organization since
the Braves released him 16 months ago.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: AD EXECUTIVE LAUNCHES A CAMPAIGN TO CURB YOUTH
VIOLENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Colo.)   By WESTRAY BATTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the wake of several high-profile school shootings
this year, lawmakers, parents and educators have been looking for
solutions to curb youth violence. Madison Avenue has traditionally
tried to support such efforts by creating public service
advertising, offering the commercials and print campaigns free to
the media. But one advertising executive has taken a different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rambam, already a seasoned executive at 32, has started
Shine, which stands for Seeking Harmony in Neighborhoods Everyday,
a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing youth violence.
Using a Web site as its hub, at shine.excite.com, Shine tries to
provide teenagers a voice to express themselves through poetry and
art about substantive topics like racism, self-esteem and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The site features original work created by children to promote
peaceful solutions to troubling issues. Celebrities like Puffy
Combs, Katie Couric and Kevin Spacey have also contributed
inspirational words and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton has joined Rambam's crusade, naming him
director of the National Youth Campaign for the National Campaign
Against Youth Violence. Clinton created this initiative soon after
the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
According to Rambam, the president is planning to announce various
programs for parents and children that would involve Shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shine began its own $30 million antiviolence campaign in October
with advertising and media partners including Excite(AT)Home, Tommy
Hilfiger, MTV and Teen People magazine. The companies have
committed a combination of money, media space and commercial time.
</P>
<P>
   Each is sponsoring a different medium for the campaign:
Excite(AT)Home, online; MTV, television; Teen People, print; and
Hilfiger, outdoor. In addition, Geppetto &AMP; Partners in New York,
part of the WPP Group, was named agency of record.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon Digital Animation Studios in New York, part of
Viacom &UR;  &LR; Inc., developed the first television commercial for Shine,
which is running on MTV. The spot features Maxine, a digitally
created hip teenager, walking into a serene field filled with
vibrant flowers. Then as a storm of dark clouds and debris swirl
around her while she hears recent news reports about teen-age
violence, she shouts: ``Stop! Choose your weapon: art, music,
technology. Shine: you stop youth violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to establish Shine as a brand, Rambam said, not
unlike other labels popular among American youth. The Web site uses
a phrase meant to serve the way a tag line or slogan does for a
brand, ``Take a stand; use your voice; impact your world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Friedman, vice president for public affairs at MTV in
New York, also part of Viacom, said the partnership with Shine
``raises the visibility of our viewers' No. 1 issue and allows kids
the platform to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV and Shine are producing a contest, called Speak Your Peace,
asking young participants to offer an idea for a 30-second public
service announcement to stop youth violence. Two spots will be
produced to run 50 times each on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger is sponsoring a similar contest, ``Stop Violence, Start
Art,'' which will place winning entries on billboards in the
winners' hometowns. Hilfiger is also printing the Shine Web address
and message on about 600,000 garment tags in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Teen People is planning to play host to a national series of
``Teen Town Hall'' meetings, award an annual scholarship and donate
space in its pages to promote Shine. The magazine will also produce
content for the Shine network, an in-school club aimed at helping
students curb violence and racism in their communities.It will
publish lesson plans in Scholastic &UR;  &LR; Inc. publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only with the help of teen-inspired ideas and solutions can we
start to eliminate youth violence,'' said Anne Zehren, the
publisher of Teen People, part of the Time Inc. unit of Time
Warner &UR;  &LR; Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rambam is not new to Shine's main audience or mission. 1n 1989,
Shelly Rambam, his mother, who was a teacher, was killed in a
hit-and-run accident. Largely in honor of her, in 1991 he started
Zoot Suit in Philadelphia, an agency devoted to advertising aimed
at children.
</P>
<P>
   Rambam also founded Kids Bridge in 1994, a nonprofit series of
four multicultural children's complexes under construction in New
Jersey. Raising more than $6 million, including a $350,000 Housing
and Urban Development grant from Congress, Rambam said the
complexes would consist of an art gallery and theater.
</P>
<P>
   After working with clients like Crayola, Hilfiger and Toys ``R''
Us, Zoot Suit was acquired in April 1997 by Gillespie in Princeton,
N.J., now part of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, a unit of
the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group &UR;  &LR; of
Co.s.
</P>
<P>
   To communicate with children effectively, Rambam said, recalling
a lesson he learned at Zoot Suit, ``it's necessary to speak to them
in their voice, not at them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Shine selected Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys, the
popular rap trio, to be host of a Voices Against Youth Violence
meeting last month in Washington, which drew almost 500 young
participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to shift the paradigm away from Nintendo and
`South Park,''' Rambam said, ``and toward programming that is
involving and accepting of the specific ethnic backgrounds,
interests and tastes of young consumers, while maintaining a cool
and hip brand identity.''

   Author's work captured nation's dark mood
</P>

</P>
<P>
   By Michael Skube
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He gave our vexations a name.
</P>
<P>
   Every middle manager caught between his bosses and his
subordinates, every wife caught between what her husband says and
what he does, everyone in American life who gets it coming and
going knows what a Catch-22 is even if he couldn't tell you who
Joseph Heller was.
</P>
<P>
   Heller, who died of a heart attack Sunday at age 76, occupied
the amorphous middle ground in American fiction, never really in
and never really out. His name was built with a first novel that
overshadowed everything he subsequently wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Catch-22'' was published in 1961, the '60s had begun only
in the chronological sense. The broader cultural meaning of the
word would not take shape until the number of American ground
forces in Vietnam ballooned and the nation was bitterly divided
over a war the Pentagon but few others believed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22,'' though set in World War II, was one of the first
expressions of irreverence directed at the American military, by
turns cynical and satirical, darkly funny and pessimistic that the
generals knew what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Its protaganist, Capt. Yossarian, a bomber pilot who knows his
next mission might be his last, feigns insanity to avoid duty. In
doing so he confronts every soldier's no-win dilemma: Only a crazy
person would want to go into combat, but only the mentally unfit
are excused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy,''
Heller once said. ``Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts _
and the question is: what does a sane man do in an insane
society?''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, who flew 60 combat missions in Europe in World War II,
had in mind a regulation from his time in the Army Air Force. He
had planned to call his book ``Catch-18,'' but Leon Uris'
best-selling ``Mila 18'' had come out the previous year and
Heller's publishers were afraid readers would confuse the two.
Heller said he picked the number 22 out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The book almost vanished into thin air as well. Except for an
effusive review in The New Republic that called Heller ``one of the
most extravagant talents now among us,'' the hardback edition of
``Catch-22'' mostly annoyed the literary sensibilities of the day.
The Oct. 22, 1961 issue of the The New York Times Book Review said
of it:
</P>
<P>
   ``'Catch-22' has much passion, comic and fervent, but it gasps
for want of craft and sensibility. If 'Catch-22' were intended as a
commentary novel, such sideswiping of character and action might be
taken care of by thematic control. It fails here because half of
its incidents are farcical and fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in ``Books of the Century: A Hundred Years of
Authors, Ideas and Literature,'' the editors of the Times Book
Review acknowledged hasty judgment in a single word: ``Oops!''
</P>
<P>
   Not until ``Catch-22'' came out in paperback in 1963 did it
become a best-seller. By the end of the decade, with the Vietnam
war at full pitch, Heller's humor and contempt seemed to many
Americans to have hit the nail on the head. And the 1970 movie that
was based on the book _ greeted with mixed reviews of its own _
sealed the idea and the phrase into the into popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Heller tired of being told he hadn't written
anything as good as ``Catch-22.'' ``I always say, 'Neither has
anyone else','' he told an interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, original as ``Catch-22'' was, many critics believe
his 1974 novel ``Something Happened'' to be equally penetrating as
social commentary. Written in Heller's over-the-top manner, it
satirizes the business world's readiness to crush the spirit of the
individual and presents a view of modern life more contemporary, if
anything, than what's found in ``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had been put in its place, but the corporation and
its faceless functionaries were another matter. They were, in their
own way, just as ridiculous. It wasn't a world for which Joseph
Heller was suited, and better for him that he wasn't. His friend
Barbara Gelb, interviewing him for the New York Times when
``Something Happened'' came out, observed that he had described
Yossarian (``with shrewd self-knowledge') as ``a crotchety old
fogey of 28.'' Heller himself was a crotchety old-fogey of 51 at
the time, amused by what he regarded as civilian insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years now,'' Gelb wrote, `` I have managed to overlook
his frequent sulkiness, his gluttonous table manners and his
tendency to growl No before he even knows what the question is. I
have stayed on good terms with him largely because I relish his
aberrant sense of humor and his skewed way of looking at life _ an
outlook he insists has changed little since he wrote Catch-22.' ''

COMMENTARY: LAND OF THE EMPTY BALLOTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every state has shortcomings that its residents don't like to
talk about. Wherever you live, I'm sure there are local
embarrassments you'd prefer not to see broadcast in the national
media _ monster pig farms, a demented governor, whatever. I myself
grew up in a Midwestern city that once elected Jerry Springer
mayor, and you don't see me bringing it up every time I go back
there to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we've got to have a little discussion about New
York election laws. The state Republican Party has fixed the March
7 presidential primary so that John McCain is finding it almost
impossible to get on the ballot. If you like McCain, that ought to
make you angry. If you like George W. Bush you ought to be angry
too. The man has pots and pots of money and the endorsement of
every powerful Republican in the state. You don't want people
thinking that with all that, he still needs to slash the other
team's tires to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are just operating within the local political
culture, which says that the only good election is an uncontested
election. In most of America, the person with the most votes wins.
Here, the person with the best election lawyer throws everybody
else off the ballot. ``It's like Chinese water torture, only not as
much fun,'' said Gerry O'Brien, the McCain state political
director.
</P>
<P>
   To run in the Republican presidential primary in New York you've
got to put together a delegate slate in every one of the state's 31
congressional districts, some of which have more politically active
Zoroastrians than Republicans. Workers residing in each of these
districts then have the month of December to collect signatures of
local party members, in rigid conformance to the incredibly picky
election law standards. The names must then be alphabetized by the
seventh son of a seventh son, born under the sign of the Great Auk.
</P>
<P>
   I was making up that last part. Although you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, organizers for Steve Forbes got his signatures
in heavily Democratic New York City districts by recruiting
unemployed minority teen-agers, registering them as Republicans and
paying them sizable weekly salaries to go door-to-door. ``It was a
political `Stand and Deliver,''' one of the organizers told me
proudly. ``It would have made a great movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's hard to envision a feel-good movie that ends with
Steve Forbes qualifying for the New York primary ballot.
Nevertheless, it was nice knowing that the state's election laws
were finally being used to create jobs for somebody besides
election lawyers. This year the Forbes campaign is paying $12 an
hour for signature collectors, and expects to spend at least
$750,000 getting the candidate on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This is an even crazier procedure than the Iowa straw poll,
which everybody was complaining so bitterly about last summer.
Sure, the Iowa Republicans made the candidates pay a kind of head
tax for every supporter who wanted to vote. But at least they
didn't do it during the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Only super-wealthy candidates can put together enough resources
to get on the New York ballot without the support of the party
organization. Forbes is about the only Republican who's managed to
pull the trick off in recent history. Paul Tsongas barely qualified
for the Democratic primary in 1992, and that near miss so
embarrassed the party that it made its rules rational.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said last week that if he failed to get on the statewide
ballot, he was going to go to court. He called on Gov. George
Pataki and other party leaders to disavow the rules and help all
serious candidates qualify for the primary. Pataki, who reportedly
nurtures hopes of being Bush's vice-presidential nominee on an
All-George ticket, ignored the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party won't bend the rules to accommodate
McCain while he spends time campaigning in other states,'' said the
governor's spokeswoman. Bush, she noted, has already done mailings
in New York, and made several campaign appearances. ``We want this
state to play a vital role in the election process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the only state in the union in which playing a
vital role in the election process does not necessarily involve
giving your party members a chance to vote.

Yossarian (``with shrewd self-knowledge') as ``a crotchety old
fogey of 28.'' Heller himself was a crotchety old-fogey of 51 at
the time, amused by what he regarded as civilian insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years now,'' Gelb wrote, `` I have managed to overlook
his frequent sulkiness, his gluttonous table manners and his
tendency to growl No before he even knows what the question is. I
have stayed on good terms with him largely because I relish his
aberrant sense of humor and his skewed way of looking at life _ an
outlook he insists has changed little since he wrote Catch-22.' ''

VIDEOTAPES GIVE NEW INSIGHT INTO COLUMBINE KILLERS

   GOLDEN, Colo. _ Videotapes made by two teen-agers as they
planned a shooting massacre and their suicides at Columbine High
School show them to be filled with hateful rage, hoping to kill 250
people, yet sympathetic to their parents for what they would soon
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be put through hell once we do this,'' one of
the killers, Eric Harris, said of his parents in the last of
several tapes he made with Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   And as if to exonerate their parents from any guilt, remorse or
responsibility, Harris quietly quotes Shakespeare: ``Good wombs
have borne bad sons.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities showed the tapes to reporters Monday after Time
magazine reported on them in this week's edition, which was made
available to the media on Sunday. The Denver Rocky Mountain News
reported on the tapes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some families of the victims were angered at the Jefferson
County Sheriff's Department for releasing the tapes, along with
surveillance videos from the Columbine cafeteria, where no one was
shot, but the killers are seen walking around students who are
cowering behind overturned desks and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The pair made three tapes in the weeks leading to the April 20
assault, in which they killed 13 people and wounded two dozen
others before turning their guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes form a macabre documentary of the meticulous planning
of the attack, which they called retaliation for what they describe
as years of taunting from friends and relatives because of their
unwillingness to dress and act as others wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with profanity and racial epithets, the tapes reflect two
boys who concluded that they could no longer cope with everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could see all the anger I've stored over the past four
years,'' Klebold says.
</P>
<P>
   ``More rage, more rage,'' Harris said. ``I'm building it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The rage erupted at their school in the Denver suburb of
Littleton, as the two seniors detonated bombs and marched through
the library, where they shot and killed 12 students and a teacher
before turning guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Halverson, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Office, said Monday that the tapes were being shown to reporters
Monday because Time magazine had violated its agreement with
investigators by using direct quotes from the tapes and the
authorities feared ``the potential for sensationalism and the
resulting anguish to the victims' families.''
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators agreed to screen them for Time ``for
background purposes only'' to provide information about the motives
of the killers.
</P>
<P>
   But Diana Pearson, a spokeswoman for Time, said the magazine
made no such agreement nor did the authorities insist on any
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tapes were shown Monday, neither the families of
the victims nor those of the gunmen had seen the tapes, Halverson
said, adding that arrangements were being made Monday for the
families to view them.
</P>
<P>
   Krista Flannigan, a victim services consultant who has worked
with many of the relatives of the shooting victims at Columbine,
said that she had talked to many of the families Monday and that
some were upset because the tapes were shown publicly before they
had viewed them, but that others were glad the public had a chance
to see the gunmen for what they were.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the homemade tapes, most of them shot in the Harris
home, last more than two hours and were made between March 15 and
sometime just before the shooting began, when the boys spent a
little over a minute saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says: ``I just wanted to apologize to you guys. To
everyone I love, I'm really sorry about all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold adds: ``Just know going to a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the tapes, the boys talk extemporaneously about
the frustrations of their lives and their plans for April 20,
against a backdrop of obvious self-loathing and expressed hatred
for all mankind, especially minority groups, whom they belittle
repeatedly with ugly racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is society? Just stupid human beings living off each
other,'' says Klebold at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Harris said that after the killings, ``We
need to die, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The tapes provide new insight into the most perplexing question
in the aftermath of the shootings: How could two teen-age boys from
comfortable middle-class families have build up so much anger and
rage to shoot innocent classmates at random?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the answer becomes quickly apparent as the two boys,
sitting on easy chairs in the Harris home, take turns talking into
the camera, recalling all the people who they feel slighted,
taunted or mistreated them. The list includes elementary school
classmates, relatives and many of the teen-agers who attend
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging a pent-up rage to ``get paybacks'' against
perceived enemies, which they said they had been denied by rules
that govern everyday life, they describe how they expect their
crime to ``kick-start a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it fun to get the respect that we're going to deserve?''
says Harris, who is holding the sawed-off shotgun he would use at
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The boys also recount several episodes in which they said their
plans might have been interrupted if their parents had exercised
more curiosity about their activities. Harris is especially lucid
in these moments, leaving the impression that perhaps he wished his
parents, Wayne and Kathy Harris, had interceded.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, he talks about walking past his mother as he
left home, with the end of a shotgun protruding out of a bag. He
says his mother thought it was his BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   More harrowing for the viewer, however, is a 17-minute visit to
Harris' cluttered bedroom, in which he plays tour guide for Klebold
as cinematographer and interviewer. With exquisite precision and
detail, Harris holds before the camera a virtual arsenal of
weapons, bombs and ammunition that he has concealed on shelves, in
boxes and behind knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he indicates a ``bunker'' outside his window where
he claims to be storing mortar grenades, pipe bombs and other
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, my parents never searched my room,'' he tells
Klebold.''
</P>
<P>
   As they're leaving his room, he pretends his mother has just
walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks good, son,'' he says, as if to mock her.
</P>
<P>
   A segment taped in Klebold's room also shows a collection of
ammunition, guns and a knife, and in separate sessions in each of
their homes, they taped themselves in dress rehearsals for April
20, trying on their belts and harnesses with loaded weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes also reveal critical differences between the two
teen-agers. While the tapes do not make clear, as reports of the
killing surmised, that Harris was the schemer and Klebold the
follower, it does become apparent that Harris is the deeper thinker
of the two. During much of their philosophical discourse, Harris
introduces most new thoughts, and Klebold builds on them.
</P>
<P>
   It is also during those moments in which Harris, far more than
Klebold, expresses sadness and regret _ hauntingly, at times _ for
what they feel they must do and how he thinks it will affect his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says of his parents: ``My Dad's great, and my mother,
she's so thoughtful. She helps out in so many ways. I wish I was a
sociopath, so I didn't have any remorse for this. But I do. They
are going to go through hell for this. This is going to tear them
apart.''

NEOPHYTES HELP ELECTRIFY MAYORAL RUNOFF IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The two dozen people waiting outside Tom
Ammiano's campaign headquarters at Josie's Cabaret and Juice Joint
piled in when the doors opened like frantic Christmas shoppers,
grabbing stacks of ``Tom for Mayor'' and ``Make History'' bumper
stickers as though they were the last Pokemon toys on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be 51 on the 20th and this is the first campaign
I've ever wanted to be a part of,'' said Ed McCready, a computer
graphics designer plastering his clothes with yellow and black
``Mayor Tom Ammiano'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been like this here for six weeks now _ ever since
Ammiano, the president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
forced Mayor Willie Brown into a run-off election on Tuesday with a
last-minute write-in campaign that captured 25 percent of the vote
in a four-way race.
</P>
<P>
   They are both liberals in the nation's most devoutly liberal
bastion, and both have experienced the sting of discrimination.
Brown, 65, is San Francisco's first African-American mayor, and
Ammiano, 58, would become the nation's first openly gay mayor of a
large city if he were elected. But the election battle here has had
little to do with race or sexual orientation. It has been much more
about who best could tackle pressing issues like housing costs, and
who best symbolizes San Francisco's heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   And by those measures, Ammiano's supporters, many of them young
renters, have sometimes seemed like religious zealots, registering
more than 14,000 new voters, plastering the city with posters and
holding fund-raising rock concerts, comedy shows and wrestling
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an electrifying event,'' said Molly Berry, 30, a
campaign worker. ``We're open from 9 to 9, and an hour doesn't go
by without at least a dozen people coming in asking to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's supporters, on the other hand, have the money and the
clout. Indeed, to say that the race between Ammiano, a former
teacher and stand-up comic, and Brown, the former speaker of the
State Assembly and one of California's most powerful, experienced
politicians, is a David-and-Goliath battle, only begins to describe
it.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last week by The San Francisco Chronicle shows Brown
leading Ammiano by 20 points, 49 to 29 percent, with 22 percent
undecided. He held an even bigger lead among older homeowners,
those most likely to vote. Still, the same newspaper's polls
wrongly predicted that Ammiano would come in last in the general
election on Nov. 2, with 11 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is taking no chances, amassing a huge campaign fund since
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six weeks, his campaign has received at least $1.3
million in unregulated, or ``soft money'' from hastily formed
political action committees, in addition to spending $400,000 (a
voter-approved voluntary spending cap) from his general campaign
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's campaign has received $4,500 in independent spending,
and $250,000 over all.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has received endorsements from California's political
establishment, the small but potentially influential San Francisco
Republican Party, the city's two local daily newspapers, and most
of the city's major labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   He has received $22,600 in contributions from a landlord's group
_ sworn enemies of Ammiano, who has declared ``war on
gentrification'' _ in the form of a contribution to an independent
political action committee, and $200,000 from the Alice B. Toklas
Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club's political action committee, which
spent $175,000 on a television commercial featuring a gay couple
that decides to vote for Brown because of Ammiano's ``out there''
tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, whose platform focuses on tenants' rights and creating
a ``living wage'' for all workers, has been endorsed by the Bicycle
Messengers union, day laborers and tenants' rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several days, the California Democratic Party has
recruited legislative staffers from Sacramento to campaign for
Brown, offering them up to four free nights at the Hilton to come
here and walk the precincts. The party put $80,000 into Brown's
campaign in the November election and anticipated spending another
$100,000 in this runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ammiano's volunteers have never been involved in a
political campaign before, and some have never voted.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, Peter Humphrey, a 35-year-old building
contractor, who said he throws wrestling parties for fun, threw a
``wrestling ball'' for Ammiano in a dark, rented space. A referee
with a grizzled beard wearing a blond woman's wig, shouted out
points as men and women, some dressed in '40s swing clothes,
tussled with strangers on mats. Humphrey asked for donations from
$3 to $250 and collected a total of $391 from the 50 guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even been registered to vote in 10 years,'' said
Humphrey, wearing a red robe over his wrestling trunks. He said he
felt compelled to hold the fundraiser, because ``it's time to look
out for the little guy.''

HELLER'S PRESAGED THE '60S WITH `CATCH-22' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has to be one of the great openings in modern literature:
``It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the
chaplain he fell madly in love with him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the anarchic beginning of Joseph Heller's ``Catch-22''
and set the tone. The phrase entered the language, but more than
that, it caught the spirit of the '60s generation that changed
America.
</P>
<P>
   Heller died of a heart attack Sunday in New York. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ralph J. Gleason, the late Chronicle columnist who
was one of the novel's early champions _ and it needed them _ the
book had ``a pervasive effect on an entire generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark, comic, subversive novel, published in 1961, expressed
disillusion with World War II but, uncannily, presaged the mood of
young people who soon would be opposing the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems reasonable to say that, aside from Bob Dylan and the
Beatles, no single body of work changed how an emerging generation
saw the world as did the vision presented on `Catch-22,''' Gleason
wrote in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Catch-22 is the dilemma of trying to stay sane in an insane
society. The only way to remain sane is to risk being considered
crazy. Here is how Gleason explained it:
</P>
<P>
   ``In Heller's monstrously funny novel, his hero, a World War II
bombardier named Yossarian, asks to be relieved of combat duty
because he is crazy. The medical officer turns him down because of
Catch-22 _ `anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't
crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yossarian believed that ``the enemy is anybody who's going to
get you killed, no matter what side he's on.'' The medical officer
said, ``That crazy bastard may be the only sane one of us left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch-22'' did not catch on when it was first published in
hardback. The reviews were mixed, some of them openly hostile.
Other reviews, notably by Robert Brustein in the New Republic and
by Nelson Algren in the Nation, saw ``Catch-22'' for the brilliant
work it was, but the book did not take off until it was published
in paperback. It has since become a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Heller was working as an advertising copywriter in the mid-'50s
when he sold the incomplete ``Catch-22'' to Simon &AMP; Schuster on the
basis of 250 pages. It was the first book bought by young editor
Robert Gottlieb, who went on to head the Knopf publishing house and
later was editor of the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Heller, who was 38 when ``Catch-22'' was finally published, said
in an interview with the Chronicle's Leah Garchik that it took
eight more years for him to achieve financial independence, when
the book was sold to Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad success didn't happen sooner,'' he told Garchik.
``It's hard to be a writer. Unlike other professions, the longer
one's life is, the more difficult it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller wrote five more novels, but none of them had the impact
of ``Catch-22.'' The somber tone of his second novel, ``Something
Happened,'' puzzled readers who were expecting another comic
whirlwind. It dealt with the bleak life of a business executive
haunted by a nameless fear. In Heller's view, business was
organized on a pecking order of fear, where everyone is afraid of
the person above and the basic fear is the loss of job security.
</P>
<P>
   Gleason's drumbeating for ``Catch-22'' in his columns in the
'60s had helped the book's phenomenal success in paperback, but
things had changed by the time ``Something Happened'' was published
in 1974 _ Heller was a slow writer. It failed to ignite a
following.
</P>
<P>
   The movie version of ``Catch-22'' was made by director Mike
Nichols in 1971, with Alan Arkin as Yossarian and a screenplay by
Buck Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Yossarian is crazy enough to be alive at the end of the film,
paddling away in a lifeboat, and he is still alive at the end of
Heller's revisiting of the character in a second book, ``Closing
Time.'' In his preface to a 1994 reissue of ``Catch-22,'' Heller
notes that a physician friend in the second novel tells Yossarian:
``Everyone has to go. Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Heller writes, ``Yossarian, now 70, will have
to pass away, too. But it won't be by my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Yossarian is still alive, but Sunday it was Heller's turn.

HARVARD BEGINS UPGRADING SERVICES TO SPOT MENTALLY   TROUBLED
STUDENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Harvard University is planning a sweeping
upgrade of its mental health services, seeking to weave a better
net to catch psychologically vulnerable students, whose numbers,
experts say, seem to be mounting at campuses around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard panel has recommended such steps as hiring more
therapists, extending counseling hours at the university's health
service, training faculty and residential tutors better on mental
health problems and even setting aside ``safe spaces'' in
university buildings where students can find respite from crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which began circulating internally last month and
whose summary is posted on the World Wide Web at
www.provost.harvard.edu is just beginning to go into effect, said
Harvey V. Fineberg, the university provost, who is overseeing it.
</P>
<P>
   It comes during a suicide-free, murder-free, generally
crisis-free year for Harvard. But that is just the time to put
preventive measures in place, Fineberg said, because no one is
feeling defensive. In the last decade, Harvard, whose undergraduate
and graduate students number about 18,000, has averaged about one
suicide a year, and was rocked by a murder-suicide in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stress levels for students are high at Harvard,'' the report,
based on a year of widespread interviews and research, said.
``Almost all deans of students expressed the belief that their
school presented the most stressful environment, and emphasized the
increasing fragility of students and apparent higher incidence of
depression and serious mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it said, ``Across Harvard, the stigma of seeking
help for emotional problems or mental health concerns is difficult
for students who are accustomed to performing at the highest
levels,'' and many are ``unwilling to confide in tutors and
advisers who may eventually write graduate school or job
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Summergrad, chairman of the committee that produced the
analysis and plan said: ``It's an attempt to look at mental health
and support services in a clinical and very broad university
context. I'm not aware of another study that has done that.'' The
basic idea, he said, ``is to build an increasingly redundant set of
services so we can have multiple ways that we can help students
enter care.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. surgeon general's report on mental health released in
Washington on Monday highlighted how common some mental disorders
were, Summergrad noted, and the Harvard report addresses, among
other things, the need to help people make the tricky distinction
between everyday problems and illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard report asks, for example: ``Is a student's inability
to finish a paper due to poor study habits, an inappropriate choice
of major, changing academic interests or obsessive-compulsive
disorder? Is difficulty living with roommates a cultural adjustment
or a manifestation of social phobia? Is a change in behavior or
appearance a struggle for a new sense of self or a reflection of
incipient schizophrenia?''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials said that for all the prestigious university's
special pressures, they did not believe students here suffered from
more psychological problems than elsewhere. Rather, they and others
said, there has seemed to be a general rise in recent years in
mental health troubles among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the research has shown in the last decade is that we're
beginning to see an increase in severe problems in college
students,'' said Perry C. Francis, president-elect of the American
College Counseling Association. That situation is happening in
part, he and others said, because teenagers with psychiatric
disorders are getting better treatment and thus advancing more
often to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it, you could say, is due to modern psychiatric
medications that allow students to keep certain mental illnesses
under control,'' Francis said ``The rub, or the issue, is that
you're finding many colleges or universities ill-prepared to deal
with their students' mental health, or counseling is seen as just
an add-on to student services.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Heidi Levine, chairwoman of the commission on counseling and
psychological services of the American College Personnel
Association, attributed some of the increase in recognized mental
illness on campus to improved diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are receiving treatments earlier,'' she said, often for
``some things that maybe in the past we chalked up to adolescent
moodiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``people who in the past might never have been able to
come to college because of serious mental illness are now able to
come to campus,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.))
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Contributors to the Harvard report emphasized the simple
statistical fact that, as Fineberg put it, ``mental health problems
are the prime area of vulnerability for young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Over recent years, said Dr. Michael Jellinek, chief of child
psychiatry services at Massachusetts General Hospital and a
professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School,
``there's been more and more attention paid to the mental health
problems of both college and graduate students.''
</P>
<P>
   Research documents extensive eating disorders among college
students, he said, and many other serious psychiatric illnesses
appear around college age, from clinical depression to addictive
behaviors to schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I read the report,'' Jellinek said of the Harvard
plan, ``it emphasized the notion of looking at every aspect of
college life to make it more supportive,'' from how dormitories are
organized to how resident counselors are trained.

SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF GENE-ALTERED FOOD PROTEST AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Ill.) (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ As the Food and Drug Administration had the
last of its three public hearings on bio-engineered food Monday,
hundreds of protesters staged what organizers said was the largest
rally ever in the United States against the use of genetic
engineering in food.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that scientists might become more active in
defense of biotechnology, about 30 professors and graduate students
from the nearby University of California campuses in Berkeley and
Davis had a demonstration of their own nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these demonstrators were from Berkeley's department of
plant and microbial biology, which last year entered into a
controversial arrangement to receive $25 million in research funds
from Novartis, the huge Swiss drug and agriculture company.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting protests, which co-existed peacefully outside
the federal building here, reflect the increasing public concern
about genetically altered crops, which have swept largely unnoticed
into American agriculture over the last decade. Because of that
concern, the FDA had hearings in Chicago and Washington last month
to inform the public about its regulations on biotech foods and
seek comment on whether those rules need to be changed. The meeting
here took place under tight security, with everyone required to
walk through metal detectors and to wear identifying badges.
</P>
<P>
   The Novartis contribution, which represents 30 percent of the
microbial biology department's research funds, has caused
dissension both on campus and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances in which it is being set up give just too
much space for suspicion that it is tainted by the contribution of
Novartis,'' said Ignacio Chapela, an assistant professor of
microbial ecology who had opposed the Novartis deal, saying it
would undermine the academic integrity of the university.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilhelm Gruissem, a professor of plant and microbial biology
who is chairman of the committee overseeing the university research
financed by Novartis, said scientists retain academic freedom under
the contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gruissem who was the main organizer of Monday's
pro-biotech demonstration, united his colleagues behind the name
Coalition of Concerned Scientists. He acknowledged that their
connection to Novartis might weaken their appearance of
independence, but they said they had come of their own accord out
of their concern that the public was not being informed about the
benefits of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are public sector scientists no matter where the funding
comes from, and we are free to say whatever we want,'' said
Gruissem, who said he has not been in a street protest since his
college days 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists said they fear that a backlash against
agricultural biotechnology could endanger research funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just sit in our offices and watch the debate, we're just
going to suffer,'' said John Taylor, another professor in the
department. He said the Novartis agreement has ``sensitized'' him
and his colleagues to the controversy surrounding biotechnology
foods. ``We get the e-mails about how bad you are,'' he said. ``So
we realize we had to be out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, biotechnology protesters trashed experimental plant
test plots at Berkeley, even though most of the research did not
involve genetic engineering. Nicholas Kaplinsky, a graduate student
at Monday's rally, said he lost a year's worth of research.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Margulis of Greenpeace said it was the largest protest
in this country against bio-engineered food, not counting the ones
at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, which involved
many other issues in addition to biotech. Organizers said the size
of the rally belied the notion that the American public trusted the
FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a kind of belief that the public doesn't care,''
said Chris Desser, coordinator of the Funders' Working Group on
Biotechnology, which represents some foundations concerned about
the issue. ``But an ignorant public is not the same as an apathetic
public. We have found the American public is not apathetic on this.
As they become educated they respond with great concern.''

&HT;        SPECTER HEARS MEDICAL WOES

<P>
   WASHINGTON - One had suffered a stroke. Another is facing
possible paralysis. And yet another lost her father. All three told
a senate subcommittee Monday, present mechanisms for protecting
patients don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), chairman of the Senate's,
appropriations subcommittee on health convened the hearing in
response to an Institute of Medicine report that said as many as
98,000 patients die because of medical mistakes. Representatives
from the medical industry joined the women in testifying joined the
women in testifying to whether the federal government should get
involved in ensuring quality hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine released Tuesday a report, entitled
``To Err is Human, Building a Safer Health System.'' In that
report, the authors called upon Congress to create a patient safety
center and to institute mandatory reporting of medical mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, in their report, argued that only through mandatory
reporting of medical mistakes could the present medical system
improve patient safety. They said without knowing what the
persistent problems are, it would be difficult to come up with
corrective strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey of the American Medical Association said that
while she too would like to see changes in the medical system, she
did not believe a federal government mandate was the right way. She
said she feared that without a guarantee of patient-doctor
confidentiality when repporting mistakes, doctors would shy away
from talking to a federal entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment we would not support a federal mandate,'' Dr.
Dickey said. ``It wold not improve the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would respectfully disagree,'' Specter said. ``I believe
there is a need for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he based his opinion on the fact that the three
women who came to the hearing were examples of how the medical
system had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Artemis, Falls Church, Va., testified that what should
have been a one-time only, $12,000 dollar operation to replace her
hip was a tragic ``comedy of errors.'' In the end Artemis'
insurance company paid $200,000 for the five operations she
endured.
</P>
<P>
   Artemis said when her hip is replaced again, she will have a
50-50 chance of losing the use of her leg. She said she attained
information that her surgeon had been accused of making similar
mistakes before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see changes in the system that will prevent
this so that we don't have to get to the reporting stage,'' Artemis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Dr. Stanton Smullens, representing the American
Hospital Association, agreed that more should be done in ensuring
patient safety. Smullens, who is also the chief medical officer for
Jefferson Health System, stopped short of saying he supported
legislation that would provide for federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Smullens, however, did say making reporting of mistakes
mandatory and protecting patient confidentiality was not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be an optimist about health care,'' Dr. Smullens
said. ``The fact that we are here talking about it and analyzing it
will help.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After tearfully pleading for mercy and apologizing to
his victim, Justin Volpe was sentenced Monday to 30 years in prison
for brutalizing Abner Louima in a Brooklyn police station. The
judge denounced the former police officer for an ``unusually
heinous'' crime that had harmed not only Louima but the Police
Department and society at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of intentional murder, one cannot imagine a more
barbarous misuse of power than Volpe's,'' Judge Eugene Nickerson
said in a packed courtroom in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, as
he sentenced Volpe for a notorious act that drew national attention
and fueled angry charges of police brutality against blacks in New
York City. Louima is black, and Volpe is white.
</P>
<P>
   The former officer's punishment was less than the sentence of
life in prison without parole that the judge could have imposed.
Volpe, 27, could be released after 25 years if he behaves well in
prison, and with credit for the six months he served since
interrupting his trial last May to plead guilty to violating
Louima's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe was also ordered to pay $277,495 in restitution to Louima,
although Nickerson acknowledged that he would not be able to do so.
Without explaining how he had arrived at the figure, Nickerson
directed Volpe to pay Louima $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe admitted that he had violently shoved a broken broomstick
into Louima's rectum in a police station bathroom, inflicting
severe internal injuries on the 32-year-old Haitian immigrant,
because he mistakenly believed that Louima had punched him hard in
the head during a street brawl, knocking him down and causing him
to fear for his life. It turned out that another man had punched
Volpe. ``However frightened and angry he was, Volpe's response was
wildly out of proportion,'' Nickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Louima described the terror he felt and the
injuries he suffered on the floor of the police station bathroom
where he was assaulted in August 1997. He told the judge of the
psychological pain he later endured because Volpe and his lawyer
suggested that the injuries had come from a homosexual encounter
before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big lie,'' Louima said, ``has caused me and my family
incredible pain and emotional suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, looking pale and somewhat thinner than his hefty,
muscular figure before he was jailed, and wearing jail clothes that
included trousers that had to be rolled up at the ankles because
they were much too long, told Nickerson, ``I was and still am
ashamed and deeply regretful for what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I betrayed Abner Louima's rights, I betrayed the
city's confidence in police officers, I betrayed myself and my
partner and I betrayed my lawyer.'' The last was a reference to his
not having told his lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, that he was guilty
until the evidence had become overwhelming at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently choking up as he stood before the bench, Volpe, who
had been on the force four years when he brutalized Louima and was
dismissed immediately after his conviction, said he had ``come to
realize that this case goes beyond me and Abner Louima.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima showed no emotion as he sat listening in the gallery.

COHEN ORDERS NEW SURVEY TO DETERMINE TREATMENT OF GAYS IN
MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen on Monday ordered
spot checks of major military bases around the country to determine
whether gay service members are being harassed and told the
Pentagon inspector general to report back within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore on Monday night called for the outright
elimination of the administration's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy for gays in the military, saying they should be allowed to
serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve their country
without discrimination,'' Gore said in a statement on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has long argued within the administration for
allowing gays to serve openly, he has not been so forceful publicly
until Monday night. His declaration follows an admission by
President Clinton over the weekend that the current policy toward
gays in the military was ``out of whack,'' but Clinton did not go
so far as to call for the policy to be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks in turn followed comments by his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, that
gays should be allowed to serve openly. Former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, Gore's lone rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, called several weeks ago for gays to be allowed to
serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton complained that the murder of a gay soldier in July
after cruel and persistent harassment showed that the military's
policy for gays was not working. In response to that death, for
which an Army private was convicted of murder last week, Defense
officials hastily put together plans on Monday for a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   The policy prohibits the military from asking about a soldier's
sex life unless there is clear evidence of homosexual conduct, and
it forbids harassing gay and lesbian service members. But the
policy also requires soldiers to leave the service if they
volunteer that they are homosexual or if there is evidence of
homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary shares the president's determination to make
sure that this policy is executed as fairly as possible,'' said
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pvt. Calvin Glover was found guilty of blugeoning to
death Pfc. Barry Winchell, the gay soldier, in their barracks at
Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the court-martial, soldiers related
how the gay soldier had been taunted for months with anti-gay slurs
without reprimand by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pentagon survey will be conducted by teams under Donald
Mancuso, the acting inspector general, who said in an interview on
Monday that he was told of the new assessment only 30 minutes
before it was announced to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen asked Mancuso to find out what problems exist in
implementing the policy that forbids harassing gay and lesbian
service members but also requires them to leave the service if they
are found to be homosexual. The inspector general said on Monday
that he was given ``full latitude'' to conduct the survey, prepare
the questions and figure out which bases to visit.
</P>
<P>
   For gay and lesbian rights groups the Pentagon announcement was
a disappointment. ``What needs to be done is training to prevent
anti-gay harassment at all levels,'' said Dickson Osborne,
co-executive director of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network.
</P>
<P>
   While saying the survey is a step forward, Osoborne said it
could not succeed because Defense officials failed to promise
confidentiality to service members who come forward to report
harassment to the visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is can gay people participate in this survey
without getting fired from their jobs, '' he said. ``How do you
trust anyone, especially at a base where an anti-gay murder took
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that the investigators would
pursue those accused of harassment, not the service members who
report that they have been taunted. Under the `don't ask' portion
of the policy, a superior is forbidden to question a service member
about his sexual preference or investigate his private activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be easy to tell from talking to people whether
anti-gay statements or harassment is a regular part of the life of
the post, irrespective of whether the people who are doing the
reporting may happen to be gay or not,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's aim, he continued, is to ``look at the climate _ if
there was a harassing climate and whether this is condoned by the
command.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the policy was first enacted in 1993, the Pentagon
has yet to institute formal training programs on the policy for all
branches of the services. Following Winchell's murder, Cohen
reissued the guidelines for 'don't ask, don't tell' in August and
asked all the services to submit proposals for training programs,
which they have done. Now that the president asked for a
reassessment of how the policy is followed, the Pentagon will act
quickly on those training proposals.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's personnel boss, Vice Adm. Daniel T. Oliver, did issue
a Navy-wide memorandum on Oct. 28, sternly reminding commanding
officers that they ``must not condone homosexual jokes, epithets or
derogatory comments, and must ensure a command climate that fosters
respect for all individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum continued: ``Service members should be able to
report crimes and harassment free from fear of harm, reprisal or
inappropriate or inadequate governmental response.''
</P>
<P>
   It then described in detail what the policy does and does not
permit.
</P>
<P>
   When the secretary reissued the policy guidelines in August, the
message drew respect and derision from officers and enlisted
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, screwing up any homosexual case provides an
excellent opportunity to appear on `60 Minutes,' wrote Col. James
C. Walker, the staff judge advocate for the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif. in an e-mail message
sent to commanders outlining Cohen's guidelines. ``My job is to
deny you that opportunity. Call me on all these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another e-mail message circulating at the Marine base at
Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., one officer wrote to several others:
``Due to the 'hate crime' death of a homo in the Army we now have
to take extra steps to ensure the safety of the queer who has
'told' (not kept his part of the D.O.D. ''don't ask, don't tell''
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gets political credit for being first to call for the
policy's elimination, the fact that some of the nation's most
prominent Democrats want it scrapped suggests a major battle ahead
in Congress. Republicans do not support the policy either, but they
generally do not want gays in the military at all.
</P>
<P>
   The process that is leading to the re-examination of the gays in
the military is similar to that which drove Clinton to shift his
position on another sensitive military issue, whether to reopen a
firing range in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Mrs. Clinton, apparently with her eye on New York
politics and the sizeable Puerto Rican community there, sided with
the governor of Puerto Rico and said the base should be permanently
closed. Shortly thereafter, Gore adopted the same position. Last
month, the president rejected the alternative recommendations of
the Navy and ordered the end of military exercises with live fire
on the base at Vieques.

CALM IN KHARTOUM AFTER SUDAN'S PRESIDENT DISSOLVES LEGISLATURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speaker of Sudan's National Assembly on Monday accused the
country's president, Omar Hassan el-Bashir, of launching a coup
d'etat after el-Bashir dissolved the legislature and imposed a
state of emergency for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament speaker, Hassan Turabi, the most powerful
political adversary of the president, accused el-Bashir of
violating the Sudanese Constitution and betraying the ruling
National Congress Party, which controls nearly all of the
legislature's 360 seats and is in turn dominated by Turabi's power
base, the National Islamic Front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take the case to the grass roots of the National
Congress and decide what to do,'' Turabi said, according to
Reuters. ``If these political matters fail, popular forces will
have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But el-Bashir, speaking at a news conference, justified his
pre-emptive political strike as ``a disciplinary measure taken to
restore law and discipline'' in Africa's largest country.
El-Bashir, who donned a military fatigue uniform for the occasion,
promised no drastic steps ``unless there is a violation of the law
or of the state of emergency,'' which was announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Sudanese soldiers cordoned off the legislative building
and set up checkpoints around the capital Khartoum, which was
otherwise reported quiet because of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month
of fasting.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman in Washington, said at
the daily briefing that the significance of el-Bashir's measures
was ``really difficult to assess, at least from this distance.``
</P>
<P>
   But Foley added, ``It's important to note that Bashir and Turabi
have engaged in regular power struggles since the regime seized
power in 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when el-Bashir, then an army general, ousted the
country's ruler, Sadeq al-Mahdi, in a military coup supported by
Turabi. El-Bashir set up an Islamic state and banned political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   As rivalry intensified between the two men, Turabi used the
National Assembly to expand his authority and influence.
El-Bashir's dissolution of the legislature in effect tried to
deprive Turabi of his power base.
</P>
<P>
   Clovis Maksud, the Arab League's former ambassador in
Washington, said that by dissolving the National Assembly,
el-Bashir was buying time for three months as well as seeking to
puncture the power that Turabi had amassed as speaker of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically, it might weaken Bashir,'' said Maksud, who now
directs the Center for the Global South at American University in
Washington. ``By establishing his power, he might be losing his
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Bashir has shown concern about the erosion of his own
presidential powers. The legislature on Tuesday was expected to
pass legislation allowing the direct election of Sudan's provincial
governors, in which the president now has a key voice.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, el-Bashir complained that some
provincial governors considered themselves above the government's
control. ``If all governors do that, then we are powerless,''
el-Bashir was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has been weakened by a 16-year-civil war between the
country's Arab majority and the insurgents in the south who
represent the black, largely Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government has also been increasingly isolated
following Western charges that it has supported terrorism. Last
month, the U.S. Congress passed a law to give food assistance to
the Sudanese insurgents. President Clinton has not yet decided
whether to implement the law, which international aid agencies say
would put their own operations at risk.

   JERUSALEM _ After six hours of impassioned and often raucous
debate _ and just two days before talks begin in Washington _
Israel's Parliament on Monday narrowly endorsed Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's quest for a comprehensive peace settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to pay ``a heavy territorial price,'' Barak
acknowledged in an emotional plea for parliamentary support. But
failure to pursue peace with Damascus ``could cost us in blood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of confidence in the prime minister's negotiating plans
passed with 47 votes in favor, 37 against, and 24 abstentions _ a
victory, but far from the strong majority Barak expected. Three
parties in Barak's governing coalition pointedly refused to back
him on Monday night, pointing to potential trouble when a promised
national referendum is held on any final peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is to meet with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria
in Washington Wednesday and Thursday for the highest-level direct
discussions ever held between Syria and Israel. President Clinton
is expected to host the opening and closing sessions of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's appearance in Parliament on Monday was
widely considered his most important appearance since he took the
oath of office there five months ago. Calling this week's
negotiations ``an opportunity that cannot be squandered,'' he
argued that for the first time in its history, Israel has a chance
for a lasting peace with all of its immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Israel's perspective, real peace with Syria and the
Palestinians, if it can be achieved, is the pinnacle of the Zionist
vision,'' he said, ignoring opposition hecklers. ``It is a
revolution. It is a new era in Israel's relations with the Arab
world, and the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak implicitly conceded that the Golan Heights would be handed
back to Syria in a peace accord, as thousands of residents from the
northern border zone demonstrated angrily outside the Parliament.
The precise boundaries of withdrawal ``will be determined in
negotiations in accordance with the depth of peace and the quality
of security arrangements,'' he said, echoing the formula used by
the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Barak's mentor, in the last
attempt at a settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud bloc, followed
Barak to the podium. He predicted that any accord featuring a Golan
withdrawal would go down to defeat in a referendum. He tauntingly
read another statement by Rabin, this one from 1992, that ``it is
inconceivable that even in peace we would descend from the Golan
Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon charged that the government acquiesced to President Hafez
Assad's desire for ``American aid and modern American weapons'' and
President Clinton's hunger ``for a stunning achievement at any cost
before the end of his term in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had praised Clinton in his remarks for his ``personal
involvement and devotion to the cause of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned national vote on the Syrian peace accord would be
the first referendum in Israel's history. Lawmakers have yet to
determine how the balloting would be organized, or who will draft
the question that will be put to voters. Israel's attorney-general
rejected an opposition proposal that Arab citizens _ a sixth of the
electorate _ be excluded from the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The vote following Monday night's debate _ a simple yea or nay
response to the peace initiative outlined by the prime minister on
Monday night _ provided the first real test of Barak's coalition
strategy. For Barak's Labor allies, the results appeared worrisome.
He assembled a multiparty government to provide the broadest
possible majority for peace with Syria and the Palestinians, but on
Monday night he was left with an uncomfortably slim plurality.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest faction in Barak's ruling coalition _ the
Sephardic-dominated Shas party _ unexpectedly abstained from the
vote and openly criticized his ``unclear'' negotiating strategy.
Most members of two smaller conservative parties in the government
_ the National Religious Party, backed by settlers in the West
Bank, and Yisrael B'aliya, representing Russian immigrants _ voted
against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all three coalition factions then joined Sharon and
other opposition figures outside Parliament in a rally with
protesters from the Golan Heights. ``We feel that the Golan is our
home, and you cannot throw people out of their homes,'' Guy Neuman,
a demonstrator from Qatrin, the largest Golan town, told an Israeli
television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, anticipating opposition attacks, portrayed himself as a
patriot and career military man who had devoted his life to
Israel's defense. He reminded his audience that he had fought
against the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the 1967 war. ``I
am fully familiar with every valley and every rock in the Golan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied to the Parliament by Nadia Cohen, the widow
of Eli Cohen, an Israeli agent who has executed by Syria in 1965
for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen, who is seeking the return from Damascus of her
husband's interred remains, publicly endorsed Barak's peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary interest is Israel's security,'' Barak said. ``The
agreement that we aspire to reach with our Syrian neighbors is one
that will also put an end to our conflict with Lebanon, and will
include diverse and effective systems to preserve security and
peace between our countries at all times. Such an agreement is not
beyond reach.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a meeting earlier on Monday, he told Cabinet colleagues that
while Israel had made no new commitments to Syria before this
week's talks, it ``would not erase'' any promises made in previous
negotiations during the administrations of Rabin and former Prime
Ministers Shimon Peres, and Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians and Israelis have profoundly different recollections of
those past pledges, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians have said the Rabin government was prepared to
withdraw to Israel's 1967 borders _ that is, to the eastern
shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. Israeli negotiators deny making
such a promise. And former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims
to have extracted Syrian permission for a permanent Israeli
presence atop Mount Heron, the Golan's high point _ an assertion
dismissed by diplomats in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations with Syria will be difficult and paved with
crises,'' Barak told his Cabinet ministers, according to state
radio reports. ``I have no illusions about the nature of the Middle
East, and I have no doubt that only the overall strength of Israel
will ensure that agreements are honored.``

GM'S OPEL UNIT SAYS IT WILL LIKELY PAY NAZI SLAVE LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The German subsidiary of General Motors
said Monday that it would probably contribute to a fund to
compensate forced laborers in the Nazi era, a move that could make
GM the first American company to accept responsibility for those
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary, Opel, made the statement as lawyers for the
former workers appeared close to a final multibillion-dollar accord
with the German government and industry. An accord would safeguard
the companies from legal claims.
</P>
<P>
   GM bought the German car maker, Adam Opel, more than 60 years
ago. General Motors' long-held view has been that because the
German government took command of Opel factories in the war,
compensation was its responsibility. Opel employed at least 2,000
forced laborers in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Big German companies, which also clung to that view, decided
more than a year ago that they would be wiser to negotiate a
friendly settlement than endure a nightmarish court battle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, the general counsel of GM, Thomas Gottschalk, said
tonight that the company was ``open and seriously willing to
consider participation in the fund,'' but that it was awaiting the
final outcome of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, the German government and industry are negotiating a
fund of 10 billion marks, or $5.3 billion, participants in the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan that has been floated by Stuart Eizenstat, the
American deputy treasury secretary who is trying to mediate a pact,
GM and up to 200 other American companies with German subsidiaries
would create a separate fund with 1 billion marks, roughly $500
million. German government and industry officials remain adamantly
opposed to a separate American fund, arguing that all companies
that used forced labor should pay into the same effort. It is not
clear how this issue will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the negotiations say an overall
agreement could come together in a few days. German officials have
publicly refused to increase their latest offer, a total of 8
billion marks, about $4.1 billion, with 5 billion from industry and
3 billion from the government.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the negotiations say they are becoming
resigned to paying 10 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a kind of consensus around the 10 billion
number,'' said one person involved in the talks, which involve
American class-action lawyers, Jewish organizations, Washington and
German industry and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know within the next 24 hours if it works,'' said Burt
Neuborne, one of the lead attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, executives at Adam Opel said they are speaking up now
because negotiations are at a crucial stage. ``Now is the moment
when it will be determined whether the negotiations are a success
or not,'' said Bruno Seifert, a spokesman for GM's Opel subsidiary
in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor, which was one of the first companies to be named in
a class-action suit over Nazi-era forced labor, said it is still
considering whether to take part in a fund.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many other American companies have German
subsidiaries that used forced laborers. But people close to the
talks say they have put together a list of nearly 200 companies,
which they are trying to coax into joining the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The American class-action lawyers remain in heated disagreement
with German officials about how that the compensation should be
handled.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for the German industry
foundation, has insisted that all companies contribute to the same
fund. As things stand right now, he said, the foundation still
hasn't collected enough commitments from German corporations to
produce the 5 billion marks that business is supposed to
contribute, and the foundation is worried that the number of
companies taking part would diminish if some put their
contributions into other funds. The German government, which has
agreed to the contribution of 3 billion marks. Negotiators are
hoping that additional German companies will join the fund when an
agreement is finally reached, adding to the total compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if there is a separate American fund, then that would lead
to a separate French fund and a separate British fund _ and there
would be nothing left for the German fund,'' said Gibowski.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Ford and General Motors have long admitted that
their German factories used forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for former forced laborers, most of whom were
brought to Germany against their will from central European
countries, say that American companies had complicated relations
with their subsidiaries around the war years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people in charge of the Ford plant during the war
that were promoted to the top levels of Ford in Europe after the
war,'' said Lothar Evers, director of the Nazi Victims' Support
Center, an association in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Ford even asked Washington for compensation for a factory that
Allied forces bombed during the war, Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can claim damages for buildings that were destroyed by
bombs, it is only fair that people whose lives were destroyed
should be able to seek claims,'' Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated exhortations from the German government, only
about 60 German companies have offered to contribute to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the American Jewish Committee published a list of 257
active German companies that appear to have used forced labor and
have not yet agreed to pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Many are small and medium-sized companies, but they also include
Philipp Holzmann AG, a huge construction company that was recently
rescued from bankruptcy by the German government and big big banks.
</P>
<P>
   The battles among groups representing former forced laborers
have been almost as intense as the bargaining with German leaders.
The players include the World Jewish Congress and the Israeli
government as well as a fractious alliance of class-action
attorneys who represent mostly non-Jewish workers in central and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The lead class-action attorneys include Neuborne, a professor of
law at New York University; Melvyn Weiss, who battled Swiss banks
over assets owned by Holocaust victims and who represented several
states against the tobacco industry; Michael Hausfeld, a securities
lawyer who led a landmark battle against Texaco over racial
discrimination; and Edward Fagan, who has sued the Swiss banks,
scores of German companies and, most recently, Japanese companies
for wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers stand to make tens of millions if not hundreds of
millions of dollars from a settlement, a fact that has generated
animosities among some Jewish groups, and the lawyers have battled
each other in recent days over how hard to bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government, which has been monitoring the talks, has
become increasingly concerned that the attorneys were holding out
for too much money at the expense of aging Holocaust survivors who
are rapidly dying of old age, one lawyer involved in the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 240,000 slave laborers, most of whom were
concentration camp prisoners forced to work in factories, are still
alive today. About half of those people are Jewish. In addition, as
many as two million other people were coerced into various degrees
of forced labor. Most came from Central European countries and
Russia and were not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Under plans being discussed, a new German foundation would make
money available to victims primarily through bilateral groups that
already exist in most central European nations to pursue claims
against the German government.

MCCAIN TO RISK ALL ON SOUTH CAROLINA, AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Senator John McCain, convinced he must win
the South Carolina primary to become the Republican presidential
nominee, has decided on a high-risk strategy under which he will
campaign in this state for nearly 18 straight days after the New
Hampshire contest and probably quit if he loses in South Carolina,
according to his senior aides.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy in South Carolina, the second state he will
actively contest, highlights the bold gamble of the McCain
campaign. He is running major organizations in only three states,
his home turf of Arizona, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, while
national front-runner George W. Bush is running in most states and
has raised four times as much money.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike in New Hampshire, where McCain leads in some polls,
Bush is ahead of the Arizona senator in South Carolina by a 62
percent-to-15 percent margin, according to a mid-November poll. As
a result, McCain is diverting a huge amount of his resources to
South Carolina, making this the only state besides New Hampshire
where the senator is running television ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the battle of the century in this primary,'' said
state Republican Party chairman Henry McMaster, invoking the sort
of hyperbole usually reserved for New Hampshire. Bush, he said,
``has done everything right,'' but McCain's tie to the veteran
community is ``huge.'' McCain, who is running as a self-style
maverick who often is at odds with his party, also is hoping to
benefit from a state law that allows Democrats, as well as
Independents, to participate in the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   Several other candidates are having an impact among the state's
many religious conservatives, which could further hurt Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about Iowa and New Hampshire, both the Bush and
McCain campaigns said this is where the Republican nomination may
be determined.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is doing little campaigning in Iowa, although he
participated in a debate there Monday night, and he plans to do
little or no campaigning for the Feb. 8 Delaware primary, which is
the only GOP contest to be held in the 18 days between the Feb. 1
vote in New Hampshire and Feb. 19 contest in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain long has made clear he will campaign hard in South
Carolina, the all-or-nothing strategy being pursued is not widely
known. The plan assumes that McCain will win New Hampshire and
calls on him to spend much more time in South Carolina. Tuesday,
for example, McCain is slated to unveil his long-awaited
health-care plan in Charleston, perhaps his most visible event in
the state so far.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina ``is the trigger mechanism that catapults this
campaign to the nomination,'' said McCain national field director
Trey Walker, who, not coincidentally, is the former executive
director of the state's Republican Party. Asked whether that means
that McCain has to win in South Carolina, Walker replied, ``Yes.''
McCain himself has said, ``We have to win South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign state cochairman, Lieutenant Governor Bob
Peeler, puts the stakes equally high. If Bush falters in the
first-caucus state of Iowa, if he faces catastrophe in the first
primary state of New Hampshire, South Carolina will put the Texas
governor on a sure, Southern-oriented path to victory, Peeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the Republican nomination, you need to win South
Carolina,'' Peeler said. ``Governor Bush is doing very well, but he
doesn't take anything for granted. The race will tighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for McCain's optimism is that many of the factors
that have helped him in New Hampshire are even more in evidence in
South Carolina. The state has the nation's highest per-capita
number of veterans, a huge plus for McCain, a former Vietnam
prisoner of war. Some 450,000 out of 3 million residents are
veterans, and it is rare to find a family without ties to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the McCain campaign began airing radio ads that seek
both to dramatize his war-hero status and present the senator as a
religious man, which is especially important in this state, where
the Christian Coalition has been a significant force in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, McCain's former fellow prisoner Bud Day says: The
``Christmas service of 1971 was centered around scripture that John
had gotten from the first Bible we had been able to get from the
Vietnamese, and it was wonderful to have the written word of God.
John composed an extremely compelling sermon that night about the
importance of Christmas . . . I think it was certainly a shot to
everyone's morale to hear those Christian words in that very
unChristian-like place.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in a quirk that has received little notice, South
Carolina allows both Independents and Democrats to vote in the
Republican primary. The state's Democratic vote is being held later
and is expected to be relatively meaningless, which greatly
increases the likelihood that many Democrats will take advantage of
the law that allows them to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario could hardly be better for McCain, who tends, in
polls, to be viewed positively by many Democrats and Independents.
``It is critical,'' Walker said, referring to South Carolina rules
that allow any voter to participate in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win in New Hampshire and a win in South Carolina starts the
media and the `snowball' effect,'' Walker said. That is why McCain
will spend nearly 18 straight days in South Carolina, although he
may make some brief fund-raising excursions out of state during
that time.
</P>
<P>
   But if McCain's plan is to succeed, the snowball must be
practically unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of South Carolina's vote, the Republican contest
moves around the country rapidly, to states such as Michigan, New
York, and California, where Bush already is organized and McCain is
just beginning to establish a presence. As many as 18 contests are
expected to be held in the 17 days after South Carolina's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said that even if McCain
does win in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he does not think the
senator would have enough time to catch up in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you can rely upon momentum to shift public
opinion rapidly just is not borne out,'' Rove told reporters at a
Washington breakfast last week. While Rove acknowledged ``there's
going to be a rough patch or two in the road,'' he added, ``We have
built a campaign that is able to endure and win and compete
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four candidates in the GOP race also are paying
attention to South Carolina, but not with nearly as much effort as
Bush and McCain. Forbes, who got 13 percent of the vote in this
state in 1996, plans to campaign in South Carolina, but is focusing
more heavily on the Feb. 22 contest in Michigan. Former Reagan aide
Gary Bauer and talk show host Alan Keyes are hoping to tap into the
South Carolina's religious conservative vote, while Senator Orrin
Hatch of Utah is relatively unknown in this state.

PATRICK McGEEHAN and was written by Kahn.)  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even by the inflated standards of high finance, Wall
Street is overflowing with holiday cheer this year. Investment
banks have set aside $13 billion to pay bonuses, 20 percent more
than last year, with pay packages above $10 million no longer a
rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among Wall Streeters whose incomes once astounded Middle
America, the mood has changed. One industry veteran bemoaned the
``opportunity cost'' of remaining a financier in the Internet Age.
Others are leaving to join online start-ups, technology companies
and venture capital firms, the pillars of the new economy, where
they sometimes take home more than their old bosses from Day 1 _
and, they say, have more fun.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Wall Street became the surest
professional path to riches during the frenzied 1980s, those with
the biggest paydays are former investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Timothy Weller. He is the talk of the Street, but mostly
because he no longer works there. Last summer, Weller, 34, left
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, where he was a middle-ranking analyst
tracking the telecommunications business, to join Akamai
Technologies, which provides networking services for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, based in Cambridge, Mass., enticed him to sign on as
chief financial officer by selling him 1.05 million shares, valued
then at $2.63 million, and even lent him the money to buy them.
Gratification was quick: When Akamai went public in October, its
stock soared from $26 to $230. Weller's stake is now worth $240
million.
</P>
<P>
   Few bankers will reap such gains, but many are still taking
their chances on the Internet. One-time masters of the universe say
banking has become prosaic, with the heavy demands no longer
producing unrivaled rewards. Bankers now ogle online entrepreneurs
the way lawyers and accountants once envied Wall Streeters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that investment bankers were at the cutting
edge,'' said Mark Long, who as a banker for Credit Suisse First
Boston helped some of America's hottest Internet companies go
public. ``Today, bankers are just hired guns.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trip last summer to promote the Internet start-up
Intraware to potential investors, Long, 32, accepted his client's
offer to become a vice president, joining shortly before it went
public.
</P>
<P>
   If Intraware does well, Long stands to earn considerably more
than he did as a banker, thanks to stock options. But that is only
one reason he left. ``You get tired of sleeping 45 minutes a
night,'' he said, ``to sell someone else's business.''
</P>
<P>
   With profits for financial firms and bonuses for bankers at
all-time highs, there is certainly no looming crisis on Wall
Street. Even those who leave banking often do so with trepidation,
fearing that inflated Internet stocks could come crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is more a blow to the psyche. The pressure to earn
Internet windfalls shows up in little ways, as with the rising
stock analyst who says he has lost repeated bidding wars for Upper
East Side apartments and adds, only half in jest, that $10 million
does not buy much of a condo these days.
</P>
<P>
   The online lure is also enhanced by ex-bankers who have changed
careers seamlessly. Jeff Bezos worked on Wall Street until he
founded Amazon.com, and that trend keeps gathering steam. Bezos,
now many times a billionaire, hired a number of other former
bankers and made them Internet retailers. Analysts and deal makers
involved in technology, telecommunications and the Internet readily
change hats and become financial officers or strategic planners at
start-ups, often bringing along former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some defectors compete directly with their old firms. At least
three new online investment banks and several Internet
stock-and-bond trading companies, all planning to use the Internet
to steal business from traditional investment banks, are led by
people who learned the business from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lessin, chief executive of Wit Capital, an online
investment bank, and formerly a top officer at Salomon Smith
Barney, has poached a long list of bankers from Salomon, Merrill
Lynch and other firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm a banker but I get to wear casual clothes,''
said Kate Cornish, 28, who left Salomon for Wit a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Especially susceptible are those who are three to five years out
of business school _ on the cusp of devoting a career to a firm,
but young enough to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `I want to be a multimillionaire by the time I'm 30,
but if I stay at Morgan Stanley, it may take me until I'm 50,'''
said Joseph Perella, Morgan's head of investment banking.
Americans, he added, want ``instant gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction, Morgan Stanley has started offering stock to some
newly hired bankers. BancBoston Robertson Stephens, a leading
technology banking firm, has lost 10 bankers to Internet clients
this year. The firm recently took 300 employees to a weekend
retreat to help build esprit de corps and to aid retention, though
firm officials said it was not a response to this year's attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bank recruiters once acted like bouncers, accepting
only the best. Goldman Sachs still finds plenty of eager
applicants, says Peter Kiernan, a senior partner who oversees
hiring from business schools, but now, he said, ``if you expect to
back up a truck and load the top 10 people in a class, you're going
to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Business school graduates think entrepreneurial jobs are the
wave of the future, Kiernan said. He now tries to persuade people
that they can be entrepreneurs within an investment bank, which can
be a tough sell. ``One thing you don't do is try to sell against
the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Wall Street did not have to try so hard. With the
rapid growth of stocks and bonds and the explosion of mergers,
securities firms were seen as controlling the levers of America's
economy. Investment banking, offering top dollar, consistently
ranked as the No. 1 or No. 2 career choice for top business
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture followed the money. ``Wall Street,'' the movie,
and ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' the novel, created a stereotype of
sharklike bankers and traders whose only obstacle was their own
greed. In the early 1990s, investment banks were seen as the
engines of globalization, financing road projects in China and
privatizing phone companies in Brazil. While corporate America
merged and consolidated, bankers raked in record fees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet, like an electronic black hole, has stolen all
the gravity. Securities firms seem to have less to do with creating
Internet companies than they did with arranging restructurings or
sending capital abroad. And through the Silicon Valley
looking-glass, Wall Street egos can appear almost humble.

</P>
<P>
   Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, wrote an
Op-Ed article in The New York Times last summer extolling the value
that entrepreneurs create in the economy and belittling the
``nonjobs'' of bankers. In ``The New New Thing,'' Michael Lewis,
who a decade ago chronicled Wall Street hubris in ``Liar's Poker,''
portrays today's financiers as desperate grovelers who shovel money
at Internet entrepreneurs in hopes of profiting from their creative
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem no different. They have pumped up the stocks of
Internet-friendly finance companies so much that a recent survey of
the wealthiest people in finance, compiled by Institutional
Investor magazine, found that the richest financiers often double
as Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the founder, chairman and chief executive of the
No. 1-ranked Internet broker, has seen his Schwab stock holdings
soar to almost $5.8 billion, making him the second-wealthiest
person in finance after Warren Buffett. J. Joe Ricketts, chairman
and co-chief executive of Ameritrade, the No. 7 Internet broker,
has stock holdings of almost $2 billion, eclipsing the combined
stock holdings of the leaders of Morgan Stanley, Merrill and
Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, headhunters rarely tried to lure bankers away
from Wall Street. But dot-com fever has changed that. When
Priceline.com decided in June to go after an investment banker to
fill a senior post at a unit it expected to take public shortly, it
asked Cynthia Remec, an executive recruiter, to round up candidates
the same day and set up interviews the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Remec frantically phoned 20 bankers to fill this tall order.
Within hours, to her surprise, she found 15 who were eager to hop
the train to Stamford, Conn., Priceline's headquarters, for an
interview. Priceline hired one of them, Anne Maffei, a former
banker at J.P. Morgan, as a senior executive at Webhouse.com, its
grocery-shopping affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and analysts on the front lines of the new economy
sometimes make especially easy pickings. Though the work hours of
Internet entrepreneurs are legendary, many bankers say the life
compares favorably with the burden of arranging a huge volume of
public offerings and mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like lead oar in `Ben Hur,''' said Bill Burnham, a
top analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston who left to join
Softbank Capital, an Internet-focused venture fund. ``No one works
harder than a tech banker or has less control over his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of stock options is also potent. Thomas Casey, 47, left
as co-head of global telecommunications and media at Merrill Lynch
to head corporate development, among other things, at Global
Crossing, a new telecom company that is building a fiber optic
network for Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the move was a roll of the dice. He left behind a
hefty pay package _ $3 million to $5 million a year at his level.
When he started at Global Crossing, he took a huge pay cut. But he
got options on 2 million shares when the stock was valued at $2 a
share. Those options are now valued at nearly $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Wall Street, you are not going to be so rich that your
children and grandchildren would never have to work again,'' Casey
said. ``But you have that opportunity if you go to a start-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said money was only one motivation. ``Ultimately, I wanted
to be in a position where I participated directly in creating
something substantial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some Wall Street firms are responding aggressively.
Nearly all the big ones have taken stakes in online trading
companies, including an array of virtual stock-trading forums known
as electronic communications networks. Most now allow clients to
buy and sell securities on the Internet. Several analysts predict
that Wall Street's willingness to compete online will slow the
growth of purely online rivals _ and perhaps stem the outflow of
seasoned bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But John Hewitt, a longtime Goldman vice president who helped
execute that firm's efforts to modernize its technology, still sees
the biggest securities firms as being stuck in another era. He
recently left Goldman to become president of Knight/Trimark, which
has used technology and low fees to lure stock-trading business.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, 48, said he long expected to retire as a Goldman
employee. But the more he learned about the Internet, he said, the
more it gnawed at him _ to the point that he raised his hand for
the Knight/Trimark job during a business dinner with Ken Pasternak,
the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Wall Street firms, Goldman included, have become so
successful that they have a vested interest in the status quo,''
Hewitt said. ``The more I thought about it, the more I felt I had
to go somewhere that had a sense of speed and that wasn't afraid of
the future.''

WHEN A CHILD TRAVELS ALONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how self-assured children seem, when they are
traveling alone there is always a moment when the plane begins to
empty or the train pulls out that their vulnerability shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, children would not travel alone until they
were skilled, ready and pressing for the chance. But the world is
not perfect, and this holiday season tens of thousands of children
will be heading home from school, or from one parent to the other,
or from grandparents to parents, sometimes even from country to
country.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines, Amtrak and Greyhound have rules governing travel
by unaccompanied minors. Amtrak and Greyhound are more stringent,
forbidding unescorted travel by children under 8; the airlines'
minimum age is 5. Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines have
just raised to 15, from 12, the minimum age at which a child may
fly alone without being registered as an ``unaccompanied minor,''
avoiding payment of a fee for the airline to supervise children.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines that permit children to take a trip that involves a
connection put a priority on getting the child to the next flight,
but missed connections do occur. Each airline has a protocol, and
parents should get the details: will the child be kept at the
airport, or will a local agency be called in? The child should be
told what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules affect seasonal travel. Parents taking children to
Mexico or the Caribbean should know there are regulations involving
documentation. Ignored, these can thwart a trip entirely, as some
letters to the Travel section report.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at guidelines about children's travel.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak carries few unescorted children _ 5,100 in the 12 months
ending June 30, 1998. It accepts children 8 and older as unescorted
travelers under these restrictions:
</P>
<P>
   The trip must be scheduled for daylight hours. No transfers are
allowed, between trains or from a train to a bus. The station at
the start of the trip must be staffed at boarding, as must the
destination station at arrival. The person taking the child to the
depot must complete a document giving Amtrak permission to
transport the child. The agent must talk with the child to verify
an understanding about who is meeting him or her. And children
traveling alone pay the full adult fare. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound
</P>
<P>
   George Gravley, a spokesman for Greyhound, said that the line
did not handle many children traveling alone. Its rules are quite
close to Amtrak's:
</P>
<P>
   No unescorted children under 8 are accepted. They must not
change buses. The trip can be scheduled for no longer than five
hours _ about 250 miles _ and must end in daylight. The child may
board and debark only at regular Greyhound terminals or at
full-time agencies, which must be open at arrival. The child sits
in Row 1 or 2 and must receive the driver's approval to get off at
a rest stop. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association has no count of how many children
travel unescorted yearly. In one measure, Northwest Airlines said
it registered 120,000 children over 5 as unescorted minors on its
539,000 annual departures.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the industrywide total, when Northwest and TWA changed
rules in October, Northwest said a significant number of its
registered children were between 12 and 15. Their earlier rules,
like current ones at the other airlines, did not require
registration of children above 11, although parents could do it
voluntarily. Now, registration is optional for 15- to 17-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Northwest has permitted all unescorted minors to
take flights involving connections. The supervisory fee for a
domestic nonstop flight, one way, is $30, for a connection, $60.
International nonstop and connecting flights are permitted with
registration, although there is no fee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   TWA does not permit connections until the child is 8. It also
does not schedule unescorted children up to the age of 17,
registered or not, on the last connecting flight of the day. TWA's
fees are $30 for a nonstop flight, $60 for a connection, both
domestic or international.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines registers unescorted children 5 to 12, but
does not charge a fee. They are not permitted to change planes or
make connections.
</P>
<P>
   American, Continental and Delta have rules to avoid strandings
caused by canceled flights or missed connections. American will
reschedule if there is such a possibility; it also will not take
children on the last flights of the day out of its hub airports.
Children must be 8 to take a trip with a connection. Its fee is $30
each way, whether nonstop or connection, domestic or international.
</P>
<P>
   Continental will not take a child on a flight leaving between 9
p.m. and 5 a.m., except on international flights, a flight from
Honolulu or a domestic flight of two hours or less. Continental
will also not schedule a child on the last connecting flight of the
day to the destination, or start a child out if there is a
possibility of a missed connection. Its fees are $30 for a nonstop
and $60 for a connection each way, domestic or international.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, beginning April 1, will not accept a child on the last
connecting flight of the day. A child must be 8 to take a
connecting flight. The domestic fees are $30 and $60; a fee is
charged on international flights only if the child is connecting
from a Delta domestic flight to another airline's international
flight.
</P>
<P>
   United and US Airways take 5- to 7-year-olds on nonstop flights
only; children 8 to 11 may make connections. United's fee is $30
each way, with no extra fee if two children travel together. There
is no fee for flights to Japan. US Airways charges $30 for each
flight segment. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Country
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns over abductions, travel to Mexico with
children requires strict documentation. The State Department warns
about this, but many parents still get to the airport unaware.
</P>
<P>
   A child under 18 traveling with one parent must have notarized
consent from the other parent to board a flight to Mexico, or must
present, if applicable, a decree of sole custody for the
accompanying parent, or a death certificate for the other. Children
traveling alone or with someone else must have notarized consent to
travel from both parents, or notarized consent from a single
parent, plus documentation that that parent has sole custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Consular Affairs has also become concerned about
travelers, including children, who visit Mexico, Central America or
Caribbean countries without passports. For years, many of these
countries have admitted United States citizens on modest
identification _ driver's licenses, say _ and people are surprised
to discover that they cannot re-enter the United States on the same
documentation. A valid passport works best, but an expired one, a
certified copy of a birth certificate, or a certificate of
naturalization or citizenship will also work as long as another
document with a photo establishes identity.
</P>
<P>
   Places to pick up passport forms are listed at travel.state.gov.

 FRANKFURT, Germany: eastern Europe.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lead class-action attorneys include Neuborne, a professor of
law at New York University; Melvyn Weiss, who battled Swiss banks
over assets owned by Holocaust victims and who represented several
states against the tobacco industry; Michael Hausfeld, a securities
lawyer who led a landmark battle against Texaco over racial
discrimination; and Edward Fagan, who has sued the Swiss banks,
scores of German companies and, most recently, Japanese companies
for wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers stand to make tens of millions if not hundreds of
millions of dollars from a settlement, a fact that has generated
animosities among some Jewish groups, and the lawyers have battled
each other in recent days over how hard to bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government, which has been monitoring the talks, has
become increasingly concerned that the attorneys were holding out
for too much money at the expense of aging Holocaust survivors who
are rapidly dying of old age, one lawyer involved in the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 240,000 slave laborers, most of whom were
concentration camp prisoners forced to work in factories, are still
alive today. About half of those people are Jewish. In addition, as
many as two million other people were coerced into various degrees
of forced labor. Most came from Central European countries and
Russia and were not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Under plans being discussed, a new German foundation would make
money available to victims primarily through bilateral groups that
already exist in most central European nations to pursue claims
against the German government.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEMS MAY HAVE AN ALIBI

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first few days of next year, hundreds of thousands of
Americans are likely to discover that they cannot get cash from a
teller machine. Others will suddenly lose power or be greeted with
silence when they pick up their telephones.
</P>
<P>
   There will be neighborhood pharmacies asking customers to pay in
full for medicines because insurers' computers do not recognize
their names. And thousands of business and home computers are
likely to be penetrated by vandals or thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 computer problems? Although many people who encounter
such technology potholes will naturally assume so, they may well be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we watched the world tomorrow as closely as we will watch
Jan. 1, we'd see a whole set of things not working,'' said John
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   To gain perspective on potential Year 2000 problems _ and
perhaps head off sensationalized media coverage and panic _
Koskinen and industry representatives have been trying to pin down
just how messy normal life can be. On Monday, the President's
Council made its first attempt to publicize failure rates for vital
activities in a wide range of basic industries and government
services.
</P>
<P>
   The report bounced around the landscape from irritations (up to
10 percent of the 907 million automated teller transactions each
year fail on their first attempt, usually because of customer
errors) to safety concerns (telephone network glitches disrupt 911
service somewhere about once a week). It also touched on
transportation accidents and energy reliability: For example,
nearly every year since 1994, tens of thousands of Americans or
Canadians have lost power in late December or early January,
including 1.5 million during last year's ice storm in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Some are skeptical that such data will alter anyone's suspicions
or behavior when problems arise as the millennium arrives. ``There
will be very little they can say to counteract the belief that it's
a Y2K problem,'' said Lisa Aspinwall, a University of Maryland
psychology professor who is studying public perceptions about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen expects the baselines to provide an important
benefit even if they have little effect on public perceptions: They
may help to identify serious Year 2000 problems more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, utility grids may experience glitches that are
handled well enough by backup systems to keep the power on. The
benchmarks could point to a high incidence of malfunctions that
drastically increases the risks of blackouts several weeks down the
road, particularly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to focus on the first things that go wrong if it
looks like things that could develop later are more important,''
Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential value of failure data was reinforced Monday when
the Y2K International Cooperation Center, an information
clearinghouse established in Washington by the United Nations,
issued a global preparedness overview.
</P>
<P>
   It concluded that although computer risks remained relatively
high in some countries in lagging sectors like health care, ``most
critical infrastructures will function about as well as they
normally do in the first days of the new year.'' But the report
suggested that a closer look might reveal accumulating errors in
some power systems or other crucial areas that could lead to
deteriorating service or worse if left unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said the government would continue gathering failure
data but some industry experts question how many useful baselines
can be established. For instance, power reliability during the
winter is overwhelmingly a function of weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have 20 customers out on a typical quiet evening with
a somewhat higher level on New Year's Eve because you have more
cars crashing into poles,'' said Steven Kley, director of
distribution assets for Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For some industries, lack of enthusiasm for benchmarking is as
big a problem as lack of data. ``No one in the health care industry
wants to come out and say we normally have a lot of problems with
insurance coverage at the beginning of the year because so many
people are switching plans, but everyone in the industry knows
it,'' said one leading industry consultant who declined to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many large companies are privately putting extra effort
this year into tracking not just failure rates but any deviation
from what they consider normal activity. DuPont, for instance,
began in September to get reports every other week from truckers,
railroads and even Rhine River barge operators in Germany on how
much of their equipment is available. DuPont is looking for any
early indications _ so far, there are none _ of disruptions that
could affect the arrival of supplies or its ability to ship out
products.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies will be relying on failure benchmarks for
some guidance as to the seriousness of their problems next month,
most of them will not be nearly as defined as DuPont's. ``Most
people will have experts who know what's normal in their command
posts but 90 percent will be doing their assessments based on gut
feeling,'' said William Ulrich, a Year 2000 consultant based in
Soquel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be the best thing for companies that have not
drilled like DuPont on how to use failure benchmarks, not to
mention the government and consumers. ``Too much information is
just as bad as not enough,'' said Ann Coffou, a Year 2000 expert
with the Giga Group, a technology consulting firm in Cambridge,
Mass.

TRAVEL: SURFING (AND SKIING) THE NET

   SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT SLOPE
</P>
<P>
   www.skinet.com
</P>
<P>
   Ski resorts have been scrambling to get their own Web sites up
and working, some with more sophistication than others. On the site
for Steamboat, Colo., for example, if your computer is equipped for
audio, you can hear a detailed daily report on conditions. If you
want to see rather than hear about the snow, or lack of it, you may
find a Webcam photo on the home page of your favorite mountain.
Comparison shopping for a resort is trickier, and booking is
probably still best done on the telephone, but there are some sites
that provide a good base of information.
</P>
<P>
   Skinet, with selections from the magazines Ski, Skiing and
Freeze, has an authoritative tone and a lot of useful features. The
home page offers capsules of the articles, and you can click to get
the whole thing. Two of the four when I looked were ``The Old
Farmer's Almanac Predicts Snowy Winter'' and ``Last-Minute
Millennium Deals,'' the latter with links to travel deals. There
are links for forums, chat areas, games and gear.
</P>
<P>
   In the Snow Finder section, you select a state, a Canadian
province or a country and get a report on current snow conditions.
I picked Alaska and got the Alyeska Resort: 30 to 84 inches of
packed powder. Quebec reported no snow this early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING THE SKI MALL
</P>
<P>
   skitown.com
</P>
<P>
   This is more like a big city than a small town, or maybe a giant
mall putting a roof over a host of ski-mountain resort guides.
Browsers will find SkiResortsGuide.com, MountainResortsGuide.com
and a bunch of others all here on the ``premier virtual mountain
resort community on the Internet.'' Skitown lists more than 570
places to slip and slide in the United States and Canada. There are
also sections for real estate around ski towns, a place to exchange
messages with other skiers online or to read or write reviews,
weather reports and forecasts; there are jobs, travel packages and
a newsstand with selections from publications in resort towns. You
can search for ski areas on a map of the United States or Canada or
specify a narrower geographical area _ the Rockies, for example.
There is also an A-to-Z list (which was actually an A-to-Y list)
running from the Afton Alps Ski Area in Minnesota to the Yawgoo
Valley Ski Area in Rhode Island. Information is still sketchy for
some areas, and some links aren't operating yet.
</P>
<P>
   Everything on the Web site seems neatly organized, and it moved
swiftly the half-dozen times I visited on various days and at
various hours, although that may have just been luck. Skitown is
based in Fort Collins, Colo. You can't reserve directly on Skitown,
although there is a form to be filled out that will be passed on to
one of the company's partners.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING A DIFFERENT ROUTE
</P>
<P>
   There are innumerable other ski sites, of course. Of the popular
Web portals I tried, Yahoo is well tuned for skiers. AOL has a
travel section, as does CompuServe, as does GoTo, and MSN links you
to Expedia, also run by Microsoft, which has a ski-vacations
subcategory. Searching ``ski and snow'' on Yahoo brings up a
worldwide directory by region, from which you can get basic
information, updated daily, about European and Southern Hemisphere
resorts as well as those in North America.

   Q. Please help me find a one-day guided tour of Vancouver that
focuses on the area's native culture. _ Jamie Witter, Bridgeport,
Conn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In response to a surge of interest in Pacific Northwest
native culture, several Vancouver companies have recently begun to
offer specialized day tours.
</P>
<P>
   West Coast City and Nature Sightseeing offers tours throughout
the year. The four- to five-hour excursion, led by Jeff Watts, a
Nuu-chah-nulth guide, visits the brightly painted totem poles in
the 1,000-acre Stanley Park, as well as the University of British
Columbia Museum of Anthropology, with its vast collection of wood
carvings, totem poles, canoes, ceremonial dishes and jewelry by
Haida, Kwakiutl, Coast Salish and other cultural groups.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor sculpture area includes two contemporary Haida
houses and a number of totems. The tour, which travels by minibus,
also goes to places used by native descendants; among them is the
Native Education Center, which is built in the style of a long
house. The cost is $29, figured at a rate of $1.48 Canadian dollars
to the U.S. dollar. Information: (604) 451-1600.
</P>
<P>
   Landsea Tours offers a five-hour bus excursion from early May to
mid-October. It visits the totem poles in Stanley Park, a long
house in the Capilano Reserve area north of Vancouver and the
19th-century St. Paul's Mission Church, one of the oldest surviving
mission churches in Vancouver. The $47 price includes a light meal,
and traditional activities, like weaving with cedar bark.
Information: (604) 255-7272.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Spirit Tours has a similar five-hour itinerary for the
same price and during the same time period. Telephone (604)
683-0209, fax (604) 683-6037. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm taking my 5-year-old daughter to England for the first
time this spring and would like to visit some places connected to
children's literature (Beatrix Potter is among the writers who come
to mind). Can you help? _ Lindsey McDonald, Bangor, Maine &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. England is a great place for visiting children's literary
sites, which include museums and attractions devoted to several
authors and their famous characters.
</P>
<P>
   Beatrix Potter, author of the nearly 100-year-old Peter Rabbit
books, lived in the Lake District for some 40 years. Several sites
in this lovely hilly region celebrate her books and her life. At
The World of Beatrix Potter, in Bowness-on-Windermere in Cumbria, a
theater shows biographical videos and there are displays devoted to
Potter's work as a farmer and conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attraction is the elaborate recreations of scenes
from her books, among them, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle's kitchen and
Squirrel Nutkin's old oak tree. Between October and April, the
hours are 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily; until 5:30 in the warmer
months. Admission is $5.25, children $3.25. Information: (44-15394)
88444. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two other Beatrix Potter sites in Cumbria are run by the
National Trust, a British conservation organization. Both are open
from the end of March to the end of October and admission is by
timed tickets. At The Beatrix Potter Gallery, 28 Main Street in
Hawkshead, there are exhibitions of sketches and watercolors that
Potter produced for her own stories.
</P>
<P>
   It is open Sunday through Thursday from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Admission is $4.70, $2.35 for children. Information: (44-15394)
36355. The second site, Hill Top, was Beatrix Potter's 17th-century
home from 1905 until her death in 1943. The small beamed cottage
has been kept as she left it, with her furniture and china all in
place. Admission $6.30, $3.15 for children. The house is in Near
Sawrey, Ambleside. Information: (44-15394) 36269. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 150 miles north of London, in Peak Village, fans of the
author Kenneth Graham and the illustrator E.H. Shepard can visit
the new Wind in the Willows Attraction in Derbyshire. The exhibits
include life-size models of Ratty, Mole and Badger (with sound
effects like Badger's snores), recreations of the meadows, woods
and streams where they cavorted and an interactive display on the
real creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $5.25, children $3.25. Open 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
daily from Oct. 1 until April 1, to 5:30 p.m. during the rest of
the year. Information: (44-1629) 733433.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk through scenes from ``James and the Giant Peach,''
``Matilda'' and other Roald Dahl stories at the Roald Dahl
Children's Gallery at the Buckinghamshire County Museum in
Aylesbury, 35 miles west of London. The gallery, on the A41, is
quite popular and entry is by timed tickets. Hours vary throughout
the year. Admission is $5.65, $3.25 for children. Information:
(44-1296) 331441.
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority has a free Literary Britain map,
with a section devoted to children's literature. The phone number
in New York is (800) 462-2748, fax (212) 986-1188. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to sign up for a whale-watching trip in Baja this
winter. I'm specifically interested in gray whales. Do you know of
an organized tour? _ Raymond W. Fritsch, Columbus, Ohio &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In mid- to late fall, thousands of gray whales migrate from
the Bering Sea to their winter home in the comparatively warm
Pacific lagoons off the Baja Peninsula. January to early April is
whale-watching season, with February considered the optimum month.
Here are two tour possibilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Natural Habitat Adventures, based in Boulder, Colo. offers
several five-day trips; departure dates include Feb. 15, 18 and 21.
Participants (up to 20 per trip) stay in thatched-roof cabanas
overlooking the San Ignacio Lagoon in the Vizcaino Biosphere
Reserve, and take two daily whale-watching excursions aboard
skiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Other activities include hikes, bird-watching and sea-kayaking.
The cost is $2,295, double occupancy, excluding international air
fare to Loreto. Information: (800) 543-8917.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanic Society Expeditions, in San Francisco, has a nine-day
tour that also goes to San Ignacio Lagoon, which is a prime calving
area for gray whales. On Feb. 18, the group (of up to 28 people)
departs from San Diego aboard a 95-foot motor vessel with 15 double
and triple cabins, shared baths, a library and salon.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to San Ignacio, the boat stops at the San Benitos
Islands, breeding grounds for elephant seals and California sea
lions. Two days are spent at the lagoon. Other stops include Cedros
Island and Ensenada. The cost per person is $1,890. Information:
(800) 326-7491, fax (415) 474-3395.

 WASHINGTON: training proposals.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Navy's personnel boss, Vice Adm. Daniel T. Oliver, did issue
a Navy-wide memorandum on Oct. 28, sternly reminding commanding
officers that they ``must not condone homosexual jokes, epithets or
derogatory comments, and must ensure a command climate that fosters
respect for all individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum continued: ``Service members should be able to
report crimes and harassment free from fear of harm, reprisal or
inappropriate or inadequate governmental response.''
</P>
<P>
   It then described in detail what the policy does and does not
permit.
</P>
<P>
   When the secretary reissued the policy guidelines in August, the
message drew respect and derision from officers and enlisted
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, screwing up any homosexual case provides an
excellent opportunity to appear on `60 Minutes,' wrote Col. James
C. Walker, the staff judge advocate for the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif. in an e-mail message
sent to commanders outlining Cohen's guidelines. ``My job is to
deny you that opportunity. Call me on all these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another e-mail message circulating at the Marine base at
Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., one officer wrote to several others:
``Due to the 'hate crime' death of a homo in the Army we now have
to take extra steps to ensure the safety of the queer who has
'told' (not kept his part of the D.O.D. ''don't ask, don't tell''
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gets political credit for being first to call for the
policy's elimination, the fact that some of the nation's most
prominent Democrats want it scrapped suggests a major battle ahead
in Congress. Republicans do not support the policy either, but they
generally do not want gays in the military at all.
</P>
<P>
   The process that is leading to the re-examination of the gays in
the military is similar to that which drove Clinton to shift his
position on another sensitive military issue, whether to reopen a
firing range in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Mrs. Clinton, apparently with her eye on New York
politics and the sizeable Puerto Rican community there, sided with
the governor of Puerto Rico and said the base should be permanently
closed. Shortly thereafter, Gore adopted the same position. Last
month, the president rejected the alternative recommendations of
the Navy and ordered the end of military exercises with live fire
on the base at Vieques.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After six hours of impassioned and often raucous
debate _ and just two days before talks begin in Washington _
Israel's Parliament on Monday narrowly endorsed Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's quest for a comprehensive peace settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to pay ``a heavy territorial price,'' Barak
acknowledged in an emotional plea for parliamentary support. But
failure to pursue peace with Damascus ``could cost us in blood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of confidence in the prime minister's negotiating plans
passed with 47 votes in favor, 31 against, and 24 abstentions _ a
victory, but far from the strong majority Barak expected. Three
parties in Barak's governing coalition pointedly refused to back
him on Monday night, pointing to potential trouble when a promised
national referendum is held on any final peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is to meet with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria
in Washington Wednesday and Thursday for the highest-level direct
discussions ever held between Syria and Israel. President Clinton
is expected to host the opening and closing sessions of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's appearance in Parliament on Monday was
widely considered his most important appearance since he took the
oath of office there five months ago. Calling this week's
negotiations ``an opportunity that cannot be squandered,'' he
argued that for the first time in its history, Israel has a chance
for a lasting peace with all of its immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Israel's perspective, real peace with Syria and the
Palestinians, if it can be achieved, is the pinnacle of the Zionist
vision,'' he said, ignoring opposition hecklers. ``It is a
revolution. It is a new era in Israel's relations with the Arab
world, and the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak implicitly conceded that the Golan Heights would be handed
back to Syria in a peace accord, as thousands of residents from the
northern border zone demonstrated angrily outside the Parliament.
The precise boundaries of withdrawal ``will be determined in
negotiations in accordance with the depth of peace and the quality
of security arrangements,'' he said, echoing the formula used by
the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Barak's mentor, in the last
attempt at a settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud bloc, followed
Barak to the podium. He predicted that any accord featuring a Golan
withdrawal would go down to defeat in a referendum. He tauntingly
read another statement by Rabin, this one from 1992, that ``it is
inconceivable that even in peace we would descend from the Golan
Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon charged that the government acquiesced to President Hafez
Assad's desire for ``American aid and modern American weapons'' and
President Clinton's hunger ``for a stunning achievement at any cost
before the end of his term in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had praised Clinton in his remarks for his ``personal
involvement and devotion to the cause of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned national vote on the Syrian peace accord would be
the first referendum in Israel's history. Lawmakers have yet to
determine how the balloting would be organized, or who will draft
the question that will be put to voters. Israel's attorney-general
rejected an opposition proposal that Arab citizens _ a sixth of the
electorate _ be excluded from the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The vote following Monday night's debate _ a simple yea or nay
response to the peace initiative outlined by the prime minister on
Monday night _ provided the first real test of Barak's coalition
strategy. For Barak's Labor allies, the results appeared worrisome.
He assembled a multiparty government to provide the broadest
possible majority for peace with Syria and the Palestinians, but on
Monday night he was left with an uncomfortably slim plurality.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest faction in Barak's ruling coalition _ the
Sephardic-dominated Shas party _ unexpectedly abstained from the
vote and openly criticized his ``unclear'' negotiating strategy.
Most members of two smaller conservative parties in the government
_ the National Religious Party, backed by settlers in the West
Bank, and Yisrael B'aliya, representing Russian immigrants _ voted
against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all three coalition factions then joined Sharon and
other opposition figures outside Parliament in a rally with
protesters from the Golan Heights. ``We feel that the Golan is our
home, and you cannot throw people out of their homes,'' Guy Neuman,
a demonstrator from Qatrin, the largest Golan town, told an Israeli
television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, anticipating opposition attacks, portrayed himself as a
patriot and career military man who had devoted his life to
Israel's defense. He reminded his audience that he had fought
against the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the 1967 war. ``I
am fully familiar with every valley and every rock in the Golan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied to the Parliament by Nadia Cohen, the widow
of Eli Cohen, an Israeli agent who has executed by Syria in 1965
for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen, who is seeking the return from Damascus of her
husband's interred remains, publicly endorsed Barak's peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary interest is Israel's security,'' Barak said. ``The
agreement that we aspire to reach with our Syrian neighbors is one
that will also put an end to our conflict with Lebanon, and will
include diverse and effective systems to preserve security and
peace between our countries at all times. Such an agreement is not
beyond reach.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a meeting earlier on Monday, he told Cabinet colleagues that
while Israel had made no new commitments to Syria before this
week's talks, it ``would not erase'' any promises made in previous
negotiations during the administrations of Rabin and former Prime
Ministers Shimon Peres, and Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians and Israelis have profoundly different recollections of
those past pledges, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians have said the Rabin government was prepared to
withdraw to Israel's 1967 borders _ that is, to the eastern
shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. Israeli negotiators deny making
such a promise. And former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims
to have extracted Syrian permission for a permanent Israeli
presence atop Mount Heron, the Golan's high point _ an assertion
dismissed by diplomats in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations with Syria will be difficult and paved with
crises,'' Barak told his Cabinet ministers, according to state
radio reports. ``I have no illusions about the nature of the Middle
East, and I have no doubt that only the overall strength of Israel
will ensure that agreements are honored.``

NUCLEAR-WEAPONS SCIENTIST PLEADS `NOT GUILTY' TO CHARGE OF
MISHANDLING DATA
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ A weapons scientist pleaded not guilty on
Monday to the illegal computer downloading of a vast trove of
nuclear arms data, but a federal magistrate ordered him jailed
pending trial, declaring that the acts he is accused of represent
``a clear and present danger to the security of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Wen Ho Lee, was ordered held behind bars after
all-day proceedings here, where he entered the courtroom smiling
broadly at relatives and dozens of supporters and left to live in a
cell while awaiting a trial that may be months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead not guilty,'' Lee responded in a loud, clear voice
after Magistrate Don Sven asked what he had to say about the
59-count indictment returned against him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing produced testimony that Lee's unauthorized
downloading of highly classified data in 1993 or 1994 roughly
coincided with his notice from the Department of Energy that he
might lose his job at the Los Alamos laboratory because of
cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   There was also testimony that seven computer tapes containing a
virtual blueprint for much of the country's nuclear arsenal had
been created by Lee, then had vanished _ not turning up despite an
investigation involving about 1,000 witnesses, a review of a
million documents and inquiries by the FBI in Europe and in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the day, Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher, said his
client had destroyed the tapes. But he refused to tell questioners
outside the courtroom where or how they had been destroyed, or
whether there was any proof that they had been.
</P>
<P>
   FBI investigators have concluded after a search of Los Alamos
computers that Lee copied information relating to the design,
construction and testing of the most advanced nuclear weapons in
the American arsenal _ data that Lee's former boss said on Monday
was of extraordinary importance.
</P>
<P>
   The former boss, Stephen Younger, said that the material Lee is
accused of compromising could, in the wrong hands, make the U.S.
missile systems vulnerable to hostile nations, perhaps even change
the global balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first day I entered the nuclear weapons program it
was made crystal-clear to me how important this information was to
national security,'' said Younger, the associate laboratory
director for nuclear weapons. ``We are more aware of anyone else of
the destructive capability of these weapons. It is a sacred trust
to me that we have taken on for the country, and we take that very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is not accused of espionage, or passing the classified
data to another country, Lee has not explained why he downloaded
the data or what he did with it. A few of the computer tapes he
used have been recovered, but most are unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI special agent, Robert Messemer, testified that the volume
of material downloaded by Lee would made a stack of paper 134 feet
tall if it was printed.

JAPAN OFFICIAL FORESEES LESS DEBT RELIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese finance minister said Monday that he
expected the government to begin trying to gradually wean the
country's shaky economy away from its reliance on public borrowing,
a practice that has made Japan one of the biggest debtor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's comments, made in an
interview, suggested that the government was keenly aware that its
relentless borrowing was increasingly calling into question its
fiscal responsibility, a criticism that Japan had made of the
United States in years past.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa is one of the nation's most powerful and best-known
politicians, and his comments about government spending came
against the backdrop of mild economic improvement in Japan after
its worst recession since the end of World War II. The remarks may
be a sign that the government is beginning to have faith that the
economy's long-term prospects are improving.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, officials have been wary of publicly describing the
signs of life in the economy over the last year as a recovery. They
have also given little indication of when Japan would stop
borrowing heavily to inject money into the economy, much of it to
build public works projects ranging from extra tunnels and airport
runways to a new Tokyo subway. Such spending has been criticized as
extravagant, wasteful and unlikely to keep the economy going once
the money runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa said he had discussed the matter of a gradual, measured
return to fiscal restraint with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on the
phone Monday morning, and that the prime minister seemed eager to
find a way to reassure the public that he was concerned about
Japan's increasing indebtedness and would work to correct it as the
economy regains momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Obuchi wondered how could he say it without giving up the
appearance of the fight against recession,'' Miyazawa said. ``There
is some anxiety about that.''
</P>
<P>
   How widespread the prime minister's concerns are among the
political elite here is unclear. Shizuka Kamei, chief policy
official of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and leader of
one of its largest factions, is an outspoken advocate of government
spending to prop up the economy. Moreover, few politicians are
likely to endorse any meaningful reduction in public spending
before parliament elections, which must be called by September.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Japanese deficit, already the highest in the
industrial world, is expected to reach 10.7 percent of the gross
domestic product by the end of this fiscal year, on March 31, 2000.
The United States, by contrast, is running a surplus estimated at
1.9 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the
Paris-based group of rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of fortunes between the two countries is
embarrassing for Japan, which criticized the United States several
times in the 1980s over its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa's remarks came as executives here indicated more sense
of a recovery. A widely watched business survey by the Bank of
Japan, released Monday, showed that corporate sentiment improved in
the third quarter to its best level in two years. Still, the survey
_ known as the tankan _ contained some mixed signals, notably
evidence that large businesses were cutting capital spending even
more than they had predicted in the second quarter. Such cutbacks
reflect corporate caution about the strength of the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report suggesting that the recovery remained
tenuous, the finance ministry said Japan's trade surplus fell for
the ninth consecutive month, largely because of the strength of the
yen. This has made Japan's products more expensive abroad, hurting
the profits of major exporters ranging from Sony and Honda to
Kikkoman, the world's largest producer of soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament recently approved the government's ninth expensive
attempt to prod the recalcitrant economy into action _ a package of
public spending, loan guarantees, tax breaks and other measures
worth $171 billion if local government spending and lending is
included.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the news that for the first time since World
War II, the government will have to finance more than half of its
budget through bond issues, has raised public sensitivity to the
country's increasing fiscal imbalance, which has swelled total
public debt to more than $5.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines and talk shows here have been debating the value of
all of the spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Miyazawa said he thought that tax receipts would start to
rise, perhaps as soon as next year, after declining in five out of
the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax revenues in the next fiscal year may go up,'' he said,
``reflecting some improvement in the business situation as a result
of the restructuring that many companies have undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry's tax bureau is substantially less optimistic,
though. The government's efforts to reform the tax system will in
the short term actually reduce what it takes in.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the economy has improved, corporations and
individuals show little sign of increased financial well-being.
Corporate Japan collectively lost money this year for the first
time since the government began gathering data on corporate
performance, according to data compiled by Mikuni &AMP; Co., the
country's only independent credit-rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   And Miyazawa himself, one of the few voices of fiscal restraint
in the top echelons of Japanese government, noted Monday that
consumer sentiment remained uneasy. ``In some ways,'' he said,

 BRITAIN'S LARGEST CABLE TV FIRM BUYS SWITZERLAND'S TOP OPERATOR  
(ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ NTL Inc., Britain's largest cable concern, expanded its
foothold in continental Europe Monday with a $3.7 billion deal to
buy Cablecom Group, Switzerland's leading cable television
operator.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase gives NTL 1.28 million subscribers in Switzerland,
accounting for 53 percent of the cable market there, according to
the two companies. As part of the deal, NTL also will get
Cablecom's SwissOnline subsidiary, one of the most popular Web
sites in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   NTL, a 6-year-old telecommunications company based in New York
that operates mainly in Britain, has gone on a European shopping
spree within the past six months, betting that cable delivery of
entertainment, telephone and Internet services to homes will become
an increasingly important business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by influential shareholders that include France Telecom
and Microsoft, NTL bought Cable and Wireless PLC's consumer cable,
telephone and Internet units in Britain, as well as France
Telecom's 1G networks and Ireland's largest cable company,
Cablelink.
</P>
<P>
   Those acquisitions, along with the purchase announced Monday,
have put NTL in direct competition with United Pan-Europe
Communications, or UPC, which is based in Amsterdam and has
followed a similar path.
</P>
<P>
   NTL's chief executive, Barclay Knapp, who is from Nebraska, has
pursued a strategy that that combines bundling telephone service,
cable television and Internet access into a single service, much as
AT&AMP;T has sought to do with its acquisition of Tele-Communications
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of our overall European strategy, it is particularly
important to have acquired a network at the very heart of Europe,''
Knapp said in a statement about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisition would benefit both NTL and
Cablecom because it solidified NTL's position in Europe while it
would make Cablecom more competitive at home.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Sinclair, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London,
said the deal brought NTL ``one of the best run, competitively and
operationally strong cable companies in Europe at a low price.''
Sinclair, who rates NTL stock as a buy, said the acquisition gave
NTL ``an opportunity to consolidate its position, not just as the
leading UK player but as the most athletic competitor to UPC across
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   While most analysts praised the deal, investors sent NTL's share
price down $6.375, to $113.375, on the Nasdaq stock market.
Analysts said investors were nervous that NTL might have to issue
more shares to finance the acquisition of Cablecom. NTL already has
about $7.7 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   NTL said that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Chase Manhattan
Bank would finance $2.3 billion of the purchase price and said it
was assessing a number of proposals to finance the balance of the
purchase price. &QL;

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS SEND NASDAQ INDEX TO ANOTHER RECORD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks continued to power ahead Monday,
pulling the Nasdaq composite index to its seventh record this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in technology shares was led by Internet,
telecommunications and networking stocks. But other market gauges
slipped lower on the day. Trading activity, which usually begins to
tail off as the end of the year approaches, was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite climbed 37.93, or just more than 1 percent,
to 3,658.17. Since the start of the year, the index has risen by an
astonishing 66.8 percent. Many investors, eager to get in on the
ride, have been recent buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greed meter is running at full tilt,'' said Philip S. Dow,
a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in
Minneapolis. ``Most of the calls I get are which technology stocks
I should buy. They have nothing to do with what is a good
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulled down by big drops in Hewlett-Packard and the drug makers
Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
32.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,192.59. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index also slipped, but by a more modest 1.82 points, or
0.1 percent, to 1,415.22. But the Russell 2000 index of small
company stocks moved higher, rising 3.67 points, or 0.8 percent, to
470.38.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy. On the Big Board, 977.6 million shares
changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.55 billion
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, part of both the S.&AMP; P. 500 and Nasdaq, had a big day.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which has risen fifteenfold this year, gained 26
1-16, to 417 9-16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Wal-Mart Stores were rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the company said sales for the week ended Dec. 10 were at
the high end of management's expectations and that same-store sales
for the month are on track to meet the company's internal forecast
of a gain of 5 percent to 7 percent compared with results in the
month a year earlier. Its shares rose 4|, to 67~.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about earnings dragged down Oracle, the world's biggest
maker of database software, which is expected to post results for
the quarter ended Nov. 30 after the market closes Tuesday. Its
stock fell 4~, to 79 13-16.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley A. Nabi, vice chairman of DLJ Asset Management, said
disappointing fourth-quarter results could be particularly damaging
for highflying Internet stocks, and possibly for the overall stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see an ugly bear market on the horizon,'' he said.
``What worries me is that this small group of stocks may
contaminate the whole market. But that isn't going to happen in
what is left of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks took a pounding, largely on worries that Washington
will renew its efforts to rein in the industry's ability to set
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Merck fell 3 3-16, to 68\. Johnson &AMP; Johnson lost 2 5-16, to 92
1-16. Pfizer was down one-half, to 33[. Bristol-Myers Squibb
dropped 1 9-16, to 66 11-16.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the technology sector, Foundry Networks jumped 26\,
to 304, after the maker of computer-networking gear said its board
had approved a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Dow at Dain Rauscher Wessels said market gauges could jump
Tuesday if a report on November consumer prices is friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a benign reading on consumer prices, we could be off
to the races again,'' he said. ``You could see yields on 30-year
bonds fall down toward the 6 percent level by year-end if that
happens.''  &QL;

Steinbrenner has repeatedly promised that he will soon announce
where he wants the Yankees to play when the lease at Yankee Stadium

 NEW YORK: the gallery.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What I did not only hurt Abner Louima and his family, but
conjured up the worst fears in people,'' he said. ``This fear was
worse by me being a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Volpe repeated his earlier statements that another
former officer, Charles Schwarz, had been wrongly convicted by the
jury of helping to torture Louima by holding him down in the
bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house. Volpe repeated his
claim that the officer in the bathroom was Thomas Wiese. In the
past, Volpe had said that Wiese merely watched the attack with the
stick.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad, maintained to the judge that
Volpe's statements exonerating Schwarz lacked credibility.
Vinegrad, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, previously
said that there had been more than sufficient evidence to support
the conviction of Schwarz, who faces up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz plans to appeal his conviction, and his lawyer, Ronald
Fishetti, said Monday that the prosecution should give Volpe a
lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, Wiese and a third former officer, Thomas Bruder, face
trial next month on charges that they conspired to lie to
investigators to persuade them that Schwarz had not taken part in
the torture. Defense lawyers have indicated that they would call
Volpe as a witness for their clients, who deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing Volpe to 30 years, Nickerson reduced a finding by
the U.S. Probation Department that federal sentencing guidelines
mandated that Volpe be sentenced to life in prison without any
chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, he was taking into account such factors as the
likelihood that the former police officer would have to serve much
of his sentence in ``some form of segregation'' for his own
protection from other inmates _ meaning even harsher punishment. He
lowered the finding to a guideline that called for a sentence of
between 30 years and life. He then imposed the 30 years, without
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Dan Dunne,
said that it was too early to say where Volpe would be incarcerated
or what security precautions, if any, would be taken to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Kornberg said he would appeal. He had told
Nickerson that a 20-year-sentence would have been enough. Later he
noted to reporters outside the courthouse _ as Louima's supporters
loudly jeered him in the background _ that another police officer,
Francis Livoti, had been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for
violating a man's civil rights by killing him with an illegal
chokehold. And Volpe's father, Robert Volpe, a retired city police
detective, said that 30 years was, in effect, as harsh as a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Louima said that he hoped the sentence would ``send a clear
message that no one is above the law,'' but the Rev. Al Sharpton,
the New York activist, said after leaving the courthouse that Volpe
``should have been given life.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Rodney, co-chairman of the Haitian-American Alliance,
called the sentence a ``slap on the wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Loretta Lynch, the interim U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said
she accepted the 30-year term as the result of a ``very careful
balancing'' by Nickerson.

THERE'S TIME TO CATCH UP AFTER A LATE INVESTING START 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I started my investing late in life. I am a 49-year-old woman
who sells real estate and my income can vary quite a bit from year
to year. My net income usually falls between $80,000 and $110,000
at this point in my career. I now have a savings program that
includes $200 a month to Fidelity Asset Manager fund, where I have
$19,461, and $200 a month to Fidelity Fund, where the balance is
$6,084. I have SEP-IRAs of $6,782 in Fidelity Equity Income and
$8,049 in Fidelity Spartan Market Index. I add $5,000 a year to the
SEP-IRAs. I don't necessarily picture myself retiring at age 65,
but I would like to have the financial resources to slow down if I
so chose. In some articles, you seem to lean toward Vanguard funds.
As you can see, I am invested in Fidelity funds. Should I diversify
into different funds, or do all the companies offer similar
packages? I honestly don't know what you mean by large-cap and
mid-cap etc., but would like to have an evaluation of my financial
status. I like to keep liquid funds in an asset-manager-type fund
for easy access since my income fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Lake Oswego, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since you started investing late, you need to concentrate
more intensely on building these accounts, which will probably be
the bedrock of your financial stability whenever you retire.
</P>
<P>
   At your current savings rate (and presuming there are no
withdrawals from the Asset Manager account) you would have an
accumulation of $553,990 at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Without even factoring in the effects of inflation on that pool,
it will clearly be inadequate to support a comfortable retirement,
given your current income levels. The main thing you need to do is
save more.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion that frequently works for people such as yourself
who have variable income streams is to set a certain point as your
expected annual earnings, and then contribute a heavier percentage
of your income to savings during the years when you pass that
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, you budgeted yourself so you could live on
$90,000 a year, including the current $9,800 that goes into
savings. You might then decide that a certain percentage _ or all _
of the earnings that you make in excess of that level go into
savings.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have any particular argument with your fund choices,
although the portfolio could certainly be more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   First, I suggest that since you are using the Asset Manager
account more or less as an emergency pool, I would move to a more
conservative sibling of this fund, which is the Asset Manager
Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   Like Asset Manager, this fund spreads its investments among
stocks, bonds, and cash, but Asset Manager Income puts about 80
percent of its assets in cash and bonds, compared with about 47
percent for Asset Manager.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I suggest you look at your historical earnings trend and
decide what might be a prudent level at which this account could be
topped out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the level is $25,000, I'd continue with the
current contributions until you reach that level, and then transfer
the $200 monthly contributions to the Fidelity Fund account, or
another mutual fund holding. If a bad sales season subsequently
causes the Asset Manager Income balance to fall below $25,000 or
whatever target you have set, you could then resume contributions
until you get back to the benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   The terms large-cap, mid-cap, and so forth refer to the size of
the companies that dominate a funds portfolio. For example, all of
the funds you hold have large-cap portfolios. Cap here refers to
market capitalization, which is the value of all of the shares of a
company's stock that are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   If this value exceeds $5 billion, it's considered a large-cap
company; if the market value of all of a company's shares fall
between $1 billion and $5 billion, it's considered a mid-cap
company; if the total value of all shares is below $1 billion, it's
a small-cap company.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the large-cap market has been the place to be.
But the stock markets go through various cycles, and the common
wisdom is that the mid- and small-cap categories will have their
day and catch up, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a well-diversified portfolio is usually dominated by the
relatively stable large-cap companies, but also holds smaller
positions in the mid- and small-cap sectors. Staying within
Fidelity, for example, you might look at Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock
fund or Fidelity OTC fund to give you some exposure to that sector.
The first is solid and more cautions; the second more aggressive,
and thus far has rewarded its owners more lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   In the small-cap arena, Fidelity isn't particularly attractive.
Two nice funds, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock and Fidelity Small-Cap
Stock, are closed to new investors. Fidelity Small Cap Selector
seems to be proving little but that the small-cap arena does not
lend itself well to computer-aided stock picking.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I do tend to favor Vanguard funds, but that is basically
a reflection of my cautious approach to investing. Vanguard's
strong points are very low expenses and plain-vanilla approaches to
building portfolios, most clearly demonstrated in its wide array of
index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, on the other hand, prides itself on the
stock-selecting prowess of its many talented portfolio managers.
Recent years have been kind to the index approach, but many believe
that as markets get choppier the most talented and prescient fund
managers will return to the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to believe that with Fidelity you are going
any way but first class _ and the same can be said for many other
fund families.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are 63 and 64 years old and retired. We have $55,557
invested in these American mutual funds _ New Perspective, American
Mutual, Capital World Growth and Income, and Washington Mutual. We
also have $10,000 in a Nuveen fund, $50,000 in an annuity, and
$20,000 in deferred compensation that will be paid out next year.
We recently sold a property in Colorado and need to invest
approximately $30,000. My husband wants to add to the American
Funds portfolio. I think we need to try another fund. Our bank
account has more than $100,000 in it, so we are in a hurry to get
it down. Can you help us make a decision? We also own our own home,
with a $40,000 mortgage balance. Our combined monthly income is
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Carlsbad, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I tend to agree with your husband. You certainly could do a
lot worse than adding to the American Funds portfolio, which is
entirely made up of solid, fairly conservatively managed funds with
good long-term records.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to diversify, you might consider two American
offerings that are much riskier than the funds you hold. They are
American Century Heritage and American Century Vista.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have quite poor records over most of the last half
of this decade, new managers have posted very strong 1999 results.
Heritage is up 34.29 percent year to date, while Vista has produced
an eye-popping 81.22 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Both seem attractive candidates at this point, although if you
were to add $30,000 to the American Funds portfolio, I'd put no
more than $5,000 of it in one or both of these.
</P>
<P>
   With all of that cash loafing at the bank, why not pay off your
mortgage? With such a cash surplus, your income probably exceeds
your expenses. By prepaying the mortgage, you could then take the
amount you were formerly paying to the bank and begin a
dollar-cost-averaging program into the American Funds portfolio,
building it still further to protect you against inflation in the
later years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 42-year-old woman. Last year I opened a 403(b)
account, which now is worth $1,400, all invested in Fidelity Blue
Chip Growth fund. I contribute $150 biweekly. I would like to
retire at age 65. Is having all of my money in one fund a good
idea? Should I diversify? Is my contribution enough?
</P>
<P>
   H.I., Randolph, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fidelity Blue Chip Growth is certainly a first-rate fund,
with a long and enviable track record. But you should diversify so
that you have small percentages of your money in other market
sectors. If you send me a list of the options open to you through
the 403(b), I'll be happy to make some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to calculate whether you are saving enough. Your
retirement savings represent 9.75 percent of your earnings, which
is a pretty typical level. If your investments earned 10 percent
average annual returns for the next 23 years and you continued
contributing at the current level, you would have $336,982 by age
65.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to combine that with your husband's retirement
assets to determine if you will have a satisfactory level of
savings at that point.

Steinbrenner has repeatedly promised that he will soon announce

   Telling Time, From Stonehenge On &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Timekeeping, from sundials to wristwatches, is the subject of
the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pa., in Lancaster
County, which recently reopened in an expanded building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The building more than doubles the size of the museum's
exhibition space, to around 25,000 square feet. Money for the
construction came from the National Association of Watch and Clock
Collectors, whose headquarters is in the complex. With more than
13,000 watches, timepieces and clocks, the museum, which was
founded in 1983 and has been expanded several times since then,
traces the evolution from the colossal calendar of Stonehenge to
devices like sundials, hourglasses and oil-lamp and water clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the exhibits are a reproduction of a Greek antikythera
(circa 80 B.C.), one of the earliest known mechanically geared
timekeeping devices; six 200-year-old Japanese clocks that divide
the day into 12 hours, 6 hours of daylight and 6 hours of darkness
(the length of the ``hour'' can be adjusted by moving the tile
indicators); and an 11-foot-tall, 8-foot-wide clock with two barrel
organs and 48 animatronic figures that perform on the hour
(soldiers marching through a square, angels, a jester and
skeletons, among others).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on activities and video kiosks supplement the exhibits,
and the museum complex also contains an 80-seat theater that shows
a 10-minute introductory video, as well as a library and research
center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Watch and Clock Museum, 514 Poplar Street, is open
Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $6, $5 ages 60 and up, $4 ages
6 to 12. Information: (717) 684-8261. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexico Backs Down On Car Deposits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials vowed that they would never back down on their
plan to require a deposit of up to $800 from motorists driving
foreign-registered vehicles into Mexico. But only two days after
the plan went into effect on Dec. 1, they did. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo suspended the plan until further
notice, responding to an uproar raised by Mexicans in the United
States, which included a boycott of Mexican products like Sauza
Tequila and Corona beer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the time being Mexican customs will observe the old
procedure. Travelers who want to drive a vehicle into Mexico past
the 15-mile border zone have two choices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with a credit card can pay a $16.50 fee for a six-month
multiple-entry permit and must take the car back out of Mexico
before the end of the six-month period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those without credit cards have to buy bonds in dollars from one
of the private companies at each border post. The amount of the
bond depends on the year and model of the vehicle and is determined
by consulting the Blue Book, a listing in the United States of the
value of used cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bond amount varies from $100 to about $600. The companies,
however, charge a commission of as much as half the value of the
bond, which is not returned to the traveler. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cost is much lower for travelers with credit cards,
officials said, because the identification information on the card
is considered adequate to initiate a search for the driver if the
car does not leave Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deposit plan sought to address the proliferation of illegal
foreign-made cars in Mexico. Officials said they would revisit the
issue in the first months of next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexicans traveling by land into their country are
getting another break from their government. From Dec. 1 to Jan. 10
only, they can bring in up to $300 of goods duty free, instead of
up to $50 worth. &QL;

<P>
   To Visit Site on Jordan Call First, Be Cautious &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can now visit the isolated bend of the Jordan River where
many believe that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. But there
are a few caveats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, the area is heavily mined, so visitors must stay on the
paths. You also need to clear your visit with the Israeli army one
week ahead. And if immersion is your goal, the waist-deep waters of
the famous 20-foot-wide stream are less than pristine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Berman, the manager of a company that is developing the
site as a millennial tourist attraction, says the easiest way to
arrange a visit is to call him at (972-51) 511-269 or (972-2)
940-0598 or send a fax to (972-2) 940-0591.
</P>
<P>
   For tour groups he requires the name and passport number of the
leader, the name of the bus company, and the size of the group.
With about seven days' notice, Berman says, he can guarantee
access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can also get permission from the Israel Defense Forces by
calling (972-2) 530-5511 and providing a fax number where they can
send you a form requesting a visit. Requests are approved once a
week, on Thursday. Approvals, which are usually automatic, will be
faxed back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a heavily fortified frontier zone with Jordan, so the
experience may seem less than biblical. To get to the baptismal
site, you pass through a gate in an electrified border fence.
Soldiers on both sides of the river, Israelis and Jordanians, are
dispatched to stand guard over visitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Berman suggests that the time to visit the site is Sunday to
Thursday, 8 a.m. till dusk. There is no admission fee and, so far,
no tourist facilities except for restrooms and a drinking
fountain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, good news from a rival putative baptismal site a few
miles upriver on the Jordanian side: mine clearing there is well
advanced, Jordanian officials report. &QL;

   Paris: Toy-filled Department Store Windows &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to the last Christmas of the 20th century, two big
Parisian department stores a block apart along the Boulevard
Haussmann on the Right Bank are abandoning their haute couture
displays this month for toy-filled windows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French puppeteer Jean-Claude Dehix was commissioned by
Galeries Lafayette, at No. 40, and Printemps, at No. 64, to create
dozens of scenes, including, in one Printemps window, a space
capsule filled with teddy bears celebrating the New Year with
champagne and dehydrated caviar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Galeries Lafayette chose the theme Fairies of the World, with
155 puppets and dolls in 25 window displays. Motors animate the
puppets. A white Christmas tree 150 feet high stands under the
Galeries' dome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Printemps is looking to the future, with Barbies, traditional
French Corolle dolls and German Sigikids starring in scenes ranging
from a messy New Year's Eve party for animatronic dolls and mice to
a flight of a hundred Barbie dolls dressed as queens and
princesses. The windows are in operation from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In front of all the windows, steps lead to platforms to give
children a better view. The boulevard is most alluring at night,
illuminated by thousands of tiny lights strung in the trees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crowds at the store windows are thinnest early in the morning.
Across the street from the last Printemps window, at 37, rue
Tronchet, is a tearoom called Paul, where tea and cakes make a
fitting conclusion to a holiday stroll. &QL;

Officials think this 2,000-year-old Mayan stone carving, found in a
Brooklyn garage, was stolen from a ruin. The relic, discovered last
month, will soon be shipped back to Guatemala, the Guatemalan
consul general in New York said Monday. (Frances Roberts/The New

   (NYT30) OAKLAND, Calif. -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- FDA-BIOTECH --
Supporters and opponents of the use of gene-altered food protesting
Monday in Oakland. The conflicting protests, which co-existed
peacefully outside the federal building here, reflect the
increasing public concern about such crops, which have swept
largely unnoticed into American agriculture over the last decade.

   (NYT29) ORINDA, Calif. -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- WALLSTREET-PAYDAYS --
Mark Long, 32, left his banking job to join Intraware shortly
before the company went public. ``Today, bankers are just hired
guns,'' he says. If Intraware does well, Long stands to earn
considerably more than he did as a banker, thanks to stock options.
But that is only one reason he left. ``You get tired of sleeping 45
minutes a night to sell someone else's business,'' he says. (Peter

   (NYT28) WASHINGTON -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- ALBRIGHT-BERGER --
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, left, and National Security
Advisor Sandy Berger during interviews earlier this month. The end
of the Kosovo war was supposed to be a moment of glory for
Albright, who had argued passionately for the fight. But instead,
Berger has eclipsed her in the last six months, bringing his
physical proximity to the Oval Office and his personal relationship
with President Clinton to bear on every foreign policy issue,
administration officials and foreign policy experts say. (Paul

   (NYT27) IN THE BAY OF BISCAY, France -- Dec. 13, 1999 --
TANKER-SINKING -- A broken Maltese-registered tanker, the Erika,
sank off northwestern France on Monday, pouring thousands of tons
of fuel oil into the ocean. A slick, 10 miles long and 4 miles
wide, is off the coast of Brest in the Bay of Biscay. A maritime
spokesman said weather conditions would determine the outcome.

   (NYT26) NEW YORK -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- YANKEE-STADIUM -- George
Steinbrenner, the primary owner of the New York Yankees, arrives to
work at the stadium in this 1996 photo. For the last five years,
Steinbrenner has repeatedly promised that he will soon announce
where he wants the Yankees to play when the lease at Yankee Stadium
runs out in 2002. But as Steinbrenner weighs his options, much of
the rest of New York has come to the conclusion that he is really
down to only two: staying in the Bronx whether that is in a
renovated Yankee Stadium or in a new ballpark. (Vic Delucia/The New

   (NYT25) NEW YORK -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- NY-TRANSIT-ASSESS -- ``Show
us the money,'' says Transport Workers Union President Willie
James, left, at a press conference in Manhattan on Monday. ``Put
more money on the table so we can resolve this.'' The union's
33,000 members are threatening to walk off the job at 12:01 a.m.
Wednesday unless they reach a deal with the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority for pay increases and other benefits.

New York recently opened a Co-op expansion at its Madison Aveune
store, which KramerHutchison all-out designed. Other surprises are
also in evidence: metal birdcages the firm designed for live
parakeets (acquiescing to management's wish for birds), and vintage
1950s hospital equipment used to showcase clothes. (Barbara

   (NYT23) NEW YORK -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- KRAMER-FASHION-2 -- Robin
Kramer and Jeff Hutchinson's company, KramerHutchison, ``brands''
fashion companies through the kind of details shoppers might
believe they don't notice. The company created the feel at the
downtown boutique Jeffrey, designing fixtures, dressing rooms,
wrapping stations and procuring the stores' signature fountain,

freedom granted her company on the assignment. (The New York Times)

   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- KRAMER-FASHION-1 -- Robin
Kramer and the architect Jeff Hutchinson in KramerHutchison's new

of definition, but in a broad sense she is in the business of
``branding'' fashion companies through the kind of details shoppers
might believe they don't notice. (Carol Halebian/The New York

Eric Harris, left, and Dylan Klebold appear on a video surveillance
tape in the cafeteria at Columbine High School in April on the day
of their shooting rampage where they shot and killed 12 students
and a teacher before turning guns on themselves. The video was made
available by the Jefferson County Sheriff's department on Monday
who played the contents of the surveillance tape as well as tapes
made by the two teenagers as they planned the shooting massacre.

   (NYT20) EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. -- Dec. 13, 1999 - OBIT-HELLER-B&AMP;W --
Author Joseph Heller at his home in 1994. Heller, whose darkly
comic first novel, ``Catch-22,'' defined the paradox of the no-win
dilemma and added a phrase to the American lexicon, died of a heart
attack at his home. He was 76. (Vic Delucia/The New York Times)

   (NYT19) BOSTON -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- INTERVIEW-SILBER-BOS - John
Silber in his office at Boston University. The former president of

he remains all edge. Silber is still the bantam who slashes at
intellectual opposition the way Confederate General Nathan Bedford
Forrest savaged Union lines. (Tom Herde/The Boston Globe)

memory and our twin national penchants for celebrity and the public
washing of dirty laundry. (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- BAUM-THEATER-REVIEW -- Ron
Leibman, kneeling, and Christopher Evan Welch in ``Adam Baum and
the Jew Movie.'' Leibman's star turn as Sam Baum, a 1940s movie
mogul in denial of his Jewish identity, will remind many
theatergoers of his Tony-winning portrayal of Roy Cohn, the
right-wing lawyer in denial over his homosexual identity in Tony
Kushner's ``Angels in America.'' (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

SCI-SLOAN-SKY-SURVEY-2 --The 100-inch telescope of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey has a boxlike structure to buffer it against the
wind. Using a technique akin to overlaying thousands of faint X-ray
images to create one sharp picture, astronomers have discovered
that typical galaxies may be twice as large and contain twice as

``inflammatory quinsy,'' a severe infection of the throat, but to
this day controversy has surrounded his death. (The New York Times)

   (NYT11) KUKES, Albania -- Dec. 13, 1999 -- SCI-POLIO -- Albanian
refugee children being vaccinating against polio and measles in
April. Nearly 40 years after the United States abandoned Dr. Jonas
Salk's injectable polio vaccine in favor of an oral version, the
pendulum has swung the other way. Starting in 2000, the government

--Protesters, many of them settlers from the Golan Heights,
demonstrate against withdrawal from the strategic area captured by
Israel from Syria in 1967, on Monday outside the Israeli
parliament. After hours of impassioned debate, and just two days
before talks begin in Washington, Israel's parliament narrowly

WEAPONS SCIENTIST PLEADS `NOT GUILTY' TO CHARGE OF MISHANDLING
DATA
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for rewriting throughout; story is now complete in 1 take) 
 (sw) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ A former U.S. weapons scientist pleaded not
guilty on Monday to the illegal computer downloading of a vast
trove of nuclear arms data, but a federal magistrate ordered him
jailed pending trial, declaring that the acts he is accused of
represent ``a clear and present danger to the security of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was ordered held behind bars after
all-day proceedings here, where he entered the courtroom smiling
broadly at relatives and dozens of supporters and left to live in a
cell while awaiting a trial that may be months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead not guilty,'' Lee responded in a loud, clear voice
after Magistrate Don Sven asked what he had to say about the
59-count indictment returned against him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Lee led to widespread fears of extensive
nuclear spying by the Chinese, though the indictment does not
accuse Lee of spying. He was fired in March from his job at the Los
Alamos weapons laboratory after Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
began an investigation into the accusations spying by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing produced testimony that Lee's unauthorized
downloading of highly classified data in 1993 or 1994 roughly
coincided with his notice from the Department of Energy that he
might lose his job at the laboratory because of cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   There was also testimony that seven computer tapes containing a
virtual blueprint for much of the country's nuclear arsenal had
been created by Lee, then had vanished _ not turning up despite an
investigation involving about 1,000 witnesses, a review of a
million documents and inquiries by the FBI in Europe and in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher, said his
client had destroyed the tapes. But he refused to tell questioners
outside the courtroom where or how they had been destroyed, or
whether there was any proof that they had been.
</P>
<P>
   FBI investigators have concluded after a search of Los Alamos
computers that Lee copied information relating to the design,
construction and testing of the most advanced nuclear weapons in
the American arsenal _ data that Lee's former boss said on Monday
was of extraordinary importance.
</P>
<P>
   The former boss, Stephen Younger, said that the material Lee was
accused of compromising could, in the wrong hands, make the United
States missile systems vulnerable to hostile nations, perhaps even
change the global balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first day I entered the nuclear weapons program it
was made crystal clear to me how important this information was to
national security,'' said Younger, the associate laboratory
director for nuclear weapons. ``We are more aware of anyone else of
the destructive capability of these weapons. It is a sacred trust
to me that we have taken on for the country, and we take that very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is not accused of espionage, or passing the classified
data to another country, Lee has not explained why he downloaded
the data or what he did with it. A few of the computer tapes he
used have been recovered, but most are unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI special agent, Robert Messemer, testified that the volume
of material downloaded by Dr. Lee would made a stack of paper 134
feet high if printed.
</P>
<P>
   But Holscher pointed out that around that time Lee was also
downloading unclassified data that would have made a stack of paper
over 100 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   And Messemer further acknowledged that an investigation had
developed no evidence that Lee was trying to aid another country.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's supporters have asserted that he is being persecuted
because he is of Chinese descent (he was born in Taiwan). They say
that other, higher-ranking government figures have been guilty of
greater security lapses linked to carelessness, not spying.
</P>
<P>
   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer said that Lee had approached a laboratory employee in a
nonsecured trailer beyond a perimeter fence and asked to use the
employee's computer to download data off a main-frame Los Alamos
laboratory computer. And when Lee was told earlier this year that
he had failed a polygraph test, he began ``massive'' deletions of
classified files he had downloaded, the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as a counterintelligence person, Dr. Lee's actions
are secretive,'' Messemer said. ``They appear to be clandestine and
nefarious.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holscher emphasized repeatedly in his cross-examination that
Lee had a right to gain access to and use the information that he
copied _ even though there has been no explanation for the
downloading.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last five years, George Steinbrenner has repeatedly
promised he will soon announce where he wants the Yankees to play
when the lease at Yankee Stadium runs out in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has said he will disclose his choice by opening
day, and sometimes he has said an announcement will come at
season's end. In 1997, he said he would decide whether to stay in
the Bronx or to move to Manhattan or New Jersey after that year's
mayoral election. The following year, he said a decision would come
after the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But as Steinbrenner weighs his options, much of the rest of New
York has come to the conclusion that he is really down to only two:
staying in the Bronx in a renovated Yankee Stadium or in a new
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rationale for leaving the Bronx has been eliminated,''
said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at
New York University. ``Now the question is, how do you stay in the
Bronx and keep George happy?''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of building a new ballpark for the team on
Manhattan's West Side has all but evaporated, as has the chance, at
least for now, of shifting the team to New Jersey, many
politicians, urban scholars and New York City and state officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, 69, has spent much of the decade publicly
bemoaning what he says are the high rate of crime in the Bronx,
inadequate parking and nightmarish traffic around Yankee Stadium,
and the failure of Yankee fans to turn out in sufficient numbers
for home games.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 3.2 million people attended games at Yankee
Stadium last season, a record for the team that has won more world
championships than any other. And Gov. George Pataki, who controls
the site on the West Side that has long been considered a potential
future home for the Yankees, has said unequivocally that he wants
the team to remain in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corp.,
the state's economic development arm, said the season attendance
figures may prove decisive for Steinbrenner. ``George saw the fans
come out in large numbers, and all indications are that he will
stay in the Bronx,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Tese offered his long-term perspective, predicting that
the Yankees will move to Macombs Dam Park, the city park beside
Yankee Stadium, where a new ballpark might rise. Tese was chairman
of the state development corporation in 1993 when Mario Cuomo, then
the governor, first suggested the West Side to Steinbrenner. ``He's
tried to get into Manhattan for years,'' Tese said, ``but that's
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Steinbrenner's most ardent ally _ Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani _ talks any longer about what had once been a pet idea:
building a $1 billion enclosed stadium for the Yankees above a
railroad yard on the West Side, between 30th and 33rd Streets and
10th and 12th Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Without publicly acknowledging that the Manhattan alternative
was dead, the mayor demonstrated his own sense of how far the
political pendulum had swung when he proposed last January to use
the site for a new football stadium to lure the Jets back from New
Jersey. He never mentioned any baseball use of the site when he
made the surprise football proposal in his annual State of the City
address.
</P>
<P>
   Any lingering doubts about the mayor's intentions were erased
during the early morning of Oct. 28, when he stood with
Steinbrenner in the Yankees' clubhouse at the Stadium, basking in
the glow of their 25th World Series victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place becomes even more hallowed ground,'' said the
mayor, a lifelong Yankee fan. ``You think about all the baseball
history made in this place. It means this location becomes even
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that meant the Yankees would stay put, Giuliani
said, ``I think they will.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Steinbrenner's spokesman had said he would
decide the Yankees' future once the team's merger with the Nets was
completed. That occurred two weeks ago. Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, declined requests for an interview, but through
the spokesman he insisted that all options remained open.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium saga has spanned 12 years, time enough for
Steinbrenner to hire seven managers, return from a banishment from
baseball, nearly sell 70 percent of the team to Cablevision, beg
the forgiveness of Yogi Berra for firing him as his manager in
1985, play postgame traffic cop to investigate jam-ups on the Major
Deegan Expressway, resuscitate Darryl Strawberry's career and win
three World Series in four years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The stadium issue turned into a political minefield last year
when the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who was running
for governor, tried to place a referendum on the November ballot
that would have kept the city from spending money for a new stadium
anywhere but in the Bronx. Aware that polls showed Vallone's
referendum would be approved overwhelmingly, the mayor blocked
Vallone by placing minor revisions to the City Charter on the
ballot, knocking off the stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner stepped into the fray. ``If you single me out,''
Steinbrenner warned Vallone, ``you sure as hell are going to lose
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many elected officials say now that Steinbrenner and the mayor
failed to build broad public support for the West Side plan. ``I
told Steinbrenner that the West Side had no chance if it's
discussed in a political context,'' said Cuomo, who bemoans the
idea's fate. ``We should have spent a year developing answers to
every legitimate question, then go to the public and discuss it
issue by issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is obviously delighted with the outcome. ``The
cockamamie idea to go to Manhattan is dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear when or how the Yankees' long-range
plans will be resolved. Steinbrenner rarely talks in public about
his intentions, and even the mayor is not saying much these days.
Giuliani's spokeswoman declined several requests to answer
questions about the stadium.

   Howard Rubenstein, Steinbrenner's spokesman, insists that all
options are still being weighed and says Steinbrenner is also
awaiting a $3 million city-financed study on the Bronx and
Manhattan sites. ``We're still looking at the West Side,''
Rubenstein said. ``It has many pluses.''  &QL; 
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many city and state officials suspect that Steinbrenner intends
to wait everyone out to obtain the best possible deal for his team.
But the risk for Steinbrenner is that he might miss his moment;
some current and former government officials think he already has.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Steinbrenner is more focused on negotiating a new
cable television deal for the Yankees, which would succeed a $486
million contract with the MSG Network that spans 12 years and
expires after next season, according to a business associate.
``He's been saying, `This TV thing has to get done,''' the
associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner could further delay choosing his stadium site _ and
perhaps try to build support for the West Side _ by exercising the
first of two five-year options to extend his current Yankee Stadium
lease, from 2003 to 2007.
</P>
<P>
   But time may not be on Steinbrenner's side. He might have only
one more year to conclude a long-term deal with Giuliani, a
cheerleader who often wears the familiar blue Yankee cap and
jacket. Giuliani is expected to run for the U.S. Senate, and if
victorious he would leave as mayor in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's decision to seek higher office means the stadium
is no longer on the front burner,'' said Moss of NYU. ``His term is
expiring before the Yankees' lease. The options have been taken
from the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing an expensive deal during a Senate race to keep the
Yankees in the Bronx could carry political risks for Giuliani,
political analysts said. But there might be some political
advantage, too, because of the large Hispanic population in the
Bronx, said Norman Adler, a political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a third risk to Steinbrenner's biding his time: The
city's economy cannot stay robust forever, and a recession could
turn munificent public financing for a stadium into an unaffordable
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's delays have slowed the Mets' plans to build a new
ballpark next to Shea Stadium. The team unveiled a design for a
$500 million stadium in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' deal has not advanced very far. ``Nothing has
prevented Rudy from making a deal with the Mets first,'' said City
Councilman Walter McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat. ``It might have
given the city leverage with George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Steinbrenner's friends are unsure why he has not decided.
Some speculate that he has been hesitating because he does not want
to be remembered as the traitor who took the Yankees out of the
Bronx; others assume that by not deciding, he somehow keeps his
options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, I thought he knew what he wanted,'' said a friend. ``Now
I don't.''

 USWeb Ready to Merge With Chicago Firm  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco's USWeb/CKS, a Web consulting company, will merge
with Chicago's Whittman-Hart, a business-to-business technology
specialist, in a stock swap that creates an $11.7 billion
full-service Internet firm.
<P>
   Shares of Whittman-Hart plunged $24.75 to close at $54.50 on the
announcement, while shares of USWeb/CKS sank $7.06 to $43.81 amid
concerns that USWeb/CKS already faces the challenge of absorbing
two separate, earlier acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the integration is going to be a challenge,'' said
William Loomis, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker. ``There are
still a lot of unanswered questions. But the concept of a large,
full-service company in this fast-growing market is a very good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which has not yet been named, will be the
largest consulting firm in the United States to focus exclusively
on the Internet. The goal is to combine Whittman-Hart's
business-to-business expertise with USWeb/CKS' consumer focus to
handle a broad range of client needs.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb/CKS specializes in Web site development and management of
consumer e-commerce transactions. Its clients include
Williams-Sonoma Inc. and FAO Schwartz. The company merged with CKS,
a technology-oriented advertising agency, a year ago to bolster its
creative services. It moved from Santa Clara to San Francisco's
Multimedia Gulch this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whittman-Hart is known for developing and managing back-end
operations, including inventory control and supply ordering, for
midsize companies, such as American General Finance and Diners
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly complementary fit,'' said Robert Shaw, the
chief executive and chairman of USWeb/ CKS, who will be chairman of
the new company. ``We can focus our efforts on solving business
problems from the consumer through the supply chain and back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The merged entity will have more than 8,000 employees and more
than 70 offices in 13 countries. It's headquarters will be in
Chicago, but it will maintain USWeb/CKS's 1,000-member staff in San
Francisco, as well as its Santa Clara and Cupertino offices.
Combined revenues in the third quarter totaled $297 million.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb/CKS shareholders will receive 0.865 shares of
Whittman-Hart for each USWeb/CKS share. That will leave USWeb/CKS
stockholders with 57 percent of the company and Whitman-Hart
investors with 43 percent. The deal is expected to become final in
the spring, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bernard, Whittman-Hart's president and chief executive, will
be CEO of the combined business. Whittman-Hart Chief Financial
Officer Bert Young will be CFO, and USWeb/CKS Chief Operating
Officer Robert Clarkson will be COO.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member board will be composed of four directors from
each company, plus an additional director who has not yet been
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some securities analysts downgraded their ratings on USWeb/CKS
and Whittman-Hart yesterday, noting that the San Francisco company
is still absorbing CKS and a smaller business-to-business firm,
Mitchell Madison, which it acquired in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they've got a huge merger with another company,'' said
Drake Johnson, an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. who lowered his
rating on USWeb/CKS to ``hold'' from ``accumulate.'' ``That just
complicates the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson said he expects his concerns to be short term.
``I think the combined entity could be a pretty powerful player in
the Net space going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the expense of USWeb/CKS's earlier acquisitions,
Johnson projected a net loss for USWeb/CKS this year of $203.3
million on &UR;  &LR; revenues of $507.5 million even before yesterday's
announcement. Johnson did not expect USWeb/CKS to become profitable
until the fourth quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Whittman-Hart is profitable. Hambrecht &AMP; Quist analyst Dirk
Godsey is projecting a 1999 net income of $35 million on revenues
of $470 million.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey, who maintains buy ratings on both stocks, called
acquisition-powered growth ``a perfectly good strategy'' that has
been just as successful among Internet professional services
companies as organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Pending regulatory and shareholder approval, the merger is
expected to be complete in April 2000.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Gene-Spliced Food Protested  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials heard sharply divergent
views about the safety of genetically engineered foods during a
daylong public hearing in Oakland yesterday.
<P>
   Biotechnology industry advocates and many academic scientists
argued that gene-splicing techniques give farmers a powerful tool
to grow more and better crops. But opponents raised fears that the
technique might create mutant foods capable of causing allergies in
humans, or harming beneficial insects and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland was actually host to two _ very different _ public
debates on the issue. In a plush auditorium, safe behind the metal
detectors at the Federal Building, two dozen invited experts on all
sides of the issue spent several hours politely agreeing to
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the plaza outside, several hundred protesters
carrying butterfly posters and munching organic salads chanted,
``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Frankenfoods have got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's event was the last of three public hearings the FDA
has held nationwide about whether it needs to institute stricter
safety tests and mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods.
Since the first genetically modified foods went on the market in
the early 1990s, more than 43 different altered plant varieties
have been approved for sale, ranging from 12 types of corn to one
gene-spliced radicchio. Currently, about half of the U.S. soybean
crop and a third of the corn crop are genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   FDA Deputy Commissioner Sharon Smith Holston, who presided over
the hearing, did not say what, if any, action her agency might
take.
</P>
<P>
   But with one congressional bill already pending to require
mandatory labeling and European countries refusing to import
genetically modified products, activists think the tide is turning
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see how the FDA can just do nothing,'' said Marnie
Glickman, political director of Organic Consumer's Association in
Washington, D.C., one of the organizers of yesterday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the auditorium, the crux of the expert debate was whether
genetic engineering is simply an extension of traditional plant
breeding practices, or whether DNA splicing represents a radically
new technique that demanded more safety studies than foods grown
the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Davis Professor Calvin Qualset, a
seed expert, argued the view of the scientific majority that
bio-engineering is faster, and at least as safe, as traditional
plant-breeding techniques, in which similar crops are mated in
hopes of transferring traits, like disease resistance, from one
plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   Qualset said genetic engineering allows plant breeders to splice
a specific gene into the target plant with greater precision than
hit-or-miss pollen transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the risk is very low and the benefit is very high, I say go
for it,'' Qualset said, adding, ``We'll all go hungry pretty soon
if we wait for every possible test to be done on every modified
crop.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Regal, an ecology professor at the University of
Minnesota, argued that genetic engineering is a radical technique,
demanding additional safety tests, because it allows scientists to
splice genes from bacteria, fish or other organisms into plants _
something that could never have been done by pollen transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked one company out of splicing spider venom into corn,''
said Regal, adding that the novelty of genetic techniques makes
them prone to ``unexpected surprises'' that might cause new
allergies in humans or mutations in wild plants, if pollen from
altered crops jumps over to weeds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arguments about safety testing, speakers sparred
over whether the FDA should require labeling of genetically
modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hefle, an allergy expert at University of
Nebraska-Lincoln, said there is no evidence that genetically
modified foods have caused any spike in allergies.
</P>
<P>
   But John Fagan, chief scientist at an Iowa company, Genetic ID,
that tests foods for genetic alterations, said that without labels,
doctors could not know whether a person who had never been allergic
to corn, for instance, might have developed a reaction to a
genetically modified variety.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said companies such as his routinely test U.S. exports
before they are shipped to nations that demand labeling. ``The
American food industry is already doing it for Europe and Japan,
they're just not doing it for U.S. consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Betancourt, a cotton farmer from California's Central
Valley, said he came to the hearing to argue against such labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perception becomes reality,'' Betancourt said. ``Mandatory
labeling would be an automatic question mark thrown up over
legitimate products'' by implying they were somehow more risky than
other foods.
</P>
<P>
   Betancourt was among some 90 speakers who registered in advance
to testify during the public comment period at the end of the day.
FDA officials, who said they sorted the requests to ensure a
balance of views, gave each speaker two minutes at the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., attorney William MacLeod, who spoke on behalf
of a group called Alliance for Better Foods, which is financed by
farmers and major food companies like Kraft, said the FDA and other
federal agencies have conducted tests on genetically engineered
food and have deemed it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been changing food since the Pilgrims,'' MacLeod said.
``No one would recognize an ear of corn that the Pilgrims had 300
years ago. The difference today is that it's more precise and more
regulated than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Metz, a graduate student in plant biology at the University
of California at Berkeley, used his two minutes to urge the FDA to
reform, not reject, genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see labeling as one way for industry to show its confidence
that these products are safe,'' said Metz, who was part of a small
band of professors and students from Bay Area universities who
spent the day handing out flyers offering a middle ground on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to genetically modified foods was among the issues
that provoked rioting at the trade conference in Seattle, but aside
from harsh rhetoric about ``corporate coups'' at the FDA, the
several hundred protesters outside the Federal Building conducted a
peaceful rally as Oakland and federal police kept a discreet
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Leigh, 44, of Fort Bragg sat on a blanket as she passed
out naturally grown bread as well as blue and sweet corn to
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to remind people that food comes from the earth
and from people's hearts,'' Leigh said. ``We are here to work with
nature, not against it _ and we need to remember who's the boss
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Caplan, an environmental advocate with CalPIRG (the
California Public Interest Research Group), said, ``We want to make
sure that food is proven to be safe before it goes to market.''

 Market Developing Quickly for Digital Photo Printing  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The online photo finishing industry has had a big month.
<P>
   Yesterday, Berkeley's Ofoto launched an e-commerce site,
www.ofoto.com, where digital camera owners can upload images and
arrange to have prints made and sent to friends and family's
doorsteps. It is at least the third company in the Bay Area to
offer such services. And there are sure to be more.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mountain View's View-based &LR;   &LR; PhotoAccess.com
launched a similar site. And along with 35-employee Ofoto, Redwood
Shores' Shutterfly.com yesterday unveiled its Web finishing
service.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies are trying to cash in on the surging number
of digital cameras on the market and what they hope is the
accompanying desire to make high-quality prints. Digital cameras,
which have been dropping dramatically in price over the past
several months, are expected to be a hot seller this holiday season
and beyond. Some of the cameras cost under $200; others run into
the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that this is going to be a big Christmas
for digital cameras, so (Web finishers) have to start getting in
front of the public and the influencers and the resellers now,''
said Alexis Gerard, president of Future Image Inc., a San Mateo
firm that tracks the digital photo market.
</P>
<P>
   While all three Web photo finishers share one strategy _ they
each eschew advertising-based revenue _ each says it outshines the
competition with key differences. Shutterfly emphasizes that it
develops the images itself; PhotoAccess out-sources outsources &LR; 
 &LR; its developing to an ``established'' East Coast processor. And
Ofoto is offering free finishing to its first million customers.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether consumers embrace the virtual
Fotomat idea, stick to the brick-and-morter store or wait until
printer technology advances far enough to produce 35mm-quality
prints at home.
</P>
<P>
   James Joaquin, Ofoto president and CEO, is betting that just
about all photography will shift online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharing nature of photography, the fact that it's about
friends and family, is such a natural tie-in with the Web, where
you can purchase and send prints to people,'' he said. ''I think
that the convenience benefit will prevail.''

 Andersen Joins Venture Capital Stampede  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Joining the e-commerce investment stampede, management consulting
heavyweight Andersen Consulting said yesterday that it is creating
a venture capital division that plans to invest up to $1 billion in
Internet startups over the next five years.
<P>
   Half the money will come from the consulting firm's profits, the
other $500 million from unidentified VC firms and investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen is headquartered in Chicago but its VC operation will
be based in Palo Alto and headed by Jackson Wilson, previously
managing partner for Andersen's global markets.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting already has more than 140 venture
investments and alliances with dot-com companies. During Over &LR;   &LR; the
past three years, it has invested $40 million in with &LR;   &LR; several of
them, with impressive results.
</P>
<P>
   Its $3 million investment in Siebel Systems is worth ``north of
$500 million,'' according to Wilson. Andersen also has stakes in
Covation, a joint venture with Bank of America to provide
e-commerce solutions to the health care industry; ChemConnect, the
Internet's largest global chemicals and plastics exchange; and Blue
Martini, which provides merchandising software for online
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided it was time to stop messing around as if this were
a hobby and get really serious,'' said Wilson. Andersen Consulting
Ventures will turn some of its own consultants into full-time
venture capitalists and also hire outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the office in Palo Alto, Wilson plans to open
branches in New York or Boston, Atlanta or Austin, one in Europe
and one in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Andersen Consulting Ventures expects to have 40
to 50 people investing in and helping manage high-tech ventures.
Andersen hopes to back some of its 62,000 employees who have have
entrepreneurial visions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson conceded that there are potential conflicts of interest
if its consulting arm is giving advice to a client that competes
with a company Andersen's VC division is backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like other venture capital firms, we don't intend to invest in
companies which compete with each other or our large global 1,000
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the company already has firewalls to prevent
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting is part of Anderson Worldwide, which also
owns the Andersen accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting's commitment is impressive but it is hardly
the first consultant or company to barge into VC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is getting into the fray,'' said Jesse Reyes,
director of Venture Economics, a Newark, N.J., research unit of
Securities Data Co. There are easily 200 to 300 companies that do
venture investing, in part to gain access to new technologies as
well as make investment gains. ``I would say Andersen's interest is
more speculative than strategic,'' said Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, venture capital firms have invested close to $40
billion in Internet and other companies. Wealthy individual and
corporate investors have invested billions more. In the third
quarter, Venture Economics reports that corporate investors poured
$724.5 million into 181 companies, led by Intel Corp.'s $123
million investment in 18 private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several huge new  &LR; VC funds are popping up each week. In the past
two weeks alone, Accel Partners of Palo Alto said it is raising
$600 million for two new funds, including $120 million from a few
dozen top executives and corporations. Draper Fisher Jurvetson of
Redwood City said it is teaming up with a new investment firm
called meVC.com to create a $500 million venture capital fund for
the masses. Individual contributions could be as little as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   NeoCarta Ventures of San Francisco and Cambridge, Mass.,
announced a new $275 million fund. And two ex-49ers have started
the first Champions Ventures $40 million fund for professional
athletes

 Prudential Snaps Up Volpe Brown  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Volpe Brown Whelan, a San Francisco investment bank specializing in
public stock offerings for young computer and Internet companies,
announced its sale yesterday to Prudential Securities for an
undisclosed price.
<P>
   The cash purchase, which took effect yesterday, makes privately
held Volpe Brown the latest in a long line of local securities
firms that have sold out amid a white-hot market for
technology-oriented investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimated that Prudential paid $250 million to $300
million for the firm, based on Volpe Brown's projected 1999 revenue
of roughly $115 million and the fact that most securities firms are
being sold for about two times their revenues. That estimated price
is more than twice what the firm was worth two years ago, when
Credit Suisse First Boston bought a 25 percent stake for a reported
$25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential, owned by the giant insurance company of the same
name, is the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, with 6,700
brokers and more than 1.2 million retail account holders. But its
investment banking division is an also-ran, a position it hopes to
change by snapping up Volpe Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe Brown officials said they sold the firm to get access to
Prudential's broad network of brokers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, as legal barriers between the banking and securities
industries tumbled, San Francisco's big three investment banks,
Montgomery Securities, Robertson Stephens and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,
all sold out to giant commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest sale, the only remaining independent investment
banks in San Francisco are the year-old Thomas Weisel Partners,
founded by the former chief executive of Montgomery Securities;
Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, which provides research on
and merger advice to securities and money management firms; and a
couple of upstart firms that sell stock principally on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe Brown has led or co-managed 45 public stock offerings this
year, ranking it 26th nationally among investment banks in the
dollar value of its stock offerings, according to CommScan, a Wall
Street data firm. Prudential ranked 20th, with 61 stock offerings
led or co-managed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is now called Prudential Volpe Technology Group,
combining Volpe Brown's investment banking and research staff with
Prudential's small technology investment banking unit. Senior Volpe
Brown partners, including chief executive Thomas Volpe, will
continue to run the unit, and the new owner will be ``very light
handed'' in overseeing the operation, Prudential chief executive
Wick Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe Brown is cutting an unspecified but ``relatively small''
number of jobs as a result of the takeover, founder and chief
executive Thomas Volpe said. The firm employs about 220 people in
San Francisco, Boston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When securities firms are bought, the big danger is losing star
analysts and investment bankers. Prudential is offering bonuses to
staff members who stay with the new firm, officials said, but
defections are still possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fair amount of human capital risk in these deals,''
said Putnam, Lovell analyst Dean Eberling.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe Brown sought a buyer because boutique investment banks are
having a tough time competing against large rivals, Volpe said.
Large firms have big sales staffs that can easily distribute stock
from public offerings to a broad mix of institutional and retail
investors, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an independent firm, it gets increasingly difficult,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Simmons said they are trying to win more lead-manager
assignments in stock offerings for the new unit. Lead managers,
which coordinate offerings, collect bigger fees than co-managers,
which have fewer responsibilities. So far this year, Volpe Brown
has led only three relatively small offerings, while Prudential has
led 15 offerings, according to CommScan.

 Ad Agencies Scuttle Planned Union  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Citron Haligman Bedecarre, the largest independent advertising
agency in San Francisco, has called off its planned union with New
York's Euro RSCG Worldwide.
<P>
   The two companies said in February that Euro RSCG, owned by the
conglomerate Havas Advertising of Paris, would buy a majority stake
in CHB.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past 10 months, CHB has shifted its strategy,
deciding to focus on dot-com clients that want a fast-moving,
locally based agency and don't need Euro RSCG's vast international
resources, said Tom Bedecarre, CHB's chairman, in an interview
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about our direction versus their direction,'' said
Bedecarre. ``There's a shift that we think we can take advantage of
by remaining independent.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Bedecarre described an acquisition as
``inevitable,'' saying his agency needed international capabilities
in order to grow. CHB had held discussions with several suitors
over the years and was eager to be acquired, according to sources.
But the dot-com gold rush changed CHB's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   CHB's billings will hit $200 million this year, about double the
1997 and 1998 numbers, said Bedecarre. Twenty staffers have been
added since February, bringing the agency's total to 85. All of the
growth is attributable to technology clients, which include
Women.com and Goodhome.com, he said.
</P>
<P>
   CHB and Euro RSCG tried for several months to find an
alternative partnership structure, but were unable to come to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A Euro RSCG executive who declined to be named confirmed
Bedecarre's version of events, saying the split was mutual. ``We've
had discussions over the past several months and finally concluded
that we have too many differences,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisition were never disclosed. The deal was
officially terminated last week and Euro RSCG was expected to make
an announcement soon. Neither party will pay a break-up fee or
other penalty, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Euro RSCG, meanwhile, is no longer trying to buy a San Francisco
agency that specializes in traditional consumer products, as CHB
did until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company will devote more attention to a San
Francisco offshoot, the recently renamed Aka Euro RSCG. (cq) &LR;   &LR; That
agency, formerly known as Cohn &AMP; Wells, has historically
specialized in direct marketing. ``They're evolving and we're
focusing on them,'' the Euro RSCG source said.
</P>
<P>
   Euro RSCG operates 176 offices in 72 countries. Havas, its
parent, is the fifth-largest advertising company in the world.

 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Can you recommend an Internet Web site where I can find the best
available yields from bank certificates of deposit?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Try www.bankrate.com, maintained by Bank Rate Monitor and
Intelligent Life Corp., a publishing company based in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After you get on the site, you will find a long menu along the
left side of your computer screen. Click on the entry for ``Savings
_ CDs.'' Then, click again to find the best yields nationwide on
CDs with investment periods ranging from one month to five years.
You can scan the 25 best rates for each time period.
</P>
<P>
   The site provides not only the yields but also the minimum
required deposits and how often the interest is compounded.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for the best rates state by state _ for example,
if you only want to do business with banks located in California.
There also are subentries that compare rates entirely within the
Bay Area or any other region that interests you.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this same information appears Mondays on the Data Bank
page of The Chronicle's Business section.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Checking It Out Overseas &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was following the stock of Nielsen Media Research and
suddenly it dropped out of sight. I'm an online investor and don't
know where else to turn for information about this company. Can you
help me?
</P>
<P>
   A: You must not have been following it very closely.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Dutch publisher VNU made a well-publicized
announcement that it would buy Nielsen _ the New York company
famous for TV ratings _ for close to $3 billion in cash. Nielsen's
stock then stopped trading after the deal was consummated in
October.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in VNU, you can buy or sell it over the
counter as an American Depositary Receipt _ the form in which
overseas companies are traded on U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   VNU's principal business is the publication of regional
newspapers and mass-circulation magazines. The newly acquired
Nielsen accounts for roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of the
company's $3 billion-plus revenues.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also like to respond to your throwaway line about being an
online investor _ and, therefore, supposedly helpless.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why you can't do your own investment
research, online or offline. There are countless
securities-research sites online _ such as Yahoo (www.yahoo.com)
and Motley Fool (www.fool.com) _ that will provide you with a
boundless supply of financial news, opinions and data. Also, there
are likely to be abundant investment resources at any large public
library in your area.
</P>
<P>
   There may even be a research section on your broker's Web site.
There certainly is if you deal with one of the more prominent
online brokers, such as Schwab, Fidelity or E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Check it out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; When an IRA Is Excluded &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I worked abroad and qualified for the foreign income
exclusion on my tax form. I plan to report a $65,000 salary on
Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 but will exclude all $65,000 _
because it is foreign income _ on Form 2555, leaving a total income
of zero. Am I eligible to make a $2,000 contribution to a Roth IRA?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. You cannot make a contribution of any size to a Roth, nor
can you contribute to any other type of IRA.
</P>
<P>
   According to IRS spokesman Jesse Weller, tax law stipulates that
you may only contribute to an IRA if you have wages or other
personal-service income that cannot be excluded from U.S. taxes.
You had wages, but because they were earned abroad, they are not
taxable here.
</P>
<P>
   If you had U.S.-taxable income from wages and personal services,
you could have made IRA contributions up to the total amount of
that income or $2,000, whichever was less.

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a year and a half after buying the nation's premier
publishing house, the Bertelsmann media conglomerate is poised to
form a partnership with an American icon of popular literature,
Time Inc.'s Book-of-the-Month Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann _ which is based in Gutersloh, Germany, and
purchased Random House last year _ is negotiating to create a joint
venture that could bring together the two largest book clubs in the
United States, the Book-of-the-Month Club and Bertelsmann's
Literary Guild, according to publishing executives who asked to
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Both clubs have been pondering how to compete against online
booksellers in a book market radically changed from the days when
judges made Book-of-the-Month Club selections over sherry that had
the power to spread literary culture to readers isolated far from
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's Doubleday Direct, of which the Literary Guild is a
part, has been negotiating with Time Inc. for more than six weeks
in an effort to strike a deal this month.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides have not reached an agreement yet on the
financial terms or determined which company would operate the club,
according to publishing executives close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have made tentative plans to create a six-member
board presiding over the joint venture that will be evenly divided
between executives of Bertelsmann and Time Warner, Time Inc.'s
corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Bertelsmann and Time Inc. refused to discuss the
negotiations. ``We are declining politely, but firmly, to
comment,'' said Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc. Liz
Young, a U.S. spokeswoman for Bertelsmann, also would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, one publishing executive familiar with the negotiations
said that a joint venture would enable the two book clubs to cut
costs by sharing ``back end functions'' such as distribution and
warehousing. The problem is that book club sales growth has been
hurt by ``a couple of factors, most prominently online book
sales,'' he said. ``In the case of the Book-of-the-Month-Club,
they've really been struggling over the last couple of years, so
this is an opportunity to put some operational systems together.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fierce competition obviously did not exist when the
Book-of-the-Month Club's founder, Harry Scherman, invented the book
club in the United States in 1926 with a gimmick that relied on a
literary stamp of approval from experts like Heywood Broun and
Christopher Morley, who selected the best new books for a reading
public hungry for literature.
</P>
<P>
   The general book club strategy has been to entice a reader with
promotional offers like a four-book purchase for $2 if the customer
agrees to buy a specified number of other titles at regular prices.
For readers living far from a bookstore, the system offered a
convenient alternative. But with the rise of online bookselling and
instant purchases at the click of a computer mouse, book clubs in
the late 1990s were forced to offer something more than discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous costs in finding new members,'' said
Albert N. Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham
University who tracks book publishing. ``If these two clubs could
cut down on their promotion and mailing costs they could save a lot
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s consolidation narrowed the chief players in the
book club business to three companies, Bertelsmann's Doubleday
Direct, Time Inc.'s Book-of-the-Month Club and Rodale Press' &UR;  &LR; six
holdings, including the health-oriented Prevention Book Club. To
counter online competition, the book clubs refined their marketing
techniques and promoted their ability to filter choice books on
specialty topics for harried readers who did not have the time to
do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Book-of-the-Month Club sells general hardcover titles, but
it also includes eight other clubs that offer books in niche
markets like the One Spirit Christian Book Club or the History Book
Club. Together all of the clubs have a combined membership of 4.5
million members, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Book-of-the-Month Club's revenues were estimated
at about $280 million, roughly comparable to the revenues of
Doubleday Direct. Doubleday says it has a membership list of 4.8
million with book clubs that include the Literary Guild, as well as
a collection of other smaller clubs like the fast-growing Christian
club, Crossings, and a children's book club.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statistics from the Association of American
Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their
own, but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as
online booksellers. Mail order companies like Readers Digest that
have suffered from a free fall in sales, which have plunged as much
as 20 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the year through October, net sales for book clubs had
reached $950 million, an increase of 4.5 percent over the
comparable period a year earlier. Last year, with $1.2 billion in
book club sales, that category accounted for 5.4 percent of the
total $22 billion book market that includes consumer books,
textbooks, and professional titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann also has a substantial stake in the online business,
with a 40 percent interest in Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tentative plans, Bertelsmann and Time Inc. will allow
the two literary clubs to remain in their present locations with
separate identities _ the Book-of-the-Month Club in Manhattan and
the Literary Guild in Garden City, N.Y. &QL;

 Breakthrough Year Predicted for Small-Cap Stocks  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Don't hold your breath, but 2000 could be the year when the stocks
of smaller and midsize companies once again outperform the giants.
<P>
   Many market experts have been wrongly predicting such a turn of
events for years. It hasn't happened since 1993, but it has to
happen again sometime _ doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A few, brave market watchers still think so.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle surveyed nine experts about the stock market
outlook for 2000. A frequent _ though not unanimous _ refrain was
that economic conditions seem ripe for a superior performance by
the market's perennial also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of economies around the globe _ especially in Asia
_ should provide grand, new opportunities for lesser U.S. companies
that have been overshadowed by the big-name multinationals. Or so
the reasoning goes.
</P>
<P>
   The experts surveyed by The Chronicle _ market strategists,
financial advisers, money managers, economists, analysts and
publishers _ also focused intently on the prospects for technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even after this year's humongous 60-plus percent gain in the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, scarcely anyone dares suggest
that tech won't lead the overall market again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks are a different matter. Nearly all the experts
are bothered by what they call the Internet ``bubble'' _ the
multibillion-dollar market values assigned to Internet-related
companies with scant revenues and, in most cases, no earnings.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the survey predicted that the bubble will grow much
bigger in the coming year. Some expect it to burst.
</P>
<P>
   Readers should bear in mind that predicting the stock market is
a perilous exercise at best, and that nothing that follows should
necessarily be accepted as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   When The Chronicle surveyed a panel of experts a year ago, most
of them thought the market would perform weakly during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They cited such concerns as the global financial crisis, with
its dire threat of deflation (remember?), and the uncertainty over
President Clinton's political fate (ha!). Several thought the
market would go into a sinking spell in November and December as
Y2K and its computer problem loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding all that timidity, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index _ the principal standard of investment performance _ shows a
handsome gain of close to 18 percent so far this year (including
reinvestment of dividends). The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial
average has been even more buoyant, gaining 26 percent year to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the predictions for 2000, edited for space and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Alfred Goldman &LR; , market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son, St.
Louis:
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy will remain healthy, with corporate earnings up
about 12 percent. Inflation will remain benign _ maybe 21/2
percent. That will help the stock market, and there also is a
growing global demand for stocks _ more demand than supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth of the market _ the number of stocks doing well _
is going to improve, because a lot of companies will benefit from
economic recoveries in Japan, the rest of Asia, Latin America and
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No.1 sector is technology. My favorites are Applied
Materials, Intel and Cisco Systems (which gives you exposure to the
Internet game). They are all dominant factors in dynamic growth
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the retail sector, I like Gap and Wal-Mart. Retail is going
to do well. Consumers are working and making money _ there is low
unemployment _ and Gap and Wal-Mart have proven growth records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would warn against any company that needs to rely on price
increases to grow its earnings, because there is no price
flexibility in this economy. Forget about any commodity-type
company, precious metals, restaurants and supermarkets.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Stewart J. Pillette &LR; , Pillette Investment Management, San
Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to make the year 2000 different is that the
market will be broadening out. We follow 3,400 companies, of which
85 percent have market capitalizations below $5 billion. Most of
those companies, especially manufacturers, will be major
beneficiaries of a global recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of stocks like Autodesk, DST Systems, Mitel,
Mohawk Industries, Ashland, Alberto-Culver. And other types of
companies will piggyback on their success: banks, insurance
companies and a host of other service companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk in the market right now is the Internet stock
bubble. I'm very worried about that. A few of those companies have
earnings, but Amazon, for example, doesn't have earnings or even a
business plan. People are buying Internet stocks because they are
up, which is not a good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Joe Turner &LR; , money manager, San Ramon:
</P>
<P>
   ``The big opportunity lies in the stocks that have performed
poorly this year. I can see a reversal of this year's roles, where
the big companies, the tech stocks and the Internet stocks _ which
are absurdly overvalued _ pull back and have a year of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go through the list of stocks that are down significantly this
year, but have quality businesses, good dividend yields,
significant buying of shares by insiders or buying back of shares
by the companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups that fit this profile include real estate
investment trusts, utilities, managed-care companies, home builders
_ especially those in the manufactured-homes business, such as
Fleetwood, Cavalier and Clayton. Also, brick-and-mortar retailers,
such as Penney, Claire's Stores and Dillards. Then there's
fertilizer, which is really mundane, but there has been tremendous
insider buying. Take a look at Potash and IMC Global.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Gary Schlossberg &LR; , economist, Wells Capital Management, San
Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect more gains in the stock market next year, but more
moderate than what we are seeing this year _ probably a gain in the
mid-single digits for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. There's not enough
earnings momentum to push stocks higher than that, and there
probably will be no help from interest rates, which are likely to
either hold steady or move up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the big, mega-cap growth stocks should continue
to do better than the smaller companies through the better part of
2000. This is not to suggest that you put all your eggs in that
basket, but with more moderate earnings growth overall, investors
place a premium on reliable earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation and restructuring are going to continue to shape
corporate performance _ not only here, but also abroad. Overseas,
they are behind us in restructuring, so overseas stocks could be
more attractive as restructuring comes on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Steve Janachowski &LR; , Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski, Tiburon:
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming a relatively benign economic environment, we're
focused on four major areas: financials, pharmaceuticals,
technology and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financials haven't done particularly well this year because
interest rates have gone up, but new legislation is expected to
free up the financial-service industry to move into profitable new
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceuticals will benefit from the aging Baby Boomer
population, while technology is a hot story that will continue, and
telecommunications will benefit by providing infrastructure for the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Todd Bakar &LR; , director of research, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, San
Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has had an awesome year in 1999 _ particularly the
Internet and communications stocks _ but despite the big price
moves, this will continue to be an interesting area going forward.
This is where the innovation is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business-to-business operations on the Internet have been red
hot. A lot of companies in this area have good fundamentals, like
Agile Software, Critical Path, Verisign and Vignette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another area to watch is mobile communications. Whether your
cellular phone becomes more intelligent, or your pager, or palm
computer, the goal will be to access information, trade stocks,
search up restaurant directories _ to do more things in mobile form
that you've only been able to do at your desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In wireless, I like Nokia and Motorola. The growth on the
whole cellular and wireless front will remain explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Marshall Acuff &LR; , market strategist, Salomon Smith Barney, New
York:
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 will be another up year for the market, but
there are going to be more head winds than there were this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, the market had to contend with rising interest
rates, and we're probably going to see even higher rates during
2000, with the Fed raising them by perhaps another half percentage
point. Another head wind is that profit growth will slow to about 8
percent next year from about 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not whether the market will be up, or how
much, but is it going to broaden out? The leadership has been quite
narrow for some time. I would be more enthusiastic about the
broader market if I thought this would be a strong year for
profits. It looks as though market leadership is going to continue
to be oriented toward bigger-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like biotech companies because their productivity is rising.
Amgen is the company I would go with. It is the industry leader and
is coming forward with important new products next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A second area I like is communications technology. In
bandwidth technology I would go with MCI Worldcom, which seems
underpriced compared to its growth prospects. In wireless, Sprint
PCS seems reasonably priced, while Nokia and Qualcomm seem on the
high side.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Geraldine Weiss &LR; , publisher, Investment Quality Trends
newsletter, La Jolla (San Diego County):
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most overvalued market in history, based on every
measure of historical data we can find, such as dividend yields and
price-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology sector has been going gangbusters, and I can't
foretell when that will top out. It has been stretched to historic
limits and I would doubt that this will continue into next year _
but nobody knows.

a strategy based on fear, so we conclude that there is still a
healthy amount of fear in the market. That's a bullish sign,

a bear market.

 Stanford Embraces E-Commerce Curriculum  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Joining the growing group of business schools focusing on the
Internet, Stanford University announced yesterday that it is
opening a research center that will integrate electronic commerce
into the core MBA curriculum.
<P>
   The Center for Electronic Business and Commerce received more
than $20 million in its first round of funding, primarily from
sponsors Charles Schwab, General Atlantic Partners and eBay. The
center will serve as a library for case studies and research, and
will develop e-commerce courses for the business school.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanford doesn't plan to offer a degree specifically in
e-commerce, the university already teaches 11 courses that deal
with online business issues. A class called Electronic Commerce,
completely focused on online business, will be offered for the
first time during the Winter 2000 term.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's announcement comes at a time when MBA students are
flocking to Internet companies and MBA programs are responding with
more e-commerce-related courses. Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, Tenn., started the trend five years ago when it began
offering a concentration in e-commerce. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's e-commerce curriculum is the business school's most
popular track.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State University began offering a certificate in
electronic commerce management this summer, and San Francisco State
University said last month that it will offer a concentration in
e-commerce within its College of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Saloner, co-director of Stanford's e-commerce center, said
the center seeks to be far reaching. ``We really think that
electronic commerce is pervasive. It affects every aspect of what
we teach and do,'' Saloner said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore the center will serve as a resource for faculty
developing e-commerce case studies for classes in all business
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   True to Stanford's tradition of working with industry, another
class developed with the new center will allow students to work
directly with Silicon Valley e-commerce companies to examine
problems facing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Research at the center will take advantage of the Internet's
ability to gather consumer data. For example, one study may examine
how the buying price in an online auction is affected by factors
such as number of bidders, structure and reputation of the auction
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to become a repository for data like that, so
researchers here and elsewhere can analyze what's going on in
electronic commerce,'' Saloner said.

MCCAIN LIVENS IOWA DEBATE WITH ATTACK ON ETHANOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Defying an Iowa totem _ the corn product ethanol _
before an Iowa audience in a Republican presidential debate leading
up to the state's critical caucus next month, Sen. John McCain said
Monday night the synthetic fuel was not worthy of a federal subsidy
and should be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is not competing in the caucus, said the subsidy
amounted to a typical pork barrel project ``sneaked'' into
legislation by powerful members of Congress and should have been
exposed to competition for funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you things you want to hear,'' the
Arizona senator said, causing a stir at the outset of a discussion
between the six candidates for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   His principal adversary, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, quickly
followed by declaring his support for ethanol ``whether I'm in Iowa
or not.'' His remark elicited applause from 2,000 Republicans
watching the event in a civic center here. ``It's good for our
air,'' Bush said. ``It's reducing our dependency on foreign oil. If
I'm president I'll spend money on research and development for
agricultural research.''
</P>
<P>
   A third member of the panel, Steve Forbes, said ethanol should
continue to be funded through its current deadline in the year 2007
``and if it doesn't work out...then it ought to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Gary Bauer
and Alan Keyes, did not join the ethanol discussion but staked out
strong conservative positions on such issues as abortion, gun
control and trade.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has committed most of his resources to New Hampshire
and is not campaigning actively in Iowa, seemed to distance himself
further from the audience by challenging Bush to support the McCain
initiative to eliminate ``soft money'' from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to talk about it,'' Bush said, then seemed to put
an end to the discussion by saying nothing more. When one of the
moderators, Tom Brokaw, suggested that there was time for him to
discuss the idea further, Bush attacked the McCain measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt the Republican Party,'' Bush said. Any
assault on unregulated contributions should be coupled with
legislation which would provide ``paycheck protection'' for union
members whose dues are channeled to Democratic candidates, he said.
Embracing the McCain bill, Bush said, amounted to ``unilateral
disarmament,'' a remark which provoked more cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative group of candidates was challenged by an
opening question dealing with the role that guns, video tapes and
movies played in the massacre earlier this year at a Colorado
school by two students and whether the entertainment and weapons
industries should be watched more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than scolding the industries, Bush said, he would
initiate ``programs of faith and good will, mentoring programs and
after-school programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said the nation needed to return to ``basic moral
principles'' and return ``faith and prayer'' to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch turned the question to the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court
decision which legalized abortions and suggested that this had
contributed to the ``insanctity of life,'' perhaps more than guns
and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes blamed the Clinton-Gore administration for creating a
climate where it was difficult to make distinctions between right
and wrong. ``Prosecution for federal firearm violations are way
down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although told by a local moderator, TV newsman John Bachman,
that three of the largest denominations in Iowa called for handgun
controls, Bauer, a leader of the religious right, said: ``I think
the churches should leave to politicians the regulation of various
industries.'' He, too, intimated that laws enabling abortion
undermined the sanctity of life.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also clashed over trade issues. When Bauer
criticized Bush for favoring ``most favored nation'' trade policies
for China, the Texas governor said, ``Opening Chinese markets is
good for Iowa farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said the Chinese failed to keep their agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we let them in WTO,'' Bush said, referring to the
World Trade Organization. Turning to Bauer, he said, ``You want to
isolate the farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also refused to accept Bauer's prodding that he pledge to
name a running mate who would be dedicated to ``pro life''
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's incredibly presumptious'' to discuss vice
presidential choices, Bush said, adding that his main criterion for
a running mate would be an ability to step in and serve as
president.
</P>
<P>
   During the portion of the program in which the candidates
questioned each other, Forbes asked Bauer if the International
Monetary Fund should ``go to the political equivalent of Jurassic
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer used the opening to criticize the IMF and the WTO ``and a
lot of things the United Nations has been involved in,'' noting
that the programs had sapped US sovereignty and ``should be
reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no way to judge statewide reaction to the
debate, Bush appeared to be the audience's favorite. Though the
spectators had been cautioned not to applaud, they punctuated
several of Bush's remarks during the evening with clapping and
shouts of approval.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent polls conducted in Iowa, Bush holds a
comfortable lead over Forbes, with Bauer and McCain competing for
third place and Keyes and Hatch trailing.
</P>
<P>
   The event was sponsored by WHO-TV in Des Moines and telecast
nationally by MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the third encounter between the Republican
contestants this month, preceded by televised forums in New
Hampshire and Arizona. The final GOP debate leading up to the Jan.
24 caucus here is scheduled for Jan. 8.

CITY PLANS LAST-MINUTE COURT EFFORT TO STOP TRANSIT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 10:30 p.m. ET.) 
(mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the city began emergency operations for a transit
strike that could begin at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, negotiators on
both sides of the contract talks said there were hints of progress
Monday, although they acknowledged that the negotiations remained
snarled over wages.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani expressed skepticism about the reports of
progress in the talks. He said the city would go to court Tuesday
morning to try to stop the threatened walkout if there was no
change overnight in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But subway and bus passengers across the city reported delayed
trains and erratic service Monday, as they did last week, when a
dissident faction of the union called for a work slowdown. The
union denied any deliberate disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had planned to go to court Monday, but he said he had
backed off at the request of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, whose contract talks with Local 100 of the Transport
Workers Union have increasingly angered and frustrated him.
Giuliani has no role in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like deferring,'' Giuliani told reporters at a morning
news conference at City Hall. ``You know that. I deferred to their
judgment that the negotiations were going well.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Local 100, Willie James, told reporters that he
was encouraged by the negotiations. He would not specify what type
of progress had been made, but he said the MTA ``had come up a
bit'' and the union had ``come down a bit'' in its demands.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the MTA, Mark Shaw, said moderate
progress had been made on nonwage issues. ``It's picked up some
speed,'' he said of the talks. ``I wish it could pick up more
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA's chief negotiator, Gary Dellaverson, said some elements
involving health and pension negotiations had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani was also skeptical of the relatively positive news
that MTA officials were reporting, and said several times Monday
morning that he was hearing the opposite from ``other people'' at
the negotiating table. It was not clear whether he meant union
representatives, other MTA sources or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they say they're making progress,'' Giuliani said of
the MTA's pronouncements. ``Other sources that I have tell me that
they're not making as much progress as the MTA says they're
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor temporarily backed off from the court action,
he continued his vitriolic criticism of the union, saying that
striking transit workers ``actually kill people'' because
ambulances would be delayed in the resulting traffic jams. He also
said that the city's 33,000 bus and subway workers would be
``absolutely immoral'' if they ``try to have a whole city collapse
as a result of your desire to get a few more bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   A court injunction would be sought by the city and the MTA
together. If granted, it would order workers not to strike under
the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits walkouts by transit workers
and other government employees. If the workers violated the
injunction, they would be held in contempt of court and subjected
to what the mayor has called ``massive'' financial penalties as
well as jail time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Motivated by a potential gold mine of profits,
scientists have tried and failed for decades to duplicate the
complex genetic coding of spider silk in order to reproduce one of
the world's strongest, softest, and most flexible substances.
</P>
<P>
   So when San Francisco venture capitalist Nigel Fleming saw the
laboratory notes of a Chatham scientist who said he had succeeded,
Fleming was ecstatic. He quit his job, advanced $100,000 of his own
money to complete research, and signed on as chief executive of a
new company to rush spider silk into commercial production. Over
the next three years, he turned over $2.7 million to the scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was to be the crowning glory of my career,'' Fleming said
Monday from his San Francisco office. ``This was the most
extraordinary material in the universe, and we had it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble was that it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Glenn Elion, admitted later that he made up much
of his data in order to solicit money from unwitting investors.
According to court papers filed in connection with a federal
criminal case, Elion fleeced scientists, financiers, family, and
friends of some $3.8 million. He is scheduled to be sentenced
Tuesday in US District Court in Boston on one count of wire fraud
in connection with the case. He faces up to five years in prison
and fines of up to $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Elion could not be reached Monday. His lawyer, Robert Goldstein,
declined to comment but indicated he would present mitigating
evidence at the hearing. ``There is more to say about this case,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elion _ who has a doctorate in chemical engineering and is the
nephew of Gertrude B. Elion, who won the Nobel prize for medicine
in 1988 _ owned several companies, including a tiny winery in
Chatham and a biotech start-up, Plant Cell Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Elion developed the scam as a way
of raising money to participate in another fraudulent scheme based
in Nigeria. The documents said that Elion had received a letter
from a Nigerian man who said he had access to $25 million in US
currency. The currency was coated with a special black substance
for security purposes, the letter stated, and Elion would receive
20 percent of the currency if he would send cash to pay for
removing the black coating.
</P>
<P>
   Elion said he traveled to Nigeria, meeting a man at a hotel who
showed him a box of black-coated bills. He eventually sent at least
$700,000 to advance the scheme, much of it solicited from other
people, court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain funds for the Nigerians, Elion solicited money from
partners, friends, and family to further what he said was promising
research on producing synthetic spider silk, US Secret Service
agent Sean McCarthy said in court documents. ``Elion stated he felt
that if he told these people the truth, they would be reluctant to
send money,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Fleming learned of Elion's claims to having
cloned the silk-making gene of the golden-silk spider by inserting
it into bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was amazing stuff,'' said Fleming, who has a doctorate in
clinical biochemistry from Cambridge University and was a lecturer
at Harvard Medical School. ``People have been trying to do this for
20 years. Dupont spent $20 million on it because it's so
potentially commercially lucrative. They said they could build
suspension bridges with it. He showed me a lot of partial data that
was very convincing, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming helped Elion launch a company to develop and market the
genetically engineered spider silk. The two traveled the world to
raise money, winning pledges of capital from companies in Japan and
elsewhere in Asia, Fleming said. Elion persuaded family and friends
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   He said he began to be skeptical after Elion presented data to
Dupont scientists. Under tough questioning, Elion grew angry and
later sent a bitter, retributive letter, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, I see that he couldn't face anyone who seriously
questioned his data,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents from the Secret Service and Scotland Yard, meanwhile,
arrested a man running the money-coating scheme and found Elion
among his victims. Elion admitted to investigators that he had been
working for years to profit from the scheme, living for a time in
London, where Fleming thought he was doing research.
</P>
<P>
   Elion's brother ``finally cornered him in a bar and demanded to
know the truth,'' Fleming said. ``That's when we got the news that
this was all a pack of lies.''

ROBINSON TO GET FIRST LOOK AT HIS OLD TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He could be bitter but isn't, exactly. He could
second-guess himself, which he does only slightly. He could feel
forlorn, not that he would tell you. Or he might just feel freed
from a world of pressure and expectation he never felt comfortable
in, which he certainly does.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson feels a lot of things as he looks on from across
the country at the Los Angeles Kings he guided for four mostly
frustrating seasons, now flexing muscles like an NHL power in their
first year since he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson spent four years trying to raise the Kings, and then
they went and grew up without him.
</P>
<P>
   He is now an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils, and
when the Kings venture into the Continental Airlines Arena tonight,
it will be Robinson's first personal view of his former team since
it ended last season a disappointing 32-45-5, out of the playoffs
and in search of a new coach and direction.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach would become Andy Murray, fresh from coaching at
the high school level, and who is constantly credited for bringing
the Kings intensity and organizational skills, an indirect slap at
Robinson's reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'll tell you what, I'd like to have the team Andy was
given when I was coaching there,'' Robinson said. ``There's seven
or eight new faces on the club that probably would have made a big
difference between us making and not making the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson made the playoffs only once in his four seasons, that
coming in 1998 when the Kings were then promptly swept in the first
round. Still, progress had been made and more was expected last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but guys had career years in '98,'' said Kings
defenseman Rob Blake. ``There were 10 guys who had career years,
and if they don't duplicate it, we don't make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings would never get it going last season. They lost both
goaltenders in the fourth game of the year. Then Blake broke his
right foot. Soon right winger Glen Murray tore his right knee.
Their season was spinning out of control, and there would be no
salvaging it. Others began to underachieve and there were whispers
a passive Robinson was starting to lose control.
</P>
<P>
   Before the last game of the season, Robinson _ who was willing
to stay on _ asked Kings general manager Dave Taylor if he would be
coming back. Taylor, his friend and former Kings teammate who
carpooled with him to games, said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the stupidest thing I ever did,'' Robinson said of
asking Taylor. ``That was a long, friggin'' night.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a proud NHL Hall of Famer, was suddenly out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at pictures of Larry when he took over four years ago
and it's brown hair and a smooth complexion,'' said Kings
defenseman Sean O'Donnell. ``You look at last year and he had more
white hair, a little more wrinkles. It seemed like his four years
here was more like about 10 or 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the Kings, and management all agree his one downfall
last season was his inability, or refusal, to come down on players
who failed to follow directions and perform as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the one thing I should have done different was to be
a little harder on them, that's all,'' Robinson said. ``I demanded
hard work and got hard work, but if I were to second-guess myself,
I should have set those standards and stuck by them, no matter who
the person was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of underachievers last year, guys that had great
seasons the year before and I stuck with them, hoping that they
would come back and come through. It's easy to get mad and bench
this guy and that guy, not play this guy _ but these same people
you're benching are the same people who are going to win you games,
so you always keep hoping and hoping, hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson hoped himself right out of a job. He admits it simply
isn't his nature to confront players, to criticize and punish those
who failed to respond. He had played for Scottie Bowman, a stern
taskmaster whose personal style he had never been comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Larry was always big on wanting guys to like him,''
O'Donnell said. ``That's a fine line, because sometimes when you're
a head coach you have to get guys pissed off. Larry didn't seem to
want that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'll never be the way Scottie was when I played.'
Because he hated him. Then you look at the results Bowman's got.
He's always had good teams. There's a fine line being a friend. You
should be able to do it, but the problem is the way players are
nowadays, if they smell they can get away with something, they'll
do it. Unfortunately, Larry kind of got caught up in that. It
wasn't his personality to embarrass somebody or to scream at them
or name them in the media. Things just sort of started landsliding
after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hoping just him telling you to do it was enough. And it
should be enough. It's not Larry's fault. But there are some guys
who need to be told two and three times, and if they still don't
listen, then action needs to be taken, whether it's scratching them
from the lineup, not playing them a couple periods, demoting them
on lines. It's something I don't think Andy hesitates to do. He
keeps everyone on a short leash.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been fairly significant personnel changes.
Taylor traded three young players and a first-round draft pick in
the offseason for Ziggy Palffy, Bryan Smolinski, Marcel Cousineau
and a fourth-round pick. Aki Berg is back after a year playing in
Finland and Frantisek Kaberle is over from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Players injured a year ago _ Blake, Murray, goaltenders Stephane
Fiset and Jamie Storr _ are healthy. Donald Audette, acquired last
December, is back for a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, Smolinski, Murray, Audette and Blake have been the
Kings' top five scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different team,'' Taylor said. ``We have the addition
of more speed and more skill. Andy Murray has done a very good job
with the club, but the biggest reason for our turnaround is, if you
look at Bryan Smolinski and Ziggy Palffy, those two players brought
us an additional 53 points at this juncture _ which is quite an
improvement in our team offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said during his tenure with the Kings the
organizational philosophy had always been to develop its young
talent, not to trade or sign for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to stick with our draft choices and not give
away our first draft picks,'' he said. ``That's what we went with,
and that's what I died with.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor insists the philosophy remains, and it was because of it
they were able to trade good young players, get something in return
and still have a strong system. Still, Taylor can appreciate
Robinson's outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he saw me at the draft he said, `Great trade, but a year
too late,''' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   And if Taylor had made the trade and the injured players were
back and the other new additions here, but Robinson still the coach
... would the Kings be doing as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an impossible question to answer,'' Taylor said. ``I
believe it was time for a change last year. When I talked to Larry
at the end of the season, I think he felt as much relieved by the
decision we had made.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blake: ``There's no answer for that. No one knows.
Something had to be done. Things weren't working out the way they
were last year. It's unfortunate that the coach is probably the
easiest guy to go every time. That's usually what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Robinson is doing what he enjoys best _ developing
players. He is usually the last one off the ice after New Jersey
practices, spending extra time with young skaters willing and in
need of learning from one of hockey's greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   Here there is no media spotlight, no one demanding the big
answers, no impending meeting, no schedule to decide, no one
requiring a disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he does not miss the stress naturally incorporated
with being a head coach, but might be willing to try that road
again in the right situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think I'm at the stage of my career now, having been in
the game for so long, I'm looking at just being able to be close to
the young guys and teaching young guys, and passing on what I've
learned and my experiences,'' Robinson said. ``That part of the
game appeals to me more than going back to the grind and day-to-day
tribulations that go with being a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back on it and I'm hurt that I started something I
didn't get to finish. Especially going into the new building, to be
able to at least have one year of being there with it. But then,
that's the way the league goes sometimes. That's the hazards of
this occupation.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Last Friday, when Dana Dimel's car phone rang, the then-Wyoming
football coach figured, correctly, that it had to be good news.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At that time, Dimel was returning home to Laramie, Wyo., from
the Denver airport after a recruiting trip. Earlier that day,
Marshall coach Bob Pruett had changed his mind after signing a
contract to become the University of Houston's new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that it was a tossup between Bob and me. We were the
only two candidates, and when I heard he had pulled out, I was
hopeful the phone would be ringing soon to bring some good news,''
Dimel said Monday at a news conference introducing him as the
Cougars' new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel, 37, who first was contacted by UH on Nov. 24, three days
after Kim Helton was dismissed after seven seasons, agreed to a
five-year, $600,000-a-year contract plus bonuses and incentives. He
will receive a base salary of $300,000 annually and $300,000 a year
from external revenue sources such as radio-television, apparel,
camps and personal appearances _ about twice Helton's compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dimel can earn bonuses based on team graduation
rates and grade-point averages, bowl appearances, Top 25 rankings,
Conference USA championships and No. 1 C-USA ranking in total
offense and total defense.
</P>
<P>
   UH will pay $200,000 to buy out the remaining two years of
Dimel's contract at Wyoming. UH also owes Helton $600,000 for the
last two years on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel said he intends to implement a controlled passing game
with a 55-percent passing, 45-percent running ratio in play
selection.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach said he expects to complete his staff by Wednesday
and has offered positions to Les Koenning Jr. and Dick Bumpas, who
were Helton's offensive and defensive coordinators, respectively.
Dimel, who held his first players meeting Monday, already has hired
Nevada quarterbacks coach Phil Davis as the Cougars' offensive
coordinator. Helton's staff is under contract until June 1, but
Bumpas and Koenning apparently were the only assistants offered
positions on Dimel's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Clancy Barone and secondary coach Mark
Stoops, both of whom were on Dimel's staff at Wyoming, are
considered possibilities to join him at UH.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dimel said he has offered a position as an
offensive assistant to former UH quarterback and Heisman Trophy
winner Andre Ware, who said Monday, ``I am still mulling it over.''
</P>
<P>
   University chancellor/president Arthur K. Smith described the
search for Helton's successor _ by Smith and athletic director Chet
Gladchuk _ as ``a stealth operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel in turn called his plan for next season ``a stealth
offense that is going to strike very quickly, a one-back set mostly
with four receivers and spread out the field combined with a
defensive pressure package. We want to get great speed all over the
field. That comes from recruiting, and that can make a very good
coach out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel reiterated that he intends to actively recruit the Houston
area and increase the Cougars' recruiting visibility throughout
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked out of the hotel windows Sunday night, saw all those
lights and thought about all the great players there must be living
right out there,'' Dimel said. ``We should be able to bring in some
of them. We will have athleticism, guys who can chase the football
and run with it and catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   That process can begin Wednesday, the initial signing date for
midterm junior-college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel is a former offensive lineman, like earlier UH coaches
Bill Yeoman and Helton. Dimel's brief NFL career ended in his
rookie year as a Minnesota Vikings free agent after his fifth knee
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old offensive lineman,'' Dimel said. ``I grind it out.
If I'm on offense or out on the recruiting trail, I'm grinding it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He had logged 1,700 miles in a rental car recruiting Kansas
junior colleges shortly before he received his second, decisive
call from Gladchuk telling him the Cougars job was his.
</P>
<P>
   During 10 years at Kansas State, including terms as offensive
coordinator and offensive line coach on Bill Snyder's staff, Dimel
helped the Wildcats' rise to one of the country's most successful
programs of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, between 1988 and this season, the Cougars played in
one bowl. That was the 1996 Liberty Bowl after the Helton-coached
Cougars shared the C-USA title, their first conference championship
since a tie for the '84 Southwest Conference crown and one of four
Cotton Bowls under Yeoman. Their best regular-season record during
that time was 7-4 in '96 and '99, which adds up to two winning
seasons in the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   When hired for his first head coaching job by Wyoming before the
1997 season, Dimel was one of 27 new Division I-A head coaches. Joe
Tiller, with 24 victories at Purdue the next three seasons, is the
only one of the group who has won more since then than Dimel, who
was 23-12 at Wyoming after replacing Tiller.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel grew up in Columbus, Ohio, about a mile from the Ohio
Stadium. His first game as Wyoming's head coach was at Columbus
against the Ohio State Buckeyes, and the Cowboys almost pulled off
an upset in the 1997 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts, it was an easy decision to try to take
this program back to be a champion in Conference USA and to compete
with the Big 12 schools,'' Dimel told the crowd of UH staff and
supporters at the Athletics/Alumni Center, ``and I know we will
compete very quickly with the University of Texas (which is on UH
schedules the next three seasons).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get it cranking, no doubt, in my mind. Not to
sound braggadocious, but I don't know anything but win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that the tradition of this football program
is in the hands of one who cares deeply about it.''

 McCAIN CHALLENGES BUSH ON HOME-GROWN ISSUE IN IOWA  
 (For use by New York Times news service clients)   
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Arizona Sen. John McCain used a lively
Republican presidential debate Monday night to denounce federal
subsidies for ethanol and to challenge Texas Gov. George W. Bush to
end the largely unregulated ``soft money'' donations to political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush and the four other candidates for the Republican
presidential nomination met for the first time in this crucial
state in a debate that focused on agricultural issues, morality and
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew applause from the audience of 2,400 Iowa Republicans
by backing the federal subsidy of ethanol, a major issue among Iowa
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute session gave the candidates yet another
opportunity for self-promotion and to challenge their rivals in
advance of the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses. It was the last debate of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain seemed defended his stand against ethanol, a gasoline
additive derived from corn, an Iowa agricultural staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you things you don't want to hear,'' McCain
said. ``And one of those things is (about) ethanol.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has shunned Iowa because of his opposition to the $700
million-a-year ethanol subsidy, which he considers to be a
pork-barrel spending project. In denouncing ethanol, McCain
appeared to be playing the maverick card he has cultivated with
voters in other states, particularly New Hampshire, where polls
show the senator is giving Bush a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ethanol statement evoked a few boos and hisses from the
Republican crowd. He softened the blow a bit by arguing that as a
president promoting free trade, Iowa farmers would make up for the
loss of ethanol-related corn by exporting more agricultural
projects.
</P>
<P>
   China, McCain said, ``will be eating Iowa pork and loving every
mouthful of it when I'm president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is well ahead of his nearest competitor, publishing
magnate Steve Forbes, in Iowa polls, said he supports the ethanol
subsidy ``whether I'm in Iowa or not. ... It's good for the air
(and) it reduces our dependency on foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain challenged Bush on campaign financing, asking Bush to
join him in pledging to end the power of Washington lobbyists and
``soft money,'' the contributions to political parties from
corporate interests and unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stop it now,'' McCain said to Bush and the other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would like to ``talk to you about it sometime.''
When moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News pressed him for an answer,
Bush said he liked the idea of restricting soft money, but worried
it would hurt the Republican Party if nothing was done to control
the ability of unions to take portions of union-worker wages for
political activity _ most of it benefiting Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We better have paycheck protection or our conservative values
aren't worth a shot,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a conservative abortion foe and former Reagan
administration official, challenged Bush on trade with China. The
two argued over whether China would live up to trade agreements and
the regulatory framework that goes with China's admission to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stop China playing us for suckers,'' Bauer said to
Bush. ``The time for them playing us for suckers will end with my
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he called China ``evil'' and said the Beijing government
is the largest threat to U.S. power in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Bush argued that on balance trade with
China is preferable to the hard-line position taken by Bauer
because it opens China to possible democratization and helps the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something,'' Bush said. ``Opening up the
Chinese market is good for our farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also won applause for his answer to a question posed by the
moderators, Brokaw and local television anchor John Bachman, on
philosophers they admire. After Forbes talked about British
philosopher John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, Bush answered
``Christ, because he changed my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates seemed to agree on one thing: Despite solid
economic prosperity, American morals are in a tailspin and only the
strong moral leadership of a Republican president can straighten
them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president of the United States ought to set a
moral tone in this country,'' Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first thing a president can and should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the debate was Alan Keyes, a former State Department
official who called for a ban on abortion. The debate was televised
on the MSNBC cable channel.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After six hours of impassioned and often raucous
debate _ and just two days before talks begin in Washington _
Israel's Parliament on Monday tepidly endorsed Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's quest for a comprehensive peace settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to pay ``a heavy territorial price,'' Barak
acknowledged in an emotional plea for parliamentary support. But
failure to pursue peace with Damascus ``could cost us in blood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of confidence in the prime minister's negotiating plans
passed with 47 votes in favor, 31 against, and 24 abstentions _ a
victory, but far from the strong majority Barak expected. Three
parties in Barak's governing coalition pointedly refused to back
him on Monday night, pointing to potential trouble when a promised
national referendum is held on any final peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is to meet with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria
in Washington Wednesday and Thursday for the highest-level direct
discussions ever held between Syria and Israel. President Clinton
is expected to host the opening and closing sessions of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's appearance in Parliament on Monday was
widely considered his most important appearance since he took the
oath of office there five months ago. Calling this week's
negotiations ``an opportunity that cannot be squandered,'' he
argued that for the first time in its history, Israel has a chance
for a lasting peace with all of its immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Israel's perspective, real peace with Syria and the
Palestinians, if it can be achieved, is the pinnacle of the Zionist
vision,'' he said, ignoring opposition hecklers. ``It is a
revolution. It is a new era in Israel's relations with the Arab
world, and the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak implicitly conceded that the Golan Heights would be handed
back to Syria in a peace accord, as thousands of residents from the
northern border zone demonstrated angrily outside the Parliament.
The precise boundaries of withdrawal ``will be determined in
negotiations in accordance with the depth of peace and the quality
of security arrangements,'' he said, echoing the formula used by
the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Barak's mentor, in the last
attempt at a settlement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud bloc, followed
Barak to the podium. He predicted that any accord featuring a Golan
withdrawal would go down to defeat in a referendum. He tauntingly
read another statement by Rabin, this one from 1992, that ``it is
inconceivable that even in peace we would descend from the Golan
Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon charged that the government acquiesced to President Hafez
Assad's desire for ``American aid and modern American weapons'' and
President Clinton's hunger ``for a stunning achievement at any cost
before the end of his term in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had praised Clinton in his remarks for his ``personal
involvement and devotion to the cause of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned national vote on the Syrian peace accord would be
the first referendum in Israel's history. Lawmakers have yet to
determine how the balloting would be organized, or who will draft
the question that will be put to voters. Israel's attorney-general
rejected an opposition proposal that Arab citizens _ a sixth of the
electorate _ be excluded from the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The vote following Monday night's debate _ a simple yea or nay
response to the peace initiative outlined by the prime minister on
Monday night _ provided the first real test of Barak's coalition
strategy. For Barak's Labor allies, the results appeared worrisome.
He assembled a multiparty government to provide the broadest
possible majority for peace with Syria and the Palestinians, but on
Monday night he was left with an uncomfortably slim plurality.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest faction in Barak's ruling coalition _ the
Sephardic-dominated Shas party _ unexpectedly abstained from the
vote and openly criticized his ``unclear'' negotiating strategy.
Most members of two smaller conservative parties in the government
_ the National Religious Party, backed by settlers in the West
Bank, and Yisrael B'aliya, representing Russian immigrants _ voted
against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all three coalition factions then joined Sharon and
other opposition figures outside Parliament in a rally with
protesters from the Golan Heights. ``We feel that the Golan is our
home, and you cannot throw people out of their homes,'' Guy Neuman,
a demonstrator from Qatrin, the largest Golan town, told an Israeli
television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, anticipating opposition attacks, portrayed himself as a
patriot and career military man who had devoted his life to
Israel's defense. He reminded his audience that he had fought
against the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the 1967 war. ``I
am fully familiar with every valley and every rock in the Golan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied to the Parliament by Nadia Cohen, the widow
of Eli Cohen, an Israeli agent who has executed by Syria in 1965
for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen, who is seeking the return from Damascus of her
husband's interred remains, publicly endorsed Barak's peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary interest is Israel's security,'' Barak said. ``The
agreement that we aspire to reach with our Syrian neighbors is one
that will also put an end to our conflict with Lebanon, and will
include diverse and effective systems to preserve security and
peace between our countries at all times. Such an agreement is not
beyond reach.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a meeting earlier on Monday, he told Cabinet colleagues that
while Israel had made no new commitments to Syria before this
week's talks, it ``would not erase'' any promises made in previous
negotiations during the administrations of Rabin and former Prime
Ministers Shimon Peres, and Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians and Israelis have profoundly different recollections of
those past pledges, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians have said the Rabin government was prepared to
withdraw to Israel's 1967 borders _ that is, to the eastern
shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. Israeli negotiators deny making
such a promise. And former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims
to have extracted Syrian permission for a permanent Israeli
presence atop Mount Heron, the Golan's high point _ an assertion
dismissed by diplomats in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations with Syria will be difficult and paved with
crises,'' Barak told his Cabinet ministers, according to state
radio reports. ``I have no illusions about the nature of the Middle
East, and I have no doubt that only the overall strength of Israel
will ensure that agreements are honored.``

COHEN ORDERS NEW SURVEY TO DETERMINE TREATMENT OF GAYS IN
MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 9th graf to correct spelling of bludgeoning) (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen on Monday ordered
spot checks of major military bases around the country to determine
whether gay service members are being harassed and told the
Pentagon inspector general to report back within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore on Monday night called for the outright
elimination of the administration's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy for gays in the military, saying they should be allowed to
serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve their country
without discrimination,'' Gore said in a statement on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has long argued within the administration for
allowing gays to serve openly, he has not been so forceful publicly
until Monday night. His declaration follows an admission by
President Clinton over the weekend that the current policy toward
gays in the military was ``out of whack,'' but Clinton did not go
so far as to call for the policy to be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks in turn followed comments by his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, that
gays should be allowed to serve openly. Former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, Gore's lone rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, called several weeks ago for gays to be allowed to
serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton complained that the murder of a gay soldier in July
after cruel and persistent harassment showed that the military's
policy for gays was not working. In response to that death, for
which an Army private was convicted of murder last week, Defense
officials hastily put together plans on Monday for a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   The policy prohibits the military from asking about a soldier's
sex life unless there is clear evidence of homosexual conduct, and
it forbids harassing gay and lesbian service members. But the
policy also requires soldiers to leave the service if they
volunteer that they are homosexual or if there is evidence of
homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary shares the president's determination to make
sure that this policy is executed as fairly as possible,'' said
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pvt. Calvin Glover was found guilty of bludgeoning to
death Pfc. Barry Winchell, the gay soldier, in their barracks at
Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the court-martial, soldiers related
how the gay soldier had been taunted for months with anti-gay slurs
without reprimand by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pentagon survey will be conducted by teams under Donald
Mancuso, the acting inspector general, who said in an interview on
Monday that he was told of the new assessment only 30 minutes
before it was announced to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen asked Mancuso to find out what problems exist in
implementing the policy that forbids harassing gay and lesbian
service members but also requires them to leave the service if they
are found to be homosexual. The inspector general said on Monday
that he was given ``full latitude'' to conduct the survey, prepare
the questions and figure out which bases to visit.
</P>
<P>
   For gay and lesbian rights groups the Pentagon announcement was
a disappointment. ``What needs to be done is training to prevent
anti-gay harassment at all levels,'' said Dickson Osborne,
co-executive director of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network.
</P>
<P>
   While saying the survey is a step forward, Osoborne said it
could not succeed because Defense officials failed to promise
confidentiality to service members who come forward to report
harassment to the visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is can gay people participate in this survey
without getting fired from their jobs, '' he said. ``How do you
trust anyone, especially at a base where an anti-gay murder took
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that the investigators would
pursue those accused of harassment, not the service members who
report that they have been taunted. Under the `don't ask' portion
of the policy, a superior is forbidden to question a service member
about his sexual preference or investigate his private activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be easy to tell from talking to people whether
anti-gay statements or harassment is a regular part of the life of
the post, irrespective of whether the people who are doing the
reporting may happen to be gay or not,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's aim, he continued, is to ``look at the climate _ if
there was a harassing climate and whether this is condoned by the
command.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the policy was first enacted in 1993, the Pentagon
has yet to institute formal training programs on the policy for all
branches of the services. Following Winchell's murder, Cohen
reissued the guidelines for 'don't ask, don't tell' in August and
asked all the services to submit proposals for training programs,
which they have done. Now that the president asked for a
reassessment of how the policy is followed, the Pentagon will act
quickly on those training proposals.

<P>
   The Navy's personnel boss, Vice Adm. Daniel T. Oliver, did issue
a Navy-wide memorandum on Oct. 28, sternly reminding commanding
officers that they ``must not condone homosexual jokes, epithets or
derogatory comments, and must ensure a command climate that fosters
respect for all individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum continued: ``Service members should be able to
report crimes and harassment free from fear of harm, reprisal or
inappropriate or inadequate governmental response.''
</P>
<P>
   It then described in detail what the policy does and does not
permit.
</P>
<P>
   When the secretary reissued the policy guidelines in August, the
message drew respect and derision from officers and enlisted
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, screwing up any homosexual case provides an
excellent opportunity to appear on `60 Minutes,' wrote Col. James
C. Walker, the staff judge advocate for the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif. in an e-mail message
sent to commanders outlining Cohen's guidelines. ``My job is to
deny you that opportunity. Call me on all these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another e-mail message circulating at the Marine base at
Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., one officer wrote to several others:
``Due to the 'hate crime' death of a homo in the Army we now have
to take extra steps to ensure the safety of the queer who has
'told' (not kept his part of the D.O.D. ''don't ask, don't tell''
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gets political credit for being first to call for the
policy's elimination, the fact that some of the nation's most
prominent Democrats want it scrapped suggests a major battle ahead
in Congress. Republicans do not support the policy either, but they
generally do not want gays in the military at all.
</P>
<P>
   The process that is leading to the re-examination of the gays in
the military is similar to that which drove Clinton to shift his
position on another sensitive military issue, whether to reopen a
firing range in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Mrs. Clinton, apparently with her eye on New York
politics and the sizeable Puerto Rican community there, sided with
the governor of Puerto Rico and said the base should be permanently
closed. Shortly thereafter, Gore adopted the same position. Last
month, the president rejected the alternative recommendations of
the Navy and ordered the end of military exercises with live fire
on the base at Vieques.

BUSH TANGLES WITH MCCAIN OVER CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In the most spirited Republican debate so
far, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona
sparred over McCain's advocacy for overhauling the nation's
campaign finance laws, with Bush declining McCain's offer that the
two take a joint pledge against accepting so-called soft money, or
largely unregulated corporate contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has emerged as the most potent challenger to Bush
for the Republican presidential nomination, told Bush that special
interests were stealing the federal government and that, ``You and
I can stop that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can commit, as nominees of the party, that we'll have
nothing to do with soft money,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush answered that such a repudiation of soft money would amount
to ``unilateral disarmament'' by giving an advantage to Democrats,
who benefit from donations from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Without soft money, Bush said, ``Our Republican Party and
conservative values don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange underscored McCain's efforts to portray himself as
an insurgent outsider and Bush as the candidate anointed by the
establishment, and it was one of many instances Monday night when
Bush's challengers sought to put him on the defensive or pin him
down in an uncomfortable way.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a religious conservative, also invited Bush to take
vow: a promise that if Bush became the Republican nominee, he would
choose a running mate who was opposed to legal abortion. Bush did
not do so, saying it would be presumptuous for someone who has not
yet won the nomination to be choosing a vice presidential
candidate. Instead, he said, voters could rest assured that he
would choose a vice presidential candidate who could become
president if necessary, and that that was the most important
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose lackluster performances in previous debates came
under intense scrutiny and criticism, was more assertive and
aggressive this time around, his voice more forceful and his
bearing more confident.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the candidates shed some of the tact and
restraint that had defined two forums earlier this month,
precipitating some pungent and occasionally hilarious dialogue as
the subjects ranged far and wide, from gun control and health care
to the vanishing of the family farm and America's trading
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and Bush in particular quarreled over that last topic,
with Bauer challenging Bush's support of China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stop allowing China to play us for suckers,'' Bauer
said. ``They dump their goods here, and Iowa farmers are selling
less to China now than they did 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the best way to change that was to make trade with
China even freer, and that China's place in the trade organization
would make it more amenable to fair trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening up Chinese markets is good for Iowa farmers, yessir,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't kept their agreements for 20 years,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates began mixing it up when McCain was asked about
his push to reduce pork barrel spending, and brought up,
unprompted, his opposition to federal subsidies for ethanol, a
corn-based fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Support for ethanol subsidies is a litmus test for candidates in
Iowa, but McCain, apparently seeking to bolster his case that he is
willing to oppose special interests, flatly said he would cut the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you the things you don't want to hear as well
as what you do want to hear,'' McCain said. ``And everybody here on
this stage, if it wasn't for the fact that Iowa is the first caucus
state, would share my view that we don't need ethanol subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first freewheeling moments in the series of
Republican debates, the other candidates jumped on McCain's
statements and, to cheers from the audience in the studio, pledged
their backing for ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support ethanol because it's good for the quality of the
air,'' Bush said. ``It also reduces our dependence on foreign
oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin B. Hatch of Utah said ethanol was ``a renewable
resource that helps farmers, that literally might help us in the
event of another energy crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the first question, on whether movies and video
games had contributed to school shootings like those at Columbine
High School, the candidates agreed that part of the blame should go
to movies and video games that desensitive children to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We parents should know what our children are watching,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the real problems were a deterioration of moral
standards and the nation's failure to outlaw abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much focus today on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and that's fine,'' Bush said. But the focus, Bush said,
should be on ``a problem of the heart in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he would set a moral tone as president that would
give him the clout to take on movie producers and makers of video
games over violence in popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's Republican forum was the third in 11 days to
feature all six candidates for the party's nomination, but it was
the first to take place in Iowa, a pivotal state whose precinct
caucus on Jan. 24 is the opening contest of the primary season. The
first primary, in New Hampshire, comes eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to be on much sturdier ground in Iowa than in New
Hampshire, where McCain has pulled ahead of him in several recent
polls. But the publisher Steve Forbes is pouring time and money
into Iowa in the hopes of finishing a strong second to Bush and
proving himself a viable alternative to the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has adopted an unusual, possibly even risky strategy of
ignoring Iowa so that he can focus on New Hampshire, South Carolina
and Arizona
</P>
<P>
   The two previous Republican forums _ in Manchester, N.H., on
Dec. 3, and in Phoenix on Dec. 6 _ were marked by a striking degree
of at least superficial cordiality, with the six candidates
speaking to and about one another in relatively restrained,
respectful terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's opponents, still trailing far behind in national
polls, made subtle and sometimes indirect efforts to chip into that
lead by portraying him as someone without the requisite experience,
seriousness or intellectual maturity to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's lackluster, frequently rote performances during those
debates came under exacting scrutiny, dulled the sheen of
inevitability surrounding his candidacy. Journalists and political
analysts examined everything from Bush's cautious adherence to
comments taken from his stump speeches to the curl of his lips,
which struck many observers as a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Republicans and even a few of Bush's foreign
policy advisers conceded that they had been disappointed by the
impression that Bush was making in the debates, which they said did
not do justice to the charm and fluency in policy that he has
projected in less formal settings.

 &HT;    Bush, McCain finally show sparks in Iowa debate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Presidential candidates Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain sparred over tax and campaign finance reform
in a Monday night debate that highlighted differences that could
frame the battle for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges came in a debate televised nationally from the Des
Moines Civic Center in the biggest city in the state that will kick
off the presidential season with its Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who drew criticism for uninspired and uninspiring
performances in previous debates in New Hampshire and Arizona,
wound up in a spirited discussion with McCain when he asked the
senator a question about the relative merits of their tax-cut
plans. Bush, who has avoided cross words about McCain (R-Ariz.),
wound up debating the campaign-finance reform plan that undergirds
many of McCain's positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get rid of pork in Washington, stop feeding the
hog,'' Bush said, arguing that the best way to limit pork-barrel
spending is to lower taxes, giving government less money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   McCain touched on the tax question but used most of his time to
talk about his call for the end of unlimited soft-money campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny you mention pork,'' McCain told Bush. ``What the
American people need is their money back and they are not going to
get it back until we get it out of the hands of the special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked if all the GOP contenders, including Utah Sen.
Orrin Hatch, publisher Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer,
would join him in swearing off soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to talk about it,'' said Bush, taking the bait
and making the case that McCain's plan is ``unilateral
disarmament'' because it would not curtail big donations to
Democrats from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my worry,'' he told McCain, ``with your plan it's going
to hurt the Republican Party, John.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain also differed on federal ethanol subsidies, the
issue that is keeping the Arizona senator from campaigning here.
Iowa farmers, a powerful political force, like the subsidy program.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said ethanol subsidies come from a dead-end program
backed by special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you that I want to tell you the things you
don't want to hear as well as the things you do want to hear,''
McCain said, drawing boos in the Des Moines Civic Center. ``And one
of those is ethanol. Ethanol is not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said ethanol subsidies should continue because the
agriculture-based fuel ``is good for the air'' and helps reduce
dependency on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is concentrating his campaigning efforts on New
Hampshire, where he now leads Bush in the run up to the Feb. 1
primary, and South Carolina, where Bush has a substantial lead
going into the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took heat from Bauer, who challenged him to vow to
choose an anti-abortion rights running mate if nominated. Bush
declined, as he has throughout the campaign. ``I will name somebody
who can be the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The six candidates also were asked to name a political or
philosophical hero.
</P>
<P>
   Bush named Jesus Christ ``because he changed my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to tell viewers why he choose Christ, Bush said, ``If they
don't know it's going to be hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes named John Locke and Thomas Jefferson. Hatch named
Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. McCain cited ``all of our
founding fathers'' and Theodore Roosevelt. Bauer named and quoted
Christ.

 NEW YORK: jail time.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Our litigation strategy surrounding the Taylor Law is a
tool,'' Shaw said. ``We think it's useful to keep it and use it as
a hammer over everybody's head.''
</P>
<P>
   A city official said Monday night that the goal was not to jail
transit workers, but to ``remind the union members who vote for a
strike what the repercussions are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a road map for what the penalties are,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said that if workers do strike,
``serious consideration ought to be given to firing the leaders who
caused the strike to happen.'' The MTA, not the city, has the
authority to fire workers in the event of a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said that the city will have to spend millions of
dollars to prepare for a strike. On Monday, he said that some of
those costs _ to hire private buses in time for Wednesday morning
and to pay for police overtime _ were already being incurred. Last
week, the mayor said the union would be liable for all costs
related to the strike, which he estimated would be at least $3.5
million a day. The transit union was fined $1.25 million after an
11-day walkout in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll seek to impose on the union every single penny that they
have cost the citizens of the city of New York,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The union has asked for a 27 percent wage increase over three
years; the MTA has offered a 12 percent increase over four years.
The average salary for transit workers is $39,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The contract talks ended Monday at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in
midtown Manhattan at 4:30 a.m., then resumed at 9 a.m. On Tuesday,
the union has scheduled a 10 a.m. ``informational meeting'' _ city
officials are calling it a ``strike meeting'' _ to explain the
status of the negotiations. The union's 46-member executive board
is scheduled to meet Tuesday night to decide whether to authorize a
strike, accept the MTA's latest offer or continue negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and other city officials complained bitterly Monday
about a militant faction of dissidents, called New Directions, that
makes up nearly half of the union membership. James, who was nearly
defeated in his campaign for president by the dissidents last year,
has been under heavy pressure from them to obtain higher wages in
the talks. Giuliani called the dissidents ``the group that is most
enthusiastic about violating the law.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the leader of the dissidents, Tim Schermerhorn, and
the leader of a taxi drivers' organization announced that they
would work together in the event of a strike. Although the city's
emergency plan calls for taxi drivers to pick up multiple fares,
Bhairavi Desai, an organizer for the New York Taxi Workers'
Alliance, said that her group would not cooperate with any plan
that hurts taxi workers. Ms. Desai's group represents about 2,000
drivers out of the 42,000 in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor countered, ``The vast majority of taxi drivers,
believe me, are going to take advantage of the opportunity to make
a lot more money during the strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had kept in touch in the last week with Gov.
George Pataki, who has been visibly absent from the public exchange
of threats and accusations surrounding the contract talks. ``The
governor's the head of the Transit Authority,'' said Peter Vallone,
the speaker of the City Council. ``He should be involved in these
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But City Hall officials said the governor was involved behind
the scenes. ``I am in touch and have directed them to be
responsible and work round the clock to try to reach agreement,''
Pataki said Monday at a news conference in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor has been highly critical of what he calls the
MTA's sluggishness in the talks, he has not extended that criticism
to the man who effectively controls the MTA, Pataki, whose good
will Giuliani needs if he runs for the U.S. Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton.

BRITAIN TO LIFT BAN ON GAYS IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GAYS-MILITARY) 
 (af)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain has decided to end the ban on homosexuals in
the armed forces, Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon has said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoon said a new code of conduct would be introduced next year
replacing the current prohibition against gay men and women in
uniform, The Times of London reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States military, with its ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy, the British military flatly bans gays.
</P>
<P>
   The new code will specify that sexual behavior involving on-duty
personnel will be a punishable offense but that sexual orientation
no longer will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's sexuality is a private matter,'' Hoon said. ``People
are entitled to a private life. A new code of conduct, is,
therefore, the right way of dealing with this question, but I want
to make sure that any solution to this problem does not jeopardize
the effectiveness of the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair had been
promising to take such action since September when the European
Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of four gay people dismissed
from the military.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Britain's ban constituted a ``grave
interference'' in private lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the new code would be drawn up in January, but a
Defense Ministry spokesman said no time had been set for ending the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Most other European nations have permitted gays in uniform since
the Netherlands pioneered the cause in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Hoon will open an armed forces equal opportunities conference in
Birmingham this week, and he said he intended to devote attention
to expanding the recruitment and advancement of women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the day when we have a woman general, but,
equally, I don't believe in positive discrimination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the British armed forces are still barred from
front-line combat roles and are not permitted to serve in the
infantry, armored corps, diving units or submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Hoon did not say if he intended to change that, but he added,
``As women progress through the ranks, they will need to have the
right experience and background to reach the top.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The end of the war in Kosovo was supposed to be a
moment of glory for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had
argued passionately for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the six months since, Albright has been effectively
eclipsed in foreign affairs by Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, who has brought his physical proximity to the Oval Office
and his personal relationship with President Clinton to bear on
every foreign policy issue, according to administration officials
and foreign policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   From forging China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to
the unsuccessful battle to win ratification of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, to shaping American policy toward Russia's war in
Chechnya, to running Clinton's 11-day trip to Europe, Berger's
presence has been unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would argue that Albright has been locked out. The
secretary was at center stage in the Middle East last week when the
Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, told her during their meeting in
Damascus that he was prepared to resume negotiations with Israel.
Her assistants were quick to note that Assad had told a visitor the
week before that ``nothing can happen until the lady comes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian breakthrough was announced by Clinton, but
Albright was in the spotlight explaining the deal on television,
even though she is less a fixture on the talk shows than she once
was.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what will be continued visibility for Albright this
week as the Middle East peace talks resume in Washington, officials
inside and outside the administration say there is little doubt
about who actually formulates the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dispute who runs the show on foreign policy,''
said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who
is working on a study of the national security council, and who
worked with Berger in the first Clinton term.
</P>
<P>
   Of Albright, he said: ``She remains a participant in the
process. But her weight as secretary of state in the determination
of foreign policy appears less than at any time in the Clinton
administration, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher's
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, a trade lawyer by profession and longtime Washington
political insider, has emerged on top not because of his expertise
in foreign policy, said Daalder.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, what helped him rise so forcefully are his skills as a
hands-on manager, his obsession with finding a consensus among top
officials and the fact that, in this administration, foreign policy
has often been redefined as economic policy advanced through
increased trade.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say Berger emerged the much stronger of
the pair from the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who is seen as a policymaker driven by convictions
with a large human rights concern, persuaded Berger and Clinton of
the need to go to war against the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, many officials have said. It was a position that the
president and Berger came to much later and more warily than the
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But once the war began, the White House became the center of
operations, a place that Albright visited for meetings but where
Clinton and Berger held the fort. For the most part, her task was
to work the phones from the state department to try to keep the
NATO foreign ministers on board and fully briefed.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's foreign policy emphasis then shifted away
from Albright's strengths _ the Balkans and Europe _ to China,
Russia, the Middle East and Ireland _ where a special envoy, George
Mitchell, reported to Berger and the president.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Berger was being reinforced by a bigger and
more operational National Security Council than ever before. There
are currently 99 policy assistants at the council _ 35 on loan from
nongovernmental institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations
_ many of them micromanaging issues. A decade ago, there were only
about 70.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's recent trip to Istanbul for a meeting of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Russia
was the major topic, Berger briefed reporters every day, a job
often done by the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On Russia policy in general, Albright's deputy undersecretary of
state, Strobe Talbott, is the key policymaker, with Berger
increasingly involved, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, who is the administration's most frequent traveler to
Moscow, writes long memos that are delivered to Albright and Berger
``concurrently and equally,'' an administration official said. The
issues are then resolved at the White House, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary talks frequently with the Russian foreign
minister, Igor Ivanov, but Ivanov, according to administration
officials, is not part of the inner workings of the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Berger has taken the lead, a situation that Albright
has said she believes is a traditional one for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   When China's entry into the World Trade Organization needed to
be pushed, Albright said it was natural that the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, should be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fantastic,'' Albright said. ``She has every detail in
her head; that is her job.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fight with Congress over the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, Berger was in the catbird seat. He gave the Democratic
leadership the go-ahead to try to win ratification and then
negotiated _ unsuccessfully _ with Republican leaders. Neither
Albright's warm relationship with the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms _ a friendship she has
taken great pride in _ nor Berger's political instincts, helped.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty's defeat was a major setback for the administration,
and Berger tried a comeback with two speeches that lambasted what
he called the dangers to the United States of neo-isolationism. But
after receiving poor reviews from the foreign policy establishment
on the grounds that he had been too partisan, Berger dropped the
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had not been given an advance copy of Berger's first
speech, to the Council on Foreign Relations, State Department
officials said. In the interview, she said crisply: ``I write my
speeches and Mr. Berger writes his speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Berger is not the most powerful national security adviser in
recent history _ a status that that still belong to Henry Kissinger
followed by Zbigniew Brzezinski. But he is surely the most
political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He instinctively understands Mr. Clinton's needs better than
anyone else,'' Daalder said. ``That makes him absolutely the best
national security adviser for this president, whose involvement in
foreign affairs is episodic and often driven by domestic political
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Albright, who know each other well from Democratic
presidential campaigns and Washington salons, insist that they work
together in seamless coordination.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office, Berger said that he and the
secretary ``work together as a team as well as any foreign policy
team in the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, sensitive about their relative positions. He
took care to read in advance a State Department transcript of an
interview that Albright had given to The New York Times a week
earlier, in which a question suggested that Berger had assumed some
of the mantle of secretary of state _ a notion that Berger hotly
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Albright said, ``As far as I am concerned a strong
national security adviser is very important for a strong secretary
of state.''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the emphasis on teamwork is not misplaced,
said Coit Blacker, who was the senior assistant on Russia on the
National Security Council in Clinton's first term and is now a
professor of international relations at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Berger had overtaken Albright because his personality suited the
president, and Albright appeared to have left a vacuum. It is
Berger who has the ease of access to Clinton, an ultimate measure
of clout in any administration.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed in an interview how often she had seen Clinton
one-on-one this year, Albright replied: ``I do not keep track of it
but often what happens is that I see him alone or after a meeting
or I talk to him on the phone. He calls me or I call him.''

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Florida State University has asked the NCAA to clarify whether a
Seminoles football player violated NCAA rules when he worked with a
Houston personal trainer last summer and was not required to pay
for the trainer's services.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Minnix, Florida State's associate athletic director for
compliance, was quoted in Thursday's Tallahassee Democrat as saying
he had contacted Steve Mallonee, an NCAA director of membership
services, last week to seek an opinion on whether FSU defensive
lineman Roland Seymour was in violation of NCAA regulations when he
worked in Houston for a month last summer with personal trainer
James Cooper and wasn't required to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix's request occurred after a Dec. 4 story in the Chronicle
reported he had known about the matter in August but had neither
sought an official rules interpretation from the NCAA nor taken any
action regarding Seymour's eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The story reported that the Seymour case could be considered a
violation of NCAA bylaw 12.1.1.1.6, which states that a
student-athlete loses his or her amateur standing by accepting
preferential treatment, benefits or services as a result of his or
her athletics skill, reputation or payback potential as a
professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix, who spent 20 years as an NCAA enforcement representative
and director before coming to Florida State in 1995, said he knew
Cooper did not require payment from Seymour but believed the matter
was not an amateurism issue because Cooper has made similar
arrangements with other high school and college athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has gained a national reputation as a strength and
conditioning expert and trains dozens of NFL and NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour, a junior defensive end from New Orleans, entered the
season as one of the top pro prospects at his position but played
in only eight games because of a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA finds that Seymour's involvement with Cooper was
indeed a rules violation, Florida State would be required to
declare him ineligible. Under those circumstances, he might not be
available for the top-ranked Seminoles' Sugar Bowl matchup with
Virginia Tech. Florida State also might be subject to institutional
penalties for allowing an ineligible player to participate
throughout the season. Forfeits, however, likely would not be
assessed if the school were found to have investigated the matter
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix did not respond to a message from the Chronicle on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour's relationship with Cooper came to Minnix's attention
when the player was linked to Houston sports agent Carl Poston by a
recruiter for a rival agent last summer. The recruiter contacted
Bill Saum, the NCAA's chief enforcement official for agent issues,
after seeing Seymour and Poston together at a Houston restaurant.
In talking to Saum, the recruiter mentioned Seymour was training
with Cooper and speculated that Poston was paying the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Minnix subsequently was told by Cooper that the trainer had
worked with Seymour for free. Minnix said he concluded Seymour had
not violated NCAA rules, because of Cooper's practice of routinely
providing free workouts for high school and college athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tallahassee Democrat story last week, Minnix said he had
discussed his opinion of the Seymour-Cooper matter last August with
Saum. According to the article, Saum did not disagree with Minnix's
view that Seymour was not in violation of NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Saum said last week he was prohibited by NCAA procedure from
discussing the matter publicly.

MCCAIN OPPOSES ETHANOL SUBSIDY, SEEKING TO GRAB SPOTLIGHT IN IOWA
GOP DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Arizona Sen. John
McCain tried to steal the spotlight from Texas Gov. George W. Bush
Monday night by taking a stand very much in keeping with his
maverick image, but in direct opposition to popular sentiment in
Iowa.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the third GOP presidential debate in two weeks, but the first
in Iowa featuring all six candidates, McCain proposed ending the
multimillion-dollar subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based fuel
additive that gives Iowa's hard-pressed farmers another market for
their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethanol is not worth it,'' McCain said in the nationally
televised debate from the Civic Center in downtown Des Moines. ``It
does not help the consumer. These ethanol subsidies should be
phased out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the GOP front-runner who leads in early Iowa polls,
disagreed. He said use of ethanol is good for air quality. It also
reduces reliance on foreign oil, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republican candidates agreed with Bush on the
economically dubious practice of converting corn surpluses into
fuel. But McCain's stand, surprising because, on its face, it would
seem to be broadly unpopular in Iowa, was certain to garner
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who chose to not compete in Iowa but to take part in
Monday's debate, has taken the lead in most polls in New Hampshire,
the state that holds the first primary in early February. He has
gained that lead by forging an image as a tell-it-as-it-is,
nontypical politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here on this stage, if it wasn't for the fact that
Iowa is the first caucus state, would share my view that we don't
need ethanol subsidies,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   His answer may prove more popular in New Hampshire, South
Carolina and other early primary states. Iowa's caucus on Jan. 24
will be the first significant political test in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Bush was asked whether he would commit to
nominating an anti-abortion vice-presidential running mate. As he
has in the past, Bush seemed to suggest that he would not.
</P>
<P>
   He said the key would be whether his running mate is qualified,
loyal and ``shares my conservative views.'' But he did not directly
address the abortion question.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also were asked to address how to fix societal
ills that led to the mass shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado. Former Ambassador Alan Keyes suggested the key was
outlawing abortion, a move that would ``restore the country's
allegiance to basic moral principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said he would be a president of integrity
who could approach the entertainment industry in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have the moral power to talk to those people,'' Hatch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the most important thing was enforcing existing gun
laws, a move that in itself would send a clear message to the rest
of the country and would make the country safer. In Texas, he said,
he worked to appropriate more money to counties so that district
attorneys could prosecute more people who used guns illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to send a signal: Don't be illegally selling guns,''
Bush said. ``Don't be illegally using guns.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that sometimes he doesn't know what his own
children are looking at on the Internet. He said the country must
learn more about the influence of the Internet on children.
Libraries, he added, should have filters on their computers that
make it impossible to log onto sites that promote violence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a third of the debate was spent by the Republicans
tearing at the Democratic administration for its foreign policy.
McCain and Keyes said President Clinton is not firm enough in
condemning Russian actions in Chechnya. Bush promised a Ronald
Reagan approach promoting a missile defense or muzzling nuclear
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer said the United States is too
subservient to international organizations, such as the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a former Reagan administration official, jabbed back at
Bush after hearing his criticism about Bauer's hard line on keeping
China out of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening up Chinese markets is good for Iowa farmers,'' Bush
said, but Bauer replied: ``You believe the Chinese will keep the
agreements. They haven't kept their agreements in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Center was ringed with police cars and clusters of
Bush and Forbes supporters, who gathered more than an hour early to
ensure backdrops for the television crews on pre-debate telecasts.
Forbes bused in some of his backers and loaded the back of a
mid-sized moving van with literature and give-away day-glow orange
T-shirts and stocking caps.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's face-off had several segments. At one point, the
candidates were allowed to ask each other questions. At another,
questions solicited from audience members were asked. The forum
also featured questions asked from moderators Tom Brokaw, NBC news
anchor, and John Bachman, WHO-TV anchor in Des Moines, directly to
the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Although expectations for Bush were high heading into Monday's
debate, one GOP consultant, Rich Galen, said the governor should be
pleased if he progressed as much between the second GOP debate and
Monday's forum as he did between the first and second face-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bush is on the right track,'' said Galen, a Bush
backer who once ran GOPAC, the political committee headed by former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday, the campaign will shift back to meetings with
small groups of Iowans, a setting where Bush excels, Galen said.
Campaigns have a natural ebb and flow, and McCain's rise in New
Hampshire is part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew it would get closer,'' Galen said of the GOP
nomination race. ``Bush's campaign is not even concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Nofziger, a Forbes backer and veteran of several Ronald
Reagan campaigns, said that Bush needed to go beyond canned
fragments of his speeches and display a great mastery of the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sticking with the prepared remarks hurt him in the last two
(debates),'' Nofziger said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate, Nofziger said, might have entertained political
junkies while passing with little notice among ordinary voters who
will troop to Iowa's caucuses just a month away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably won't be until after New Year's that people notice
these guys,'' he said. ``Right now they're more concerned with
Christmas shopping and the end of the college football season to
bother with politicians.''

HEARING SCHEDULED ON MINIMUM WAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The five-member Industrial Welfare Commission,
which has the authority to raise the minimum wage with or without
approval from the California state Legislature, will hold a public
hearing Wednesday in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is the first step in what is expected to be a
yearlong process to decide whether to increase the state's minimum
wage from its current $5.75 an hour. Every two years, the
commission is required to review the current minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Labor organizations and those who support a wage increase say a
dual-income couple can't earn enough money on minimum wage to
escape from living in poverty. Business organizations say an
increase in the minimum wage will lead to layoffs since businesses
can't pass on the higher costs to customers in a competitive world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes around $40,000 a year to support a family in
California, and clearly the minimum wage is nowhere near that,''
said Sharon Cornu, a spokeswoman for the California Labor
Federation. ``An increase in the minimum wage would reward hard
work and promote prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the California Labor Federation petitioned the IWC for the
hearing, Cornu said the organization has not determined how large
of a minimum wage increase it will ask the commission to implement.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone supports an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Broyles, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of
Commerce in Sacramento, said, ``There are other ways (instead of
raising the minimum wage) to make life more affordable for all
Californians, including making housing more affordable and lowering
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   California's minimum wage will soon become the lowest on the
West Coast. A successful 1996 ballot initiative in Oregon boosted
that state's minimum wage in three steps to $6.50 and hour this
year. In Washington, the minimum wage will increase to $6.50
beginning Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``With other states increasing their minimum wage, there is no
reason for California to be a low-wage state,'' Cornu said.
</P>
<P>
   Broyles, disagreed saying, ``If it's going to be raised it
should be done at the federal level, putting all states on a level
playing field instead of pitting one state against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, California's minimum wage is 60 cents higher than the
federal minimum wage of $5.15 per hour.

 McCAIN CHALLENGES BUSH ON HOME-GROWN ISSUE IN IOWA  
 (EDs: Adds quotes from McCain, Bush spokeswoman; edits to
tighten)  
 (For use by New York Times news service clients)   
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Arizona Sen. John McCain denounced federal
subsidies for ethanol in a debate before a belt-corn audience here
Monday, and he issued a pointed challenge to Texas Gov. George W.
Bush to seek an end ``soft money'' donations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush and the four other Republican presidential hopefuls
met for the first time in this crucial state in a debate that
focused on agricultural issues, morality and trade. Bush and McCain
dominated the 90-minute session, held in advance of the Jan. 24
Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew applause from the audience of 2,400 Republicans by
backing the federal subsidy for ethanol, a major issue among Iowa
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended his stand against ethanol, a gasoline additive
derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you things you don't want to hear,'' McCain
said. ``And one of those things is (about) ethanol.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has shunned Iowa because of his opposition to the $700
million-a-year ethanol subsidy, which he considers to be a
pork-barrel spending project. In denouncing ethanol, McCain
appeared to be playing the maverick card he has cultivated with
voters in other states, particularly New Hampshire, where polls
show the senator is giving Bush a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew a few boos and hisses from the Republican crowd for
his statement on the subsidies. He softened the blow a bit by
arguing that as a president promoting free trade, Iowa farmers
would make up for the loss of ethanol-related corn by exporting
more agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
   China, McCain said, ``will be eating Iowa pork and loving every
mouthful of it when I'm president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important that the voters of Iowa know where
I stand on the issues,'' McCain told reporters after the debate.
``The farmers of Iowa should want to be off subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain denied attempting to seek political advantage outside
Iowa through an ``in-your-face'' debate performance in a state
where he is not competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Florida and said I'm against sugar subsidies,''
McCain said. ``I'll go to Texas if they'll let me in and say I'm
against gas and oil subsidies. Those are the fundamental beliefs
that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is well ahead of his nearest competitor _ publishing
magnate Steve Forbes _ in Iowa polls, said he supports the ethanol
subsidy ``whether I'm in Iowa or not. ... It's good for the air
(and) it reduces our dependency on foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush was not tailoring his
message to Iowa voters during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's speaking to America as well as Iowa,'' Hughes said.
``Obviously Iowa is first, but one thing about George W. Bush is he
says the same thing whether he's in the barrio, the chamber of
commerce, or in a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked Bush to join him in pledging to end the power of
Washington lobbyists and ``soft money,'' the contributions to
political parties from corporate interests and unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stop it now,'' McCain said to Bush and the other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would like to ``talk to you about it sometime.''
When moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News pressed him for an answer,
Bush said he liked the idea of restricting soft money, but worried
it would hurt the Republican Party if nothing was done to control
the ability of unions to take portions of union-worker wages for
political activity _ most of it benefiting Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We better have paycheck protection or our conservative values
aren't worth a shot,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a conservative abortion foe and former Reagan
administration official, challenged Bush on trade with China. The
two argued over whether China would live up to trade agreements and
the regulatory framework that goes with China's admission to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stop China playing us for suckers,'' Bauer said to
Bush. ``The time for them playing us for suckers will end with my
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he called China ``evil'' and said the Beijing government
is the largest threat to U.S. power in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Bush argued that on balance trade with
China is preferable to the hard-line position taken by Bauer
because it opens China to possible democratization and helps the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something,'' Bush said. ``Opening up the
Chinese market is good for our farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also won applause for his answer to a question posed by the
moderators, Brokaw and local television anchor John Bachman, on
philosophers they admire. After Forbes talked about British
philosopher John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, Bush answered
``Christ, because he changed my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates seemed to agree on one thing: Despite solid
economic prosperity, American morals are in a tailspin and only the
strong moral leadership of a Republican president can straighten
them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president of the United States ought to set a
moral tone in this country,'' Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first thing a president can and should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the debate was Alan Keyes, a former State Department
official who called for a ban on abortion. The debate was televised
on the MSNBC cable channel.

DESPITE CRITICISM, MARINO WILL START 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CHARLES NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ As the airwaves in South Florida crackled with
criticism of the Miami Dolphins, particularly their celebrated
coach and veteran quarterback, Jimmy Johnson said Monday that he
was sticking with Dan Marino for Sunday's home game against San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Dan's our starting quarterback,'' Johnson said without
emotion at the team's practice facility. ``We've been inconsistent
at that position, but we feel like we can improve on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins lost to the Jets, 28-20, on Sunday and have become
a questionable playoff qualifier at 8-5 after a 7-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's loss, in which Marino was intercepted twice _
once for a touchdown _ and completed just 18 of 39 passes, Johnson
implied criticism of Marino by calling his offense ``hit and miss''
while claiming ``the running game wasn't the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was asked Monday about that veiled criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just say right now, any time we turn the football over
more than our opponent, that's going to be a negative with me,
however we turn the ball over,'' he said. ``When you've got a tight
ballgame and you turn it over, you're going to have a difficult
time winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that on Aaron Glenn's interception of a Marino pass
early in the fourth quarter _ which he called perhaps the key play
of the game because Miami soon lost its lead _ the Jets were in a
three-deep zone and that Marino ``should have dumped the ball off
to the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, has been erratic since returning from a neck injury
on Thanksgiving Day against Dallas. He has presided over three
straight losses, and the interception returned 67 yards by safety
Omar Stoutmire in the fourth quarter Sunday was the fifth Marino
turnover this season that has been returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his team played hard, just not effectively enough.
He walked out of his weekly news conference after less than 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly this is a trying time for Johnson, who won two Super
Bowls with Dallas but has been unable to win even a division title
with Miami in four years, quitting in frustration for a few days
after last season. He has been trying without success to remold
Marino, whose immobility and high-risk passing have not produced
the consistency Johnson covets, and their relationship has
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the Jets' victory, after Marino had been removed
from the game by his coach for inefficiency, the former Dolphins
tight end Jim Mandich told a radio audience, ``Jimmy Johnson and
Dan Marino _ one of these guys is not going to be here next year.''

IN A COURTHOUSE, A SPECTACLE OF HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN IN
PAKISTAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan _ Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's ousted prime
minister, is a pale and plump man who long ago lost most of his
hair. Under the courtroom's severe fluorescent lights, he often
sits with a slump, his face given over to a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   Two months back, he and his six co-defendants were among the
country's most powerful people. Now they appear pitiful, trying to
face a future that is not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Since an Oct. 12 military coup, these men have spent most of
their time in solitary confinement. Each time they are brought to
the stately British-era courthouse, they grimly plead for the
return of a few simple pleasures, asking the judge for a
television, a radio and a copy of the Koran. They also say they
want soft mattresses and food that is not slop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am forced to live like a caged animal,'' Sharif complained
once again Monday, describing the 7-by-10-foot stone-floor cell.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Shahbaz, the former chief minister of Punjab
Province, told the judge at a pretrial hearing: ``I am suffering
terrible back pain. I need exercise. It is inhumane.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahid Khakan Abbasi, the former director of the government
airline, said: ``We have not offered our prayers in nine weeks.
Even the Israelis allow their prisoners to say prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes on, Pakistan's great spectacle of how the mighty have
fallen. But there is no high drama here. People had reason to
expect much more in the way of courtroom theater.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are onetime members of the ruling elite and
they are accused of conspiring to kill 198 people, hijacking a
jetliner, kidnapping an army general and plotting to wage war
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead there have been weeks of procedural delays in beginning
the trial, which now seems unlikely to start before Dec. 27 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution seems reluctant to share its evidence. The
defendants contend that is because of a paucity of supply. ``It's
all cooked up,'' Sharif opined of the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its shortcomings, the case has a riveting story line: a
crowded commercial aircraft was carrying Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the
army Chief of Staff, to Karachi on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   He was as yet unaware that Sharif had fired him. The plane was
denied permission to land in Karachi. Finally, after some scary
airborne wandering, it was allowed to alight safely with a
near-empty gas tank _ but only after the military had staged a coup
and taken control of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, just days after appointing himself Pakistan's ``chief
executive,'' told the nation in a televised speech that Sharif and
his conspirators ``would have forced our plane either to land in
India or crash.'' He added: ``Providence ultimately intervened.
Praise be to Allah that the plane landed safely when barely seven
minutes of fuel was left.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, when the prosecution formally charged the seven
defendants, it turned over summaries of the statements of its own
53 witnesses _ the guts of its case.
</P>
<P>
   The collected stories make a sometimes-convoluted narrative and
one that could alternatively be read as the prime minister's
understandable efforts to head off a military coup after he
exercised his constitutional right to dismiss the army chief.
</P>
<P>
   Memories differ about the timing of events, and it is often
unclear who said what to whom at key moments. But witnesses seem to
agree that Sharif replaced his army chief by 5 p.m. on Oct. 12 and
that within the next 90 minutes the military took control of the
state television station and moved to surround the prime minister's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Sharif inquired about Musharraf's flight,
which was due in Karachi at 6:55 p.m. He wanted to divert the
plane, preferably out of the country _ to Muscat, in the United
Arab Emirates. But he was told that the aircraft lacked sufficient
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif then said that the plane might as well land in Karachi or
in nearby Nawabshah, says a statement by Zahid Mehmood, the
director of protocol at Sharif's house.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, there was some discussion about taking Musharraf
into custody. Finally, it was decided that no one should be taken
from the plane or allowed to leave. The flight was to be refueled
and sent on to Muscat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the plane, things were tense, the statements say.
The general and his aides were in the cockpit, making snap
decisions as instructions from the ground kept changing. As late as
6:53 p.m., the pilot was still being told he could not land in
Pakistan, said an air traffic controller, Manzoor Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal ended with a safe landing at 7:48. Musharraf left the
airliner, suddenly confronted with the option of governing this
nation of 140 million people. He decided, as he would say later,
that he viewed this as ``his destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's attorneys _ and some of his political confidantes _
raise questions about the timing of such destiny. Some contend that
a coup had been in the works for months. A few even argue that the
rebellion began as early as 10 a.m. and that the prime minister
fired Musharraf in reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, Sharif himself disputed that notion. In a brief
conversation before the hearing, he said, ``The coup began minutes
after the notification was issued'' of the general's dismissal.
``The army knew to head for the TV station and to refuse to allow
the news to be broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the sequence of events on Oct. 12 does not seem of great
interest in Pakistan _ or at least not in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has there been much protest about the solitary confinement
for the prisoners or about the ``protective custody'' of military
officers who were part of Sharif's inner circle on Oct. 12,
including Lt. Gen. Khwaja Ziauddin, the man Sharif had selected to
be his new army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In a few moments, court was in session and the famous
co-defendants were taking their turns begging for improved
treatment in the district jail. If they would be allowed
television, they said, they would gladly pay for the sets and leave
them behind as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who has been sympathetic to such requests, agreed to
this scheme, but the prosecutor, Raja Quershi, resisted until
finally, exasperated, he proclaimed, ``OK, let them have their
TVs.'' Then later, again nettled by the incessant complaints, the
prosecutor once more crankily relented. ``Yes, OK,'' he said. ``And
they can have their Korans.''

ING'S $10 BILLION BID  _  AND RETRACTION _ PUSHES SHARES OF A
FRENCH BANK UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands, France, Belgium, Britain)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Shares in one of the most profitable midsize French
banks, Credit Commercial de France, surged Friday after the ING
Groep, the biggest Dutch financial services group, first made and
then withdrew a $10 billion takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   ING, which has been on a shopping spree in recent years,
withdrew the bid early Monday after detecting what a spokesman
called a ``lack of enthusiasm'' on the part of Credit Commercial
management.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Ruud Polet, said that ``anything may happen now''
and that executives of both banks would see each other on Thursday,
when Credit Commercial's board is scheduled to meet in Paris.
Godfried van der Lugt, the acquisition-minded chief executive of
ING, which holds a 19.2 percent share in Credit Commercial, is a
director.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a letter from Van der Lugt to Credit Commercial's
management, ING offered to pay 137.5 euros in cash, or $139.34, a
premium of almost 15 percent to Credit Commercial's closing price
on Friday, valuing the bank at more than $10 billion. ING withdrew
that offer after Credit Commercial's board decided at an emergency
session late Sunday to publish it. Credit Commercial said its board
could not take immediate action, given that ING's offer was made
``suddenly, and without consultation.''
</P>
<P>
   Polet, the ING spokesman, said ING did not view Credit
Commercial's action as a rejection. Rather, it decided to withdraw
the offer because of a ``kind of lack of enthusiasm, a lack of
conviction, that made us think it was not the right moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading in shares of Credit Commercial was suspended Monday on
the Paris exchange until two hours after the market opened, and the
stock price surged more than 5 percent within minutes of the
resumption of trading, appearing to reflect a conviction among
investors that ING would sweeten its offer. Shares of Credit
Commercial rose 6.2 euros, or 5.2 percent, to 126 euros. In
Amsterdam, ING fell 0.60 euro, to 56.40 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expected ING to pursue its courtship of
Credit Commercial, the sixth-largest French bank by assets and one
of the most profitable. Thanks to a strong retail business and the
profitability of a fund unit, Banque de Louvre, Credit Commercial
has reported earnings increases in each of the last 12 years, an
unusual record among French banks. Last month, Credit Commercial
said third-quarter profit rose 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If a renewed bid succeeds, the move would provide another
example of European cross-border bank consolidation, an area ING
has pioneered. In recent years, ING bought Barings of Britain,
Banque Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium and BHF-Bank of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Czepliewicz, a bank analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
London, said there was ``no fundamental divergence of views''
between the two banks' managements and that he thought the bid
would be renewed. Credit Commercial, a midsize high-quality bank
available for a reasonable price, neatly fits ING's acquisition
pattern and would give it a foothold in the French market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One possible rival bidder, KBC Bancassurance of Belgium, the
second-largest shareholder in Credit Commercial with an 18.2
percent share, said today that it would not make a competing offer.
Swiss Life, the third-largest shareholder with 14.7 percent, said
it would not comment. KBC is a unit of Almanij.
</P>
<P>
   Charles de Croisset, Credit Commercial's chairman and chief
executive, has said in the past that he was open to discussion of a
merger, and in October he reacted to news reports of a possible
takeover bid for the bank by hiring as advisers Rothschild &AMP;
Compagnie and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ING is being advised by
J.P. Morgan.

THROWING THE BOOK AT KOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If all you want for Christmas is to trade places
with Kobe Bryant, if you'd go to the North Pole and back to be able
to give him your student-loan payment book in exchange for his
black book with Michael Jordan's phone number in it and prom date
Brandy's and fellow adidas client Peyton Manning's, then you really
ought to ask Santa for author Roland Lazenby's latest work, ``Mad
Game.'' Subtitled, ``The NBA Education of Kobe Bryant,'' the
313-page biography is proof that there is no such thing as a
charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bryant has a free pass from gravity that's not expected to
expire anytime soon, a $71 million contract with the Los Angeles
Lakers, his own signature sneaker and a rap album that's set for
release in March.
</P>
<P>
   He's like Mike, all right. But as Lazenby's book makes
startlingly clear, Bryant, 21, also is like you and me, tiptoeing
around hostile co-workers and getting blamed for every little thing
that goes wrong on the job and knowing at least one of the smiling
faces he sees every day is trashing him behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   We already knew Bryant was young and headstrong. We knew he was
clean-cut and conscientious and, yes, cocky, sometimes attempting
too much on the court because in his mind no play is impossible to
pull off. Until we got to page 230 of Lazenby's book, though, we
had no idea Bryant ``is a little prick is what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   That fetching description came courtesy of someone Lazenby
identifies only as a longtime Lakers employee. Lazenby's source _
for our purposes he'll heretofore be known as Sore Throat _
unleashes enough vitriol to poison popular opinion on Bryant on
page after page. The source complains that Bryant ``has this
attitude: You may be Shaquille O'Neal but I'm Kobe Bryant. I'm
every bit the player you are plus some.''
</P>
<P>
   Sore Throat also describes how the Lakers assembled for
players-only meetings at various times throughout last year's
truncated season to address Bryant's selfishness on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, nowhere is it mentioned whether or not O'Neal's
insistence on shooting off-balance shots while double-teamed or
holding onto defensive rebounds to slow the fast break was likewise
addressed at these gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the allegiance of this unidentified source is so easy to
discern, by the time Lazenby gets around to describing this person
as someone ``close to O'Neal,'' this reader's reaction was, Do you
think????
</P>
<P>
   Bryant sighed after practice the other day when some of Sore
Throat's quotes were read back to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you see what I have to put up with,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lamar Odom is smart he'll go to school on Bryant, and we're
not talking on the court tonight when Odom's Clippers play host to
the Lakers at the Staples Center in the first meeting of the two
phenoms.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, 20, has them all smiling in Clipperville now. It's early
yet. Just wait until Odom delivers a breakout performance in an
All-Star Game and the NBA develops eyes only for him and then we'll
measure the temperature in the Clippers' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't have to be an investigative reporter to deduce the
Lakers were a team divided last year under coach Del Harris and his
replacement, Kurt Rambis. And yet even Bryant was taken aback when
he read the galleys of the book and realized how deep the fissure
was.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash doesn't bother him as much as it baffles him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever was the source of those quotes might have some
serious issues,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the quotes do seem so spiteful as to seem unreal. When
Sore Throat talks about how the one constant in last year's chaotic
season was ``the team's dislike of Kobe'' or that when things go
badly ``it's never Kobe's fault,'' it struck this reader as so
skewed it might as well have been made up.
</P>
<P>
   Lazenby, though, is adamant; he is no Edmund Morris, mixing fact
with fiction in order to buttress a biographical tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a made-up person,'' Lazenby said Monday when reached
at the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg where he teaches
journalism classes. ``My source is a very real person who was
reflecting an attitude that was prevalent in the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazenby, who has written a handful of sports books, including
one on the Lakers that was published in 1993, spent months hanging
out with last season's team. The thesis he formed over time, he
said, was, ``Get off Kobe's back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the attitudes I saw infuriated me, too,'' Lazenby
said. ``My point in writing this book was to have the reader say,
`Wow! Look at the attitudes Kobe has had to battle against.''
</P>
<P>
   Those, on top of all the pressures he had to deal with coming to
the NBA straight out of high school and being labeled a knight in
teen-ager's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being compared to Michael Jordan. When Jordan was
Bryant's age, he wasn't the player who would redefine the game,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant understands he's a work in progress. He's the first one
to admit he has a lot of learning left to do.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball circles his type is called ``coachable.'' Let's
just say there are a lot worse raps.
</P>
<P>
   There's a passage in Lazenby's book in which Sore Throat says of
Bryant, ``When Kobe makes a turnover it totally deflates the whole
team ... because he doesn't make a turnover trying to help the team
win. He makes a turnover out of selfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   The quote was one of a few relayed to Bryant two days after he
committed six turnovers in a loss to Sacramento. He didn't flinch.
He didn't wince. He said matter-of-factly, ``Some of what was said
(in the book) might have had some truth to it.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. In one sentence Bryant owned up to more
missteps than many of his colleagues will in any one season.
</P>
<P>
   Under Phil Jackson, the Lakers have looked more fraternal than
fractious. Bryant, though, continues to proceed cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he toiled the nights away in a recording studio,
cutting a rap album. Not surprisingly, trust emerged as a recurring
theme in his songs. To read ``Mad Game'' is to better understand
why.

SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES RE-ENGINEERED FOR THE OLD WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A typical ad for a Hyundai Galloper reads like a zoology
text: ``Strong and Savage, Lives in Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Motor and other automakers have introduced such ads to
persuade Europeans to buy an unlikely animal, a native of North
America that has been bred successfully in the Far East and is now
spreading to the narrow lanes and congested cities of Western
Europe: the sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomical gas prices and a tradition of compact cars would
seem to make most of Europe less hospitable than the United States
to sport utilities. Yet Europeans _ to the delight of auto industry
executives but to the dismay of environmentalists and traffic
planners _ are taking to the vehicles in a big way, moving up from
their midget Fiat Cinquecentos and Renault Twingos.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the models sold in Europe, sometimes
modified versions of their trans-Atlantic kin, are smaller and more
fuel-efficient than the behemoths found on American roads. But some
larger models are also attracting buyers.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of relative stability, European sales of the
high-riding sport utilities surged 26 percent last year, four times
the rate of the overall passenger vehicle market, to 464,400. This
year, they are expected to grow another 21 percent, to roughly
564,200, again four times the pace of the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that number represents only about 3.7 percent of the
total number of new passenger vehicles registered, far lower than
in the United States, where last year sport utilities made up 16
percent of the market. The growth in Europe last year and this year
was fueled by the introduction of new models like the Land Rover
Freelander, the new Honda HR-V and the General Motors Corp.'s
updated Frontera from its Opel division, all smaller than the
standard sport utility and hence better attuned to European roads.
And with virtually every major manufacturer preparing an entry or
already selling one, Europe's flirtation with sport utilities is
expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still latent demand in Western Europe for this
thing,'' said Nigel Griffith, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
in London. ``There are still cowboys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, General Motors replaced its old Frontera, which was
essentially an Isuzu Rodeo for the European market, and sold 25,000
of the new model. This year, it expects to sell 37,000 Fronteras,
which are built at a factory in Britain. In just the first eight
months of this year, Honda Motor sold more than 17,000 HR-V's, its
new sporty, two-door hatchback similar to the CR-V in the United
States, lifting its total European sales of sport utility vehicles
to more than 41,000 _ almost as many as it sold in Europe in all of
last year. And Land Rover, part of the BMW-owned Rover Group, sold
more than 40,000 Freelanders last year, the model's first year.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by such successes, Fiat Auto announced this summer
that it would invest $122 million in a joint venture with
Mitsubishi Motors to build a sport utility at a factory outside
Turin, Italy. Renault of France says that early next year it will
introduce a utility, its first since bowing out of Jeep 12 years
ago when it sold its controlling stake in American Motors to
Chrysler. And Ford Motor is planning a downsized sport utility
vehicle next year that will be more fuel efficient than the
Explorer, its smallest model now, in part to meet the mounting
European competition.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the offerings for the more pampered European
motorists. The Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler had such
success in Europe with its M-class utility, which is assembled in
Alabama mainly for the North American market, that it started
production of the M-class in July at a factory in Graz, Austria. In
Italy, Mitsubishi is manufacturing the Pajero Pinin, an upscale
model that it developed with the Italian design house Pininfarina.
BMW has decided to introduce a European version of its new luxury
X5, which goes on sale in the United States in December.
</P>
<P>
   To outdo them all, Volkswagen plans to trot out its first two
sport utilities by 2002. One, a mid-priced Volkswagen, will be
built at a factory in Slovakia, while a more expensive version that
is part of a joint venture with Porsche will be assembled at the
same factory, then gussied up with a fancy Porsche interior and a
more powerful engine at a factory Porsche is building in Leipzig,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Because European roads are smaller than in the United States and
gas prices higher, automakers have bred a miniature species of
sport utilities for Europe. Honda's new two-door HR-V, for
instance, at 13 feet 6 inches, is 28 inches shorter than the Ford
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities imported from the United States are trimmed to meet
European tastes and requirements. Chrysler, which imports the
Wrangler and the Cherokee from the United States, and assembles the
Grand Cherokee at the factory in Austria where Mercedes makes the
M-class, builds different seats and a stiffer suspension into its
European cars and installs wipers and lights that conform to
European standards.
</P>
<P>
   Because of high gas prices (in Italy, for example, unleaded gas
can cost more than $4.50 a gallon), many sport utility vehicles in
Europe have diesel engines, since diesel fuel is cheaper. And most
European utilities have 4-cylinder engines, which use less gas than
the V6 or big V8 engines in comparable American models.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the sport utility was dreamed up by
American automakers as essentially a pickup truck with a roof over
the bed and extra rows of seats, and then successfully copied by
Japanese manufacturers. In Europe, by contrast, it was first
popularized by the Japanese, who created the market by introducing
smaller, more economical utility they had designed for congested
Asian cities, and then copied by other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese created the market from scratch,'' said Daniel T.
Jones, a professor of auto industry management at the Cardiff
University business school in Wales. ``And everyone piled in behind
the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   European automakers like the SUV for the same reason their
American counterparts do: fat cars make fat profits. Yet the
growing competition in Europe, as more and more models flood the
market, has depressed profit margins below those in the United
States. Moreover, small production runs, usually of 30,000 to
40,000 vehicles, prevent the economies of scale that benefit
manufacturers in the United States, where runs are often five to
six times that size.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, Jones said, the Europeans often share
development costs with partners and borrow equipment from existing
models. Thus, the platform for Renault's new sport utility will be
adapted from its highly successful Scenic line of cars. The
mechanical equipment for Fiat's new entry will come from
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the automakers charge far higher prices in Europe for
the same models they sell in the United States. A Chrysler Grand
Cherokee, for instance, sells for up to 300,000 francs in France,
or more than $46,000, compared with about $35,000 in the United
States. The manufacturers explain the difference by citing
transportation costs, European taxes, and the expense of outfitting
the cars to meet European standards. European consumers don't seem
discouraged from buying.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so many luxury carmakers are rushing into the market
that a new category of high-priced, high-performance sport utility
vehicle is emerging _ populated with the likes of BMW's X5,
Mercedes-Benz's M-class and Porsche's planned offering _ that is
blurring the very definition of a utility. Thomas Zauber, a BMW
spokesman in Munich, emphasized that ``we don't say sport utility
vehicle, we say sport activity vehicle, as opposed to off-road
varieties.'' BMW, he said, believes that ``the market is beginning
to differentiate, and we believe it's going to grow in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, said Griffith of DRI, ``the market is about a
statement of self-image, what people want to project to other
people, and not just about moving from point A to point B.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call the vehicles, more and more Europeans are
buying them, and for much the same reasons as their Americans
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got maximum safety, even if going off-road to pick
mushrooms,'' said Mario Roccabella, who drives a Suzuki Vitara, a
small utility. Indeed, Roccabella, a 48-year-old auto salesman in
Rome, got so hooked on his own vehicle several years ago that he
began selling several brands, including Land Rovers, Mitsubishis
and Subarus, and now organizes rallies for S.U.V. owners. Even in
labyrinthine Rome, he said, sport utilities abound, offering
greater vision because of their height, and a relatively smooth
ride ``even though the streets are made of Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental objections to the vehicles have not yet arisen,
and some countries, like Italy _ now one of the hottest markets _
have even abolished taxes they once levied on off-road vehicles to
discourage their spread, under pressure from automakers as well as
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Some automakers and environmentalists cite the relatively low
market share of sport utility vehicles, their smaller size in
Europe and greater fuel efficiency as reasons an environmental
debate has not erupted in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some European motorists are already griping about sport
utility drivers who hog the road in extremely congested cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it very much the way they look down at you from
so high up,'' said Ann-Henri Le Gouvello, 55, who owns a soup
company in Rambouillet, France, and who uses a four-door
Mercedes-Benz 300GE _ hardly a subcompact _ to drive to Paris or go
hunting near his Rambouillet home. He sniffed at what he deemed
pretentious city dwellers in their showy all-wheel drive vehicles,
saying, ``They use them to drive only in the city, and they never
leave the road with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite fears that too many of the vehicles are on the
drawing board, the automakers are accelerating their plans,
pointing not only to growth in Europe but the potential for export.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Reuter, a spokesman for Ford Europe, said its new, smaller
model was designed for North America, Europe and Asia. Volkswagen
expects to sell some of its new Volkswagen and Porsche utilities
abroad; roughly half the 20,000 Porsches it will build will be sold
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never would have done it just for Europe,'' said Griffith
of Standard &AMP; Poor's.

sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he
flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to
he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the
absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a
respectful whistle.

smiles in collapsed, wrinkled cheeks. People I know are already
dying and others I've known are already dead. We don't look that
beautiful now. We wear glasses and are growing hard of hearing, we
sometimes talk too much, repeat ourselves, things grow on us, even
the most minor bruises take longer to heal and leave telltale

SECURITY COUNCIL BACKS OFF _ AGAIN _ ON VOTE ON INSPECTIONS FOR
IRAQ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council backed away from a vote
that had been planned for Monday on a new arms inspection system
for Iraq. Diplomats said that foreign ministers of the five
permanent council members were still conferring by telephone in
hope of broadening support for the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to create a new disarmament commission for Iraq and a
new program for the Iraqis to follow that would lead to a
suspension of nine years of sanctions had first been tentatively
planned for last Friday, then Saturday, then Monday. Action is now
possible on Tuesday, but that is also not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats seemed in the dark about exactly what was being
discussed at a higher level, since it was fairly clear that of the
five veto-bearing permanent members of the 15-member council,
Britain and the United States will vote for the measure and Russia
and China are thought likely to abstain. Some diplomats said Monday
that the delay was intended to give more time to efforts to
persuade Russia to vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   France, which last week appeared ready to support the
resolution, now seems to be slipping back toward abstention,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has put pressure on Russia and France, traditional business
partners, to stop the move toward new arms inspections, and
France's hesitation may reflect its desire not to leave itself
exposed in Iraq by breaking ranks with Russia. The French have
talked the most in recent weeks about holding out for the broadest
consensus. France's U.N. representative, Alain Dejammet, said that
France had proposed changes in the resolution to help the Russians
support it.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis argue that they have met all the requirements for a
lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and would agree to international
monitoring only after the embargo is gone. The resolution before
the council would lift the limit on Iraqi oil sales immediately and
make import procedures easier, but would keep controls on how Iraq
spent its money until it had met requirements yet to be framed by a
new arms inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says that this is too vague a goal line for Iraq, and
would like to have tasks spelled out in advance. Under a resolution
after the 1991 gulf war, Iraq was required to destroy all its
weapons of mass destruction and the means to make new ones. Much of
the Iraqi arsenal was eliminated, but questions remain about the
biological weapons, which Iraq at first denied having, and nuclear
programs, which inspectors from the International Atomic Energy
Agency found to be more advanced than expected. Fears that both
those programs have continued run high among disarmament experts.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arab diplomats, watching the year-long process of trying to
replace an arms inspection system that ended with British and
American air strikes against Iraq last December, question whether
the United States really wants an effective monitoring operation in
Iraq, which would make independent American military action more
complicated, or whether Washington is backing the new plan on the
assumption that Iraq would block it, thus providing a pretext for
more bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi rejection of the plan would allow sanctions against Iraq
to remain indefinitely _ or until Arab nations and more distant
friends of Iraq are prepared to begin breaking the embargo. The
Clinton administration appears willing to gamble that the embargo
will hold, at least in the near future, while it tries to
strengthen an Iraqi exile opposition in the hope of toppling
President Saddam Hussein.

TOP ATHLETES COUNTDOWN IS A BIG STEP UP FOR ESPN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've watched ESPN's ``SportsCentury'' countdown, your
choices for the century's greatest North American athletes may
differ from the cable network's. But who ranks where is irrelevant
_ except as fodder for amusing debates that go nowhere _ because
the 50 profiles stand as ESPN's most creative work in its 20-year
history. They, not their order, demand attention.
</P>
<P>
   They're packed with surprises (an old friend of Lou Gehrig's
weeping in remembrance), distinguished by balance and enterprise in
finding people who are not the usual interview suspects, and made
memorable by a sensual visual style.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Jack Nicklaus entry. In the five-minute opening
segment, cameras slowly wash over the Scottish links of St.
Andrews, and the Irish course at Turnberry, to convey golf's
ancient history and the meaning of the British Open to Nicklaus.
This storytelling device transports you to where golf began, and
offers an unexpected window into Nicklaus' psychology. ``I like the
old stuff, what was,'' Nicklaus says. Recalling Nicklaus' victory
at the 1970 British Open at St. Andrews, Tom Jarrett, the course
historian, says in a voice made for golf, ``He took off his
pullover, opened his shoulders and slammed a mighty shot onto the
18th hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to Nicklaus' appearance in next year's British
Open at the historic links, the Royal and Ancient Club's Michael
Bonallack says, ``Everyone will have a tingle down the spine. I'll
bet Jack will have a tear in his eye.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of editorial decision alters expectations for a
television profile. How much more can you know or feel about a
great athlete? More, this series proves.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to open the Nicklaus profile in Scotland is a
reminder of other smart choices, like focusing on races lost by the
hurdler Edwin Moses, not the 122 he won consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's profile of Jim Thorpe, which opens with a nighttime
tribal Indian dance, is the saddest of the 50 in ESPN's series:
from the schools that wrung the American Indian heritage from
youngsters like Thorpe to his burial in a town he never saw, but
which paid his widow for the right to change its name to his.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's Olympic and baseball feats are recounted, but serve as
prologue to his being stripped of his 1912 Olympic gold medals for
playing minor league baseball to his slide into obscurity as a
bouncer, ditch digger and movie extra. There is more eloquence in
the people interviewed for this profile than in any other because
of the bittersweet subject. Skip Rozin, a writer, on Thorpe's
post-athletic career: ``Like soldiers who can't deal with
peacetime, here is a man who couldn't live without sports.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Grace Thorpe: ``I remember dropping him off for
him to pick up the bus and the bus stop was right in the middle of
the theater and the marquee was right where I dropped him off. I
waved at him and right up there it said, `Jim Thorpe,
All-American.' And that's the last I saw of Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to judge the craft of a ``SportsCentury'' profile is to
compare it to a longer documentary about the same subject.
</P>
<P>
   Take Johnny Unitas. The great Baltimore Colt quarterback was
ESPN's subject earlier this year, and HBO's last week in a
60-minute documentary done with NFL Films as part of its league
deal to continue producing the weekly program, ``Inside the NFL''
</P>
<P>
   Unitas is prickly and unreflective, letting his gridiron feats
speak for a life he says little about. Both works capture Unitas
but the ``SportsCentury'' profile grasps him equally well in less
than half the time. Many of the stories are the same _ his anger at
being cut by the PIttsburgh Steelers, his problems with Coach Don
Shula's hollering style and his late entrance into Super Bowl III
against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Each features interviews with teammates and opponents but ESPN
shows more enterprise: snaring an assistant coach at Louisville,
where Unitas played; a teammate on the semipro team he played for
after the Steelers cut him; his brother, Leonard, and his sister,
Shirley. Her memory of their widowed mother's philosophy says much
about the man Unitas became. ``If you had a need, it would be
discussed,'' she says. ``If it was a want, she didn't want to hear
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO devotes more time to the beloved place Unitas held in 1950s
and 1960's Baltimore _ sounding very similar to that of the Dodgers
in Brooklyn _ and made generous use of NFL archives. Despite the
league connection, HBO notes Unitas' failed campaign to receive
league disability benefits for an elbow injury suffered in 1968
that has rendered his right thumb and index finger unusable.
</P>
<P>
   The HBO documentary also recalls a macho story of Unitas' being
hammered to the turf in a game against Chicago. His face, upper lip
and nose bloodied, he threw a game-winning touchdown pass. ``That's
no big deal,'' he says. ``I don't throw with my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, neither work discusses his wife or children, and
only ESPN's details his many business failures, including losing
his Colts consulting job because he handicapped for a gambling tip
sheet. ``He was too trusting, that's all,'' says Leonard Unitas.
</P>
<P>
   Now ESPN faces a new test: as the countdown heads to No. 1, it
will be fascinating to see how well-chronicled lives like Muhammad
Ali's, Babe Ruth's and Michael Jordan's can be freshened up. Expect
the unexpected. &QL;

HIGH COURT'S PLATE PILED WITH TOUGH ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its last term, the Supreme Court breezed through
75 decisions and finished its work on June 23, for the earliest
closing in 30 years. This term, the justices will also decide about
75 cases, but at the rate they are going now they will be lucky to
make it home by next Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The court began its end-of-year recess Monday, having decided
only two cases since the term began on the first Monday of October.
That compares with an average of more than eight cases the court
had decided by this time in the preceding 10 terms.
</P>
<P>
   Equally telling, the court in recent years has been issuing its
first opinions in the first few days of November. This term, the
first opinions that actually decided cases (there was one earlier
ruling that simply asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to advise
the court on a question of Pennsylvania law raised by a pending
case) did not come until Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But telling of what? Impending gridlock? An obvious possibility.
Sleeping on the job? Emphatically not. Far from shirking its
responsibilities, the court has arguably taken on too much, and is
in the position of a boy with eyes too big for his stomach and too
many desserts piled on his plate. The reason the justices have
decided so few cases is almost surely that they have so many hard,
sharply contested and terrifically important ones on their plate.
</P>
<P>
   Case by case, exercising the discretion that permits them to
turn down 99 cases for every one they decide to hear, the justices
have been constructing a term fit for the millennium, in which many
of the most important principles of constitutional law are up for
review.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERALISM: There are six cases on the docket that address the
validity of the country's essential structural arrangements. The
cases test everything from the states' authority to carry out their
own views of foreign policy to the authority of Congress to make
states accountable for civil rights violations. Three of the
federalism cases have been argued and remain undecided; if the
recent past is a guide, the votes will be very close and the
dissenting opinions bitter.
</P>
<P>
   RACE: It is a safe guess that an unusual case from Hawaii about
an election open only to descendants of the native Hawaiians,
argued in the first week of the term and still undecided, has
struck at least some justices as raising broader questions of
racial preferences in public policy.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION: It is too soon to expect a decision in a case argued
this month that opens the door to revisiting old debates about
government aid to religious schools. Meanwhile, the justices have
agreed to take a new look at organized school prayer, in the
context of students' petitions for God's blessing on public high
school football games.
</P>
<P>
   FREE SPEECH: A Missouri case on whether the $1,000 limit on
campaign contributions is too restrictive of political speech was
argued on the second day of the term and remains undecided as the
election calendar moves forward. A case on the First Amendment
implications of mandatory student activity fees was argued in early
November, as was a case on nude dancing as a form of protected
expression. This month, the court heard a case on federal limits on
indecent programming on cable television, a question that
essentially defeated the justices when they last tried to tackle it
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   DUE PROCESS: A case to be argued next month on whether states
can give grandparents and others the right to petition for
visitation with children who are not their own, over the parents'
objections, raises intriguing questions of due process and parental
rights.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONERS' RIGHTS: If the world knows anything about the current
term, it is that the justices have the opportunity, in an appeal
they accepted last week, to reconsider the 33-year-old Miranda
decision.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickerson vs. United States may be the highest profile
case of the term, it is not necessarily the most challenging, even
in the area of criminal law, for a court that has not displayed any
particular appetite for revisiting Miranda. On the first day of the
term, the justices heard their most important case so far under the
1996 law that limited state prisoners' access to federal courts.
That case remains undecided. A challenge to Florida's continued use
of the electric chair presents an interesting task to a court that
is deeply divided over the meaning of cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hard cases are scattered throughout the year _ the
electric chair case will be argued in February _ the term seemed
disproportionately front-loaded. Of the 10 cases argued in October,
most appeared preordained to produce the sharp divisions that,
inferring from the court's delay, they evidently have. But some of
these cases raise issues that have not been conclusively resolved
in more than 200 years of the country's history. That the Supreme
Court has not managed to wrap them up neatly in three months should
be the occasion for neither blame nor surprise.

SPORTS COLUMN: FASSEL'S RUN ORIGINATED WITH A TIRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ First of all, let's set the record
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, the Giants are not undefeated in the
month of December since Jim Fassel became coach. True, they have
won all nine regular-season games in December, but they also lost a
playoff game to the Minnesota Vikings in that month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 9-0 under any kind of condition _ home games, grass
games, day games, games against losing teams _ is admirable for any
coach, any team. No wonder people overlook that 23-22 loss to the
Vikings in Fassel's first season.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel was asked Monday why his team excels when the weather
gets damp and chilly in the swamplands. He declined to offer any
fanciful full-moon theories, or credit any exotic meteorological or
horoscope factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only remember what you do in December,'' he recited, a
little ditty suggesting December is generally the month when teams
either qualify for the playoffs or go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year is the toughest part of the schedule,''
Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is for the Giants, with three contenders _ St.
Louis, Minnesota and Dallas _ looming. The Giants can qualify for
the playoffs by winning all three games, which will not be easy,
but at least they have the streak going for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things written about us, they start believing in
them,'' Fassel said Monday after giving the players a day off after
the 19-17 victory at Buffalo. ``You start to take the field
believing in yourself, but they make it happen,'' he said. ``It's
not just a matter of reading your clips.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he remembered how the streak began, Fassel deliberated
and allowed as how he vaguely remembered something.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year, we played poorly in one game; I went into the
next zone,'' Fassel just happened to recall. ``This was a time when
you could fold your tents. I went way beyond. It was ugly. But they
responded. So I said, `Hey, maybe I don't have to go there
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel got it exactly right. It all dates back to Nov. 30, 1997,
when the Giants lost to Tampa Bay, 20-8, and Fassel closed the
locker room. In the next day's paper, Bill Pennington of The New
York Times reported that Fassel had been ``emptying his opinions
and his emotions in a red-faced harangue that threatened the jobs
of starting players on the team's feeble offensive unit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In shouts that filled the Giants' cavernous dressing
quarters,'' Pennington continued, ``Fassel also told the team that
it may have lost its hunger at the worst possible time: in a
playoff hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach did not hide his feelings from the news media after
that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way we played the football game,''
Fassel told reporters. ``We're not hitting on any cylinders. There
were mental mistakes, a lack of execution, a lack of
aggressiveness. It was a very disappointing loss.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fassel's outburst, a few defensive players headed off bad
feelings toward the unproductive offensive unit. The coach himself
threatened Danny Kanell with demotion from starting quarterback,
and eventually Kanell and Dave Brown were purged, while the Giants
have not lost a regular-season game in December since. Fassel has
not repeated his diatribe, which he said was totally spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do a lick of calculation,'' Fassel said Monday. ``I
don't act like I'm ticked. They can see it. They can tell if you
are play-acting. I always speak my heart. They're with me too much.
They could get tired of it. They know when I'm mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in his third season, Fassel does not seem to make his
players' eyes glaze when he talks. Percy Ellsworth, one of the
safeties, said he had been wondering, ``What can he say to make me
come out and fight?' Ellsworth found out: ``It was amazing. He came
in both times and was able to rally the troops. I don't know how he
did it, but he knew the exact right things to say and we all came
out fighting. It has to be him. He never gives up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has faced another offense-defense rift, which he defused
by confronting Michael Strahan, the chief critic. Fassel has once
again shifted quarterbacks, from Kent Graham to Kerry Collins. And
he said Monday that he had more time for the mood of the team
``since I gave up some duties with play calling,'' to Sean Payton,
his quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Because the season began late this year, the final game at
Dallas game will take place two days into the new century. The
Giants have not yet played in January under Fassel, but they are
about to find out if the December touch has any carry-over value. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 2,000-year-old Mayan stone carving that police
detectives discovered in a Brooklyn garage last month will soon be
shipped back to Guatemala, where the authorities believe the piece
was plundered from a ruin, the Guatemalan consul general in New
York said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The consul, Fabiola Fuentes, said the authorities in her country
consider the carving _ a 500-pound oblong stone depicting a jaguar
clutching a man _ to be priceless. Ms. Fuentes said she expected
the carving to be shipped in the coming weeks to the National
Museum of Anthropology and History in Guatemala City, where
specialists would try to determine from which ruins the object was
looted.
</P>
<P>
   The carving, which may date back as far as 150 B.C., was found
on Nov. 12 packed in a crate in a garage on Pitkin Avenue in the
East New York section of Brooklyn after the police received an
anonymous tip. Detective Ruben Santiago of the Major Case Squad
said investigators determined that the tenants of the house and the
landlord knew nothing about the carving, and no arrests were made.
Detective Santiago said the theft might have been committed by a
ring trafficking in stolen artifacts. ``There is a problem with
things being smuggled,'' he said. ``This is not the only piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fuentes said that after detectives notified her about the
discovery, she sent photographs of the carving to the Ministry of
Cultural Affairs in Guatemala. Although archaeologists there could
not determine the artifact's precise origin, Ms. Fuentes said, they
said features on the stone were very similar to other Mayan
carvings found in the Guatemalan highlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that the piece is from Guatemala,'' Ms.
Fuentes said. ``They have experts, and they determined that the
piece comes from Guatemala. They know with precision the
characteristics of the monuments of Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts familiar with Mayan artifacts say the theft was no
surprise. Despite international treaties barring the export of
ancient artifacts, the sale of stolen carvings and pottery from
Guatemala and other countries in Central America where the Mayans
flourished has been a problem for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the valuable ones have been carved up and taken away
already,'' said Ian Graham, an archaeologist at the Peabody Museum
of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. In August,
Graham alerted the authorities that a 1,000-year-old artifact,
which was being offered for sale by an American collector, had been
stolen from Guatemala years before.
</P>
<P>
   For the Guatemalan authorities, putting a stop to the looting is
difficult in large part because many of the richest sites are
heavily forested and difficult to patrol. Ms. Fuentes also said the
Guatemalan officials believed that the thieves worked for powerful
criminal rings, possibly tied to drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to establish how much we lose because there are so
many small pieces taken, instruments and pottery and even
monuments, like the big one that we lost,'' Ms. Fuentes said.
``It's hard to imagine, but these people have so much logistical
and economic power in order to move these pieces from the
country.''

PEARL RESNICK, PHILANTHROPIST AND HEAD OF REAL ESTATE FAMILY, DIES
AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pearl Resnick, the matriarch of a prominent New York real estate
family and a philanthropist, died Mondayat a hospital in West Palm
Beach, Fla. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Resnick, whose maiden name was Ezaak, was born on Jan. 3,
1912, in Okna, Ukraine. She came to the United States with her
family in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, she married Jack Resnick, who had started a
small real estate business in 1928. It grew into one of New York's
largest development and construction companies, Jack Resnick &AMP;
Sons. Resnick died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Resnick was a member of the board of overseers of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she was also a trustee at Yeshiva and a major
contributor to both institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Resnicks established the Jack and Pearl Resnick
Gerontology Center and the Jack and Pearl Resnick Fellowship in
Geriatrics at Albert Einstein. Mrs. Resnick also endowed an
academic chair in brain tumor research in memory of her daughter,
Susan Resnick Fisher, who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the Resnick's support, the campus of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine was named in their honor in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Gershon Kekst, president of Kekst &AMP; Co., a New York public
relations firm, said that Mrs. Resnick's character and charm were
as important as her ability to raise money. Kekst, who is chairman
of the Jewish Theological Seminary, recalled that about eight years
ago, when the seminary was in financial straits, Mrs. Resnick
joined the board and put everyone at ease. Kekst said that after a
board meeting, Mrs. Resnick told him: ``That was a very good
meeting. Things are going to be all right.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Resnick was a board member of Bar-Ilan University near Tel
Aviv. She and her husband also helped finance the Jack and Pearl
Resnick Film Division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sons, Burton P. Resnick of Rye, N.Y., and
Ira Resnick of Manhattan; a daughter, Marilyn Katz of Purchase,
N.Y.; a sister, Anna Sherman of Yonkers; 10 grandchildren; and 5
great-grandchildren.

FOUR TEAMS SWING NINE-PLAYER TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ In his relatively short tenure as the Oakland
Athletics' general manager, Billy Beane had never held such power
in his hands. ``I can blow this whole thing apart,'' he told
colleagues in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But Beane was only joking. He had to supply the last piece of
the puzzle Monday, and he was not going to withhold it. He agreed
to trade Jimmy Haynes to the Milwaukee Brewers, and the first
four-team trade in 14 years was complete.
</P>
<P>
   With Beane playing the most crucial though least significant
role in terms of the player he included and the one he got back,
the Brewers, the Colorado Rockies, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the
Athletics sent nine players and $1.05 million in various
helter-skelter directions.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct part of the unusual and intricate transaction
had the Rockies trading Vinny Castilla, their good-hitting third
baseman, to the Devil Rays for Rolando Arrojo, a pitcher, and Aaron
Ledesma, a utility infielder. The Rockies also sent Jamey Wright, a
young starting pitcher, and Henry Blanco, a good defensive catcher,
to the Brewers for Jeff Cirillo, a .300-hitting third baseman, and
Scott Karl, a left-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   To secure Haynes as a second starting pitcher the Brewers
wanted, the Rockies gave the Athletics a minor league pitcher,
Justin Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Dowd, the Rockies' new general manager, who hit the ground
trading, was the driving force behind the four-team transaction,
and officials of other teams generally credited him with gaining
the most from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, whose .326 batting average was fifth best in the
National League last season, and Castilla, who in the past five
seasons has batted better than .300 four times and averaged 38 home
runs and 112 runs batted in, were the best-known names in the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, who seldom have made trades in their two-year
existence, acquired Castilla to bolster one of the American
League's weakest offenses. Later in the day the Devil Rays added to
their lineup, signing Greg Vaughn, a home run hitting free agent,
to a four-year, $34 million contract. The Mets had expressed some
interest in Vaughn but not at that rate.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla and Vaughn, who hit 95 home runs the past two seasons,
join Fred McGriff and Jose Canseco in the middle of the Tampa Bay
lineup. Cirillo will become the cleanup hitter in a Colorado lineup
that O'Dowd has overhauled in an attempt to make it a
multidimensional threat. The general manager previously traded
Dante Bichette, another of the Rockies' sluggers, to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' Dean Taylor, the Milwaukee general manager,
said, ``Dan and I have been working on the basic structure of this
deal for the better part of six weeks. As we satisfied each other
and expanded the deal to make it work, everyone worked hard to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd said the deal began as a three-team trade involving the
Rockies, the Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals. But that one fell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay had specific interest in Castilla,'' O'Dowd said.
``We knew we had to come up with two pitchers for Milwaukee. We
didn't want to trade the second pitcher ourselves because it would
eliminate the depth that we had worked so hard to acquire with the
Darryl Kile deal. So we went on a shopping spree over the last week
and a half to try to get that second pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal was on and off a dozen times. You have to keep in
mind, Milwaukee, Tampa Bay, the Rockies and Oakland were exploring
other possibilities. As late as last evening, this thing could have
easily not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd engineered the final piece after Taylor gave him a list
of five pitchers the Brewers would consider as the second starter
they wanted. ``Four were unrealistic,'' O'Dowd said without
identifying them. Haynes was the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the list, we had done our due diligence,'' O'Dowd
said. ``We knew what pitching was available and not available in
the industry. When I got the list, I had already talked to those
clubs. I waited a little bit because I knew Billy was exploring
other options. I didn't want to get into paying that price yet. I
wanted to wait for these meetings. I also didn't want to jump into
something until I knew the other two pieces of the puzzle were
solidly in place. Oakland was the last piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Beane, O'Dowd said, ``really could have done some damage.'' But
he was not about to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships are part of making deals,'' Beane said. ``I'm
very close to Danny. It's not a part of a favor bank, but we
weren't going to sit there and blow this entire deal apart just
because we were pig-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he added, he had planned to trade Haynes somewhere this
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great deal,'' Beane said. ``It was a fun deal to watch
even being somewhat on the periphery. The good thing about being
part of it was knowing what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time four teams joined in one trade was on Jan. 18,
1985. On that day the Brewers traded catcher Jim Sundberg to Kansas
City for catcher Don Slaught and pitcher Frank Wills. Then the
Brewers sent Wills to the Mets for pitcher Tim Leary and Slaught to
Texas for pitcher Danny Darwin and a player to be named, who later
became Bill Hance, a catcher, who never reached the major leagues. &QL;

BRYANT, ODOM EXPECTED TO SQUARE OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A matchup that existed only on talk radio and in
the occasional newspaper column could become reality tonight. Kobe
Bryant and Lamar Odom, head to head.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have already begun the debate which young phenom
will be the better player, the Lakers' Bryant or the Clippers'
Odom. But no one figured the two L.A. stars would get a chance to
prove themselves against one another because they played different
positions.
</P>
<P>
   That changed two days ago when Clippers coach Chris Ford moved
his multidimensional rookie from small forward to point guard. Now
Odom and Bryant are likely to guard each other when the Lakers and
Clippers meet tonight for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a real interesting matchup,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson said. ``I think the Clippers have made a move that's
progressive, it's obviously something where they have to fight (to
end) a losing streak and they're trying to make some changes in a
positive nature. This young man (Odom) looks like he distributes
the ball and is unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could play spoiler, though. He said he ``might'' put Ron
Harper on Odom, instead of Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to seeing him play,'' Jackson said
of Odom. ``I don't watch college basketball, I'll admit it. I saw
him play one time, it seems like two years ago, in the NCAAs, and I
was impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   No Air in L.A.: Michael Jordan enjoyed watching the Lakers beat
the Detroit Pistons on Sunday from the confines of owner Jerry
Buss' luxury suite. But Jordan said he has no intention of joining
the Lakers for an impromptu workout, as he did with the Chicago
Bulls last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in any shape, not in basketball condition is what he
told me,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, he's not in shape to keep up with Bryant, his
presumed heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he wasn't going to come to practice,'' Bryant said.
``We were talking about it the other day, I asked him if he was
going to come to practice. He said, `Hell no.' He said, `I've got
to get in shape.' He doesn't want to chase me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Glen Rice, who missed Sunday's game because of an
upper respiratory infection and 102-degree fever, skipped Monday's
practice as well. But Jackson said he hopes Rice will be available
for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   If not, rookie Devean George might get his second NBA start.
George played only 15 minutes after starting Sunday's game, as Rick
Fox came off the bench to play 37 minutes and score a season-high
20 points. Jackson could start Fox, but seems to prefer keeping his
rotation intact.

DEMOCRATS GIVE $1 MILLION TO REFURBISH GORE'S HOME

   Whether for a billiard table or a hot tub, a steam shower or
lush landscaping, leading Democratic donors dug into their pockets
to contribute over $1 million to make improvements in Vice
President Al Gore's official residence.

   Businesses including Bell Atlantic, Coca-Cola,
PricewaterhouseCoopers and General Motors contributed to the
8-year-old effort to improve the 33-room mansion, situated on the

cobalt-blue glass sculpture that, because it clashes with the
Victorian interiors, sits in a closet. Sony Corp. donated $1,500 in
electronic equipment, and Howard Glicken, a Florida businessman and
Democratic donor who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations
in 1998, donated a $6,000 billiard table.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the fund raising is to be released Tuesday by the
Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit group that
advocates campaign finance reform. The center provided The New York
Times with a copy of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a small group of people making an investment in the
vice president's residence for access and influence and it's
largely out of public view,'' said Peter Eisner, a managing
director of the center. ``For donors, this is a better deal than
giving to the campaign. Money is used to make Gore more
comfortable. It won't pay for television advertising, but it is
something that Gore would probably remember _ like the pool
table.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The fund raising was largely headed by Peter Knight, former
chairman of the Clinton-Gore re-election committee and a close Gore
associate. While Knight raised the bulk of the money, the effort
has been headed for the last two years by Douglas Hall, a
Washington businessman who once worked with Gore on The Tennessean
in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the $10,000 givers were the corporate foundations at Bell
Atlantic, Fluor, Atlantic Richfield, Coca-Cola, MCI Worldcom, Time
Warner, Pricewaterhouse, General Motors and Microsoft. The money
was spent on landscaping, outdoor lighting, a pool garden, and
insurance for the residence's artwork, which is on loan from the
Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Other donations came directly from individuals, who are not
subject to the $1,000 limit since they are not contributing
directly to a federal candidate. Nathan Landow, a Democratic
fund-raiser who was a marginal figure in the Lewinsky scandal, gave
$25,000. Jonathan Tisch, an executive at Loews Corp. and a
fund-raiser who was vice chairman of Gore's 1993 inaugural
committee, gave $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rattner, a Wall Street investment banker and Democratic
fund-raiser, gave $10,000, and John Cooke, a Walt Disney Co.
executive vice president and Gore fund-raiser, gave $15,000.
Kathleen Kennedy, a Hollywood producer, gave $15,000 and the
Foundation of Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Miami gave $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   A $20,000 donation came from Mark Jimenez, who was indicted in
1998 on campaign finance violations and who is currently
negotiating his extradition from the Philippines. Franklin Haney,
who was acquitted in 1999 in a jury trial on 42 counts of campaign
finance violations, contributed $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other donors included Bennett LeBow ($2,000), chief executive of
Brooke Group, the parent company to Liggett Group, a tobacco
company. Gore returned LeBow's contribution to his campaign on the
ground that he does not accept money from tobacco interests, but
the residence foundation accepted LeBow's check.

ATLANTA INQUIRES AFTER VIZCAINO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A day after moving $10.5 million of payroll in
one trade, the Los Angeles Dodgers are hoping to soon move another
significant piece to create more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves general manager John Schuerholz spoke with
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone about acquiring utility
infielder Jose Vizcaino for a pitching prospect, several sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides spoke at length about a possible deal during the
general manager's meetings last month and renewed talks at the
winter meetings. As was the case in trading Eric Young, the
financial aspect is key to the Vizcaino deal.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, who wasted away on the bench last season, is slated to
make $3.5 million in 2000. At this point the Dodgers can't absorb
any of Vizcaino's salary in the deal, but that could change
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta official said the Braves like Vizcaino's versatility
as an infielder. He can play second, shortstop or third base, and
is a switch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino is also considered a good clubhouse guy, though the
Dodgers were disappointed he wasn't more of an influence last
season. Part of that was because he struggled in an unfamiliar
backup role and was unhappy. He hit .252 in 94 games.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources said the deal could be put on hold until the Adrian
Beltre case is resolved, noting the Dodgers may need Vizcaino to
play third, second or some combination in a platoon-type situation.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the teams can't agree on a trade in the next
few days, both sources said the deal would likely be revisited
before or during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Carlos: With Ismael Valdes traded away, it means lefty
Carlos Perez will come into spring training with a spot in the
rotation to lose rather than one to earn. It's a scary thought,
given that Perez was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers are in the midst of sending a parade of
representatives to the Dominican Republic to keep a constant eye on
Perez, who has $12.5 million and two years remaining on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Bill Geivett, senior vice president
Tom Lasorda and strength and conditioning coordinator Todd Claussen
each visited Perez. Pitching coach Claude Osteen and minor-league
pitching coordinator Jim Benedict are next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy didn't show up in 1999, but we're optimistic he does
in 2000,'' Malone said. ``We're going to find him and bring him
home. He is in great shape, great attitude. That's the problem last
year. He came in kind of out of shape and overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers don't like what they see from Perez, one option
is to send him to Triple-A Albuquerque. By keeping him in the
minors for two months near the end of last season, it made it so he
couldn't refuse a minor-league assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Malone reiterated what Dodgers chairman Bob Daly
said Sunday about the prospect of signing right-hander Orel
Hershiser to a free-agent contract: ``It's a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Hershiser wants to start, but the Dodgers' need is
in the bullpen. Still, Malone thinks Hershiser will wear a Dodgers
uniform perhaps after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe with all my heart, he will be a Dodger again,''
Malone said. ``He has a lot to offer; quality person, a lot of
ability.''..The Dodgers lost 1996 first-round pick Damian Rolls,
22, and pitcher Adrian Burnside, 22, in the major-league portion of
the Rule 5 draft. Rolls, who played for Single-A Vero Beach last
season, was taken by Kansas City and then traded to Tampa Bay.
Burnside was taken by Cincinnati.

FORMER ETHICS COMMISSION OFFICIAL WANTS TO START COMPANY TO AID
LOBBYISTS IN FILING CAMPAIGN SPENDING REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Two years after
Missouri campaign contributions and lobbyists' spending were
required to be computerized for easy public consumption, the system
is still not on line and is hindered by glitches that give many
users fits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, the Ethics Commission's former head of computer services,
who oversaw development of the long-delayed system, wants to set up
a company to charge lobbyists a fee to help them file their monthly
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mullett, who oversaw the commission's computer services
for nearly six years, abruptly resigned in late October, just as
lobbyists began trying to file their reports by computer.
</P>
<P>
   In a Nov. 1 letter, Mullett requested an Ethics Commission
opinion on whether state law allows him to contract with lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was not lost on critics of the commission's fruitless
attempts to put information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just increases my desire to have the whole process turned
over to a different agency,'' said Democratic state Sen. John
Schneider of St. Louis County. ``Filing this information should be
simple enough that you don't need assistance. I hope complications
were not built into the system just so you need assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Commission is scheduled to discuss the request and
issue an opinion today. Ethics Director Chuck Lamb said the staff
has recommended that the commission find Mullett's plan in
violation of state conflict-of-interest laws.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits employees from working for a private entity on
projects related to the work they did for the state. But the law
primarily relates to a prohibition on attempts to influence a
government decision. So it may allow the commission some wiggle
room.
</P>
<P>
   Mullett could not be reached Friday or Monday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His request is the latest wrinkle in the long and twisted
history of the state's efforts to put campaign finance and lobbyist
spending on computer. The legislature enacted a law in 1994 that
required campaign contributions to be computerized beginning in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, it required lobbyists' reports to be filed
electronically beginning in 1998 and for the reports to be on the
Internet by January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Ethics Commission hired a California firm, SDR
Technologies Inc., to develop two kinds of software: One type would
allow campaigns and lobbyists to file information with the
commission; the second would allow the public to search and sort
the information on the commission's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the process came under fire almost immediately. The Ethics
Commission underestimated the cost, which has grown to more than
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors said the bids were rigged in SDR's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings and the
senator accused Mullett of lacking the expertise to oversee the
system. Mullett insisted that the bids were not written for one
company and his supervisors told Schneider they didn't think
Mullett needed a degree in computer science to oversee the project.
</P>
<P>
   When the software finally arrived in January 1998, it didn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon sued SDR for failing to
provide a usable product. SDR kept promising to deliver usable
software, but every version it sent was riddled with problems.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was settled last summer after an expert from the
University of Missouri-Kansas City analyzed the software and SDR
agreed to fix the remaining glitches. The first lobbyist filing
software went out last September. But it also has had minor
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission began requiring lobbyist reports to be filed
electronically in November. Mike Reid, the commission's compliance
director, said last week that the commission had received about
1,700 filings in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   Most lobbyists are filing successfully, though a few are still
having trouble with the software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are still not available to the public because the
Internet portion of the contract was cut out to save money. The
state contracted with SDR in September to develop a system to put
the information on the commission's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mullett quit in late October, just as the first filings were
about to start. He said at the time that his decision to leave had
nothing to do with the electronic filing project. He said he was
leaving to take a better job, but declined to identify his new
employer.
</P>
<P>
   In his request to the commission, Mullett argued that his job as
computer manager had no responsibility for regulating lobbyists. He
urged the commission to rule quickly so he could get the business
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that my inquiry does not spawn numerous attempts
by others to begin a similar type of business,'' Mullett's letter
says.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said he thought the statutes probably permit Mullett
to start the business. But the request just shows how badly botched
the whole process was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the software did it right, no one would need assistance,''
he said.

A PANAMA CANAL CELEBRITY HONORS UNHERALDED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ The first ship to pass through the Panama
Canal and pretty much every one since have glided through the life
of Cecil Haynes. He was born one year before the canal was
dedicated on Aug. 15, 1914, and has worked for the Panama Canal
Commission for 71 years, starting as an office boy in 1928 ferrying
papers and filling inkwells.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of the symbolic transfer of the canal, Haynes,
86, will assume a special place among the bosses at the reviewing
stand as the oldest and longest-serving worker at the canal, if not
the federal government as well.
</P>
<P>
   Honors have been coming his way for years. The small office
where he works as an inventory management specialist ordering
supplies is lined with photos of him with presidents and generals.
Last month, he was the standard-bearer at the parade celebrating
Panama's independence from Colombia in 1903. He even has his own
Coca-Cola commercial, with a lifetime supply, no less.
</P>
<P>
   The plaudits are puzzling to a man who calls himself ``a little
two-by-four'' among the VIPs. The real honors, he said, should go
the other VIPs _ Very Invisible People like his father and
thousands of fellow West Indian laborers, whose sweat and sinew
carved out the route through stone and jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am representing the forgotten workers,'' he said. ``They say
I'm famous. Famous for what? Did I go to the moon? No. This is for
the men who built the canal. Who did something international, with
loss of life. If I am being recognized, it is in their memory. I'm
famous for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also recognizes them through his memories of an era when
immigrant laborers struggled through bruising days in the field and
dispiriting nights at home. While he and the other blacks lived
crowded together in small rooms they built for themselves inside
larger wooden buildings, American bureaucrats and technicians in
the Canal Zone endured a more leisurely exile with swimming pools,
maids and good schools.
</P>
<P>
   His father, James, arrived in Panama from Barbados in 1904, the
same year the Americans took over construction of the canal. Haynes
recalled stories his father told him of days when he would come
home famished and fatigued, barely able to stay awake to eat, much
less relax after wielding pickaxes and shovels through 10-hour
shifts in drenching rain or blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes was born in Gatun City, near the man-made lake traversed
by ships, where his own childhood was humble and hard. Like many
Panamanians who saw the disparities between the Americans and the
locals, he was bothered by the imperiousness of the Americans in
the Zone, the 10-mile strip of land straddling the canal's 50-mile
route. In the Zone, American manners, laws and expectations
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to work for them and keep them in the station they were
accustomed to,'' Haynes said. ``We lived in the Zone, too, but we
were there to help them on the job and off the job. We were not
equals.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked for work when he turned 14, intent on making life
better for himself and his family. He found it as an office boy,
working for $22.50 a month. In the 1940s, he said, labor organizers
from the United States came to Panama and helped bring about better
working conditions, with increased pay and vacations. Yet, for all
the time he put into the job, he was still doing low-level clerical
work when, in 1978, his boss came by to point out that Haynes had
been on the job for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   All those years inside an office paid off when a public affairs
officer came to him looking for a feel-good feature about his
record service. Haynes went back to his boss.
</P>
<P>
   He was jumped several pay grades, he said, and eventually
promoted to his current job. Things are better now, for himself and
his countrymen. He and his wife, who are childless, sent several
nephews to college. They have a nice home nestled on a cul-de-sac.
He spoke of the past with some reluctance, not wanting to give the
impression that he was ungrateful, but only wanting to remember men
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the Americans would realize that mistakes were
made,'' Haynes said. ``Had they only treated us a little better and
given us some recognition in our own country.''
</P>
<P>
   He has received more than his share of recognition from his
countrymen. He is a familiar sight in the pre-dawn hours, as he
waits for the bus to go to work each day. Strangers shout greetings
to him in the street. But he may have less visibility soon. He is
talking about retirement, a puzzlingly foreign idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The papers are in,'' he said. ``My wife wants me to retire.
The minute that comes up, she says that I'm not working anymore.
But, you know, after doing something for so long, just to break it
off like that is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as difficult as imagining the national milestone would
ever come. He always thought the Americans would rather go to war
than to give up the canal. Now it is being handed over with a
simple ceremony that will not even be attended by President
Clinton, whom Haynes has always wanted to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force people to think different,'' was all he would
say the American president's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes talked about his years at a desk as just as important a
contribution to building the canal as the toil of his father's
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something they helped build,'' he said. ``They were
happy and proud about it. They taught me that I should always feel
how they felt, and take as much care of it in their memory. That
remained with me as a boy. That is why I am still here today.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has had his doubts. They come to him whenever he sees the
thick-armed workers at the canal, or the road crews out in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am in an office, shuffling papers,'' he said. ``Over
the years, I came to the point where if I had to do it all over
again, I would not have worked in an office. I'd be out in the
field, where people do things.''

KCI POISED FOR GROWTH IN PASSENGERS, AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It took nearly 10
years, but Kansas City International Airport seems to have finally
gotten over the Braniff blues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1989 collapse of Braniff, the carrier that embarked on
building a substantial hub at KCI, crippled the airport's
operations for several years. The number of flights and passengers
at KCI was sharply reduced, and there was even some talk that
perhaps one of the airport's terminals should be closed because of
the lack of business.
</P>
<P>
   Today KCI is growing again. Passenger traffic has risen steadily
since the mid-1990s, and the number of flights at the airport is
roughly equivalent to what it was when Braniff was operating at its
peak. This year alone, KCI added nonstops to eight new
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Like KCI, airports all over the world are dealing with rising
passenger traffic. And that could lead to trouble spots. Without
significant infrastructure improvements in the next 10 years, the
nation's air traffic system faces the prospect of a sharp increase
in delays and greater backlog, said United Airlines chief James
Goodwin at an aviation conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gridlock common at bigger metropolitan airports is not
a problem here, KCI faces other challenges. It still is not
operating anywhere near capacity, passengers still complain there
aren't enough food and beverage outlets, and morale problems in
recent years caused unusually high turnover at the city's aviation
department.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, aviation observers believe KCI is in good position
to continue growing in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new millennium looks good for your airport,'' said Terry
Trippler, consumer affairs expert for Onetravel.com, an online
travel service. ``You suffered in the early '90s, but the things
that have happened since are finally starting to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   When airlines acquire more aircraft and look to add flights,
Kansas City usually is considered, one travel agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the radar screen, and that's good,'' said Kathy
Sudeikis, vice president of corporate relations at All About Travel
in Mission. ``It's a matter of whether airlines can make it
cost-effective to add flights here.''
</P>
<P>
   KCI is certainly on Southwest Airlines' radar screen. Southwest
has gradually expanded here and is now KCI's dominant carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, long known as a discount carrier offering short-haul
flights, began changing its strategy several years ago. The carrier
started flying longer routes at higher prices, and Kansas City
became a market that attracted Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Southwest has eight gates and 72 daily departures at KCI,
flying to 21 cities east and west of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's gradual growth started in 1995, when US Airways
(then known as USAir) substantially reduced its nonstop flights
from KCI. The airline eliminated direct flights to key business and
leisure destinations such as Boston, San Diego, Seattle, Orlando,
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers that began filling the void left by the likes of
Braniff and US Airways were Midwest Express and Vanguard Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Express flew only to Milwaukee when it started service
at KCI in 1989. Now the carrier also offers direct flights to New
York, Boston and San Antonio. In 2000, the airline is dropping KCI
nonstops to Raleigh//Durham, N.C., but is adding service to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City-based Vanguard started operating in December 1994.
After struggling for years financially and operationally, Vanguard
has reached some semblance of stability in recent months and is
flying to key business cities that are the hubs of major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest has fares lower than the majors, but it's Vanguard
that is helping keep prices down in Kansas City,'' Trippler said.
``They seem to have gotten their act together, so that bodes well
for keeping your fares down.''
</P>
<P>
   Trippler said reasonable prices alone draw companies with
offices all over the country to meet in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, I'll hear people checking fares saying, `Have you
tried Kansas City?''' he said. ``It still has a reputation in the
travel industry for low fares.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McKenna, assistant director of marketing for the Kansas City
Aviation Department, said KCI has a better mix of airlines now than
it did eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good balance between the (major) carriers and the
start-up or discount carriers,'' he said. ``Having the low-cost
carriers helps keep the competition going.''
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines such as American, Northwest and United fly only
to their hub cities from KCI, but that also has helped create a
balance, McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline industry has changed somewhat,'' he said. ``The
majors are now network carriers, with several hubs instead of one
fortress hub.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, each major airline flies to two or three cities (US
Airways flies to four) from KCI. McKenna said that should provide
more opportunities for international travel from KCI. For example,
McKenna said, passengers flying to London have 14 daily one-stop
options from Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the network hubs, you have greater access to the global
marketplace,'' he said. ``And you have a multiple choice of
carriers.''

Suns out for a game against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, she realized just how seriously he was
contemplating the unheard of _ giving up a multimillion-dollar
guaranteed contract and abandoning a job he loves because he
believes his family needs him more than a basketball team does.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Danny Ainge did just that, stepping down 20 games
into his fourth season as the Suns head coach, despite a 13-7
record and two more years on his contract after this one.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge, 40, called it a simple choice between a profession he
loves and a family he adores more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you might think I'm jumping ship,'' Ainge said. ``It's
been hard. I've never quit anything in my life. But I don't really
feel like I'm jumping ship. I believe I'm diving overboard to save
my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving a lot of very precious things behind as I dive
overboard to rescue those that mean the most to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be speculation that there is more to the
story. That Ainge was frustrated by a team that hasn't played as
well as many anticipated after the acquisition of Penny Hardaway.
That he was forced out. Or that there is something wrong with
somebody in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Ainge said it is what her husband said it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me happy and very proud of him,'' she said. ``He's
giving his family the highest priority, and I know it's really hard
to do. I know how much he loves those guys and basketball and his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're dying here or something. It makes a
difference to have him at home, and he doesn't want to miss this
time with his family and have regrets later.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge is the father of six children ranging in age from
4-year-old son Crew to 19-year-old daughter Ashlee.
</P>
<P>
   And Ainge, a devout Mormon who lost his own mother to a suicide
when he was a freshman at Brigham Young University, is a devoted
family man. When he took over as head coach, he encouraged players
to bring their families along on road trips whenever there was room
on the club's chartered flights. Ainge once took all six of his
kids along, and many of the team's players often had their children
with them on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge believed having the families would make it easier for
players. But this season, his own kids were growing at home without
him. And a comment from his second son, 15-year-old Tanner, struck
a chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my teenage boys thought that I had been distant, and I
couldn't disagree with that,'' Ainge said, pausing to compose
himself. ``It's been very difficult to find that balance as a coach
that I thought I could, because I was able to do that as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had many conversations with my wife, and she has, by the
way, never, ever pressured me into this decision. This was
something I felt was making a statement to my family _ that they're
more important to me than my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as shocked as anybody that I made this decision. At
the same time, my teenaged sons and daughters and my wife are very
grateful that I made this decision for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Ainge said she and Danny Ainge had many conversations
about the impact of his job on the family, but the call Saturday
still surprised her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed this was serious,'' she said. ``He said, `I really
need you to think about this.' I thought, `Whew.' But I thought it
was going to be something he would think about for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ainge called a family meeting Sunday morning to discuss
his decision. And then he called Suns President Bryan Colangelo to
tell him he wanted to meet with him and Suns CEO Jerry Colangelo
that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo said he sensed something wrong in Ainge's ``body
language and facial expressions'' during the 120-115 Phoenix loss
to the Mavericks as he watched the game on television. When he
learned that Ainge wanted a meeting, he told Bryan ``he's going to
step down.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what Ainge did, telling the Colangelos that they
should replace him with assistant Scott Skiles and asking for an
announcement first thing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Suns lost a third straight game in mid November, Jerry
Colangelo said on his weekly show on the team's flagship station,
KTAR-AM, that there needed to be ``a correction'' even after the
team had broken the skid with a victory over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo said at the time that he did not mean a coaching
change.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns won seven straight games, starting with the Chicago
victory. And Colangelo said Monday's coaching shake-up was not ``on
our agenda'' and intended to try and talk Ainge out of resigning
before their meeting Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unequivocably, this has nothing to do with the relationship
between Danny and this organization,'' Colangelo said. ``There's
never been any pressure on him. We all share the same commitment
and passion for winning, so it wasn't anything like that. It's the
first time in my career that I've had a situation where a coach
walked in and said, `I've had enough.' '' ``I think it's the
greatest thing he's ever done,'' said Austin Ainge, Ainge's oldest
son who is a star guard at Gilbert Highland High School and has
accepted a scholarship to BYU. ``I think it's just about the
biggest expression he could show us. He gave up the job he loves.
He gave up the money. He gave up a lot of stuff that's important to
him for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge's kids have grown up with him in the limelight, first as a
player, then a television analyst and then coach. He said he wants
his life to revolve around them now, instead of theirs revolving
around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've never really known anything different,'' Austin
Ainge said. ``I feel like he's a great dad, and I wouldn't change
my life for anything, nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could tell something was bothering him a little bit, but I
couldn't tell this was coming. He'd come home a little frustrated
after a loss, but he always bounces back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said the decision didn't come down to underperformance
from his team. In fact, he said he would have made the same
decision if the Suns had a 17-3 record instead of 13-7.

KCI POISED FOR GROWTH IN PASSENGERS, AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ KCI's only direct
international flights are to Toronto on Air Canada.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All About Travel's Sudeikis agreed that KCI's strategy so far
has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've struck the delicate balance between attracting
low-fare carriers and keeping the revenues high enough for the
major airlines,'' she said. ``But we don't want to scare away the
big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudeikis said Kansas City still lacks some needed service, such
as nonstops to San Francisco and Miami. In addition, only Southwest
offers nonstop service to Las Vegas, one of the most popular
destinations from Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of holes, but I think they've done a good
job overall,'' she said. ``We're doing pretty well considering
every major carrier is still here, which can't be said for lot of
cities our size.''
</P>
<P>
   Through September, KCI's total passenger traffic was up 6
percent over the same period last year, to 8.61 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the airport ranked 37th among North America's busiest
airports with 10.95 million passengers, according to the Airports
Council International. In 1992, KCI ranked 40th.
</P>
<P>
   Another indicator of KCI's growth can be seen in its comparison
with Indianapolis, which also is without a significant hub.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, KCI had 1 million more passengers than Indianapolis
International Airport. In 1998, that gap grew to 3.6 million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Loar, chairwoman of the Kansas City Council's aviation
committee, attributes the growth to low fares and the airport's
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can unload your baggage and walk to your car within
100 yards, that's pretty convenient,'' she said. ``Also, we're
drawing people from all over the region because it's cheaper to fly
from here. If I had a dollar for every Wichita resident I've sat
next to on my flights...''
</P>
<P>
   Loar also credited aviation department officials with marketing
KCI effectively in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   With congestion being a problem at so many metropolitan
airports, Loar and others believe KCI can continue to add service.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs are good, but we as a business community need to
support the nonstops when we get them,'' Sudeikis said. ``Travel in
general has grown so dramatically. When an airline goes out and
offers us a key nonstop flight, we have to deliver when that
happens.''

BUSH, MCCAIN MIX IT UP DURING IOWA GOP DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The leading Republican presidential
candidates, George W. Bush and John McCain, finally engaged in
rhetorical battle Monday, clashing over a range of issues during
the most animated debate so far between the GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The new aggressiveness among the top contenders comes as the
primary season is fast approaching and the race is tightening with
McCain closing in on Bush, particularly in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had been criticized for his performance in two
previous debates, came across more relaxed and more willing to mix
it up with his rivals, particularly McCain, who baited the governor
on campaign finance and ethanol subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, who spoke of Jesus Christ as a prominent
influence in his life, played to more traditional Republican voters
who typically vote in the Iowa caucuses while McCain stressed
themes that appeal to those independent voters who make up a larger
chunk of the New Hampshire electorate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has chosen not to campaign actively in Iowa,
announced to the Des Moines audience that he was going to tell them
some things they did not want to hear and stated flatly that the
federal subsidy for ethanol _ a corn-based fuel additive _ ``is not
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not help the consumer,'' McCain said of a product dear
to Iowa farmers. ``Everybody here on this stage, if it wasn't for
the fact that Iowa was the first caucus state, would be sharing my
view.''
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates expressed their disagreement, including
Bush, who said: ``I support ethanol, I support ethanol strongly and
I would support ethanol whether I was here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended ethanol as ``good for the air'' and a way to
reduce dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush challenged McCain on taxes, claiming the Arizona
senator's tax cut plan did not help single mothers with incomes of
$40,000 _ a group the governor said would be aided by his tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain claimed he could tinker with his tax plan, he
quickly turned his answer into a challenge for Bush to endorse his
centerpiece campaign finance proposals, particularly the ban on
unrestricted donations to political parties, known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can commit as nominees that we will have nothing to do with
soft money. ... I hope you will make that commitment right here
tonight,'' McCain said to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be pleased to talk about it,'' Bush responded. But the
governor argued that a ban on soft money ``would hurt the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that elimination of soft money would still allow labor
unions, which generally support Democrats, to continue to use dues
levied on their members to pay for political campaigns against
Republicans. He called for ``paycheck protection,'' which would bar
unions from using their members' dues for political purposes
against their will.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain countered that Ronald Reagan won the presidency in
1980 when soft money did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The two men chose different influences when the questions turned
philosophical. When asked which thinker affected him most, Bush
responded that it was Jesus Christ. Pressed to elaborate, Bush
responded, ``If they don't know, it would be hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added, ``When you accept Jesus Christ as your savior it
changes your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, volunteered a decidedly less religious figure,
saying that former President Theodore Roosevelt was his hero. He
said Roosevelt had taken on some of the prominent powers of the day
and had established the national park system.
</P>
<P>
   The spirited exchanges between McCain and Bush occurred during a
90-minute forum sponsored by WHO-TV in Des Moines and MSNBC, the
cable network that aired the debate nationally. The format was far
more freewheeling, with the moderators allowing the candidates more
leeway to respond to each other and deviate from the questions to
challenge their opponents. Candidates not only responded to
questions posed by the moderators but also queried one another.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates, magazine mogul Steve Forbes, conservative
activists Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch,
were also aggressive in their responses.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer and Bush mixed it up particularly sharply over
U.S.-China relations. Bauer challenged Bush for his endorsement of
U.S. trade relations with the last Communist power, saying,
``Governor Bush, I will stop allowing China to play us for
suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also challenged Bush to commit to naming a running mate
who was anti-abortion, a commitment the governor has long refused
to make. Bush said he would select a vice presidential candidate
who was loyal to him and who held the same conservative principles.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Hatch referred snidely to Forbes' wealth, and his
willingness to use it for his campaign. When Hatch posed a question
to Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine mogul said, ``that means
hold onto your wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch quickly responded, ``Steve, I couldn't even lift your
wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa forum was viewed as a major test for Bush, who appeared
uncomfortable and rarely deviated from his standard stump speech in
the first two face-offs with his Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the Texas governor's Republican supporters conceded
that Bush, who had little previous experience debating, should have
engaged his rivals earlier in the season to gain more experience
before the primary season begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the Des Moines airport, Bush was asked about his
previous debate performances, if he thought he was overly scripted
and nervous in the encounters in Arizona and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who me?'' he responded. ``What matters is how people vote.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Iowa caucuses just six weeks away on Jan. 24, Bush is
in better shape in this key Midwestern state than in the first
primary state of New Hampshire, where an aggressive campaign by
McCain has catapulted the Arizona senator ahead of Bush, according
to several new polls.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Iowa polls all give Bush a healthy lead, followed by
Forbes, who has waged a high-dollar campaign and is highly
organized in the state. But one recent poll found McCain, who has
largely written off the state, coming in third close behind Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has benefited from a plethora of positive national media
coverage and what many believe were deft performances in the first
two debates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was scheduled to leave Des Moines right after the
debate, released two new ads Monday that highlight his prisoner of
war experience in Vietnam, including his giving a Christmas sermon
one year for fellow soldiers who were all being held captive in
Hanoi.

BIG BOY CHAIN IS CLOSING KC AREA AND ST. LOUIS RESTAURANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just nine months
after making a big splash in Kansas City with eight new
restaurants, Big Boy has closed the operations, along with 10 Big
Boys in St. Louis and one in Columbia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elias Bros., the Warren, Mich.-based parent company of Big Boy,
blamed delays in obtaining city permits that forced them to open
months later than planned. They also had staffing problems and a
drop in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Independence's (Mo.) Big Boy restaurant is not connected with
the Michigan chain and will remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our start-up costs started to mount drastically; ultimately
that delayed our return on our investment,'' said Tony Michaels, a
spokesman for Elias. ``We have never run into delays anywhere close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias purchased the former Shoney's restaurants in October 1998
and began reopening them as company-owned Big Boy operations last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Elias dealt with several cities, including Kansas City, Overland
Park, Kan., Merriam, Kan., and St. Louis. City officials said
zoning requirements were already in place because most of the
locations were being remodeled.
</P>
<P>
   The Overland Park Big Boy received its construction permit in
just two days and a health department permit in a week, according
to Tim Ryan, codes administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``From start to finish when the permit was issued, it was 10
days. That's pretty quick for a $100,000 remodel,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said that Overland Park promised a 20-day turnaround time
for an initial plan review and that the city had created a pre-plan
review and one-stop shop, where all questions are answered in one
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having the biggest boom in our history, with nearly $700
million in construction this year,'' Ryan said. ``Even with the
workload, we still turned it around quicker than our established
time frames.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriam officials said Big Boy's plans had been quickly
approved. Independence said that the initial review had been
returned within three days in November 1998 but that three
different departments had questions. Elias did not address those
concerns until late April, and a permit was issued that day.
</P>
<P>
   Elias also blamed its area restaurant closings on falling sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales were as expected at the start, but they did trail off,''
Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also had problems finding enough help for the
restaurants. Each restaurant had 30 to 50 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoney's had some good help; if they could have kept those
workers, it would have helped,'' said Tom Rhoades of Independence's
Big Boy. ``They were closed down for several months. Finding
workers in Kansas City is tough; we're so successful because we
have experienced employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias' area employees were not notified in advance of the Friday
afternoon closing. Michaels said each worker later received a
personal phone call from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are not expected to reopen unless a franchisee takes
over a location.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Big Boy, which the Rhoades family opened in
1962 on U.S. 40, has complained about customer confusion since the
Michigan chain came to town, and the complaints have continued
after the closings.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are calling Rhoades' operation to ask if it has closed
and what to do about gift certificates belonging to the other Big
Boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they couldn't handle the competition,'' Rhoades said.
``We're still kicking, and hope to maintain that for many years.''

CITY PLANS LAST-MINUTE COURT EFFORT TO STOP TRANSIT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Mark to Marc in 7th graf; inserts a second union
meeting in 8th graf of 2nd take; corrects `taxi workers' to
`transit workers' in 10th graf of 2nd take.)  
(mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the city began emergency operations for a transit
strike that could begin at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, negotiators on
both sides of the contract talks said there were hints of progress
Monday, although they acknowledged that the negotiations remained
snarled over wages.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani expressed skepticism about the reports of
progress in the talks. He said the city would go to court Tuesday
morning to try to stop the threatened walkout if there was no
change overnight in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But subway and bus passengers across the city reported delayed
trains and erratic service Monday, as they did last week, when a
dissident faction of the union called for a work slowdown. The
union denied any deliberate disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had planned to go to court Monday, but he said he had
backed off at the request of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, whose contract talks with Local 100 of the Transport
Workers Union have increasingly angered and frustrated him.
Giuliani has no role in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like deferring,'' Giuliani told reporters at a morning
news conference at City Hall. ``You know that. I deferred to their
judgment that the negotiations were going well.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Local 100, Willie James, told reporters that he
was encouraged by the negotiations. He would not specify what type
of progress had been made, but he said the MTA ``had come up a
bit'' and the union had ``come down a bit'' in its demands.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the MTA, Marc Shaw, said moderate
progress had been made on nonwage issues. ``It's picked up some
speed,'' he said of the talks. ``I wish it could pick up more
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA's chief negotiator, Gary Dellaverson, said some elements
involving health and pension negotiations had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani was also skeptical of the relatively positive news
that MTA officials were reporting, and said several times Monday
morning that he was hearing the opposite from ``other people'' at
the negotiating table. It was not clear whether he meant union
representatives, other MTA sources or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they say they're making progress,'' Giuliani said of
the MTA's pronouncements. ``Other sources that I have tell me that
they're not making as much progress as the MTA says they're
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor temporarily backed off from the court action,
he continued his vitriolic criticism of the union, saying that
striking transit workers ``actually kill people'' because
ambulances would be delayed in the resulting traffic jams. He also
said that the city's 33,000 bus and subway workers would be
``absolutely immoral'' if they ``try to have a whole city collapse
as a result of your desire to get a few more bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   A court injunction would be sought by the city and the MTA
together. If granted, it would order workers not to strike under
the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits walkouts by transit workers
and other government employees. If the workers violated the
injunction, they would be held in contempt of court and subjected
to what the mayor has called ``massive'' financial penalties as
well as jail time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the MTA decided against seeking an injunction Monday
because he was satisfied with the progress in the talks. ``Our
litigation strategy surrounding the Taylor Law is a tool,'' he
said. ``We think it's useful to keep it and use it as a hammer over
everybody's head.''
</P>
<P>
   A city official said Monday night that the goal was not to jail
transit workers, but to ``remind the union members who vote for a
strike what the repercussions are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a road map for what the penalties are,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said that if workers do strike,
``serious consideration ought to be given to firing the leaders who
caused the strike to happen.'' The MTA, not the city, has the
authority to fire workers in the event of a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said that the city will have to spend millions of
dollars to prepare for a strike. On Monday, he said that some of
those costs _ to hire private buses in time for Wednesday morning
and to pay for police overtime _ were already being incurred. Last
week, the mayor said the union would be liable for all costs
related to the strike, which he estimated would be at least $3.5
million a day. The transit union was fined $1.25 million after an
11-day walkout in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll seek to impose on the union every single penny that they
have cost the citizens of the city of New York,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   In proposals made last week but altered in recent days, the
union has asked for a 27 percent wage increase over three years;
the MTA has offered a 12 percent increase over four years. The
average salary for transit workers is $39,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The contract talks ended Monday at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in
midtown Manhattan at 4:30 a.m., then resumed at 9 a.m. On Tuesday,
the union has scheduled 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. ``informational
meetings'' _ city officials are calling them ``strike meetings'' _
to explain the status of the negotiations. The union's 46-member
executive board is scheduled to meet Tuesday night to decide
whether to authorize a strike, accept the MTA's latest offer or
continue negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and other city officials complained bitterly Monday
about a militant faction of dissidents, called New Directions, that
makes up nearly half of the union membership. James, who was nearly
defeated in his campaign for president by the dissidents last year,
has been under heavy pressure from them to obtain higher wages in
the talks. Giuliani called the dissidents ``the group that is most
enthusiastic about violating the law.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the leader of the dissidents, Tim Schermerhorn, and
the leader of a taxi drivers' organization announced that they
would work together in the event of a strike. Although the city's
emergency plan calls for taxi drivers to pick up multiple fares,
Bhairavi Desai, an organizer for the New York Taxi Workers'
Alliance, said that her group would not cooperate with any plan
that hurts transit workers. Ms. Desai's group represents about
2,000 drivers out of the 42,000 in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor countered, ``The vast majority of taxi drivers,
believe me, are going to take advantage of the opportunity to make
a lot more money during the strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had kept in touch in the last week with Gov.
George Pataki, who has been visibly absent from the public exchange
of threats and accusations surrounding the contract talks. ``The
governor's the head of the Transit Authority,'' said Peter Vallone,
the speaker of the City Council. ``He should be involved in these
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But City Hall officials said the governor was involved behind
the scenes. ``I am in touch and have directed them to be
responsible and work round the clock to try to reach agreement,''
Pataki said Monday at a news conference in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor has been highly critical of what he calls the
MTA's sluggishness in the talks, he has not extended that criticism
to the man who effectively controls the MTA, Pataki, whose good
will Giuliani needs if he runs for the U.S. Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton.

ENTREPRENEURIAL RATING SLIPS FOR KANSAS CITY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Despite its
reputation as an entrepreneurial center, the Kansas City area is
losing out to several other cities as a good spawning ground for
small businesses, according to a research firm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., company that tracks the
activities of 10 million businesses, this year lowered Kansas
City's ranking among the 50 best metropolitan areas to start and
grow a small business to No. 23 from No. 14 a year ago. Inc.
magazine is running the ranking in its December issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City business leaders and experts insist Kansas City is a
good place to start and grow a business.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 66,000 small businesses in the Kansas City
area, said Matt Gunther, the manager of small-business and
entrepreneurial programs for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small business is the engine that drives Kansas City,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cognetics based its rankings primarily on the number of start-up
companies reaching at least five employees in the past 10 years;
and the number of young companies _ those 10 years old or younger _
that have grown significantly in the past four years and that have
had a growth index of at least three over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   A company's growth index is its percentage of employment growth
times its number of added employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cognetics President David Birch said there were no definitive
answers as to why certain cities have dropped in their rankings,
because many of the reasons are subjective and difficult to
measure. The report makes no specific mention of Kansas City's
strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kansas City, other cities that showed the
sharpest one-year drop in the study were St. Louis, Milwaukee and
Greensboro, N.C. Memphis, Tenn; Baltimore; Houston; and Richmond,
Va., showed the biggest gains.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said some strong patterns had emerged that would indicate
why Kansas City, among other cities, got lower rankings.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, the nation's economy has shifted from an
industrial-based economy to a ``knowledge value'' economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, perhaps, has not moved quickly enough to meet the
challenges of a knowledge value economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drive through Kansas City, it definitely has an
industrial flavor to it,'' Birch said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, that was essential, but not now.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said, Kansas City lacks good research
universities and is not the air travel hub that it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great research universities are a plus,'' Birch said. ``Places
like the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University,
Georgia Institute of Technology _ a lot of the cities at the top of
the list have good research universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City International Airport is a good airport, Birch said.
``But it is not the hub it should be,'' he added. ``The knowledge
value economy travels by air.''
</P>
<P>
   To its advantage, Birch said, Kansas City does have top-rate
entrepreneurial centers, such as the Kauffman Center for
Entrepreneurial Leadership, part of the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fountainhead advocate for entrepreneurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, it doesn't mean all young businesses or
entrepreneurs feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they part of the establishment or not?'' Birch asked.
``Ewing Kauffman certainly was, but are the small entrepreneurs?''
</P>
<P>
   Gunther, of the chamber of commerce, agrees there has been an
ongoing debate on whether small businesses are part of the larger
entrepreneurial community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely they are,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
entrepreneurial programs and centers that help the small
entrepreneur be part of the establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership and the
chamber frequently sponsor programs, seminars and other events that
help small-business owners become part of the big picture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kansas City is not a major air travel hub, ``our
prices for air travel are among the most reasonable,'' said Pam
Whiting, director of communications for the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is equally important, if not more so, for small
businesses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Gunther and Whiting said, the development of the new
Stowers Institute for Medical Research will help bring Kansas City
in league with other cities who rate for their research institutes.

<P>
   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under growing pressure to
disclose his role in campaign financing, missed a congress of his
Christian Democratic Party, and did not offer a reason. Last
weekend Kohl faced the first calls from his party to step down as
honorary chairman because of financing questions. The latest
accusation comes from a French businessman who says his company
gave $44 million to German parties to seal an oil deal, a

NEOPHYTES HELP ELECTRIFY MAYORAL RUNOFF IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs 9th graf to correct S.F. Chronicle poll results.) 
 (ms) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The two dozen people waiting outside Tom
Ammiano's campaign headquarters at Josie's Cabaret and Juice Joint
piled in like frantic Christmas shoppers, grabbing stacks of ``Tom
for Mayor'' and ``Make History'' bumper stickers as though they
were the last Pokemon toys on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be 51 on the 20th and this is the first campaign
I've ever wanted to be a part of,'' said Ed McCready, a computer
graphics designer, as he plastered his clothes with yellow and
black ``Mayor Tom Ammiano'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been like this for six weeks, since Ammiano, the
president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, forced Mayor
Willie Brown into a runoff election on Tuesday with a last-minute
write-in campaign that captured 25 percent of the vote in a
four-way race.
</P>
<P>
   They are both liberals in one of the nation's most liberal
bastions, and both have experienced the sting of discrimination.
Brown, 65, is San Francisco's first African-American mayor, and
Ammiano, 58, would become the first openly gay mayor of a large
city if he were elected.
</P>
<P>
   But the election battle here has had little to do with race or
sexual orientation. It has been primarily about who best could
address pressing issues like housing costs, and who best symbolizes
the heart and soul of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And by those measures, supporters of Ammiano, many of them
tenants, have sometimes seemed like zealots, registering more than
14,000 voters, plastering the city with posters and holding
fund-raising rock concerts, comedy shows and wrestling parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an electrifying event,'' said Molly Berry, 30, a
campaign worker. ``We're open from 9 to 9, and an hour doesn't go
by without at least a dozen people coming in asking to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's supporters, on the other hand, have the money and the
clout. Indeed, to say that the race between Ammiano, a former
teacher and stand-up comic, and Brown, the former speaker of the
State Assembly and one of California's most powerful, experienced
politicians, has been a David-and-Goliath battle, only begins to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last week by The San Francisco Chronicle showed Brown
leading Ammiano by 20 points, 49 to 29 percent, with 22 percent
undecided. Brown held an even bigger lead among older homeowners,
those most likely to vote. Still, the same newspaper's poll was off
by 14 points in predicting Ammiano's showing in the general
election on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is taking no chances, amassing a huge campaign fund since
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six weeks, hastily formed political action
committees have spent $1.3 million on Brown's behalf. In addition,
Brown has spent $400,000 (the voluntary spending limit) from his
general campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, political action committees have spent $4,500 on
Ammiano's behalf, and he has spent $250,000 over all.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has received endorsements from the state's political
establishment, the small but potentially influential San Francisco
Republican Party, the city's two daily newspapers and most of the
city's major labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   He has received $22,600 from a landlord's group _ sworn enemies
of Ammiano, who has declared ``war on gentrification'' _ in the
form of a contribution to a political action committee. And he
received $200,000 from the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian and Gay
Democratic Club's political action committee, which spent $175,000
on a television commercial featuring a gay couple that decides to
vote for Brown because of Ammiano's ``out-there'' tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, whose platform has focused on tenants' rights and on
the creation of a living wage for all workers, has been endorsed by
day laborers, advocates of tenants' rights and the Bicycle
Messengers union.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several days, the California Democratic Party has
recruited legislative staff members from Sacramento to campaign for
Brown, offering them up to four free nights at a hotel to come here
and walk the precincts. The party put $80,000 into Brown's campaign
in the November election and anticipated spending $100,000 in the
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ammiano's volunteers have never been involved in a
campaign; some have never voted.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, Peter Humphrey, 35, a building contractor, who
said he has held wrestling parties for fun, held a ``wrestling
ball'' for Ammiano in a dark, rented room. A referee with a
grizzled beard wearing a blond wig, shouted out points as men and
women, some dressed in 1940's swing-dance costumes, tussled with
strangers on mats. Humphrey asked for donations of $3 to $250 and
collected $391 from the 50 guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even been registered to vote in 10 years,'' said
Humphrey, wearing a red robe over his wrestling trunks. He said he
felt compelled to hold the fund-raiser, because ``it's time to look
out for the little guy.''

U.S. REPORTS ARRESTS OF TERRORISTS PLANNING NEW YEAR'S ATTACKS ON
AMERICANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Monday night that
about a dozen members of a suspected terrorist operation believed
to be planning New Year's attacks on Americans around the world had
been arrested in the Middle East in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said the suspects had links to Osama
bin Laden, the Saudi-born militant who is blamed for the bombing of
two American Embassies in Africa in August 1998
</P>
<P>
   Despite the arrests, the threat remained credible enough that
the State Department issued a terrorism warning over the weekend
advising Americans to stay away from large gatherings and
celebrations in other countries during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had ongoing intelligence and law enforcement
activities focused on bin Laden for some time,'' the administration
official said. ``We picked up some very credible information about
an operational cell, and we moved on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The official declined to give specific details about who
arrested the suspected terrorists, other than that the arrests were
made in the Middle East, and that the attacks were planned against
Americans celebrating the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said Monday night that the authorities
believed they know the location of the planned attacks, but the
official declined to identify the country or countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat was global,'' the administration official said.
``This is really a very sensitive, ongoing investigation. And the
threat has not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department warning cautioned Americans for the period
``up to and through the beginning of the New Year and Ramadan
events and celebrations from now until January 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic holy month of Ramadan began last week.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department has issued many similar warnings,
this one was unusual because it urged Americans to avoid large
crowds during a period in which people all over the world are
likely to gather at celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said Monday that the
announcement seeks ``to let American travelers know that the U.S.
government has information, specific and credible information, that
terrorist groups have been planning terrorist actions against
American citizens and that this is a worldwide threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the warning was not made to prompt the cancellation
of travel plans, but that it ``is connected to the New Year
celebrations and the Ramadan period, and that therefore Americans
need to exercise caution.''

 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After tearfully pleading for mercy and apologizing to
his victim, Justin Volpe was sentenced Monday to 30 years in prison
for brutalizing Abner Louima in a Brooklyn police station. The
judge denounced the former police officer for an ``unusually
heinous'' crime that had harmed not only Louima but the Police
Department and society at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of intentional murder, one cannot imagine a more
barbarous misuse of power than Volpe's,'' Judge Eugene Nickerson
said in a packed courtroom in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, as
he sentenced Volpe for a notorious act that drew national attention
and fueled angry charges of police brutality against blacks in New
York City. Louima is black, and Volpe is white.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence drew sharply mixed reactions. Federal prosecutors
said they accepted it, though they had urged the judge to impose a
life term. Volpe's lawyer and his father both called it too harsh,
while Louima's supporters insisted that it was too lenient. Calling
the sentence appropriate, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said,
``I hope this is a chapter in the history of the NYPD that is
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The former officer's punishment was less than the sentence of
life in prison without parole that the judge could have imposed.
Volpe, 27, could be released after 25 years if he behaves well in
prison, and with credit for the six months he served since
interrupting his trial last May to plead guilty to violating
Louima's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe was also ordered to pay $277,495 in restitution to Louima,
although Nickerson acknowledged that he would not be able to do so.
Without explaining how he had arrived at the figure, Nickerson
directed Volpe to pay Louima $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe admitted that he had violently shoved a broken broomstick
into Louima's rectum in a police station bathroom, inflicting
severe internal injuries on the 32-year-old Haitian immigrant,
because he mistakenly believed that Louima had punched him hard in
the head during a street brawl, knocking him down and causing him
to fear for his life. It turned out that another man had punched
Volpe. ``However frightened and angry he was, Volpe's response was
wildly out of proportion,'' Nickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Louima described the terror he felt and the
injuries he suffered on the floor of the police station bathroom
where he was assaulted in August 1997. He told the judge of the
psychological pain he later endured because Volpe and his lawyer
suggested that the injuries had come from a homosexual encounter
before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big lie,'' Louima said, ``has caused me and my family
incredible pain and emotional suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, looking pale and somewhat thinner than his hefty,
muscular figure before he was jailed, and wearing jail clothes that
included trousers that had to be rolled up at the ankles because
they were much too long, told Nickerson, ``I was and still am
ashamed and deeply regretful for what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I betrayed Abner Louima's rights, I betrayed the
city's confidence in police officers, I betrayed myself and my
partner and I betrayed my lawyer.'' The last was a reference to his
not having told his lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, that he was guilty
until the evidence had become overwhelming at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently choking up as he stood before the bench, Volpe, who
had been on the force four years when he brutalized Louima and was
dismissed immediately after his conviction, said he had ``come to
realize that this case goes beyond me and Abner Louima.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima showed no emotion as he sat listening in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did not only hurt Abner Louima and his family, but
conjured up the worst fears in people,'' he said. ``This fear was
worse by me being a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Volpe repeated his earlier statements that another
former officer, Charles Schwarz, had been wrongly convicted by the
jury of helping to torture Louima by holding him down in the
bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house. Volpe repeated his
claim that the officer in the bathroom was Thomas Wiese. In the
past, Volpe had said that Wiese merely watched the attack with the
stick.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad, maintained to the judge that
Volpe's statements exonerating Schwarz lacked credibility.
Vinegrad, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, previously
said that there had been more than sufficient evidence to support
the conviction of Schwarz, who faces up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz plans to appeal his conviction, and his lawyer, Ronald
Fishetti, said Monday that the prosecution should give Volpe a
lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, Wiese and a third former officer, Thomas Bruder, face
trial next month on charges that they conspired to lie to
investigators to persuade them that Schwarz had not taken part in
the torture. Defense lawyers have indicated that they would call
Volpe as a witness for their clients, who deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing Volpe to 30 years, Nickerson reduced a finding by
the U.S. Probation Department that federal sentencing guidelines
mandated that Volpe be sentenced to life in prison without any
chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, he was taking into account such factors as the
likelihood that the former police officer would have to serve much
of his sentence in ``some form of segregation'' for his own
protection from other inmates _ meaning even harsher punishment. He
lowered the finding to a guideline that called for a sentence of
between 30 years and life. He then imposed the 30 years, without
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Dan Dunne,
said that it was too early to say where Volpe would be incarcerated
or what security precautions, if any, would be taken to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Kornberg said he would appeal. He had told
Nickerson that a 20-year-sentence would have been enough. Later he
noted to reporters outside the courthouse _ as Louima's supporters
loudly jeered him in the background _ that another police officer,
Francis Livoti, had been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for
violating a man's civil rights by killing him with an illegal
chokehold. And Volpe's father, Robert Volpe, a retired city police
detective, said that 30 years was, in effect, as harsh as a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Louima said that he hoped the sentence would ``send a clear
message that no one is above the law,'' but the Rev. Al Sharpton,
the New York activist, said after leaving the courthouse that Volpe
``should have been given life.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Rodney, co-chairman of the Haitian-American Alliance,
called the sentence a ``slap on the wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Loretta Lynch, the interim U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said
she accepted the 30-year term as the result of a ``very careful
balancing'' by Nickerson.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 14:
</P>
<P>
   When Russians elect a new parliament Sunday, they will be
exercising a right long denied them under communist rule. That
itself is the greatest achievement of Russia's young democracy.
Voters will choose among more than 20 political parties and 6,700
candidates for the 450-seat lower house, or Duma. Yet this
important election, a precursor to presidential elections next
June, has also aroused destructive forces that threaten to
undermine Russia's political progress.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute attempts to use the new Russian assault on
Chechnya for political gain is disturbing. Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin's iron-hand politics in Chechnya, as well as his defiance of
Western criticism, have given him a bounce in early polling for the
presidential race. Other potential candidates have used the ravaged
Caucasus region as a political backdrop. Sergei Shoigu, head of the
new, Kremlin-backed Unity Party, recently swept through the area
searching for civilians to lead to safety. Protecting civilians
should be more than a photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As in the 1996 presidential campaign, television coverage has
become a cudgel used against candidates and parties opposing
President Boris Yeltsin and his supporters. One particularly
scandalous Sunday night program on a nationwide channel run by the
financial tycoon Boris Berezovsky has accused the competition of
murder and attempted assassination. Such heavy-handed use of the
airwaves makes news broadcasts a megaphone for the government and
damages the principle of a free press.
</P>
<P>
   Because members of parliament are immune from prosecution, some
candidates are clearly trying to get elected for personal
protection. Immunity was originally considered crucial to the
independence of parliament. But this year it has drawn as many as
100 candidates with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   If opinion polls prove correct, the new Duma may look very much
like the old one, dominated by communists and nationalists. That
will not advance the cause of economic and political reform, nor
help the Kremlin improve relations with the West.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   So, exactly when did Danny Ainge and Charles Barkley become Big
Bird and Mr. Snuffleupagus?
</P>
<P>
   Barkley blows out his knee and Ainge resigns and suddenly their
voices take on a Muppet-like quality and they chatter on about
family and love and responsibility and I'm wondering if there's
some trend I didn't know about in which washed-up professional
athletes are building mansions on Sesame Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge, speaking of his children, said Monday at a news
conference at American West Arena, ``Their lives have revolved
around me for my entire career. I want my life to revolve around
them at this time in my life. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was no better. After his career-ending injury in
Philadelphia last week, he said, ``I guess the big fella in the sky
wanted me to finish where I started.''
</P>
<P>
   He was subdued. He was respectful. He was _ Lord, no _
``inclusive''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sadness in my heart,'' Barkley said. ``You
guys have seen me grow from a boy to a man.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE FUN TO BE BAD
</P>
<P>
   This is the guy who once fulfilled the fantasy of every adult
male in America by slugging Bill Laimbeer. He once spit on a fan.
He vaulted over a scorer's table, breaking computers and knocking
down chairs so he could chase after an officiating crew and scream
at them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Ainge, about whom Hakeem Olajuwon once said, ``I
know he's a dirty player. He tries to trip me when I'm running.
He's doing it where the referee can't see. But I know what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so did the fans of opposing teams, who booed him
mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me when it first started,'' Ainge once said. ``But
I've grown to like it.'' As did Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at his retirement news conference, Sir Charles admitted
that he'd been in the locker room, crying.
</P>
<P>
   Over what? Being a fabulously wealthy man in his 30s who no
longer even needs to ``pretend'' to be in good shape?
</P>
<P>
   I recall a time in the mid-1990s when Ainge launched the
basketball at point-blank range directly into the cranium of Mario
Elie.
</P>
<P>
   I recall a bench-clearing brawl against Detroit in which Barkley
was the first into the fray, with Ainge right on his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Future students of the game will be able to study Ainge artfully
grabbing, bumping and shoving guys when the officials weren't
looking. Or donning an indignant, completely phony ``Who? Me?''
expression when they were.
</P>
<P>
   They will hear Barkley mock the refs who threaten him with
fines, saying, ``You can't control me with money.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, each of these individuals proved to be an
obnoxious, bullying, loudmouth. Sure, that helped the Suns win a
few games. And it certainly entertained the fans.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS SUITS THEM BOTH
</P>
<P>
   But the truth of the matter is, why squander skills like this on
the basketball court when they can be put to better use at the
statehouse?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fritter away our time contemplating whether
Barkley's name belongs on the Ring of Honor at America West Arena,
we should take immediate steps to have him enshrined in the Dome of
Dishonor at 1700 W. Washington St.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Barkley has spoken of running for governor, but in
his native Alabama. Luckily for us, politicians outside of Arizona
are required to perform some actual work. Here, politics ``is''
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Charles would like that. During his time in Phoenix, Barkley was
the most interesting person in town. Unfortunately, this put him in
direct conflict with the second most interesting person in town,
his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge got less interesting when he became a coach, but he'd
return to his old form in a job that didn't force him to suppress
his best (meaning, worst) instincts. Mayor of Phoenix, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfect. Danny would be close to his kids. His pal Chuck
would be just down the street. And the two of them could quit
whining like a couple of Elmos in Grouchland.
</P>
<P>
   In this new arena they could spit and throw elbows like the old
days. Mock the opposition. Browbeat people. And best of all, no
refs. &QL;

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE AND WEN HO LEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say they have assembled substantial evidence
that Wen Ho Lee, formerly a scientist at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, illegally copied and removed classified information
describing the design, construction and testing of most major
weapons in America's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the case against Lee, his indictment last Friday
seems warranted. At least for now, he has not been charged with the
graver crime of espionage, because evidence is lacking that he
passed these stolen nuclear secrets to China or any other foreign
power.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the publicity, political pressures and accusations of
ethnic stereotyping produced by this case, it is essential that
Lee's right to a fair trial be protected.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case must be vigorously tested, even though
much of the evidence involves nuclear secrets. Federal court
procedures designed for such sensitive cases should make it
possible to explore the evidence without disclosing classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important that other investigative leads be followed
to determine whether China has obtained American nuclear secrets
and who, if anyone, should be charged with transmitting them.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is accused of transferring hundreds of files containing
nuclear weapons secrets to unclassified computers and removable
computer tapes between 1993 and 1997. Prosecutors allege that some
of those tapes have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators suspected as early as 1996 that Lee was
mishandling classified information. But for reasons not yet
adequately explained, Energy Department officials failed to remove
him from classified weapons work until late last year. He was
dismissed in March.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Lee had become the FBI's chief suspect
in a separate, earlier case that involved the possible theft by
China of one of America's most advanced miniaturized weapons
designs, a warhead known as the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI narrowed its espionage investigation too quickly to
focus on Lee, perhaps because he is a Chinese-American, ignoring
potential suspects at other nuclear facilities where scientists
also had design information on the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Lee was not involved in giving nuclear weapons secrets
to China, the systematic copying and removal of highly classified
material he is charged with is a serious offense, carrying a
potential penalty of life imprisonment. If a fair trial establishes
his guilt, he should be punished.

EDITORIAL: INVESTIGATING THE ABUSE OF GAY TROOPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 14 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen took the appropriate action
Monday when he ordered the Pentagon's inspector general to conduct
investigations at major military bases to determine the extent of
harassment against gays. But this emergency effort to head off
further viciousness is no long-term solution to a problem that can
only be fixed by allowing gays to serve in the armed forces on an
equal, open basis.
</P>
<P>
   The ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy was a bad compromise when
President Clinton proposed it in 1993 after Congress refused to end
the ban against gays in the military. Now, after five years in
practice, it is a proven failure, as Clinton acknowledged over the
weekend. The intent of the policy was to allow gay people to serve
if they did not disclose their sexual orientation or engage in
homosexual conduct. But the treatment of gays seems to have
worsened. In 1998, nearly twice the number of military personnel
were discharged for homosexuality as in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony at trial about the barracks atmosphere at Fort
Campbell, Ky., where a gay soldier was beaten to death with a
baseball bat, shows how vicious harassment was tolerated for months
and complaints were utterly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Strict punishment for harassers _ before they kill _ is
obviously needed. But the deeper problem with the policy is that it
encourages anti-gay hatred. The message it sends is that gays are
threats to unit cohesion and unworthy to serve, yet they may be
tolerated so long as they remain closeted. That has proven to be a
recipe for abuse and even resulted in ouster of those who complain
of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Until Congress and the White House replace this policy with one
that allows gays to serve openly, no amount of clarification can
ensure that gay service members will be protected from violence.

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 14 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a possible transit strike looming after midnight Tuesday,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is warning that a walkout would be
disastrous for New York City's residents and its economy. Strictly
speaking, Giuliani is a bystander in the labor negotiations between
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency, and the
transit union.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor is right to step in and assert the city's interest
in a deal. As he notes, a strike would be illegal under the state's
Taylor Law, and it is irresponsible of the union to speak casually
about walking off the job in the absence of a contract. Patient
negotiating will be a more effective tactic for bus and subway
workers seeking better wages.
</P>
<P>
   The latest reports suggest some progress has been made toward
bridging the differences between the MTA and Local 100 of the
Transport Workers Union. They started far apart, however. The union
demanded a wage increase of 27 percent over three years, while the
MTA offered 9.5 percent over four years. But since the MTA agreed
to a four-year, 13 percent increase for workers on the commuter
railroads, it may find it hard not to offer the same package to
subway and bus workers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The transit workers say they deserve generous raises because an
increase in subway and bus riders has expanded the authority's
revenues. But the extra revenues are needed to help finance the
agency's ambitious capital improvement program over the next five
years. One rule of thumb can give management some flexibility,
however. If workers are willing to increase their productivity
through staffing changes and greater flexibility in assignments,
the agency should be willing to share some of the savings in the
form of increased wages.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem in the current talks is that the union has been
split by bitter internal battles in recent years. Its president,
Willie James, barely won re-election a year ago, and a militant
faction known as New Directions has demanded and won a place at the
bargaining table. Giuliani says this group is responsible for
misleading members into thinking that a strike would not
necessarily be illegal, and would actually help their cause. In
reality, a strike could destroy the union's finances.
</P>
<P>
   By definition there is no good time for a transit strike. But at
the height of a holiday season, and with a millennium New Year's
celebration approaching, a strike right now would be especially
destructive. In most public employee unions, and indeed most
private unions, there is a tradition that talks can continue
without a contract, while wages and benefits continue at the
current level.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides should pledge immediately that if the deadline passes
without a contract at midnight Tuesday night, they will keep
talking and bring in an outside mediator if necessary to avert a
strike. Millions of New Yorkers are counting on them to behave
responsibly. &QL;

PATAKI SAYS SCHOOLS PADDED ATTENDANCE TO GET MORE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Delivering another blow to Schools Chancellor Rudy
Crew and the New York City Board of Education, Gov. George Pataki
released a report Monday accusing the city's schools of
deliberately inflating attendance figures to get much more state
aid than they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki attacked the board of education in particular, saying he
agreed with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that it should be abolished. But
while Pataki said a state investigation had uncovered ``patterns of
widespread, systemic abuse'' in attendance, the report contained no
information about which schools were padding their attendance
rolls, who was responsible and exactly how much the alleged scam
was costing the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state is embroiled in a lawsuit that accuses Pataki and the
legislature of shortchanging New York City schools in distributing
state aid, and Crew joined lawyers for the plaintiffs Monday in
charging that Pataki had issued the report primarily to bolster the
state's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani praised the report, saying, ``What they have
illustrated, aside from the dramatic facts that are in there, is
that this system does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The report infuriated Crew, who called it a ``political hack
job'' and ``flimsy counterfeit report'' by a governor who wanted to
hide the fact that he had not furnished enough state aid. Crew that
his staff had been working to fix problems with the attendance
system for years but had been hampered by the state's refusal to
provide sufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that the report contained so little
substance,'' Crew said. ``It is a blatantly political document that
sheds no new light on issues this system has been working toward
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew, who in the next few weeks is expected to decide whether to
remain on the job for at least another year, said in an interview
that Pataki was trying to ``run me out of here.'' The report on
attendance focuses on general weaknesses in the board of
education's system for tabulating attendance in high schools, and
highlights a handful of particularly disturbing examples. In one
case, a student died unexpectedly in the summer of 1998 but was
kept on his high school's rolls for the entire 1998-99 school year
and was even issued report cards.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that even if city schools were inflating
attendance figures for only 3 percent of students, it could cost
the state $300 million over five years. The state gave New York
City schools $2.2 billion in operating aid this year.
</P>
<P>
   The report complained that the board of education's attendance
system automatically presumed students were present unless they
were marked absent on scan sheets, which are fed into computers
that tabulate daily systemwide attendance. The investigators
charged that at least 40,000 attendance sheets had not been fed
into the computer system since September, meaning that there have
been more than a million instances in which a student was
automatically counted as present.
</P>
<P>
   But board officials said state education policy required them to
take attendance that way. Chad Vignola, counsel to Crew, said the
board had increased monitoring of schools in recent years to ensure
that they report attendance figures honestly. He acknowledged that
the high school attendance system allowed for inaccuracies, but
said the board would replace it early next year with a system that
matched those at the elementary and middle school levels.
