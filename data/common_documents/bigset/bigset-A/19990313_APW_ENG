<HEADLINE> Marines Practice City Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of Marines practiced rescuing a  
city threatened by chemical terrorism today outside the view of 
dozens of protesters who said the military exercise might harm 
Monterey Bay wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial military exercise, known as Urban Warrior, was  
launched without the beachfront invasion originally planned. As an 
early morning fog cleared off Monterey Bay, helicopters transported 
troops in ships offshore to the airport, where they were whisked to 
exercise sites by bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is on track and going well,'' Marine Lt. Col. Jenny  
Holbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some 100 demonstrators lined Monterey's main waterfront  
street Saturday, dancing and banging bongo drums in front of the 
beach where an amphibious landing first was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Another dozen gathered outside training sites where the Marine  
Corps had erected two mock villages, and others were bicycling 
around town chanting their protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters said they were hoping to disrupt the controversial  
military war games, the largest of more than two dozen Urban 
Warrior exercises held around the country in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out here to protest this madness. It's a waste of  
taxpayers' funds,'' said Ted Lorec of Santa Cruz, who held a sign 
reading: ``Marines Go Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the $4.5 million experiment originally called for 250  
Marines to land at the beach and drive nearly 50 Humvees, 5-ton 
trucks and light armored vehicles to training sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists and peace activists opposed the event, saying  
the invasion would harm fragile bay marine life. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission agreed, rejecting  
Navy-Marine Corps claims that a seaborne assault would not disturb 
gray whales, snowy plovers and sea otters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon then canceled the landing, focusing on exercises at  
the Naval Postgraduate School near downtown and the Defense 
Language Institute at the Presidio of Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a fictional scenario, Monterey was transformed into a city  
in a friendly foreign nation that had requested assistance from the 
United States. One setup replicated a Korean village in Korea and 
another tested the military's ability to neutralize weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cara West, a resident who came out to watch the helicopters,  
said she worried the exercises might harm the marine habitat and 
was glad to learn they were landing at the airport instead. The 
only military action visible in town were helicopters overhead and 
the occasional military vehicle passing by. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in our town are against it but I think we need  
the practice,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Midwest Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Ole Miss players can finally relax, knowing  
they'll never again have to talk about how they're still winless in 
the NCAA tournament. It's such a momentous occasion Keith Carter 
even got a new haircut. 
</P>
<P>
	But if his players think they can coast from here, coach Rod  
Barnes would like a word with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a basketball game to play and we need to win the  
basketball game,'' he said Saturday. ``Nothing to lose? If you play 
you've got something lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rebels beat Villanova on Friday night for their first NCAA  
win in four tries. Ole Miss came close last year, only to lose to 
Valparaiso on Bryce Drew's buzzer-beater 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that they've gotten their first victory, however, the Rebels  
must play top-seeded Michigan State on Sunday in the second round 
of the Midwest Regional. The Spartans have won 19 straight, 
including a 76-53 rout of Mount St. Mary's in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to expect us to be in the game tomorrow, much  
less win,'' Carter said. ``So we're just going to go out and play 
the best we can, and hope that some of the pressure's going to be 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we've got that one out of the way, we're just looking  
forward to taking this thing as far as we can,'' Carter added. 
</P>
<P>
	But his players had better be more than just happy to be here  
Sunday, Barnes said. Barnes, a former Ole Miss player, is as 
thrilled as anyone the Rebels finally won a tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another game to play, however, and he's not about to  
hand it to Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they (players) feel somewhat relieved,'' Barnes said.  
``But I don't because I know what can happen if we don't come out 
and be prepared tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OVERCOMING HISTORY:* Any time the Ole Miss band plays ``Dixie''  
or a Rebel fan waves a Confederate flag, Rod Barnes knows there are 
people who will cringe. 
</P>
<P>
	The song and flag are painful reminders of the Deep South's  
history of racial inequity, and coaches at some schools have blamed 
the Rebel flag for hampering recruitment of black athletes. The 
Confederate battle flag was a rallying point for segregationists 
during the civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of dwelling on the Deep South's past, Barnes would  
prefer to look at its progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty years ago, an African-American wouldn't have even had  
the chance to go to the University of Mississippi. Now I'm the head 
coach at the University of Mississippi,'' said Barnes, who grew up 
in Mississippi. ``So there are strides that are being taken, and 
we're going to continue to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STILL HURTING:* Michigan State guard Charlie Bell's ankle is  
still a problem, coach Tom Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, a starter for the top-seeded Spartans, aggravated an ankle  
sprain he's had all season during Friday's first-round victory over 
Mount St. Mary's. Bell didn't practice Saturday, but Izzo said he'd 
be available for Sunday's game against Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to play, but at what level?'' Izzo said.  
``It definitely won't be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SAY WHAT?* North Carolina-Charlotte guard Marlon Thomas' first  
foray into broadcasting was all Marlon, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who helped stymie Lamar Odom in the 49ers' overtime  
victory over Rhode Island in the first round Friday, wants to get 
into broadcasting when his basketball days are over. Asked to try 
his hand at interviewing Saturday, Thomas turned to teammate Galen 
Young and asked him to talk about ``this Marlon Thomas kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was put on Odom after Young fouled out.  
</P>
<P>
	``Marlon Thomas has been our savior the whole year,'' Young said  
while Thomas giggled and grinned. ``When things go tough, we look 
to Marlon because we know we can ride his shoulders because he is 
the backbone of our team. We're just thankful to have him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas nodded as Young finished.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, that's what I thought you'd say,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SMALL STARTS:* North Carolina-Charlotte coach Bobby Lutz and  
Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson, whose teams face each other Sunday, 
both began their careers at tiny NAIA schools, where they learned 
the value of hard work, not to mention versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutz, who guided the 49ers (23-10) to the Conference USA  
postseason crown in his first season, turned Pfeiffer into a 
perennial power from 1986-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it makes you appreciate this level,'' Lutz said.  
``When I went to Pfeiffer, you swept the gym, you had keys to all 
the rooms, you did everything. I didn't have an assistant right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had to do everything, you had to coach, you had to  
recruit, you had to take care of academics. ... That makes you 
really appreciate when you're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson began his coaching career at Montana Tech and knows just  
how Lutz feels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that he knows what it's like to have $3 in his pocket  
for meal money after basketball games,'' Sampson said. ``That's 
something that these players in this tournament will not relate to. 
That's the NAIA. Those guys know how to do a lot with less.''

	Bomb Explodes at NC Abortion Clinic  
</P>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A bomb exploded outside an abortion  
clinic today, causing no injuries and little damage because the 
device only detonated partially. The clinic is less than 75 miles 
near the mountainous area where serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph 
is believed to be hiding. A second device was also found at the 
clinic, authorities said. ``It appeared to be a very large 
device,'' Police Chief Will Annarino said. ``I really can't get 
into how large it is right now. But it appears it could have caused 
a lot of damage.'' Homes and business near the building were 
evacuated and police cordoned off the road around the clinic.

	Clinton Urges More Police Training  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed  
improved training and other steps to restore ``the bonds of trust'' 
between the public and law enforcement. Recent questionable 
shootings by police that took the lives of young blacks in New 
York, Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif., have revived debates about 
how officers handle confrontations with minorities. In New Jersey, 
state troopers have come under fire for conducting traffic stops 
based on a driver's race -- so-called racial profiling. In his 
weekly radio address, Clinton proposed a $40 million funding 
increase to improve police training nationwide.

	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- At least 13 people were killed today  
after attackers set a crowded six-story department store on fire. 
It was one of Turkey's deadliest attacks in years. President 
Suleyman Demirel condemned the attack, and Prime Minister Bulent 
Ecevit said it was part of a campaign aimed at disrupting the April 
18 national elections. Police immediately beefed up security in 
this city of 12 million people, conducting identity checks on 
public transportation and warning people not to take parcels from 
strangers.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Departing for peace talks in France,  
ethnic Albanian delegates said today they were ready to sign a 
U.S.-backed Kosovo peace plan if the Serb-led government backs down 
on its opposition to allowing NATO troops to enforce it. Meanwhile, 
three bombs went off this afternoon in two government-controlled 
cities, killing at least six people and injuring more than 60. In 
one of the cities, Kosovska Mitrovica, the blast occurred next to a 
mosque in a fruit and vegetable market packed with weekend 
shoppers.

	Indonesia Closes 38 Private Banks

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian government closed 38  
private banks today and took over seven others in line with reforms 
required by the International Monetary Fund. Foreign lenders have 
required that Indonesia open up its shattered economy in exchange 
for billions of dollars of loans. ``This is a sweeping set of 
fundamental reforms designed to bring our banking system back to 
financial health,'' said Indonesian Senior Economics Minister 
Ginandjar Kartasasmita.

	GENEVA (AP) -- An English-Swiss balloon team prepared to re-enter  
the jet stream after passing the halfway point in their bid to be 
the first to circle the globe nonstop, their control center said. 
Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland 
floated across the Pacific Ocean today at a leisurely 35 mph. The

Breitling Orbiter 3 had traveled more than 13,670 miles since

ranking. Moya defeated Kuerten 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 in their Champions Cup

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mexico benefited from an own goal by the U.S.  
defender Robin Fraser on a play that also resulted in an injury to 
U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, and won 2-1 today to clinch the U.S. 
Cup '99 title. The Americans suffered their first setback under 
coach Bruce Arena, whose record went to 3-1-2. Mexico remained 
unbeaten (3-0-4) in the last seven outings against the United 
States and improved to 4-3-6 in the series since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	David Wells and Kerry Wood made belated spring debuts with very  
different results. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, sidelined by back spasms earlier this month, pitched one  
perfect inning in his first outing since Game 1 of the World Series 
as the Toronto Blue Jays lost to Pittsburgh 7-5 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The adrenaline was pumping out there,'' said Wells, who was  
traded from the New York Yankees to Toronto last month for Roger 
Clemens. ``It doesn't matter if it's preseason or postseason. The 
butterflies are there anytime you face major league hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, finally recovered from an upper respiratory and  
gastrointestinal illness that sidelined him for the early part of 
spring training, couldn't find the plate Saturday as a Chicago 
Cubs' split squad lost to the Anaheim Angels 6-5 at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to be out there,'' he said, still sweating from  
his in-game laps across the outfield. ``It's been a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's NL Rookie of the Year allowed three runs and three  
hits in 1 1-3 innings, walking two and striking out none. He threw 
to nine batters, and 16 of his 26 pitches were balls. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in the second inning, Wood threw 10 consecutive  
balls, prompting manager Jim Riggleman to make a trip to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little out of whack across the body at the end,'' Wood said  
of his problem. ``I was trying to throw strikes. They could have 
hit me out of the park, I wouldn't have cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., Wells threw only 11 pitches in the sixth  
inning, retiring Ivan Cruz on a grounder to second, striking out 
Brant Brown and getting Al Martin on a weak popup to short. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to be out there all day,'' Wells said. ``My  
philosophy has always been strike one, strike two and whatever 
happens, happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Phoenix, A misplay by country-music performer Garth Brooks  
contributed to the San Diego Padres' 2-1 loss to the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, playing left field in the ninth, stepped back, then  
sprinted forward and fell as a sinking drive by Milwaukee's Alex 
Ochoa fell off his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Ochoa was credited with a double and scored moments later on a  
single to center by Todd Dunn, giving the Brewers the victory over 
the split-squad Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I let these guys down,'' said Brooks, hitless in  
two trips to the plate. ``I dropped that ball in the ninth with two 
out. It just kills me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter Fla., Marlins starter Brian Meadows allowed two runs  
in four innings, but was booed after walking Mark McGwire in 
Florida's 3-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry they didn't get to see an 800-foot home run, but I  
didn't try to walk him,'' Meadows said. ``I like to see him hit 
home runs just as much as they do, but I don't want any to come off 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was 0-for-2, including the fourth-inning walk. Darren  
Bragg homered for St. Louis. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Virtual 'Gang' Face Criminal Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Law officers have accused a group of  
teen-agers of recruiting gang members based on a Web site created 
by the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Fayette County sheriff's deputies obtained warrants to arrest  
five teen-agers on charges of violating the Georgia Street Gang and 
Terrorism Act. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old, who was not identified, was arrested Thursday,  
and his father said he found the whole ordeal hard to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of their buddies last year jokingly created a Web page and  
put five people's names on it,'' he said. ``It's just five kids who 
live in the neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of encouraging others to join the ``Rollin 5  
Crackaz,'' the teen-agers could be sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Maj. Bruce Jordan said the Web site, which gives the  
boys' full names along with ``street'' names such as Baby Z and 
Killa Turk, is a recruiting tool -- even though it does not solicit 
members for a gang in this southern Atlanta suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``An Internet site that says how great your group is is  
basically advertising your group,'' Jordan said. ``We're trying to 
be proactive and keep from having a serious gang problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Seagraves, director of the Georgia chapter of the  
American Civil Liberties Union, said the sheriff's office has 
violated the boys' First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they break the law in the real world, not the virtual  
world, that's a different matter,'' Ms. Seagraves said. ``If they 
are punished for telling other kids about their group, that's a 
clear violation of their rights.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Thank Impeach Defenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- It's payback time for the president's  
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, careful to express contrition and avoid  
gloating after his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, began 
this weekend to publicly show his gratitude to those who stood up 
for him throughout the impeachment process. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks at a pair of fund-raisers for Democratic Rep. Max  
Sandlin in Texarkana, Texas, on Friday, Clinton directly linked his 
appearance to Sandlin's support when the House voted to impeach the 
president for the first time in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time in the last year when a lot of people were just  
worried which way the political winds were blowing, that guy was 
telling people to read the Constitution of the United States of 
America,'' he told a $1,000-a-plate dinner for Sandlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was the featured guest Saturday night at an  
Arkansas state Democratic party event that was billed as a salute 
to Dale Bumpers, who delivered the defense summation to the Senate 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandlin, first elected to Congress in 1996, had been asking  
Clinton for two years to attend a fund-raiser, a Sandlin aide said. 
The cocktail reception and dinner raised more than a half-million 
dollars to help Sandlin pay some $700,000 in campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Without directly referring to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, or  
even saying ``impeachment,'' Clinton cast Sandlin's opposition to 
the House charges as a stand ``to protect the kind of government 
that we have preserved for more than 220 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though he is a very junior member,'' Clinton said, ``he  
was one of the most serious, substantive, thoughtful and effective 
advocates, asking all the members of the Congress to read the 
Constitution, read the history, and uphold their oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a Democratic National Committee reception in Little Rock  
on Saturday, Clinton was the featured guest at a $200,000 state 
party fund-raiser in honor of Bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, who retired after the previous session of Congress,  
delivered a widely praised speech to the Senate that was part 
constitutional analysis, part collegial appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	He told senators weighing the president's fate in February that  
Clinton was guilty of a ``terrible moral lapse,'' but he insisted 
that Clinton's conduct did not warrant removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can censure Bill Clinton. You can hand him over to  
prosecutors. But you cannot convict,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he and Clinton have long known each other, the two men  
were never considered extremely close. During his first 
presidential term, Clinton went to then Sen. David Pryor, another 
now-retired Arkansas Democrat, when he wanted advice on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first Senate primary in 1970, Bumpers defeated Clinton's  
mentor, Sen. William Fulbright. Like Clinton, Bumpers is a former 
Arkansas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks to the Senate also excoriated House prosecutors for  
insensitivity to the Clinton family, which he said ``has already 
been about as decimated as a family can get.''

<HEADLINE> Former Cop Guilty of 54 Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. (AP) -- A former Gauley Bridge police chief  
accused of sexual assault against three boys has been convicted on 
54 counts, 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Edward Jones, 38, collapsed after the verdicts were read  
Friday. He later was taken to the Southern Regional Jail in 
Beckley, pending sentencing next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who was arrested about a year ago, had testified during  
the trial that the allegations were a conspiracy against him by 
State Police and prosecutors. At one point, dozens of people in the 
Fayette County town of 700 rallied in his support. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Kristen Keller said it was the strength of  
testimony from three witnesses, males ages 14 to 27, who detailed 
acts that occurred from 1983 until either 1995 or 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones faces a separate eight-count indictment involving a fourth  
boy, but Keller wasn't sure after the verdict if those charges will 
be pursued.

assault of a juvenile at a Myrtle Beach motel room in 1997.

<HEADLINE> McCain: GOP Must Get Back to Basics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona, trying to  
build support in a state where the Republican Party establishment 
has thrown its weight behind Texas Gov. George Bush and Elizabeth 
Dole, urged the party to unite once again behind the basics of less 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of South Carolina are independent, they're  
patriotic,'' he said Friday at a fundraiser. ``They have a very 
significant veterans population and I intend to motivate them to 
support my candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran, must topple Bush and former  
American Red Cross President Dole to win the South's earliest 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Though McCain has not officially declared his candidacy, he  
repeated his promise not to ``stoop to negative personal attacks 
against fellow Republicans.'' He also urged South Carolina 
Republicans to unite behind the party basics of less government and 
lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must ``remind voters that we are not simply the  
anti-Clinton party,'' McCain said. ``I believe people understand 
very well what we stand against. We need to remind them what we 
stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as he talked of unity within the party on core issues, he  
spoke out against New York Gov. George Pataki's call for the 
removal of the anti-abortion plank from the GOP's national 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not agree,'' McCain said, conceding that he might  
consider an abortion-rights running mate if that person had good 
``overall qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain faces an uphill battle in South Carolina, where Bush  
enjoys the support of key party officials, including Lt. Gov. Bob 
Peeler and House Speaker David Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Attorney General Charlie Condon is state chairman for  
Dole's presidential bid.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driver Gets 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- The family of a Jehovah's Witness who  
refused a blood transfusion after she was hit by a drunken driver 
scolded the man's defense for blaming the woman's death on her 
religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``You took the thing we loved most about my mom, her faith in  
God, and used it as an excuse,'' said Jeff Russell, the son of 
Jadine Russell, as he faced driver Keith Cook across the courtroom 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, 32, listened intently then apologized before being  
sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter. Mrs. Russell died 
after refusing a transfusion following the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	In courtroom statements punctuated by sobs from the audience,  
Mrs. Russell's family spoke of her noble life and the recklessness 
of Cook, who drove drunk while on probation for a previous 
conviction for driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook's sister told reporters he should not have received jail  
time because ``he's not a murderer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was responsible for getting in his car and driving,'' Dodie  
Cook O'Keeffe said. ``But she made the decision she was going to 
die that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell, 55, was standing on the side of the road with  
police after a minor car accident on the night of March 7, 1998, 
when Cook slammed his pickup truck into a stationary car, pushing 
the vehicle into the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter, Jennifer, and two police officers also were hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russell suffered broken bones and severe bleeding, but she  
told emergency workers and doctors ``No blood!'' at least 10 times, 
and even tried to pull out an intravenous line, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jehovah's Witnesses believe there is a biblical basis for  
refusing other people's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of the accident, Cook's blood-alcohol level was  
0.17 percent, more than twice the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Unger, the lawyer who based Cook's defense on the  
victim's religion, was scolded by Mrs. Russell's husband, James: 
``Shame on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Unger made no apologies, saying outside court that it was  
his job to defend his client in the best way possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said he felt ``sorrow and remorse'' and would try to atone  
with good works when he is released. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she had survived this accident, she would've been one of  
the people visiting you in jail,'' Jeff Russell said. ``She 
would've said, 'The man made a mistake.' She would've told us not 
to hate you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, you've not affected our faith,'' he added.  
``We, as Jehovah's Witnesses, will not give you that power. You've 
bruised us but you haven't crushed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in December convicted Cook of manslaughter instead of  
murder, rejecting the prosecution's claim that the drunken driver 
was solely responsible for the death of Mrs. Russell.

<HEADLINE> B-52 Bomber Will Fly 40 More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the Air Force has figured right, its  
4-decade-old B-52 bombers will still be flying at 80 years old, 
meaning the oldest plane in the U.S. bomber fleet is only now in 
middle age. 
</P>
<P>
	The granddaddy of long-range bombers is nowhere near retiring.  
In fact, the Air Force said Friday, it will remain a mainstay of 
the strategic bomber fleet until a new generation arrives in about 
2037. 
</P>
<P>
	Most pilots who fly B-52s today were not yet born when their  
planes entered service in the early 1960s. And those same planes 
will be flying well into the 21st century with pilots of a 
generation yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	That speaks highly of an airplane that already has more than  
tripled its original life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Structurally, they are in great shape,'' Lt. Gen. Ron Marcotte  
said in an interview. As commander of the 8th Air Force at 
Barksdale Air Force Base, La. -- home to 47 B-52s -- Marcotte flies 
the bombers regularly and said that with the help of exceptionally 
good maintenance the planes are ``doing extremely well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 8th Air Force's B-52s are standing by in England for  
possible use in NATO-led airstrikes in Yugoslavia, and others are 
on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, poised to act against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The first B-52s began their Air Force duty in June 1955; the  
ones flying now were built in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' said Glenn Buchan, a Rand Corp. expert on  
strategic bombers. ``The B-52 is one of the most remarkably 
successful airplanes every built.'' Indeed, Buchan said in an 
interview, the B-52 might be the best model on which to develop the 
next generation of long-range bombers -- a large plane capable of 
carrying a wide array of modern weapons and firing them from a 
great distance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is not ready to invest in a new generation of  
bombers, however. Over the next decade or so, the service will 
devote most of its aircraft development dollars to the F-22 stealth 
fighter to replace the F-15 Strike Eagle and the so-called Joint 
Strike Fighter to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Preserve what we have'' in bombers is the way Air Force  
Secretary F. Whitten Peters described the strategy Friday. He and 
Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, briefed reporters 
on a congressionally ordered ``white paper'' on the future of the 
long-range bomber fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The upshot is that the B-52, along with the younger B-1B Lancer  
and the new, stealthy B-2 Spirit, will be kept around until about 
2037. By that time, the Air Force calculates that attrition will 
have reduced the fleet below the minimum 170 aircraft. The B-52s 
may fly to 2045, and planning for a replacement bomber might start 
in 2013. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 190 long-range bombers in the active fleet: 93 B-1s,  
76 B-52s and 21 B-2s. Only 130 of those planes are fully 
combat-ready, however. The rest are in various states of backup 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The B-52s' home bases are Barksdale Air Force Base, La., and  
Minot Air Force Base, N.D.; the B-1s are mainly at Ellsworth Air 
Force Base, S.D., and Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, and the B-2s are 
at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Known officially as the Stratofortress, the B-52 is  
affectionately called the BUFF (for Big Ugly Fat Fellow) by its 
aircrews. Its wingspan of 185 feet makes it wider than it is long 
(159 feet), and it stands 40 feet high. With eight turbofan jet 
engines, it can carry 70,000 pounds of bombs, missiles and other 
weapons and fly 8,800 miles before refueling. 
</P>
<P>
	The H model of the B-52 rolled off the Boeing Co. assembly lines  
at a cost of $9 million per plane, and the first one entered 
service May 9, 1961, with the 379th Bomb Wing at Wurtsmith Air 
Force Base, Mich. Even taking decades of inflation into account, 
that is a far cry from the $2 billion it cost to field each B-2. 
</P>
<P>
	All these years later, the B-52 still carries the most diverse  
assortment of weapons in the bomber fleet. It is equipped to drop 
either nuclear or conventional munitions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accused of Hijacking Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Touching on a partisan sticking point in the  
education debate, Republican Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota 
derided President Clinton today for trying to ``hijack'' recently 
passed legislation to pay for his proposal to hire teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly GOP radio address, Schafer praised the so-called  
ed-flex bills, which passed in both the House and Senate on 
Thursday, for increasing states' flexibility in spending federal 
education money. He said the measures recognize the distinct 
challenges each state faces in educating its children. 
</P>
<P>
	But he accused the administration of injecting partisan politics  
into the education debate. Democratic lawmakers and the president 
protested a provision in the Senate version of the bill that shifts 
to special education programs the money that was supposed to help 
pay for Clinton's new-teachers plan this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president and his Democrat allies in the Senate should not  
have tried to hijack this important bill for his poll-driven plan 
to have the federal government pay for 100,000 new teachers in 
local schools,'' said Schafer, who is vice chairman of the 
Republican Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer said the goal of Clinton's proposal -- to reduce average  
class sizes to 18 pupils in early elementary grades -- is already 
being realized in some states, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor asked rhetorically whether the federal government  
would fund extra classrooms and extra support staff along with the 
teachers. ``You know the answer to that: Of course not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted that teachers and schools would prefer to have the  
money to spend on special education. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans complain that the federal government, while  
dictating the rules that states must follow on special education, 
provides only 7 percent to 12 percent of the costs of those 
programs. Current law allows the federal government to contribute a 
maximum of 40 percent of a state's special education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans believe it is irresponsible to launch new,  
expensive federal programs without adequately funding existing 
programs first,'' Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the administration's plan endemic of the very problem  
that the ed-flex measures try to eliminate: Washington's simplistic 
approach to education. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take into account the day-to-day realities of how  
schools really operate,'' the North Dakota governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not immediately threaten a veto this week, but he  
said he would try to eliminate the special education funding 
provision. ``The Senate used this bill to undermine one of our most 
important educational achievements,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> NCAA West Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- New Mexico center Kenny Thomas' final college game  
turned out to be his longest and most forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
	Mighty Connecticut and its suffocating defensive pressure held  
the 6-foot-8, 250-pound Thomas to a single free throw, a career low 
for the player who finished as the school's No. 2 scorer with 1,931 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In four seasons, Thomas led the Lobos to 102 victories, the most  
successful four years in the program's history. But it was in the 
NCAA tournament that Thomas repeatedly came up with some of his 
worst games. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this week's West Regional, Thomas had averaged just  
8.5 points and 6.5 rebounds in six NCAA games. Frequently in foul 
trouble, Thomas failed to come up with the kind of game that could 
have lifted his stock with NBA scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico's 61-59 victory over Missouri in Thursday's first  
round, Thomas finally shook the post-season slump. He had 20 
points, 10 rebounds and four blocks before fouling out late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	But against Connecticut, Thomas wasn't a factor. The Huskies'  
duo of 6-foot-11 center Jake Voskuhl and 6-7, 235-pound forward 
Kevin Freeman, manhandled him inside and kept him away from the 
basket. Thomas had 11 rebounds, but was 0-for-6 shooting, including 
0-for-3 on 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said the Huskies' defensive plan  
was to frustrate Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say play him smart. We tried to play him big,''  
Calhoun said. ``If he is going to make 3-point shots, we can live 
with that. We didn't want him in the post making shots inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 30 minutes he was on the floor, Thomas never got a good  
look inside, but denied later he was frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They double-teamed me and I wasn't expecting it,'' he said.  
``It's UConn and playing New Mexico. I didn't think they'd 
double-team me right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas now will wait for the NBA draft this summer. There is no  
consensus on how high he will go. At his best, he has uncommon 
quickness and a deft shooting touch for someone of his size. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pros will also look at how he struggled in the NCAA. He  
had four points and four rebounds against Kansas State his freshman 
season, eight points and three rebounds against Louisville two 
years ago and three points and five rebounds against Butler in 
1998. And finally, his nightmarish afternoon against Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DAVIS STILL THERE:* Like a relative who comes to visit for a  
couple of days and stays two weeks, Iowa coach Tom Davis is 
determined to party as long as he can in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going back home, getting our sunglasses and shorts and  
do it again,'' the lame-duck Iowa coach said Saturday after the 
fifth-seeded Hawkeyes beat fourth-seeded Arkansas 82-72 to advance 
to the round of 16 next week in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa told Davis last year his contract would not be renewed  
after this season. Davis is being forced out despite being the 
winningest coach in school history (269-139). The victory over 
Arkansas also gave him his 10th 20-win season in Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	After the win over Arkansas, Davis was embraced individually by  
his players. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MESSAGE TO DUKE?:* Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin said  
the Huskies weren't thinking of No. 1 Duke as they put away New 
Mexico in the game's first seven minutes with a 17-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we tried to send a message to them,'' El-Amin  
said after the 78-56 victory over the Lobos. ``We wanted to come 
out and play Connecticut basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin did make it clear Connecticut is building momentum and  
looking forward to a possible meeting with the Blue Devils in the 
national finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we play hard like this and be so aggressive on  
defense and take our shot on offense, we are one of the best teams 
in the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TURNOVER TURNAROUND:* With an extended pressure defense that  
springs traps without warning, Arkansas usually thrives on 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Razorbacks held true to form in the first half against Iowa,  
forcing 16 turnovers that led to 14 points, but the Hawkeyes turned 
the tables in the second half with their own full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazzled by the unexpected pressure, Arkansas had 12 second-half  
turnovers -- including three straight during a 16-0 Iowa run -- that 
led to 16 points for the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press did exactly for them what it had done for us in the  
first half when they jumped on us and we came back,'' Arkansas 
coach Nolan Richardson said. ``It stopped our momentum.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Devils March On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- It didn't take Florida A&AMP;M coach Mickey  
Clayton long to figure out what some of the nation's best teams 
will have to do to knock off No. 1 Duke in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would have to bring your `A' game. You couldn't do it with  
your `B' or your `C,''' Clayton said following his team's 99-58 
loss Friday night to the top-seeded Blue Devils in the first round 
of the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the regular season, the Blue Devils (33-1) left  
little drama for the second half. Duke sank 11 of its first 14 
shots en route to shooting 66 percent in the first half, and went 
on to extend its school-record winning streak to 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played hard. They didn't get the win, but at the same  
time I didn't think they expected to,'' Duke's Chris Burgess said 
of the Rattlers (12-19), the only team in the 64-team NCAA field 
with a losing record. ``I think they just wanted to make sure they 
had a nice experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton and his players said they enjoyed Thursday's news  
conference, when they dreamed of beating the nation's most dominant 
team. Then, Friday's game unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality of it is we got whipped. It is never fun getting a  
whipping,'' Clayton said. ``When your daddy spanked you, even if 
you did wrong, you didn't enjoy it. They handed it to us in a lot 
of different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's only question mark for Sunday's second-round game against  
ninth-seeded Tulsa is the health of Trajan Langdon, who missed his 
third straight game with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important we get him back. He's our emotional  
leader, he's our team leader and he's the best shooter in the 
country,'' Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the nation's longest winning streak survived the first  
round of the tournament, College of Charleston saw its 25-game 
winning streak snapped on the same court where it began -- the 
Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa blew most of a 26-point lead, but steadied itself in the  
final minutes and held on for a 62-53 victory over the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Hurricane (23-9) turned it over on six consecutive  
possessions, helping fuel a 25-1 run by Charleston that cut the 
Cougars' deficit to 53-51 with 3:20 left before Tulsa steadied 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener, Brandon Wharton pulled Tennessee out of its  
shooting woes with 16 second-half points in a 62-52 over Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols will meet Southwest Missouri State in the second game  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-seeded Tennessee (21-8) overcame a miserable offensive  
start to win its first NCAA tournament game in 16 years. The Vols 
also snapped Delaware's 13-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was an offensive nightmare for both clubs. Neither team  
shot better than 33 percent and they combined for 37 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Survive and advance, that's what we call it,'' Tennessee coach  
Jerry Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee missed 17 of its first 20 shots, but managed to win  
its first NCAA tourney game since 1983 because 13th-seeded Delaware 
shot a season-low 29.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Hens (25-6) entered the postseason with 10 straight  
double-digit wins and the nation's fifth-longest winning streak, 
but couldn't handle Tennessee's athletic front line as the game 
wore on. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was an upset in the day's second game as the  
12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State Bears held No. 5 seed 
Wisconsin to 12 first-half points and went on to a 43-32 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's scoring output was the lowest by any team in a  
first- or second-round game in the history of the tournament. It 
also was the lowest output in any NCAA tourney game since the 
introduction of the shot clock in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams did a better job of defending us starting in February,''  
said Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett, whose Badgers (22-10) wound up 
with their lowest point total since 1948-49. ``I take a lion's 
share of the responsibility or not finding ways for us to play 
better and score more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive gem gave Southwest Missouri State (21-10) its  
first victory ever against a Big Ten team and its first NCAA 
tournament victory since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm upset because I felt our guards immediately took us out of  
our game plan,'' Bennett said. ``We came out and started jacking 3s 
the first four or five possessions.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Claim Torture in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Security police tortured three Americans  
charged with espionage, terrorism and sabotage in Zimbabwe, their 
lawyer said Saturday during the suspects' first appearance in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, accused of being mercenaries and arms dealers, are  
missionaries for an Indianapolis-based Protestant group, defense 
attorney Jeremy Callow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were arrested when a hand gun carried by one of them  
activated an airport metal detector on Sunday. The men were 
attempting to board a flight to the United States via Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimbabwe police said -- and Callow admitted in court -- that the  
Americans owned a truck found the same day at the airport. The 
vehicle contained assault and sniper rifles, shotguns, a light 
machine gun, hand guns, firearms, telescopic sights, knives, 
camouflage cream, two-way radios and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Callow claimed police beat the men and applied electric shocks  
to their genitals last week while they were in custody, the 
state-run news agency Ziana reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge granted Callow's request for a physical examination and  
a private physician for John Lamonte Dixon, 39, Gary George 
Blanchard, 34, and Joseph Wendell Pettyjohn, 35, all of 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Magistrate Alpheus Chitakunya also ordered prison staff to  
ensure that any further police interrogation take place in the 
presence of their lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chitakunya turned down a bail request and ordered the men  
held until March 26. They face life imprisonment if they are 
convicted on the weapons charges alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking disheveled but alert, the suspects shuffled into court  
with their feet in leg irons and shackled to plain clothes 
policemen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quick interview with journalists, Blanchard indicated that  
security police had hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are walking a bit better now than we were,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutor John Musakwa told the court that a diagram of  
Zimbabwe's presidential offices -- across the road from President 
Robert Mugabe's official residence -- was also found in the 
suspects' truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are mercenaries belonging to a group called Harvest Field  
Ministries of USA,'' said Musakwa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercenaries in Africa often pose as missionaries in order to  
mask arms shipments and travel unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
	Musakwa said the men arrived in Harare by truck from Congo last  
week, where Zimbabwe is supporting Congolese President Laurent 
Kabila with troops and weapons in an eight-month old civil war. The 
men had been flying in and out of Zimbabwe since 1997, when they 
arranged for arms to be shipped to Congo via Tanzania, Musakwa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects provided a phone number for the Indianapolis  
organization, based in the home of Jonathon Wallace, who identified 
himself as the president of the group, Harvest Field Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said the men worked for his organization, which he  
described as an independent Protestant missionary group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We help the poor. We were drilling wells in the Congo to help  
the people,'' Wallace said, adding that Pettyjohn is his 
son-in-law. He said the weapons were for hunting and the camouflage 
cream was for paintball war games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the missionaries had distributed seeds, clothing,  
medicine, Bibles and other books in Congo. He denied his group had 
anything to do with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Them charges are so ridiculous it's unbelievable,'' Wallace  
said. ``They had just went over to pay all of our bills there in 
the Congo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace expressed disappointment with the U.S. Embassy in  
Harare: ``The embassy is kind of standing back. I don't understand 
why they haven't pursued more in this matter. Is someone going to 
address the beatings and these men's lives?'' 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. diplomats were in court Saturday and the U.S. Embassy  
has denied the men were connected to the government.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City's mayor, an icon to the nation's  
left, says he will launch a third bid for the presidency by running 
in the 2000 elections, according to an interview published 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am ready for the presidential candidacy,'' Cuauhtemoc  
Cardenas was quoted as saying in the daily Reforma. 
</P>
<P>
	He also repeated a proposal that Mexico's opposition parties  
form an alliance to topple the Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
which has ruled Mexico for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardenas is the dominant figure of his Democratic Revolution  
Party and one of Mexico's most respected -- if not always successful 
-- politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of revered President Lazaro Cardenas, who served in the  
1930s, Cardenas lost a fraud-marred presidential election in 1988 
and finished third in 1994. In 1997, he became the first elected 
mayor of Mexico City in about 60 years.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal officials have found 17 paintings  
owned by a noted writer whose death is surrounded by mystery, the 
attorney general's office said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The find may lift some of the confusion surrounding the death of  
writer and dancer Nelly Campobello. 
</P>
<P>
	Campobello was rarely seen in the years before her death.  
Eventually, Mexican intellectuals persuaded the government to look 
into her whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a judge ordered a suspect held for trial on charges  
he kept Campobello captive for years. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a death certificate that the suspect, Claudio  
Fuentes, signed as a witness, Campobello died of a heart ailment at 
the age of 86 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	When police exhumed her grave, they found three bodies.  
Investigators say one of the bodies matches Campobello's 
description, but the other two remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office said it uncovered 17 missing  
paintings belonging to Campobello, including works by Jose Clemente 
Orozco and Carlos Merida, at a house in Mexico City on Wednesday. 
It gave no further details. 
</P>

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal officials said Saturday they have  
seized more than 25,000 counterfeit recordings from street markets 
in the northern state of Coahuila. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, the federal attorney general's office said it  
had seized 24,697 audio tapes, 552 videocassettes and 340 compact 
discs during raids. 
</P>
<P>
	It said there were no arrests.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have long pressed Mexico to crackdown on  
widespread counterfeiting of music and video recordings, as well as 
of computer software. 
</P>

	Street stalls throughout the country openly sell obviously  
counterfeited works, and many computer dealers offer unlicensed

propose a date for the vote, but said he wanted it to be held 
within three months.

	The Alliance and other opposition parties held a forum Friday to  
find ways to block President Carlos Menem from trying to seek 
re-election Oct. 24. Menem has hinted that he might be interested 
in seeking a third term if his supporters could find a legal way 
for him to run.

<HEADLINE> FCC Releases Audit of Bell Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission released  
an audit of the five regional Bell telephone companies Friday 
reporting that $5 billion in equipment can't be accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bells contend the audit, conducted in 1997, is flawed and  
overestimates missing equipment. FCC auditors have disputed this 
but one commissioner raised questions about the accuracy of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Audit results, the Bells say, won't affect rates directly. But  
consumer groups, AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom are already using the audit 
to press for lower local and long-distance rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC intends to seek public comments on the audit, its  
ramifications and what action, if any, the commission should take. 
FCC staff recommended, however, that the Bells be required to take 
write-offs and making accounting corrections. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FCC agreed to release the audit, but the results  
-- covering hundreds of pages -- did not come out until late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff report recommends, for example, that BellSouth write  
off $430 million in equipment. BellSouth said the recommendation is 
inappropriate because many items the FCC auditors claim don't exist 
in fact do exist. It also said a write-off wouldn't affect rates. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth also said there appeared  
to be problems with the audit's methodology. ``I believe that this 
agency and its commissioners may never be capable of judging the 
accuracy and authenticity of the current set of audit results,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he raised concerns that the auditors may have turned a  
``blind eye'' to equipment they classified as missing but was 
subsequently found by telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Commissioner Gloria Tristani said the FCC's staff ``has been  
very thorough and careful in performing these audits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth said: ``While we dispute the methodology and the  
results of the FCC's audit, it must be understood that the accuracy 
of records of our equipment inventory has no impact on our rates. 
None.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said the audit results could have serious implications for  
consumers. ``The Bell companies use their self-reported investments 
in various regulatory contexts to justify higher rates,'' AT&AMP;T 
said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tournament Ratings Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With fewer buzzer-beaters and a lack of  
competitive games, CBS' ratings have slipped for the first two days 
of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS averaged averaged a 4.7 preliminary national rating in the  
two-day period, down 2 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's coverage of Friday's four games posted a 4.8  
rating and a 12 share, which was even from the second day of last 
year's tournament. But on Thursday, it had a 4.7/12 mark -- down 2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reasons for Thursday's dropoff was that much of the  
East coast was asleep when North Carolina and UCLA were upset late 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Another was the abundance of blowouts. Only eight of the 32  
first-round matchups were decided by fewer than five points. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the tournament numbers may be down, CBS' final regular  
season ratings were up 5 percent from last season -- the first time 
in six years its numbers haven't decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're up in today's world, you're ahead of the  
game,'' said CBS Sports President Sean McManus. ``There's so much 
college basketball on, thousands of games, and so many different 
places to watch games that it makes it difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network averaged a 2.1/5 in a year in which the college game  
didn't have to go up against the NBA for much of the season because 
of the lockout. CBS posted a 2.0/5 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN also capitalized on the NBA lockout, with a rating increase  
of 13 percent on its primary channel and an 8 percent increase on 
ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ratings dropped 6 percent from a 1.8 to a 1.7.  
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes Outside N.C. Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- One of two bombs planted outside an  
abortion clinic exploded Saturday, causing no injuries and little 
damage because it detonated only partially. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic, less than 75 miles from the mountainous area where  
serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph is believed to be hiding, 
received no advance warning of the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about a possible link between the explosion and  
Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage, we 
don't discount anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second bomb ``was located in the same proximity as the first  
device,'' Asheville Police Chief Will Annarino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exploded bomb was placed outside the Femcare clinic, next to  
a wall near where the waiting room is located, Annarino said. It 
went off at about a half-hour before the clinic was to open at 8 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared to be a very large device,'' Annarino said. ``I  
really can't get into how large it is right now. But it appears it 
could have caused a lot of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homes and businesses near the building were evacuated and police  
cordoned off the road around the Orange Street clinic in a 
neighborhood several blocks from downtown Asheville. More residents 
were evacuated when the second device was found. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI and Asheville bomb teams disarmed what was left of the  
exploded bomb and were working to disarm the unexploded bomb early 
Saturday night. Investigators would not elaborate on the makeup of 
the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that  
received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium 
anthrax. Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Annarino said it was premature to discuss whether the package  
and the explosion are related. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in Little Rock, Ark., said he was deeply  
disturbed to learn about the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that the perpetrators of this terrible act will  
be brought to justice,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been a fugitive since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of  
a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty 
policeman and severely wounded a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three  
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that 
killed one person. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Clinton administration said it plans to seek  
$4.5 million for alarm systems and closed-circuit camera systems to 
protect abortion clinics to counter violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also would be used to determine which clinics were  
most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Police Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Expressing concern that recent charges  
of police misconduct could undermine the fight against crime, 
President Clinton on Saturday proposed improved training and other 
steps to restore the ``bonds of trust'' between the public and law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been deeply disturbed by recent allegations of serious  
police misconduct and continued reports of racial profiling that 
have shaken some communities' faith in the police who are there to 
protect them,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent questionable shootings by police that took the lives of  
young blacks in New York, Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif., have 
revived debate about how officers handle confrontations with 
minorities. In New Jersey, state troopers have come under fire for 
conducting traffic stops based on a driver's race -- so-called 
racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People, the National Council of La Raza, the National Asian 
Pacific American Legal Consortium and other groups have called on 
Clinton to speak out against police brutality and withhold federal 
funds from departments with poor records. 
</P>
<P>
	The president used his weekly radio address to speak to those  
concerns. He also offered a series of federal initiatives and 
policy suggestions designed to bolster public confidence in law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touted the steady drop in crime nationwide since his  
administration began promoting community policing. But he cautioned 
that those advances could be undermined if public trust in the 
police waned. 
</P>
<P>
	``While each specific allegation will have to be dealt with on  
its own merits, it is clear that we need a renewed determination as 
a nation to restore those bonds of trust that have been absolutely 
critical to our success at lowering the crime rate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president taped his address at the White House on Friday  
before flying to Hope, Ark., to dedicate his birthplace as a 
historical site and raise money for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attended two events in Little Rock Saturday, and helped  
raise $200,000 at each of them for the Democratic National 
Committee and the state party. 
</P>
<P>
	To enhance relations between the police and citizens, the  
president said he would instruct the Justice Department to expand 
police ethics training at 30 regional community policing centers. 
He proposed a $40 million funding increase to improve police 
training nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for a nationwide program to help more communities  
establish ``Citizen Police Academies'' to acquaint citizens with 
the work of law enforcement, and $2 million to help police 
departments recruit more minority officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Police departments ought to reflect the diversity of the  
communities they serve,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he noted that the current Justice Department budget  
includes new funds to enforce civil rights laws ``so that a few bad 
police officers do not undermine the progress, and the support, 
that hundreds of thousands of police officers have worked so hard 
to earn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Police Organizations, an umbrella  
group of law enforcement unions and other interests, has called on 
the administration to produce programs to inform police cadets and 
current officers that official misconduct carries federal prison 
terms.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Phoebe Brand cannot excuse Elia Kazan. She  
cannot forget that nearly 47 years ago, the great director named 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	She cannot forget because hers was one of those names.  
</P>
<P>
	``I forgive,'' she says. ``I forgive a lot, but I don't think I  
can forgive Kazan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Kazan told a congressional committee that Miss Brand had  
been a member of the Communist Party, he punched her ticket for the 
blacklist. Forty years would pass before the actress would appear 
in a film. 
</P>
<P>
	But at that same moment, Kazan sealed his own fate. For the rest  
of his life, Kazan would be known as Broadway's best director -- AND 
as a McCarthy-era Judas. He would be remembered for films like ``On 
the Waterfront'' and ``East of Eden'' -- AND for destroying 
colleagues' careers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 89 years old now. Next Sunday night his own career will be  
crowned with a signal honor, an Academy Award for lifetime 
achievement. But the honor has been overshadowed by screams of 
outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Age and ability in the arts or anything else, in my opinion,  
does not excuse a crime,'' says Rod Steiger, star of ``On the 
Waterfront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the good guys win,'' rejoins Charleton Heston.  
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the lifetime achievement award is a deathless pause in  
the Oscars' relentless pageant of glitz. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year will be different. Expect protests and  
counter-demonstrations, lusty cheers and stone silence -- all 
because of something that happened before many of us were born, at 
a time when Americans hated and feared the Soviet Union, a country 
that no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other figure who testified, Kazan remains a  
lightning rod for those who despise what happened in those days, 
even as others applaud him as a truth-telling hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	Because a half-century after America went on a hunt for  
Communists in its government, its media and all its closets, the 
hunt -- and the fruits of that hunt -- remain a matter of contention. 
And because Kazan was the most celebrated witness to give the House 
Committee on Un-American Activities what it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he was the best director of the theater in my  
time,'' says playwright Arthur Laurents, himself a victim of the 
blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan brought ``Death of a Salesman'' and ``A Streetcar Named  
Desire'' to the stage and continued to direct the best work of two 
titans, Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams. He won praise for 
films like ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' and an Oscar for 
``Gentleman's Agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every play of worth intended for Broadway was offered me  
first. I had to shrug them off,'' Kazan recalled in ``A Life,'' his 
1988 autobiography. ``In films it was only a matter of what I 
wanted to do, name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he was at the top of the entertainment world, he wasn't born  
anywhere near it. He came into this world as Elia Kazanjioglou, and 
arrived in the United States from Turkey when he was 4. Always, he 
wrote in his memoirs, he has felt like an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan rejected the life his father expected of him: working at  
the family carpet company. Instead, he wound up at Yale Drama 
School, and then at New York's Group Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group was devoted to performing new plays that turned a  
penetrating light on American life. Its leaders were Harold Clurman 
and Lee Strasberg, perhaps two of the most influential figures in 
the history of the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Kazan who shouted ``Strike!'' at the end of Clifford  
Odets' ``Waiting for Lefty,'' a 1935 play about a taxi drivers' 
walkout. The audience roared ``Strike!'' in response -- an 
electrifying, legendary moment. 
</P>
<P>
	By this time, Kazan was a member of the Communist Party -- there  
was and is no law against it -- and he was not alone among members 
of the Group. In his book, he said there was a cell that met on 
Tuesday nights in actor Joseph Bromberg's dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Kazan, the success of ``Waiting for Lefty''  
encouraged party leaders to take a stronger hand. They told Kazan 
to inform the cell that it must lead other actors in an 
insurrection, taking control of the Group from its directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan says he did as he was told, but then told the cell that he  
disagreed with the plan. The party pressured Kazan to change his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he quit. He had been a member for less than two years,  
from the summer of 1934 to the spring of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	So much changed in the next 16 years. The Depression ended,  
taking with it many of the radical impulses of a nation in peril. 
And with World War II and its aftermath, feelings toward the Soviet 
Union evolved from suspicion to camaraderie to enmity. 
</P>
<P>
	The blacklist began in 1947 when hearings into Communist  
involvement in the film industry led to contempt charges against 
the Hollywood Ten, screenwriters who would not answer the 
committee's questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Your career could be destroyed because you refused to talk, or  
because you were named as a party member, or because ``Red 
Channels'' or some other publication reported that you were 
politically suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare, it was, and even as I talk to you about it  
now, I can feel my body being disturbed,'' says Betsy Blair Reisz. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reisz, first wife of actor Gene Kelly, was listed in ``Red  
Channels'' though she was not a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kelly's insistence, she was given a major part in the movie  
``Marty,'' for which she received an Oscar nomination, but that was 
just a chink in the blacklist. Aside from one B movie in 1959, 
Hollywood shunned her. She moved to France, then England making 
films in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It knocked people out of the box for 15 years,'' says Victor  
Navasky, editor of ``The Nation'' and author of ``Naming Names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1952, Kazan testified before the House committee.  
Yes, he said, he had been a Communist. No, he said, he would not 
name others he knew to be members of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months later, he did just that.  
</P>
<P>
	What happened in the meantime? Kazan, in his book, said that  
producer Darryl Zanuck's pleas did not move him to name names; 
instead, he said he came to realize that he no longer agreed with 
the Communist program, and he abhorred the party's stealth. 
</P>
<P>
	And so he named:  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Leverett. Joseph Bromberg. Phoebe Brand and her husband,  
Morris Carnovsky. Odets. Paula Miller (Lee Strasberg's wife). Art 
Smith. And others he knew who were not members of the Group 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	Most, if not all, had been named by others. Bromberg had died  
that year; he was already blacklisted, and had gone to London for 
work despite a weak heart. Kazan said he and Odets had agreed to 
name each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan testified in executive session. The next day, the  
committee released his testimony. And the day after that, Kazan 
placed an ad in The New York Times -- a defiant explanation of what 
he had done, written by his wife, Molly, under his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secrecy serves the Communists,'' the statement insisted. ``At  
the other pole, it serves those who are interested in silencing 
liberal voices. The employment of good liberals is threatened 
because they have allowed themselves to become associated with or 
silenced by the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Liberals must speak out.''  
</P>
<P>
	The response was immediate. Old friends -- friends who knew him  
by his nickname, ``Gadg,'' short for ``Gadget'' -- cut him dead, 
turning their heads when they saw him on the street. The statement 
in the Times didn't mollify them; it infuriated them. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Karl Malden gave him tickets for his new play, ``The  
Desperate Hours.'' He also gave tickets to actor Sam Jaffe, but 
when Jaffe learned that Kazan would be sitting in the same row, he 
canceled his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tony Kraber, a fellow member of the Group, was called to  
testify, he was asked if Kazan's testimony was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this the Kazan who signed a contract for $500,000 the day  
after he gave names to the committee?'' Kraber replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan denied it. But even if it wasn't true, Kazan's detractors  
said, he was wealthy and could have lived well without the movies. 
He could have hewed to the stage, where no blacklist existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also,'' says Arthur Laurents, ``he was in a very strong  
position. ... He could have made the committee look bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Navasky: ``He was at the top of his form when he was  
called, and people felt if he couldn't resist, how could they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he was known as a director with a social conscience,  
creator of such films as ``Gentleman's Agreement,'' which condemned 
anti-Semitism. ``He was thought to be a man of moral fiber,'' says 
Navasky, so many on the left were shocked at what they considered a 
betrayal of friends and colleagues, and his reasons are disputed to 
this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He DIDN'T name everyone in the cell,'' says Patrick  
McGilligan, co-author of ``Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the 
Hollywood Blacklist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He named the people he didn't like. He named the people who he  
felt condescended to him. ... He was a cutthroat guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many on the right, Kazan acted as a hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``The villains and victims have been inverted. The Communists  
should have apologized. They should have been charged with 
treason,'' says Scott McConnell, a spokesman for the Ayn Rand 
Institute who is organizing counter-demonstrations in Los Angeles 
to support Kazan on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell insists that Communists did subvert films, both with  
overt propaganda in movies like ``Mission to Moscow'' and ``Song of 
Russia,'' and with other movies that glorified self-sacrifice and 
collective work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonsense, says Laurents, whose newest play, ``Jolson Sings  
Again,'' is the story of a director who informs. ``Nobody has been 
able to point to one movie that was propaganda for the Soviet 
Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Group Theatre, ``it was not political. Everyone tried  
to make it seem so, and it was not,'' says Phoebe Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an argument that is still played out in any discussion of  
the Red Scare. American Communists were subversive agents of 
Stalin, says one side. No, says the other: They were well-meaning 
Social Democrats, though perhaps they were naive. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, the argument is an unending loop, and they cannot bear  
to discuss it or Kazan any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't talk about that. Not a word. It makes me sick,'' says  
Jules Dassin, the director who fled to Greece when he was 
blacklisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I can't talk about it,'' says Karl Malden, who as a member  
of the Academy's board proposed the lifetime achievement award for 
Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan himself is not talking. He told his story in ``A Life,''  
and some would say he told it in ``On the Waterfront,'' in which 
informing is a virtue. His lawyer, Floria V. Lasky, says he will 
not apologize when he receives the award. ``Apologize for what?'' 
she asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Bentley believes Kazan deserves the honor, and he thinks  
the firestorm he must endure is unfair. The Communists were shifty, 
he says, and Kazan acted out of principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentley didn't always feel that way. Once, he wrote a play --  
``Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?'' -- in which Kazan was one of 
the villains. Relations between the two men were less than 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he encountered Kazan at a gathering at cartoonist Al  
Hirschfeld's place. Someone who was unaware of their history tried 
to introduce them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan is ``quite coherent when he speaks ... (but) his brain is  
somewhere else a lot of the time now,'' Bentley says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put his arms around me, which is pretty hard to do, because  
he's a lot shorter than I am. And he said, `Eric, we always got 
along fine, we did.' And I thought, `No, we didn't.' But I didn't 
say anything.''

<HEADLINE> Several NHL Stars Out With Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When the Washington Capitals had injuries to key players earlier  
this season, general manager George McPhee joked that he had an 
all-star team in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
	Now many other NHL teams know exactly how he felt. There are  
several all-stars sidelined by injury, including forwards Wayne 
Gretzky, Mark Messier, Brett Hull, Theo Fleury and Pavel Bure. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-name goaltenders haven't been spared, either. Dominik Hasek,  
Tom Barrasso and Grant Fuhr all have missed lengthy periods with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Want to talk all-star defensemen? How about Kevin Hatcher?  
</P>
<P>
	``We lost very good players and it's a big loss,'' said  
Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, referring to Barrasso, Hatcher and 
defenseman Darius Kasparaitis. ``We have to battle through this and 
start winning again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso has a broken hand, Hatcher a broken foot and  
Kasparaitis a knee strain, and none is expected to be back soon. 
Without them, the Penguins recently had a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's absence from the Buffalo lineup also has had a negative  
effect on the Sabres. In 10 games without the league's two-time 
MVP, the Sabres were 3-4-3 before Saturday's game against Boston. 
Hasek has been out with a strained groin since Feb. 17 and is in a 
day-to-day situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are in no hurry to rush him back, fearing further  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the type of injury that can keep you on the sidelines for  
a while, so he's doing the right thing staying out,'' Sabres 
captain Mike Peca said. ``We're getting close to the playoffs. 
That's where we want him to be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Panthers don't have that luxury. In a five-team  
fight for a playoff berth in the Eastern Conference, the Panthers 
need Bure now. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bure has a torn cartilage in his right knee and is expected  
to be out two to three weeks. Bure, acquired in a blockbuster trade 
with Vancouver this season, had 13 goals in 11 games with the 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr returned to the Blues' lineup on Saturday after missing 16  
games because of arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, and won 
his 100th game for St. Louis in a 6-4 victory over Edmonton. His 
absence had thrown the Blues' goaltending situation into disarray. 
St. Louis has used a total of five goaltenders so far, and has been 
struggling as the NHL heads into the final weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Canucks weren't an NHL power when Messier went  
down with a knee injury Feb. 11. But his absence hasn't helped the 
Canucks. There's still no word when he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of a star player hasn't hurt everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche haven't missed a beat with Fleury  
sidelined by a sprained right knee and the Dallas Stars' depth has 
overcome the loss of Hull to a hamstring injury and defenseman 
Darryl Sydor to a knee sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, teams played better in the immediate aftermath of  
a star's absence as other players picked up their games to 
compensate. Such a team was the New York Rangers, who went 5-0-1 
right after Gretzky was sidelined by a neck injury Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rangers have since lost two straight.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you are missing a star player (it is tough) because  
they're the key,'' Ottawa coach Jacques Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Privatize Weapons Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is moving forward with plans to  
privatize its weapons handling operations despite criticism that 
the proposal would compromise national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the process, and as we get closer to the actual  
implementation of those initiatives, we are prudently handling 
those concerns for security,'' said a Navy spokesman, Cmdr. Brian 
Cullin. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers affected by the plan are responsible for loading and  
unloading weapons from the nation's warships. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan underway would affect a half dozen bases nationwide in  
California, New Jersey, Virginia, South Carolina and Washington 
state. California's Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is the busiest 
weapons depot. 
</P>
<P>
	Weapons depots in those areas began preparing for the bids over  
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics insist that placing the handling of the nation's  
Tomahawk missiles and torpedoes in private hands would jeopardize 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Handling ammunition is not like handling groceries,'' Wiley  
Pearson, a defense policy analyst for the union representing 
civilian weapons handlers, told The Los Angeles Times, which 
reported on the changes Saturday. ``You need special skills, and 
you need special oversight. As a matter of national defense and 
national security, there is a huge risk here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cullin countered that privatization has been occurring over  
the past 15 years in many sectors of the Navy's operations. 
Officials did not move forward with the weapons handling plan until 
they were certain security would not be compromised, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why you find it being one of the last ones'' for  
privatization, Cullin said. ``We needed to ensure that the 
appropriate regulations were in place before we could move 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy does not plan to review the submitted bids until Jan.  
1, 2001, he said. The privatization effort, which was included in 
fiscal year 1999 budget plans for the Navy, is expected to save $8 
billion by 2005. About 80,500 jobs will be outsourced as part of 
the plan.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Wins U.S. Soccer Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mexico benefited from an own goal by the United  
States defender Robin Fraser on a play that also resulted in an 
injury to U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, and won 2-1 Saturday to 
clinch the U.S. Cup '99 title. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico, which won both its tournament games, took its third  
straight U.S. Cup championship before a pro-Mexican crowd estimated 
at more than 50,000 in its first appearance against the Americans 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Hejduk tied the score 1-1 for the U.S. on an unassisted  
goal in the 51st minutes. But the Mexicans soon went back ahead in 
the 58th minute on a score by Jose Manuel Abundis, assisted by 
Rafael Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser inadvertently gave Mexico a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute,  
when a Mexican crossing pass deflected off his upper body into the 
nets while he slid to the turf. On the play, Mexico's Francisco 
Palencia started near Fraser in the penalty box and continued 
forward, colliding with Meola. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola stayed on the ground for treatment, then left the game  
with a cut lip and minor dental damage. He was replaced by Zach 
Thornton, who received the victory in Thursday's 3-1 win over 
Guatemala in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the third start this year for Meola, who returned to  
the U.S. national team in January after a four-year absence. He had 
shutouts against Boliva and Germany in his other outings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans suffered their first setback under coach Bruce  
Arena, whose record went to 3-1-2. Mexico remained unbeaten (3-0-4) 
in the last seven outings against the U.S.. and improved to 4-3-6 
in the series since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Thanks His Defenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- It's payback time for the president's  
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, careful to express contrition and avoid  
gloating after his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, began 
this weekend to publicly show his gratitude to those who stood up 
for him throughout the impeachment process. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks at a pair of fund-raisers for Democratic Rep. Max  
Sandlin in Texarkana, Texas, on Friday, Clinton directly linked his 
appearance to Sandlin's support when the House voted to impeach a 
president for the first time in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time in the last year when a lot of people were just  
worried which way the political winds were blowing, that guy was 
telling people to read the Constitution of the United States of 
America,'' he told a $1,000-a-plate dinner for Sandlin. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Clinton was the featured guest at an Arkansas  
state Democratic party salute to Dale Bumpers, who delivered the 
defense summation to the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned that they had been through ``all kinds of  
adversity'' together, and saluted Bumpers for never forgetting 
``the lessons of the past, beginning with the Constitution'' during 
his long Senate career. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also presented Bumpers as the antithesis of the kind of  
politician who relies on personal attacks to further his career, 
saying that ``all the complexities, and all of the problems I've 
faced'' in politics might have vanished if egos had been set aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety percent of them would go away tomorrow if people could  
just understand that they don't have to define their lives in terms 
of putting someone else down, defeating someone else, thinking 
they're better than someone else, ignoring their common humanity,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a $200,000 Democratic National Committee reception prior to  
the Bumpers event, Clinton found himself in the company of folks 
whose confidence in him was never shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's done a wonderful job,'' said Mary Ann Bowman, who  
made no secret of her distaste for Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's $40 million investigation of Clinton. ``To spend the money 
they spent is absolutely ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent Saturday afternoon at the home of his  
mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, watching Arkansas fall to Iowa in 
the NCAA tournament. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton remained in 
Washington, where she had been nursing a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandlin, first elected to Congress in 1996, had been asking  
Clinton for two years to attend a fund-raiser, a Sandlin aide said. 
The cocktail reception and dinner raised more than a half-million 
dollars to help Sandlin pay some $700,000 in campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Without directly referring to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, or  
even saying ``impeachment,'' Clinton cast Sandlin's opposition to 
the House charges as a stand ``to protect the kind of government 
that we have preserved for more than 220 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though he is a very junior member,'' Clinton said, ``he  
was one of the most serious, substantive, thoughtful and effective 
advocates, asking all the members of the Congress to read the 
Constitution, read the history, and uphold their oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a Democratic National Committee reception in Little Rock  
on Saturday, Clinton was the featured guest at a $200,000 state 
party fund-raiser in honor of Bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, who retired after the previous session of Congress,  
delivered a widely praised speech to the Senate that was part 
constitutional analysis, part collegial appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	He told senators weighing the president's fate in February that  
Clinton was guilty of a ``terrible moral lapse,'' but he insisted 
that Clinton's conduct did not warrant removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can censure Bill Clinton. You can hand him over to  
prosecutors. But you cannot convict,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he and Clinton have long known each other, the two men  
were never considered extremely close. During his first 
presidential term, Clinton went to then Sen. David Pryor, another 
now-retired Arkansas Democrat, when he wanted advice on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first Senate primary in 1974, Bumpers defeated Clinton's  
mentor, Sen. William Fulbright. Like Clinton, Bumpers is a former 
Arkansas governor. 
</P>

	His remarks to the Senate also excoriated House prosecutors for  
insensitivity to the Clinton family, which he said ``has already 
been about as decimated as a family can get.''

<HEADLINE> Military Cancels Assault Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- The Pentagon today ferried hundreds of  
Marines from ship to shore via helicopter instead of launching a 
practice amphibious assault through the sensitive waters of 
Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon decided to cancel today's planned Hovercraft  
assault after the California Coastal Commission objected. Instead, 
the Marines will be helicoptered from transport ships to Monterey 
Peninsula Airport, then bused or trucked to training sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, about 100 protesters lined the coastal town's scenic  
waterfront holding signs, dancing and playing drums today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission had unanimously rejected a report from the Navy  
and Marines that claimed the Hovercraft wouldn't disturb gray 
whales, snowy plovers and sea otters in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have abided by that decision,'' Marine Lt. Col. Jenny  
Holbert said Friday. ``We're as concerned and committed to the 
environment as they are, so we decided to abide by that decision 
and go with helicopter landings instead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two environmental groups, Arc Ecology and the Fort Ord Toxics  
Project, nevertheless attempted to scuttle both the Monterey 
operation and a second landing off the Alameda County coast on 
Sunday. But U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins ruled late Friday 
that they had failed to prove their claims of environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.5 million Urban Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment --  
one of a series of exercises held around the nation in recent years 
-- is designed to test the Marines' ability to handle a coastal 
urban conflict, natural disaster or large-scale humanitarian 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans had called for a beach landing in Monterey, where hundreds  
of personnel would practice a response to terrorists possessing 
``simulated biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbert said using the Hovercraft was simply a way to get the  
Marines from ships to land and was not actually part of the 
exercise, which will otherwise be unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It totally eliminates any impact on coastal resources, and  
directly addresses the concerns the commission had,'' said Peter 
Douglas, executive director of the coastal commission.

<HEADLINE> Espy Criticizes Independent Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, whose  
run-in with an independent counsel cost him $1.5 million in legal 
bills, says his experience casts doubt on the whole institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like someone would put out a want ad for  
independent counsels: good pay, good benefits ... good judgment is 
not required,'' Espy said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy, President Clinton's first Agriculture Secretary, was  
acquitted in December on 30 charges that he accepted gifts and 
entertainment from companies or organizations regulated by the 
agency. He was forced to resign in 1994 after an independent 
counsel was appointed to investigate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a private attorney in Jackson, Miss., Espy was one of  
several speakers on a panel examining the fate of the independent 
counsel law, which will expire June 30 unless Congress and the 
president approve its reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from both parties have said they see almost no chance  
for survival of the Independent Counsel Act, although some House 
Republicans have floated the idea of having an assistant attorney 
general handle investigations of high-level government officials. 
Congress is scheduled to hold hearings in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy said he would be willing to testify about the matter on  
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The former secretary described his 4 1/2-year investigation by  
independent prosecutor Donald Smaltz as one with ``high tangible 
costs, high intangible costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Espy said he owes $1.5 million in legal bills and is trying to  
recover professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph diGenova, a former independent counsel who conducted a  
3-year, $2.8 million investigation into the State Department's 1992 
search of Bill Clinton's passport file, agreed that changes are 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long distance between Mike Espy and Richard Nixon.  
Having a statute that doesn't differentiate is a dumb idea,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA East Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- To many people, asking your father to be  
your employee might seem strange. To Steve and Sam Alford, it made 
all the sense in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tennessee's Volunteers play Southwest Missouri State in  
Sunday's East Regional second-round game, one of the attractions 
will be the Bears' coaching staff. Steve Alford is the head coach 
and his father, Sam, is one of his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a head coach, you always want someone covering your back.  
If you can't appreciate or think your father's going to do that, 
nobody will do it,'' the younger Alford said. ``It's just a great 
opportunity. We had always thought about coaching together. We 
probably thought it would be a different role reversal. But it's 
been a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Steve got the Southwest Missouri State job four years ago,  
one of the first things he did was call his father, who was just 
finishing his 20th season as the head coach at Chrysler High School 
in New Castle, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kind of caught me by surprise,'' said the elder Alford, 56,  
whose Chrysler teams went 300-188 and won sectional titles in each 
of his last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam said he and his son have always been close, and their  
relationship blossomed when Steve was a high school sophomore and 
the two began traveling the state to conduct basketball clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do the talking and he would do the demonstrating,''  
Sam said. ``Then, slowly, as his name grew and he took off, he 
started doing the talking and the demonstrating, and it was very 
evident that he was very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Alford led Indiana to the 1987 NCAA championship and spent  
four years playing in the NBA, he went into coaching, a move that 
produced immediate success at Division III Manchester. By the time 
Southwest Missouri State called in 1995, Alford had a trump card he 
could use on his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew that if he wanted to be around his grand kids,it was  
probably going to be hard to do it from New Castle,'' Steve said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *O'NEILL'S LEGACY:* Jerry Green is in just his second season  
coaching Tennessee, and he has a team made up mostly of players 
recruited by Kevin O'Neill, who is currently coaching at 
Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though O'Neill is no longer with the Vols, his former  
players still remember him, especially when they're asked about how 
he recruited them. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Tony Harris said O'Neill sent him ``about 1,000'' letters  
and postcards. Some of them were signed in jest by the likes of 
Abraham Lincoln and Tyra Banks, and all of them told Harris that 
the Vols really needed him to play for Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow guard Brandon Wharton recalled a similar experience.  
</P>
<P>
	``He made you feel like you were the only person he was  
recruiting,'' Wharton said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HORROR FLICK:* Tulsa coach Bill Self spent some time Saturday  
reviewing tape of the Golden Hurricane's first-round victory over 
the College of Charleston on Friday night, and he didn't like what 
he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Hurricane's 26-point lead was cut to two in the  
closing minutes before Tulsa steadied itself and regrouped in the 
final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That right there was really borderline nightmarish material,''  
Self said. ``We could have been talked about for a really long time 
if we would have squandered that lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LARGER THAN LIFE:* Duke sophomore forward Shane Battier  
admitted to being more than a little overwhelmed when Mike 
Krzyzewski began recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty mind-blowing experience,'' Battier said. ``I  
mean, here was this man who has a video game named after him, and 
he's calling my house and he wants me to play for him. It took me a 
while to get over that.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Escape With Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The IOC's chief investigator knows there's a  
fine line between action that gets a member kicked out of the club 
and action that brings a heavy slap on the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding at times like an umpire explaining his strike zone,  
International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound defended 
the latest recommendations from his internal investigation of the 
Olympics' worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member panel recommended stern warnings for two IOC  
leaders, executive committee member Kim Un-yong of South Korea and 
Phil Coles, who helped win the 2000 Summer Games for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no regulation about `severe censure' in the IOC  
charter. I understand I will get a very serious warning,'' Kim told 
The Associated Press before leaving for a special IOC general 
assembly in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they provoke me further, I am not going to fight the  
warning,'' Kim added. ``I am, have always been, committed to IOC 
work. I will continue to work with the Olympic family to promote 
the Olympic goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It gave lesser rebukes to seven others, including former IOC  
vice president Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, and cleared three members 
implicated in the million-dollar gifts-and-favors scheme that Salt 
Lake City waged as it won the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's only recommendation for expulsion in the latest  
batch of cases was saved for a minor member from the South Pacific 
island of Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork, an IOC member since 1987 but never a  
member of the leadership, was targeted for ouster because of a 
$30,000 loan his wife received from Salt Lake's top bidder, which 
was later paid in full. Wallwork denied knowing about the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders said for several weeks that the latest batch of  
alleged infractions were minor compared with the earlier ones, in 
which nine members were expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	But big money -- and big names -- are still involved, and Pound  
had to repeatedly defend the report against charges of whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a judgment call,'' the Montreal lawyer said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said his panel tried to distinguish between members who  
sought to enrich themselves and those ``who were careless about 
what they should do and not attentive to what people might think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report accused Kim and Coles of serious conflicts of  
interest or lapses in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	It warned that they could be expelled if misconduct recurred.  
And Pound said he suspected that there was evidence, yet uncovered, 
that would call for Kim's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission believes there is additional evidence still out  
there,'' Pound said. He added, however, that it was time to close 
the file and get ready for the IOC's watershed session in 
Switzerland next Wednesday and Thursday, changes stemming from the 
Salt Lake scandal will be debated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been a work in progress,'' he said. ``There  
are times when you have to take a photograph and make a report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, president of both the international Taekwondo federation  
and the confederation of Olympic sports bodies, allegedly used his 
Olympic position to help land lucrative jobs in telecommunications 
and music for his two children -- daughter Kim Hae-jung, a concert 
pianist, and son Kim Jung-hoon, a satellite TV executive also known 
as John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC commission concluded its work on allegations involving  
concert dates and recording contracts for Kim Hae-jung, which it 
said ``created at least a very serious appearance of conflict of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the investigation remained open on allegations that Kim  
Un-yong knew that Salt Lake City bidders helped pay for a job for 
his son at Keystone Communications in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it was ``highly unlikely'' that Kim Un-yong did not know  
of the arrangement, although ``evidence available as of this day is 
not entirely conclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the allegations be fully established, which is not the  
case, the commission would consider that such behavior by an IOC 
member would justify expulsion from the IOC,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, in a statement released by his New York-based publicist,  
said he was ``carefully reviewing the report, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with my colleagues in the IOC and the Olympic 
family toward advancing the goals of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the best-liked members of the clubby IOC, was  
accused of accepting some $60,000 in travel benefits from Salt Lake 
bidders, including trips to ski resorts and the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was similar to that of Agustin Arroyo, the IOC member  
from Ecuador who has been ousted, but Pound said there were 
differences that made Coles' case less severe, most notably the 
fact that the Australian was legitimately in the United States when 
the Salt Lake City-paid travel began. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pound said, ``alarm bells'' should have sounded for Coles  
when offers of trips kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least a warning light should have gone off in his head,''  
the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork's wife, Julia, borrowed the money from Tom Welch, the  
former head of Salt Lake's Olympic efforts. A Salt Lake ethics 
report said Welch had to withdraw the money from his children's 
trust funds, and the loan was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork told the IOC that he knew nothing about the loan and  
that he and his wife were separated at the time. But the Pound 
commission said faxes about the loan were sent from Welch to 
Wallwork's office, and that the Wallwork family received $67,585 in 
travel benefits from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his commission found nothing to call for more  
expulsions in the responses from 37 cities that bid for the games 
from 1996 onward. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said all of that information should be turned over to a  
standing ethics panel, part of the reform package due for adoption 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that panel might also consider the case of Anita  
DeFrantz, a vice president from the United States. While DeFrantz 
has repeatedly denied any knowledge of wrongdoing, reports this 
week quoted Welch and former Salt Lake Olympic vice president Dave 
Johnson as saying they discussed everything about the gift program 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always said that if there are facts to back up the  
allegations, we will look at it,'' Pound said. ``But so far, she 
says she did not know. We'll give the benefit of the doubt to Anita 
at this time.''

<HEADLINE> GOP, Dems To Lock Up on Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Republicans have rival  
plans for shoring up Social Security and Medicare. But, like 
opposing armies mired in their trenches, each is on the defensive, 
far from a historic agreement to overhaul the massive entitlement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Factor in their long-running suspicions and animosity --  
exacerbated by the president's impeachment and trial -- and the 
prospects for a year of political positioning far outweigh the 
chances for a dramatic deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always was a long shot'' for Social Security or Medicare  
reform in 1999, says Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional 
Budget Office director who now is a senior fellow with the 
liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is the future of two of the government's most popular  
programs. Social Security provides pensions to 45 million mostly 
elderly and disabled Americans, while Medicare supplies health 
insurance for 39 million elderly and disabled people. The impending 
retirement of the baby boomers, beginning in a decade, threatens 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare already is spending more money each year than it  
collects in revenue. Its trust fund financing hospital coverage is 
projected for insolvency by 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security will begin spending more than it collects in  
2013. Its trust would be depleted by 2032. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy of either fund is politically unthinkable. The  
question is not whether something will happen, but what and when. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Republicans talk about fixing both programs by using  
the large projected federal surpluses, without the cuts in benefits 
or tax increases many analysts say are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Their solutions are painless approaches to very real problems,  
designed to let each side claim it is protecting Social Security 
and Medicare. Yet the very act of offering pain-free prescriptions 
makes it harder for each side to swallow the more onerous medicine 
that is probably inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed using $2.8 trillion in expected federal  
surpluses over the next 15 years to reduce the national debt. That 
would strengthen the economy, thus making it easier for the 
government to generate revenue to pay benefits to future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	He also would put an equal amount of Treasury bonds into the  
Social Security trust fund. The president says that would ensure 
payment of benefits; Republicans contend it amounts to 
double-counting. 
</P>
<P>
	By investing some of the money in financial markets, Clinton  
says his plan would keep Social Security solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have pledged to use the $1.8 trillion in projected  
Social Security surpluses over the next decade only to reduce the 
debt, or for any Social Security or Medicare reforms that are 
enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have not said how they would extend the life of either  
program. Behind the scenes, Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Clay 
Shaw, R-Fla., are writing a plan to create federally subsidized 
personal retirement accounts for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been secret contacts between emissaries of both sides  
-- White House economic adviser Gene Sperling and Kenneth Kies, a 
former top aide to Archer, the House Ways and Means Committee 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional Democrats, worried about a Social Security  
overhaul that might reduce benefits and deprive them of a potent 
campaign issue, are unhappy. Some say those contacts have 
diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that leaves little prospect for major progress.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take an act of courage on the part of the  
president to keep the ball moving forward,'' Reischauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the president? Because it is easier for Clinton to craft a  
proposal than for Congress' 277 Republicans to agree on one. And 
because ever since Democrats attacked Republicans in the 1980s for 
considering trimming Social Security benefits -- which may have won 
Democrats the Senate in 1986 -- GOP lawmakers have been wary. 
</P>
<P>
	Their wariness has been sharpened by years of losing budget  
battles with Clinton, and by the bitterness the recently ended 
impeachment fight engendered. Recent comments by GOP leaders 
underline how low their level of trust is. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how Republicans count on avoiding another year-end budget  
clash this year with the White House, House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas, said, ``You can't with this administration. They're 
shameless. If you could deal with somebody you could count on'' it 
would be different. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a brief  
interview, said of Clinton: ``I can't determine if he's serious or 
not about working with us.''

<HEADLINE> Parties Fight for Control of House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Jersey Rep. Bob Menendez give up a safe  
seat to run for the Senate next year? The House Democratic leader, 
Dick Gephardt, heard that and was soon on the telephone asking 
Menendez to hold off until the two could meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez says Gephardt told him ``we're going to have a  
majority'' after 2000, and that as a member of the leadership, 
Menendez would have more ability to shape policy than if he were in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez decided to seek re-election to the House, meaning his  
fund-raising talents can be put to better use helping more 
Democratic candidates win House seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Score one for Gephardt, D-Mo., and the Democrats in the  
recruiting battle, an early part of the struggle for House control 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss of six seats next year would deprive Republicans of their  
majority. That slim margin has made both parties eager to minimize 
retirements from within their ranks while also courting strong 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates ``must be up and running by May'' to establish their  
credibility in states with early filing deadlines, says Ed 
Brookover, a former political director at the GOP campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He adds that there is more time in states with later primary  
elections, but ``between now and Labor Day is just crucial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and the Democrats are not alone in the recruiting game.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Hart, a third-term state senator from Pennsylvania,  
recently came to Washington, where officials said she met with 
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	She is considering a challenge for the seat now held by  
Democratic Rep. Ron Klink, who is weighing a Senate bid, but she 
declined to discuss her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, Republicans are undergoing a top-to-bottom  
transition at their campaign committee and are more reluctant to 
discuss their recruitment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's none of your business'' who is being courted, said Rep.  
Tom Davis, R-Va., the new committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
GOP has been slower to gear up. The perception that Democrats could 
gain a majority in 2000 is hampering efforts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Republicans must cope with the expected retirements of  
some committee chairmen required to surrender their powerful posts 
at the end of the current term. Other vacancies will occur among 
Republicans who came to Congress in 1994 pledging to serve no 
longer than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	One such lawmaker -- Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington -- has  
not decided whether to seek a new term despite his pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a conversation with Denny Hastert,'' Nethercutt said.  
Asked whether the GOP leadership wants him to run again despite his 
pledge to the voters, he replied, ``It's just implied. We want to 
keep every seat we can keep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are eager to talk about their early recruiting  
efforts, projecting confidence about their ability to end six years 
of Republican rule in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gearing up faster than two years ago,'' says Erik Smith,  
a spokesman for the House Democratic congressional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the political backlash produced by President Clinton's  
impeachment in the GOP-controlled House, he said, Democratic 
``activists never disengaged. They just kept working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Open seats are likely to be a key to the battle for control and  
Democrats are determined to hold retirements to an absolute 
minimum. Thus, they were cheered recently when Rep. George Brown 
announced he would run for a new term -- his 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, chairman of the  
campaign committee, are hoping to douse the ambition of lawmakers 
mulling Senate campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Gephardt secured a seat on the powerful Commerce  
Committee for Rep. Bill Luther of Minnesota, who then gave up 
thoughts of running for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also has spoken to Democratic Reps. Debbie Stabenow of  
Michigan, David Minge of Minnesota, Nita Lowey from New York, and 
Ted Strickland in Ohio, all of whom had been pondering Senate 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabenow, who defeated a Republican incumbent to claim her House  
seat in 1996, seems certain to run for the Senate. ``It's a 
marginal seat,'' she said in an interview, and already, both 
parties are trying to line up candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gephardt is not limiting his efforts to persuasion of  
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	He has talked with Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the House's  
only independent, about skipping a challenge to GOP Sen. James 
Jeffords. Sanders votes with Democrats for organizational purposes, 
and Democrats protect his seniority rights, even though he is not a 
member of the party's caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties are hoping for rematches in some districts.  
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, Republicans hope Mark Baker will run again against  
Rep. Lane Evans after taking 48 percent of the vote in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gephardt recently went to Baton Rouge, La., for an AFL-CIO  
function, he met with Marjorie McKeithen. She is considering a 
rematch against Rep. Bill Baker, R-La., who triumphed narrowly last 
November.

<HEADLINE> Dole Revels in Hometown Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) -- Favorite daughter Elizabeth Dole returned  
home Saturday for an old-fashioned political rally welcomed by 
1,000 supporters urging her to press ahead with her presidential 
ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salisbury will forever be my home,'' Mrs. Dole said after  
listening to speeches from former neighbors, local politicians and 
longtime friends in a small gymnasium at Livingstone College. 
</P>
<P>
	``My roots are deep here,'' she said, as her supporters cheered  
and held signs, including one homemade one which said simply: 
``Dole in Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is still not an official candidate for the  
Republican nomination, Mrs. Dole spoke like someone who is serious 
about making a White House bid next year. Her 30-minute speech 
addressed issues such as defense spending, education and the war on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	While her themes were serious, the mood was celebratory inside  
the gym at the historically black college, which is located just a 
few blocks from her childhood home in downtown Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Mrs. Dole inched closer to a full-fledged  
presidential campaign by announcing the formation of an exploratory 
committee. At the rally Saturday, she only hinted that she was 
ready to make a run. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest she came to doing so was when Vincent Boyle, a  
second-grader from Salisbury, presented her with a belated 
Valentine's Day card, which said: ``I would love to go on vacation 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Vincent, I can't go on vacation because that would take too  
much time,'' she told the young boy. ``Maybe we can go out together 
on the campaign trail.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Wins NCAA Ski Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUMFORD, Maine (AP) -- Colorado's Ove Erik Tronvoll and Magnus  
Ericksson finished 1-2 in the men's 20-kilometer cross-country race 
Saturday, sending the Buffaloes to their second straight NCAA 
skiing title. 
</P>
<P>
	Onni Odegard took third in the women's 10-kilometer event,  
clinching the victory as Colorado finished with 650 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, one of the pre-championship favorites, finished second  
with 636 points after starting the day in fifth place, 85 points 
behind. The Pioneers leapfrogged Utah, Vermont and Dartmouth as 
Britta Wienand won the women's 10-kilometer race to lead all six 
Denver racers into the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont was third with 600 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which started the day in second place, 19.5 points behind  
Colorado, finished fourth with 578.5 points. New Mexico was fifth 
with 572, and Dartmouth sixth with 539. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won against the odds,'' Colorado coach Richard Rokos said,  
noting that the Buffaloes had been picked fourth and Denver first 
in a preseason coaches poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado had dedicated the championships to Lucie Hanusova, a  
cross-country skier who was killed in January in a snowmobile 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the other two Colorado women finished 28th and 39th,  
its third man, Jorgen Aukland, wound up eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tronvoll, a senior from Norway, was ill at last year's  
championships and fared poorly, and he finished a disappointing 
fifth in Thursday's 10K freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my last shot,'' he said. He made it count.  
</P>
<P>
	Tronvoll finished in 56 minutes, 17 seconds, far ahead of  
Ericksson (57;53.2). 
</P>
<P>
	Utah twins Rune and Frode Kollerud, who finished 1-2 in the 10K,  
had to stop during Saturday's race to change the wax on their skis, 
which takes about a minute. They finished 12th and 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah team had put on hard wax for hard snow on the cloudy  
day at Black Mountain, but the sun came out 15 minutes before the 
race and softened the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys were panic waxing, but we decided to stay with  
it,'' Utah's third skier, Pat Casey, said. ``It's a judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad it came down to a waxing race. If it was a skiing  
race, we would have been better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Pat Miller said the Utes didn't have time to make the  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those unfortunate things, it's part of  
cross-country ski racing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not sure if Utah could have caught Colorado anyway, but  
it probably would have meant a higher finish in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wienand handed Ekaterina Ivanova of Russia her first loss in 19  
races since joining the Vermont team in January. Wienand finished 
in 51:11.6, far ahead of runner-up Ivanova's 52.34.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont gambled by using no wax on Ivanova's skis because she  
lifts them from the track as she skis. The coaches feared they 
might ice up. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chip Lacasse said the change allowed Ivanova to make up  
ground on the hills, but she lost about eight seconds on the 
downhills.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Saturday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	COUNTRY CAMPER: After a trip to Mesa on Friday night to play the  
Chicago Cubs, the Padres didn't get back into camp until well after 
11 p.m. But that didn't keep Brooks from making fans happy. As 
other players quickly hurried home, Brooks stood at the players' 
parking lot entrance to sign autographs. He stayed past midnight, 
signing by the light of a security guard's flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
	LOW NOTE: Brooks played the field on Saturday for the first time  
in a game, entering San Diego's afternoon contest with the Brewers 
in the sixth inning in left field. Facing David Weathers, in his 
first at-bat, he lined the first pitch back to the box. Weathers 
knocked the ball down and threw Brooks out at first. In his second 
at-bat, with a runner on second and two out in the ninth, Brewers 
manager Phil Garner ordered pitcher Horacio Estrada to walk Andy 
Sheets intentionally to get to Brooks. Brooks lined the second 
pitch at the shortstop. In the field, Brooks had one chance, diving 
and missing a two-out liner with the scored tied at 1-1 in the 
ninth off the bat of Alex Ochoa. Ochoa got a double and Todd Dunn 
followed with a single to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
	ON THE RECORD: ``I try to sign as much as I can,'' Brooks said  
of his fan-friendly autograph signings. ``But there is a time when 
you have to walk away and leave somebody standing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one thing you can say in baseball that you can't say in  
music is `I'll be back tomorrow.' In music, you're there one night, 
on a bus or a plane, and gone to the next city.''

<HEADLINE> Man Loses CIA Confirmation Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chilean resident who wanted the CIA to  
confirm that he once worked as a ``covert employee'' lost his 
appeal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for  
the District of Columbia affirmed a lower court's decision to throw 
out a lawsuit filed by Eduardo Frugone, who contended he worked for 
the CIA for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Frugone tried to obtain retirement benefits from the  
Office of Personnel Management, which oversees federal health 
benefits. That office suggested Frugone contact the CIA because the 
agency had all of his records. 
</P>
<P>
	He did. Frugone then received a letter from the Office of  
Independent Contractor Programs telling him that he had not paid 
enough Social Security taxes to make him eligible for benefits. The 
letter did not identify the job Frugone had worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Furgone then asked the CIA to turn over his records under the  
Freedom of Information Act. When the CIA told him it could not 
respond within the 10-day period required by law, Furgone sued. The 
agency formally denied his request a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CIA's summary judgment request to a lower district court,  
the agency claimed it could refuse to confirm or deny Frugone's 
employment because the FOIA does not apply to matters kept secret 
by executive order because of national security or foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower court agreed and threw out the lawsuit. Frugone  
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he narrowed his appeals claim to seek only employment  
information from the CIA and his personnel file. 
</P>
<P>
	Frugone claimed that because the Office of Personnel Management  
acknowledges the existence of his relationship with the CIA, the 
CIA must as well. The federal appellate panel disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Sick of Being 'Good Girl' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lea Thompson is sick of being seen as a  
goody-goody. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating for me artistically because it's easy for  
people -- critics or whoever -- to dismiss me as a nice girl,'' 
Thompson says in the April issue of Redbook. ``That makes me angry. 
Just because you're nice and you're not tearing up the town, dating 
all kinds of people and trying to destroy yourself, doesn't mean 
your work doesn't have depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old star of ``Caroline in the City'' and longtime  
husband Howard Deutch, her director for ``Some Kind of Wonderful,'' 
have two children. Growing up with a less-than-perfect mother made 
her want to lavish extra attention on her kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother really fought a battle with alcoholism,'' Thompson  
says. ``She finally quit when I was about 8.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being the child of an alcoholic fostered independence at an  
early age, and some hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember my mother ever driving me to school or to my  
dance class or whatever,'' she says. ``I resented that she wasn't 
Donna Reed.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Wins U.S. Soccer Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mexico benefited from an own goal by the United  
States defender Robin Fraser on a play that also resulted in an 
injury to U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, and won 2-1 Saturday to 
clinch the U.S. Cup '99 title. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico, which won both its tournament games, took its third  
straight U.S. Cup championship before a pro-Mexican crowd estimated 
at more than 50,000 in its first appearance against the Americans 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Hejduk tied the score 1-1 for the U.S. on an unassisted  
goal in the 51st minutes. But the Mexicans soon went back ahead in 
the 58th minute on a score by Jose Manuel Abundis, assisted by 
Rafael Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser inadvertently gave Mexico a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute,  
when a Mexican crossing pass deflected off his upper body into the 
nets while he slid to the turf. On the play, Mexico's Francisco 
Palencia started near Fraser in the penalty box and continued 
forward, colliding with Meola. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola stayed on the ground for treatment, then left the game  
with a cut lip and minor dental damage. He was replaced by Zach 
Thornton, who received the victory in Thursday's 3-1 win over 
Guatemala in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the third start this year for Meola, who returned to  
the U.S. national team in January after a four-year absence. He had 
shutouts against Boliva and Germany in his other outings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans suffered their first setback under coach Bruce  
Arena, whose record went to 3-1-2. Mexico remained unbeaten (3-0-4) 
in the last seven outings against the U.S.. and improved to 4-3-6 
in the series since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Foreign Policy Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saddam Hussein's Iraq keeps taunting U.S.  
pilots. China is accused of stealing American nuclear secrets. A 
Kosovo peace agreement remains elusive. Across the globe, President 
Clinton's foreign policy is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign policy experts say the administration is pursuing  
short-term gains at the cost of lasting solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton administration kicks the can down the road and  
hopes for the best,'' said Ted Galen Carpenter of the 
conservative-leaning Cato Institute. ``The problem with American 
diplomacy is we want results now. Long-term goals get little 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright swooped into Kosovo peace  
talks outside Paris last month hoping ethnic Albanian would approve 
a self-rule plan in the Serb province. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she came away empty handed from Rambouillet after badly  
misjudging the commitment the Kosovar Albanians -- in particular, 
guerrilla fighters who do not want to surrender weapons -- had to 
the tenuous deal, U.S. official have admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albright's performance was weak at Rambouillet,'' said Thomas  
Keaney, head of the foreign policy institute at Johns Hopkins 
School of Advanced International Studies. ``If the State Department 
was surprised by the Kosovars, that's a real indictment on their 
conduct of foreign policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovar Albanian agreement would clear the way for NATO  
airstrikes against Serb targets if Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic does not accept the autonomy plan as well as a 
28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force, a main roadblock to final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks resume near Paris on Monday. Albright was not planning to  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	A divided House, in a nonbinding resolution, last week approved  
Clinton's plan to send up to 4,000 Americans to Kosovo for NATO 
peacekeeping. Approval, however, came only after lawmakers attacked 
the president's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``America needs to quickly change directions and leave behind  
this chilling comedy of errors that has defined our foreign 
policy,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Tex. 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, the Pentagon since December has engaged in a low-level  
conflict. Almost daily, Iraqi pilots violate ``no-fly'' zones over 
Iraq, and allied warplanes strike back. This pattern followed a 
series of concentrated airstrikes in December that failed to force 
Saddam to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.N. weapons inspectors have been off the job  
since mid December, opening the way for Saddam to possibly rebuild 
his chemical and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is calling for an end to the Saddam regime. His words  
are backed by $97 million Congress approved to fund Iraqi 
opposition groups. But not everyone in his administration appears 
entirely behind the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, head of U.S. forces in the Gulf, told  
the House Armed Forces Committee last week that the Pentagon should 
not arm Iraqi opposition groups because none is strong enough to 
oust Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni also warned that getting rid of the current regime -- a  
long-term prospect at best -- could splinter the country and 
destabilize the region. 
</P>
<P>
	So the administration is stuck adding up small victories over  
the Iraqi sky while U.S. policy remains in a holding pattern, said 
Keany, the Johns Hopkins analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can dignify bombing as a new strategy,'' he  
said. ``Saddam maintains the initiative. He can turn it on and off 
at will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, a growing power, is perhaps the most complicated  
challenge. The world's most populous nation with 1.3 billion 
people, it offers a huge market for U.S. products while at the same 
time has the potential of becoming a military threat, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics are accusing Clinton of setting aside  
national security concerns related to China, including possible 
nuclear espionage, so he could realize short-term gains in the 
U.S.-China relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-secret nuclear warhead information from U.S. weapons labs  
may have been passed to China in the 1980s, according to 
allegations U.S. authorities began investigating in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that in 1997, when he learned that the ``scope of  
the potential espionage might be very broad and might be directly 
related to lax security at the energy labs ... we moved quickly and 
decisively'' to further restrict access to labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department last week fired a computer scientist at  
the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico who has been under FBI 
investigation for nearly three years, though he has not been 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	A 700-page report by a special House committee led by Rep.  
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., criticizes administration-authorized 
high technology transfers to China from U.S. business that may have 
helped Beijing develop more accurate long-range ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis casts a cloud over Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's White  
House visit in April. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese officials have been negotiating to seal a deal  
in time for the meeting for China to join the World Trade 
Organization. A WTO agreement would lower Chinese tariffs on goods. 
That could help reduce the $57 billion trade deficit with the 
United States, but also would protect Beijing from bilateral trade 
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Kansas To Face Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- It's been three months since Utah lost a  
game. If the Utes keep playing the way they did in the first round 
of the NCAA Midwest Regional, it might be next season before they 
lose another one. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (28-4) got a big first half from 6-foot-7 Alex Jensen and a  
huge second half from 6-10 Hanno Mottola to stretch its winning 
streak to 23 games with an 80-58 victory over Arkansas State. The 
Utes have never lost an NCAA first-round game under coach Rick 
Majerus. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen scored 18 points -- 17 in the first half -- and grabbed 11  
rebounds. Mottola scored 22 points -- 19 in the second half -- to 
send Utah into Sunday's second round against Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixth-seeded Kansas overpowered Evansville 95-74 to earn a  
matchup with third-seeded Kentucky, which defeated New Mexico State 
82-60. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alex kept us in the game in the first half, I don't know how  
many offensive rebounds he had, but he was valiant,'' Mottola said. 
``Then he got into some foul trouble in the second half and I got 
some open looks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas State (18-12), shot 42 percent in the first half, but  
made just three of 13 field goals in the first 13 minutes of the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with good intensity the first half, but I think  
their size just wore us down,'' Arkansas State coach Dickey Nutt 
said. ``When they closed down the perimeter, they were able to shut 
us down inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (23-7) beat Washington 59-58 as Wally Szczerbiak scored a  
career-high 43 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. He also blocked the 
Huskies' last-second shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really nervous. But when he blocked the shot and there  
was no foul, and when I saw the ball was in Wally's hands, I knew 
we had it,'' said Damon Frierson, one of only two other Miami 
players besides Szczerbiak to score. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Rick Majerus sees this box, I know what his game plan  
will be,'' Miami coach Charlie Coles said. ``Two guys had 45 shots. 
That gives me a day and a half to teach my other guys to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, a second-team AP All-American, took 33 of Miami's 55  
shots, and made 18 of them. He sank all five 3-pointers for the Red 
Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd MacCulloch, Washington's 7-footer, had 11 points and nine  
rebounds for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jayhawks owned the area inside the lane and ruled the boards  
as they rallied from an early Evansville run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kansas did a great job of throwing it inside and ramming it  
down our throats,'' Evansville coach Jim Crews said. ``They're big 
and strong and their size and strength inside overwhelmed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	T.J. Pugh had 15 points and 10 rebounds, both career bests, for  
Kansas, including 12 points in the first half when the Jayhawks 
were shaking off mistakes and the Purple Aces' hot shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my points were when we were losing,'' Pugh said. ``I  
consider myself an opportunistic shooter. I wanted to keep us 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (23-9) outrebounded Evansville 45-15 and shut down the  
Aces' high-scoring offense in the second half. The 30-rebound 
margin is the third highest in an NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	Heshimu Evans scored nine points during a 21-0 second-half run  
as defending national champion Kentucky (26-8) shook off 
inexperienced New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico State (23-10), which had no players with previous  
postseason experience, was only down 44-43 after Eric Channing's 
3-pointer with 15:43 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Padgett, who along with Evans is among four Wildcats who  
have played in at least two national championship games, responded 
with a 3-pointer on the other end to start the decisive Kentucky 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	By time Evans scored on an inside basket with 8:52 left,  
Kentucky had a 65-43 lead. Evans also had a 3-pointer, two free 
throws and another inside spurt in the seven-minute outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats shot 61 percent (30-of-49) to earn a second-round  
game against the only team to win more games than them in the 
1990s.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The highest-ranking official  
implicated in the Olympic scandal said today he would not contest a 
serious warning about his conduct recommended by International 
Olympic Committee investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, a powerful IOC executive board member from South  
Korea, barely escaped expulsion when IOC investigators recommended 
Friday that he be severely censured. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no regulation about `severe censure' in the IOC  
charter. I understand I will get a very serious warning,'' Kim told 
The Associated Press before leaving for a special IOC general 
assembly in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they provoke me further, I am not going to fight the  
warning,'' Kim added. ``I am, have always been, committed to IOC 
work. I will continue to work with the Olympic family to promote 
the Olympic goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, investigators of the Olympic bribery scandal  
recommended that Seiuli Paul Wallwork, an IOC delegate from Western 
Samoa, be thrown off the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they recommended that Kim and Phil Coles, a longtime  
IOC member from Australia, be censured. Seven others, including 
Vitaly Smirnov, a former IOC vice president from Russia, will 
receive warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	While the panel issued a recommendation on Kim, his case  
remained open and could lead to a recommendation for expulsion, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is president of both the International Taekwondo Federation  
and the Confederation of Olympic Sports Bodies, and had been 
considered a possible successor to IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Athletes: Don't Blame Us </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From running tracks to balance beams, Olympic athletes make it  
clear: 
</P>
<P>
	This scandal is not about us!  
</P>
<P>
	While they say they're shocked and saddened by accusations that  
Salt Lake bribes fattened IOC members by millions of dollars, the 
men and women who compete for medals insist the games still shine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should let it hang over the Olympics,'' said  
Shannon Miller, who's won more Olympic and world-championship 
medals than any other U.S. gymnast. ``The Olympics is still about 
the athletes and competing with other nations and doing your best. 
It's still about that, no matter what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No athletes have been implicated in the half-dozen  
investigations into the case, in which leaders of the Utah bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games are accused of using cash, travel and medical 
expenses, gifts and other lavish inducements to try to win the 
votes of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	And officials of the International Olympic Committee, the U.S.  
Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee all have 
pledged that athletes would not suffer as a result of any backlash 
from the scandal, such as sponsor pullouts or revenue shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must return the games and the attention to the athletes,  
the most important members of the Olympic family,'' USOC president 
Bill Hybl said. ``It is their dreams that we must make possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Tewksbury, a 1992 swimming gold medalist from Canada,  
returned his medal to the IOC because he said he was ashamed about 
the scandal. But his reaction was unique, and athletes generally 
have taken a low profile as their sports' leaders search for 
culprits and reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys have found that public support for the Olympics, and  
especially Olympic competitors, remains extremely high despite the 
alleged wrongdoing among the leadership in limousines and hotel 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes say that's the way it should be.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing can tarnish my medals,'' said Amy Van Dyken, who won a  
record four golds for swimming for the United States in the 1996 
Atlanta Games. ``The Olympics are such a pure thing. You are there 
for your country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happened in Salt Lake and other Olympic bid cities was not  
so pure, and the idea that the rings could be damaged and the flame 
snuffed out by greed makes the athletes mad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me emphasize that athletes did not have a damn thing to do  
with this whole mess,'' said Willie Davenport, a hurdler and 
bobsledder on five U.S. Olympic teams. ``It's the people in the 
high chairs who did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Naber, a four-time Olympic champion swimmer and now  
president of U.S. Olympians, an alumni group, said the athletes 
were concerned with fair play, whether on the field or in the 
boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a win-at-any-cost philosophy, the athletes only want to  
win when they're entitled to win,'' he said. ``Consequently, 
something like this strikes at the very core of the athlete's 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a member of the gold-medal women's gymnastics team at  
Atlanta, said she probably has not paid as much attention to news 
of the scandal as she should, ``but when you've worked your whole 
life for something, you hate to think about it like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Olympians don't know the difference between the IOC, the  
USOC and the various federations and organizing committees who put 
on the games, nor do they care to, Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just concentrating, working their sport to the best of  
their ability,'' he said. ``Yet they are stakeholders in this 
debacle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won three golds and six medals overall  
as one of the most-storied track stars in Olympic history, said 
athletes can understand the crisis because they face something 
similar every time they compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like dealing with drug testing,'' she said. ``You're  
guilty until the results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Thomas, a world champion gymnast and two-time Olympian who  
now works for Dallas' bid for the 2012 Games, said the scandal 
already had changed the public's perception. 
</P>
<P>
	``That clean, fresh image of the Olympics and bringing the games  
here has been tainted,'' he said. ``Let's face it, you hear the 
jokes on the radio. (The scandal) is not something to be taken 
lightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and USOC intend to bring more current athletes into  
their decision-making, and the athletes think that could help avert 
similar scandals in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletes have come up through the ranks, they know the sports,  
they know what the Olympic movement means,'' said Miller, an 
athlete representative for USA Gymnastics. ``That's their life, 
that's what they've grown up doing, and I think having them in the 
position to make decisions for the athletes that are coming up now 
would be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And just as when they set out to compete, the athletes said they  
were optimistic that the games that form their dreams would emerge 
from the scandal stronger and better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it can crush the Olympic movement, it's too  
strong,'' Thomas said. ``It's going to get cleaned up and we're 
going to move on from there.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Pleased With Indiana Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Purdue's chance to stay alive in the NCAA  
tournament comes Sunday against Miami. But the Boilermakers could 
smile Saturday because their fierce in-state rival, Indiana, was 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Down in Orlando, the Hoosiers were routed by St. John's 86-61.  
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I would have liked to have seen Indiana win just  
because of the fact that they're part of the Big Ten,'' Purdue's 
Brian Cardinal said. ``But I think from a university standpoint, 
I'm kind of glad they got beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we should be concentrating on Indiana and the  
games that they're playing,'' forward Jaraan Cornell said, but ``in 
our hearts, we're kind of happy that they were defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Purdue won Big Ten titles in 1994, 1995 and 1996, it  
doesn't get the publicity that Indiana receives. Perhaps that's 
because the Boilermakers have never made it to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get as much recognition as we deserve,'' coach Gene Keady  
said. ``If you want to get more, win bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GETTING PHYSICAL:* Coaches Bob Huggins of Cincinnati and John  
Chaney of Temple worked hard Saturday trying to lay claim to the 
distinction of being the wimpier team in their game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not near as physical as Temple is,'' said Huggins, whose  
teams have had a reputation for relishing contact. ``We're a little 
more athletic, a little quicker now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney wasn't buying any of that. And with two centers weighing  
240 pounds (Kevin Lyde) and 290 (Ron Rollerson), he still said his 
team needs to be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	``My players are very, very meek and young,'' Chaney said with a  
laugh. ``There are times when I will challenge them and use 
whatever blaspheme words I can, but I can't seem to get them off 
the mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BUILDING TRADITION:* Perhaps a win over Purdue in Sunday's NCAA  
East subregional will drum up more interest in Miami. Hurricanes 
coach Leonard Hamilton understands why that's been lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1971 through 1985, Miami did not have a basketball program  
and a whole generation of youngsters in that city had no local team 
to root for. So when the program resumed, a new fan base had to be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't build tradition in three, four, five, six  
years,'' Hamilton said. Teams that are ``consistently at the top 
for the most part have been there for 20, 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FORGET DUKE:* Back on Nov. 28, Cincinnati handed Duke its only  
loss of the season, 77-75. That doesn't shake the confidence of 
Temple players as they prepare to face the Bearcats on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it plays a part in our mind,'' Quincy Wadley  
said. ``We know they're a good basketball team and they were 
capable of beating Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat Duke, a great team,'' said Mark Karcher, ``but I  
think we can come out and beat anybody on any given night. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HISTORY LESSON:* Keady likes to take his players sightseeing on  
road trips and their visit to historic Boston was a wonderful 
opportunity. Unless your foot hurts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just took a trip to the JFK museum,'' Cornell said. ``It  
was very interesting, even though I didn't feel like walking around 
because I had a blister on my foot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keady's reasons for such trips go beyond educating his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``For me,'' he said, ``it's fun to get away from watching tapes  
in the hotel room.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CONFERENCE CALLS:* Smaller conferences, known as mid-majors,  
don't always get the recognition they deserve. And Chaney thinks 
that may motivate players from those leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of renown could come from ``talking heads'' who dwell  
on major conferences, Chaney said. That slight could spur players 
from smaller schools even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They work with a different kind of fuel and it's always  
high-test,'' Chaney said. ``They're saying, `Hey, we can do it' 
when somebody else is saying they can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple beat one of those schools, Kent of the Mid-American  
Conference, 61-54 in Friday's first round.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Faces E. Coli Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The largest E. coli outbreak in Nebraska  
history grew to 49 cases, and state health officials warned there 
could be more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are at least half a dozen potential cases that  
we're looking into in addition to the 49 already found,'' Marla 
Augustine, spokeswoman for Nebraska Health and Human Services, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has been traced to a restaurant in Kearney where  
investigators suspect contaminated lettuce may have been the 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people have been hospitalized for the potentially fatal  
bacteria, including an 8-year-old girl who was in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain of E. coli in the 49 cases attacks the digestive  
tract. Symptoms include fever and bloody diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Adulation Surprised DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio never quite understood why people insisted on  
making such a fuss about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players hit more home runs than his 361 and had higher  
lifetime batting averages than his .325. Yet it was DiMaggio, who 
captivated the public; DiMaggio, who was celebrated in literature; 
DiMaggio, who had songs written about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe D. was intrigued by the reaction. He saw himself as an  
ordinary guy, trying to earn an honest buck, much the way his 
immigrant father had when he worked as a fisherman in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	And that, of course, was exactly why Hemingway wrote about him  
in ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,'' the ancient  
Cuban fisherman says. ``They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe 
he was as poor as we are and would understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was why Simon and Garfunkel sang about him in their  
anthem of the troubled '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio wondered about those lyrics, but they were on target.  
America often turned its eyes to Joe D. because he was special, 
equipped with panache that separated him from other players. He had 
style and substance, a regal way of carrying himself that marked 
him as one of a kind. He played the game with dignity and respect 
and people picked up on that. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps baseball bon vivant Tommy Lasorda put it best.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was, to people all over the world, what a baseball player  
was supposed to be like,'' Lasorda said. ``If you said to God, 
`Create someone who was what a baseball player should be,' God 
would have created Joe DiMaggio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Stengel, who managed the Yankees in DiMaggio's final three  
seasons, put it more directly. ``He makes the others look like 
plumbers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's era contributed to his aura. He came to the Yankees  
in 1936, with the country locked in a devastating economic 
depression and with war clouds forming over Europe. It was a 
difficult time and America needed a hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe D. filled the bill with a 56-game hitting streak in 1941, a  
record two months of day-in, day-out batting consistency. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at Yankee Stadium after Babe Ruth and before Mickey  
Mantle. If those two fun-loving sluggers played the game with a 
twinkle in their eye, then DiMaggio played it with a hard glare. 
This was his business and center field was his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He would never have thought of participating in some of the  
shenanigans that modern players do, celebrating home runs with all 
sorts of intricate hand gestures, pointing, preening and prancing 
their way around the bases. In DiMaggio's time, that was called 
showboating. That was not his style. He had no interest in 
embarrassing anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a quiet pride about him, a sense of obligation to his  
team and his town. 
</P>
<P>
	Players joining the New York Yankees for the first time gave him  
wide berth. Whitey Ford recalled being too scared to utter a word 
for about a week. And when rookie Yogi Berra failed to run out a 
pop fly one day, DiMaggio told him off. Berra was a Yankee now. He 
was expected to hustle all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were DiMaggio's standards. He would accept nothing less  
from himself or those around him. 
</P>
<P>
	He played hard and he played hurt, often ignoring injuries when  
the team needed his bat and glove. When he could no longer do it, 
he walked away from the game with his head held high, saying, ``I'm 
not Joe DiMaggio anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had a classic, right-handed swing, defying the vast open  
spaces of left field in Yankee Stadium. And he had the noble, easy 
gait of a thoroughbred in the outfield, always positioned 
perfectly, rarely having to do more than lope after a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He was, as Hemingway wrote, ``the great DiMaggio,'' and that was  
what the fuss was all about.

<HEADLINE>  Jonrowe Quits Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE ISLAND, Alaska (AP) -- DeeDee Jonrowe, one of the pre-race  
favorites in this year's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, quit the 
trail Saturday after her 12-dog team stopped running along the 
frozen Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonrowe, 43, of Willow, Alaska, scratched while running the  
60-mile stretch of trail between the checkpoints of Grayling and 
Eagle Island in Alaska's vast Interior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dogs come first, and they just don't belong out here right  
now, for whatever reason,'' she told KNOM radio and the Alaska 
Public Radio Network while waiting for a plane to airlift her team 
from the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	Her team of young dogs stopped about 25 miles outside Eagle  
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she played with them and tried to cajole them, but she  
said it was clear to her that the dogs didn't have the will to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're creatures of habit, and they no longer trust what  
happening,'' Jonrowe said. ``It's mental -- it's not physical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time she was in fourth place behind Doug Swingley of  
Lincoln, Mont., Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, and Rick Swenson 
of Two Rivers, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she may have left Grayling too soon, without giving the  
team enough rest in the extremely cold conditions. Jonrowe spent 
only an hour in the checkpoint before setting out in pursuit of the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Yukon, temperatures early Saturday were reported at 30  
below zero, with a 20 mph headwind for mushers. 
</P>
<P>
	The scratch was the first ever for Jonrowe, who was competing in  
her 17th Iditarod. She has come close to winning several times, 
placing second last year and in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were two things I hadn't done: I hadn't won and I hadn't  
scratched,'' she said. ``I was hoping it was much more likely to 
win than to scratch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the 1999 Iditarod, Jonrowe had 11 straight finishes  
in the top 10 that earned her more than $250,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the seventh scratch among the 56 mushers who started the  
1,100-mile race March 6 in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the 1995 winner from Lincoln, Mont., made it to Eagle  
Island at 5:27 a.m. (9:27 a.m. EST) Saturday with 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser, a three-time Iditarod winner, arrived second at 8:51 a.m.  
with 10 dogs, and Swenson, who has won the race five times, was 
third into the checkpoint an hour later with 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jonrowe's scratch, defending champion Jeff King of Denali  
Park, Alaska, moved up to fourth. King left Grayling at 7:02 a.m. 
after a five-hour rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were Alaskans Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof,  
Ramey Smyth of Big Lake, Vern Halter of Willow, Bill Cotter of 
Nenana and Charlie Boulding of Manley and race rookie Harald 
Tunheim of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley has racked up a number of firsts so far in the race. He  
earned $3,000 by being first into the namesake checkpoint of 
Iditarod, and another $3,500 for being first to reach the Yukon 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	His success came despite breaking two sleds -- and quickly  
repairing them well enough to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dogs are running fine,'' Swingley said Friday in Anvik.  
``I'm just having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Barron from Sheep Creek, Alaska, declared himself out of  
the race overnight back at the midpoint Gold Rush ghost town of 
Iditarod. Barron -- the sixth scratch in the race -- said his young 
dogs simply were too tired to continue. He finished 12th in last 
year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner gets $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize money is  
paid to the first 20 finishers.

	Coming into the 1999 Iditarod, Jonrowe had 11 straight finishes  
in the top 10 that earned her more than $250,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the seventh scratch among the 56 mushers who started the  
1,100-mile race March 6 in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the 1995 winner from Lincoln, Mont., made it to Eagle  
Island at 5:27 a.m. (9:27 a.m. EST) Saturday with 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser, a three-time Iditarod winner, arrived second at 8:51 a.m.  
with 10 dogs, and Swenson, who has won the race five times, was 
third into the checkpoint an hour later with 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jonrowe's scratch, defending champion Jeff King of Denali  
Park, Alaska, moved up to fourth. King left Grayling at 7:02 a.m. 
after a five-hour rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were Alaskans Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof,  
Ramey Smyth of Big Lake, Vern Halter of Willow, Bill Cotter of 
Nenana and Charlie Boulding of Manley and race rookie Harald 
Tunheim of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley has racked up a number of firsts so far in the race. He  
earned $3,000 by being first into the namesake checkpoint of 
Iditarod, and another $3,500 for being first to reach the Yukon 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	His success came despite breaking two sleds -- and quickly  
repairing them well enough to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dogs are running fine,'' Swingley said Friday in Anvik.  
``I'm just having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Barron from Sheep Creek, Alaska, declared himself out of  
the race overnight back at the midpoint Gold Rush ghost town of 
Iditarod. Barron -- the sixth scratch in the race -- said his young 
dogs simply were too tired to continue. He finished 12th in last 
year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner gets $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize money is  
paid to the first 20 finishers.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Step Up To Defend Belle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles leaped to the  
defense of Albert Belle on Saturday, insisting that his recent 
clubhouse tirade should never have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle made headlines when he angrily threw his glove, helmet and  
two bats into his locker Thursday after striking out in the sixth 
inning of an exhibition game. He also whisked aside several letters 
that were sitting on his chair before showering and quickly exiting 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The eruption occurred in a near-empty room filled with a handful  
of reporters and a few players. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in an impromptu press conference in the Oriole dugout  
before an exhibition game against Montreal, Orioles general manager 
Frank Wren said, ``I think the whole situation is unjust. I think 
some confidences were violated (because) the clubhouse is sanctuary 
of the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the clubhouse is closed to the media  
for 15 minutes after a game. But the Orioles opened the locker room 
during games in the spring because players often leave well before 
the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After Belle's tirade was reported, the Orioles abruptly changed  
their policy and now keep the clubhouse closed during exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the team, the damage had been done.  
</P>
<P>
	``This hurt a lot of people. It hurt our franchise and it hurt  
Albert because Albert has done nothing wrong,'' Wren said. ``I 
would say there's 55 players in that clubhouse, and if 54 others 
did what he did it wouldn't have been a story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, however, is no ordinary player. He has been suspended for  
destroying part of a bathroom, hitting a taunting fan in the chest 
with a thrown baseball, twice charging the mound, using a corked 
bat and hitting an infielder with his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle talked of changing his controversial image upon signing a  
five-year, $65 million contract with Baltimore in December, and the 
Orioles were eager to stress that Thursday's incident was not a 
digression. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you sit in that clubhouse, every single game of every  
single season, somebody's going to walk in there and throw 
something,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``That's why we keep 
the press out during the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Wren: ``It's a pimple on an elephant. This isn't right.''  
</P>
<P>
	Belle, approached by three Orioles beat writers seeking comment  
Friday, said, ``I'm done. I'm done with you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wren, who planned to talk to Belle about the coverage of the  
incident, said, ``I can see why he's upset and wouldn't speak.''

<HEADLINE> America's Cup TV Row Cools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The America's Cup seems safe at ESPN -- at least  
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had threatened to pull out of its contract to  
televise the event because rival Fox Sports Net signed a contract 
to have its logos plastered on Young America's yachts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fox Sports Net reached an agreement to let the New York  
Yacht club syndicate the sponsorship deal so that the event's TV 
status wouldn't be placed in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we gave money to help build a winning U.S. entrant, we  
did it to bring the Cup back to America, and it was a good 
marketing opportunity,'' Fox Sports Net spokesman Vince Wladika 
said. ``When it became apparent the televising network was willing 
to sacrifice the event along with America's chances of reclaiming 
the Cup, we felt it was our duty to put our own interest behind 
that of America's reclamation of the Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ESPN contract stated that Fox Sports Net ads would appear on  
the sails and hulls of two of Young America's yachts during 
America's Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the America's Cup, Fox Sports has  
generously agreed to release us from the contractual obligations 
that ESPN objected to,'' said John Marshall, president of Young 
America. ``Fox Sports Net agrees with us that our partnership has 
fueled a dispute that has become a distraction from our mission of 
winning the Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN signed the final contract to air the event last week, and  
the syndicates had a 30-day window to agree to the terms, which 
stipulated that the telecast was clear of competing network logos. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said it would pull out of the event unless those terms were  
met. 
</P>
<P>
	It already had agreements from America's Cup 2000, the event  
organizer in New Zealand, and the America's Cup Challenge 
Association, which represents the competition's 15 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But final approval hinged on a unanimous decision by the 15  
challenge teams -- including Young America. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fox Sports Net didn't wait until the 30 days expired before  
ending the controversy.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Near Mexico City Spouts Ash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Popocatepetl volcano near Mexico City has  
again spouted plumes of ash and water vapor, civil defense 
authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The activity on Friday followed an explosion late Thursday that  
sent ash falling on the city of Puebla, 65 miles east of Mexico 
City, the National Center for Disaster Prevention reported. 
</P>
<P>
	More light ash showers were likely to fall from Friday's  
explosions, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18,000-foot volcano is located just 50 miles southeast of  
Mexico City. The biggest of Friday's exhalations lasted about 11 
minutes, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Suspicious Bag Shuts Down Runway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Authorities are investigating an  
unaccompanied piece of luggage at the Port Columbus International 
Airport that led to the shutdown of a runway for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	WCMH-TV reported Saturday that Mary Schiavo, a former inspector  
general of the Department of Transportation, checked a bag Friday 
as part of a story the station was doing on airport security, but 
didn't board the flight to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The station showed the contents of her bag, which included what  
appeared to be a tape recorder, an alarm clock and wiring. Ms. 
Schiavo had put identification on the bag, the station reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The station did not say whether the bag that caused the runway  
shutdown was Schiavo's. But it said it told airport official David 
Whitaker that Ms. Schiavo checked a bag and didn't get on the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Schiavo nor Whitaker returned messages seeking  
comment. WCMH offered no comment beyond its newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators concluded there were no explosives in the suitcase  
that shut down the runway Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard L. Morgan, director of public safety at Port Columbus,  
said he didn't know whether the station or Ms. Schiavo were 
connected to the suspicious bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we are trying to determine everything that  
happened from the beginning,'' he said, adding that the FBI would 
assist in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  
criticizing the Federal Aviation Administration on several 
occasions. She has since published a book accusing the FAA of 
sloppy inspections, lax airport security and disregard for bogus 
airplane parts.

	Bomb Explodes at NC Abortion Clinic  
</P>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A bomb exploded outside an abortion  
clinic today, causing no injuries and little damage because the 
device only detonated partially. The clinic is less than 75 miles 
near the mountainous area where serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph 
is believed to be hiding. A second device was also found at the 
clinic, authorities said. ``It appeared to be a very large 
device,'' Police Chief Will Annarino said. ``I really can't get 
into how large it is right now. But it appears it could have caused 
a lot of damage.'' Homes and business near the building were 
evacuated and police cordoned off the road around the clinic.

	Clinton Urges More Police Training

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed  
improved training and other steps to restore ``the bonds of trust'' 
between the public and law enforcement. Recent questionable 
shootings by police that took the lives of young blacks in New 
York, Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif., have revived debates about 
how officers handle confrontations with minorities. In New Jersey, 
state troopers have come under fire for conducting traffic stops 
based on a driver's race -- so-called racial profiling. In his 
weekly radio address, Clinton proposed a $40 million funding 
increase to improve police training nationwide.

It was one of Turkey's deadliest attacks in years. President 
Suleyman Demirel condemned the attack, and Prime Minister Bulent 
Ecevit said it was part of a campaign aimed at disrupting the April 
18 national elections. Police immediately beefed up security in 
this city of 12 million people, conducting identity checks on 
public transportation and warning people not to take parcels from

<HEADLINE> School Desegregation Deal Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A settlement approved in a long-standing school  
desegregation case will allow busing to continue but frees the St. 
Louis school district from court supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr., who approved the  
settlement Friday, said it represents ``a fair, reasonable and 
adequate resolution to this historic case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing 21 parties have been quarreling since 1972  
when the original lawsuit was filed by Minnie Liddell, a black 
mother who alleged that St. Louis Public Schools and the state of 
Missouri were responsible for a segregated school system. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement scales back busing between the city and county  
school districts, maintains the city's magnet school program, 
provides about $180 million for new schools and sets student 
achievement goals for city schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon apologized again Friday to  
past generations for once supporting a system that allowed skin 
color to determine where children attended school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my opinion that the state of Missouri has learned its  
lesson,'' Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acceptance of the St. Louis settlement brings an end to the last  
of Missouri's two court-ordered school desegregation programs, 
which have been among the most costly and ambitious approaches in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone was happy with the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Mayor Clarence Harmon had complained that it left out  
an earlier agreement for an oversight board to monitor the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to carefully monitor the school district's progress  
toward improving the quality of education our children receive ... 
and will not hesitate to speak out when we feel their effort is 
falling short,'' Harmon said.

<HEADLINE> Indiana H.S. Hoops Player Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Hundreds of students exchanged hugs and  
shared tears Saturday as they remembered John Stewart, a star 
basketball player who died during a regional championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy performed Saturday morning revealed that Stewart, 18,  
a senior center for Lawrence North High School, died from heart 
complications stemming from a disease known as hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disease of the heart that causes the heart to become  
enlarged,'' said Joyce Fisher, Bartholomew County coroner. ``And 
when that happens, the pump system in the heart doesn't work hard 
enough to sustain life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Stewart probably wasn't born with the disease, but  
it's a condition that progressed over time. She said less than 1 
percent of the population has the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes there are some symptoms, but it's not unusual on  
young adults to cause sudden death,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart died Friday after collapsing at Columbus North High  
School during the regional championship game between Class 4A No. 2 
Lawrence North and No. 1 Bloomington South. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawrence North star, who had already signed to play with  
Kentucky in the fall, was at the top of his game, scoring 22 
points, including 10 in a row to start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was having the game of his life,'' said Tal Short, senior  
guard for Lawrence North and co-captain with Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	With two minutes to play in the third quarter, he asked to be  
taken out because he was feeling dizzy and having trouble 
breathing. He collapsed on the bench and was taken to Columbus 
Regional Hospital, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Stewart's 7-foot, nearly 300-pound body needed a  
strong heart to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a good heart to pump a lot of blood and oxygen  
through (the body) and when you are strenuously exercising, at some 
point it just can't keep up anymore,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said that Stewart's mother, Felicia Stewart, had noticed  
her son was experiencing some shortness of breath during games in 
the past few weeks. But the basketball player thought his asthma 
was causing his difficulty in breathing, so he had been using his 
inhaler a little more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Fisher said, it's safe to say that Stewart's heart  
condition, not his asthma, was making it difficult for him to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's teammates, Fred Long and Andy Means, said they didn't  
even realize that Stewart had asthma until the second North Central 
game this season, when Stewart said he was dizzy and used an 
inhaler in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't happen during the rest of the season,'' Means said.  
``So it just kind of got out of my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant superintendent Duane Hodgin said Stewart had had a  
physical and was cleared to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, several of the school's 1,200 students packed into the  
auditorium to remember their friend and support one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Lana Klene, a school counselor, said that many students were  
getting over the initial shock and just felt numb Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're walking around, checking out groups of students,'' she  
said. ``If one of them seems to be having a hard time coping, we 
get them out of the auditorium and talk to them one on one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving lots of hugs.''  
</P>
<P>
	A crisis team also assembled at the school Friday night. As many  
as 500 students, parents and school officials waited in the 
gymnasium and cafeteria for the buses to return from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Gathered in small groups, students talked in hushed tones.  
Others walked around with dazed looks on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's cheerleaders sat in a circle, and fans still dressed  
for the game walked around crying, many saying they couldn't 
believe what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Others held hands and formed a circle around Stewart's Lawrence  
North jersey, which someone had placed in the center of the 
gymnasium floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, a junior center, said he'll miss his friend and will think  
about him every time he suits up next year. He said if he could, 
he'd tell Stewart: ``Thanks for beating up on me in practice. You 
are one of the best friends I've ever had. I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other teammates said it helps to know that Stewart died while  
playing the game he liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had to go like that, I don't know if there could've been  
a better time or a better game for that,'' sophomore guard Chris 
Hill said. ``If there was any way he would've wanted to go out, 
that was it.''

<HEADLINE> `Born Yesterday' Creator Dies at 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Garson Kanin, a prolific playwright who created  
the Broadway and Hollywood classic ``Born Yesterday,'' died today. 
He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin died of heart failure at his Manhattan home after a long  
illness, said his assistant, Martha Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	His place in entertainment history would have been assured had  
Kanin done no more than write and direct ``Born Yesterday,'' the 
oft-revived play that made Judy Holliday a star of the theater in 
1946 and won her an Oscar for the movie version in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin was the author or director of numerous stage and movie  
hits, including some of the celebrated screen pairings of Spencer 
Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	In collaboration with his wife of 43 years, actress Ruth Gordon,  
he wrote the screenplays of Tracy and Hepburn's ``Adam's Rib'' in 
1949 and ``Pat and Mike'' in 1952. He and his wife also received an 
Academy Award nomination for writing ``A Double Life,'' the 1948 
movie for which Ronald Colman received a best-actor Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gordon died in 1985. In 1990, Kanin married actress Marian  
Seldes, who was with him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin claimed collaboration in the first Tracy-Hepburn teaming,  
``Woman of the Year,'' in 1942. His screenwriter brother, Michael 
Kanin, and Ring Lardner Jr. were the officially credited writers 
and won an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said ``The More the Merrier,'' the delicious 1943 comedy  
of wartime Washington, was his brainchild, but the screenplay is 
credited to four other writers. The comedy of political corruption 
and personal redemption, which ran for 1,642 performances on 
Broadway, boomed anew during the latter Nixon years. 
</P>
<P>
	As an officer in a U.S. Army film unit during World War II,  
Kanin was co-director, with Carol Reed, of ``The True Glory,'' 
which won the Oscar for best documentary in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote some 14 books of fact and fiction and published  
numerous articles and short stories everywhere from Good 
Housekeeping to Penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin, born in Rochester, N.Y., dropped out of James Madison  
High School in New York during the Depression. He worked as a 
telegram messenger, Macy's stock boy, burlesque comic and 
honky-tonk saxophone player, but also attended the American Academy 
of Dramatic Arts, which led to the stage. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma, UNCC Are Similar Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Neither Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson nor North  
Carolina-Charlotte coach Bobby Lutz had to study much film for 
their showdown Sunday in the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners (21-10) and 49ers (23-10) share too many  
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team has great post play, and so relies heavily on the  
3-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams use superior speed to make up for a lack of size and  
are led by demonstrative coaches who honed their talents at tiny 
NAIA schools and who got their first NCAA tournament victories 
Friday at the Bradley Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutz ``kind of looks like that crazy coach from Oklahoma  
sometimes,'' Sooners coach Kelvin Sampson said Saturday in what 
seemed like a meeting of the Mutual Admiration Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Both schools survived down-to-the-wire games in the first round  
thanks to dizzying displays of defensive switches. The 49ers 
dispatched Lamar Odom and Rhode Island and Oklahoma cut short the 
college careers of Arizona's A.J. Bramlett and Jason Terry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers and Sooners each boast a key starter from Latin  
America who had to master English along with the jump shot. The 
49ers have kiss-blowing guard Diego Geuvara of Venezuela and 
Oklahoma has Eduardo Najera of Mexico, a forward who plays more 
like a guard. 
</P>
<P>
	These teams are mirror images.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oklahoma, they have real good shooters. They led the Big 12 in  
3-point shooting; we led Conference USA in 3-point shooting,'' 
49ers senior forward Galen Young said. ``They're not a real big 
team. We're not a real big team. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we both make up for that with aggressiveness and just the  
will to win. So, that's going to make for a real good game come 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game between the fifth-seeded 49ers, who upset 12th-seeded  
but slightly favored Rhode Island in overtime, and the 13th-seeded 
Sooners, who upset the Wildcats 61-60, precedes the Ole 
Miss-Michigan State matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma senior guard Michael Johnson said the resemblances  
might have made for easier preparation but will present a tougher 
task on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play hard. They execute their offense. I think it's going  
to be a challenge to play a team similar to ourselves,'' Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Najera said another similarity is the underdog mentality that  
has fueled both teams all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're very similar,'' Najera said. ``We haven't gotten  
a lot of respect, but that's why we're here. We're going to try to 
get it. And I'm sure Charlotte feels the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very similar. We run our sets and execute. We don't  
have an NBA player that's going to take over the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of like in the same boat as far as respect,'' 49ers  
senior guard Marlon Thomas agreed. ``They're coming in here with 
nothing to lose. We're coming in here with nothing to lose. ... So, 
it's going to be a dogfight from start to finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lutz knows just what kind of sharpshooters he'll face Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``They shoot the 3 so well, that's kind of like us,'' Lutz said.  
``And we know how tough we can be to defend when we're shooting the 
basketball well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson said he didn't anticipate any surprises from either  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we're not going to get to tomorrow and all of a  
sudden get bad at the things we do good,'' Sampson said. ``The 
things that we've emphasized to our guys on a daily basis has been 
our old standbys. That's defending and rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are known for their hustle: rebounding, drawing  
charges, diving after loose balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a feeling they're going to balance out,'' Lutz said.  
</P>
<P>
	So, just what will be the difference in advancing to the round  
of 16 and going home? 
</P>
<P>
	Both coaches had similar takes on that, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to boil down to who shoots the basketball  
the best,'' Lutz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making shots,'' Sampson agreed. ``It comes down to that.''

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Recruit Dies During Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) -- John Stewart, a 7-footer who had signed to  
play basketball at Kentucky next season, died Friday night after 
collapsing during Lawrence North High School's playoff game against 
Bloomington South. 
</P>
<P>
	With about two minutes to play in the third quarter, Stewart,  
who had scored 10 straight points, asked to be taken out of the 
game, complaining of shortness of breath. Moments after coming out 
of the game, he collapsed on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency personnel responded and administered CPR. Stewart was  
put on a stretcher and taken to Columbus Regional Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart arrived at the hospital, doctors tried for 90  
minutes to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for the hospital confirmed that Stewart had died,  
but was unable to provide information on a cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	After Stewart collapsed, the teams went to their locker rooms  
and the game was halted for about 30 minutes. Lawrence North 
players and coaches voted to continue the game, which South won 
55-50 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was the neatest young man I've ever coached,'' coach Jack  
Keefer said as he stood in the hospital. ``This is probably the low 
point of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death will be determined after an autopsy on  
Saturday at the Indiana University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough thing to tell kids,'' Keefer said. ``They've  
got to wonder why. It's the whole gamut of emotions. It's totally 
devastating.''

<HEADLINE> Trump, NASCAR Plan N.Y. Metro Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump and Bill France figure the old  
Field of Dreams line is true: If you build it, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
	So Trump, the real estate developer, and France, chairman and  
chief executive officer of the International Speedway Corporation, 
plan to construct a superspeedway in the metropolitan New York area 
where, until now, motorsports rarely has been seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The track will be in either New York, New Jersey or Connecticut.  
Except for Watkins Glen and Pocono -- both well-removed from the 
area -- auto racing has been in short supply in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	France, whose family owns NASCAR and controls valuable Winston  
Cup racing dates, said the expansion makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``ISC looks for growth opportunities and the New York market  
offers that,'' France said. ``We are excited about the prospects. 
We plan a track with the highest standards and new and unique 
features.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said five sites were under consideration with five more to  
be added before a final decision is made. He said the facility 
would cost between $200 and $250 million, ``maybe more.' 
</P>
<P>
	One problem could be finding a race for the facility once it is  
completed. The current NASCAR schedule includes 34 races -- one up 
from last year with the new Homestead, Fla. track, in which ISC has 
part ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	France's company is also constructing new tracks in Kansas City,  
and Joliet, Ill., and another facility is being built in Denver by 
Penske Motorsports. That could raise the calendar to 37 races and 
other tracks -- Texas, Phoenix, Fontana, Calif., and Las Vegas -- 
desperately want second Winston Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC would own the new track, adding it to five other motorsports  
facilities under its control. That list includes Daytona 
International Speedway, home of the Daytona 500; and tracks in 
Talladega, Ala.; Phoenix; Darlington, S.C.; and Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	France said the layout in the New York area would be at least a  
one-mile track to qualify for the superspeedway designation and 
would probably have a road course to maximize usage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be 750 acres, up or down a little, with a minimum of  
75,000 seats to start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new track will be called Trump Superspeedway. Future naming  
rights, however, will be retained by ISC. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said politicians from all three states had contacted him  
about the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all want it,'' he said. ``Any good politician would want  
it in his area. It means huge economic development for the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One site on the preliminary list is in Riverhead, N.Y., on Long  
Island, about 75 miles from New York City. A town official last 
month said Trump has bid $55 million to develop a 2,900-acre site 
that once housed an aircraft test flight facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Riverhead is a little far out,'' Trump said. ``It's a  
wonderful site. It's one of our sites. But it's tough out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the developer looked around Trump Tower, one of his  
buildings in the heart of Manhattan, where the speedway 
announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key,'' he said, ``is to be as close to Fifth Avenue and  
57th Street as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Comes Up Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Purdue had a big shot to take in its biggest game  
of the season, and the guy who took it, and made it, wasn't the 
player most people expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron Stephens hit a 15-footer jumper with 25 seconds left to  
break the game's final tie Friday night, and the Boilermakers went 
on to a 58-54 victory over Texas in the opening round of the East 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens, who came in averaging 3.3 points, hit the game-winner  
on a nice pass from a driving Tony Mayfield. The most logical 
shooter would have been Jaraan Cornell, the Boilermakers' leading 
scorer, or Brian Cardinal, the workhorse forward, who is second on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We practice that when the big man steps out,'' said Cornell,  
who finished with 18 points. ``Tony gave him a great pass. His form 
looked good and he knocked it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (20-12), the 10th seed, will play second-seeded Miami, a  
75-54 winner over Lafayette, in Sunday's second round at the 
FleetCenter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's other doubleheader at the FleetCenter, third-seeded  
Cincinnati beat No. 14 George Mason 72-48 and sixth-seeded Temple 
defeated No. 11 Kent State 61-54. Those winners will meet in 
Sunday's other second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens' shot gave him four points for the game and put the  
Boilermakers, who had entered the tournament having lost four of 
five, ahead 56-54. After a turnover by seventh-seeded Texas 
(19-13), Mayfield made two free throws with 4.1 seconds left for 
the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard-fought, grind-it-out game the way we thought it  
would be,'' Purdue coach Gene Keady said. ``We regrouped over the 
last 10, 12 days and got our attitudes right. Cam hit that shot, 
Tony made the free throws, we played good defense and we advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas led 51-50 with 1:22 left on a driving layup by Ivan  
Wagner. Cornell hit a short jumper and made two free throws around 
a turnover by Wagner for a 54-51 lead. The Longhorns tied it with 
25 seconds left on a 3-pointer by William Clay, but those were 
their final points. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Mihm had 21 points and 14 rebounds for Texas, and he was  
almost the hero on Stephens' game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their guard drove. I came out and he kicked it out,'' the  
7-footer said. ``I actually got a piece of the ball. It was a good 
clutch shot. Sometimes it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
                       *Miami 75, Lafayette 54    	
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Hemsley set a school record with nine 3-pointers and had  
31 points as the Hurricanes (23-6) won their first NCAA tournament 
game in their third appearance. Hemsley was 9-for-12 from long 
range, and two of his 3s accounted for half the points in Miami's 
12-0 run to open the second half, giving the Hurricanes a 46-29 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to have this kind of game in this caliber  
of game,'' Hemsley said. ``It just felt great to get our first NCAA 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemsley made 3-pointer after 3-pointer and, after his  
career-high seventh early in the second half, he turned to the 
crowd and gave an imitation of Michael Jordan's famous shrug when 
he couldn't miss from long range in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``A tournament game, a full house, that's what you live for,''  
he said. ``When you play well in a packed gym, it's a great 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemsley finished two shy of the NCAA tournament record set by  
Jeff Fryer of Loyola Marymount against Michigan in the second round 
in 1990. Hemsley broke the school record of eight set by Samarr 
Logan in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Ehlers, the Patriot League player of the year, had 14  
points for Lafayette (22-8), the 15th seed that was making its 
second NCAA appearance and first since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Cincinnati 72, George Mason 48    	
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats (27-5) advanced to the second round for the fifth  
straight year with the easy win, holding the Patriots (19-11) to 
their worst shooting game of the season (18-for-66, 27.3 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're one of the best defensive teams in the  
country,'' Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins said. ``In the 10 years 
I've been here, this is one of the better halfcourt defensive teams 
we've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Mickeal had 18 points for the Bearcats, who closed the  
first half with a 26-6 run for a 41-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Miskiri had 13 points for the Patriots, who had won 10  
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Temple 61, Kent St. 54    	
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Pepe Sanchez played 40 minutes and had 15 points,  
six rebounds, nine assists and no turnovers for the Owls (22-10), 
who will play Cincinnati in the NCAA tournament for the third time 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems we're always in their neighborhood,'' Temple coach  
John Chaney said of the Bearcats, who have won the previous two 
meetings. ``Our chances are better to win against a team like that 
than they were against a team like Kent State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed Brokenborough also had 15 points for Temple, which led  
59-48 with 2:03 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whorton had 13 points for the Golden Flashes (23-7), who  
were making their first NCAA tournament appearance.

<HEADLINE> NY Speaker Urges Movie Ticket Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite a plunging crime rate, some New Yorkers  
say there's one place where they're still getting mugged -- at the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket prices have hit $9.50, and City Council Speaker Peter  
Vallone is calling for a movie boycott and a federal investigation 
into theater giant Loews Cineplex Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's hit them where it hurts most,'' Vallone said Friday. He  
wants moviegoers to skip flicks on the first Friday of each month, 
and says they should bring their own munchies the rest of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not alone. A New York Times columnist suggested that  
moviegoers bring their own paper cups into theaters to abuse the 
free refill policy. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorkers tend to be resigned to paying a premium on just  
about everything. After all, Broadway tickets top off at $85 each, 
and a dinner for two in Manhattan can easily run $100. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vallone and others worry climbing movie prices will soon put  
a trip to the silver screen out of reach for some families. 
</P>
<P>
	The $9.50 price tag -- which the City Council says is the highest  
in the nation -- is just the latest benchmark. In the last five 
years, movie ticket prices in the city have risen by 27 percent, 
more than twice as fast as the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, tickets in Oklahoma City and Honolulu cost $6.50;  
Omaha, Neb. $7; Detroit, $7.50; and Los Angeles, $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure in the 1980s, then-Mayor Edward I. Koch tried  
to organize a picket against rising movie prices, but the campaign 
had little success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Movies are the opiate of the people,'' he said. ``No picket  
line will succeed. The only thing that will succeed is 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp. of America and Cineplex Odeon announced in 1997 that  
they would merge their theater businesses to form the world's 
largest movie theater company, with more than 2,600 screens in 
North America. The new company, Loews Cineplex, controls about half 
of the screens in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters to the Justice Department and the state attorney  
general, Vallone asked the government to look into Loews Cineplex 
in light of last month's 50-cent price increase to $9.50. He also 
said the Council would open hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Loews Cineplex officials did not return several calls for  
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside a Sony theater at Lincoln Square, some moviegoers  
shrugged at the price increase. Others bemoaned the high prices 
that are part of life in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely too high, especially for children. It used to  
cost $5 for them and now it's $6,'' said Liz Callahan, 32, who was 
taking her two nieces, aged 8 and 7, to a matinee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't have raised prices without giving something in  
return, like free popcorn,'' said Levi James, 25, of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Times columnist Clyde Haberman recently noted that  
signs over the Sony food counters say, ``Free refills on all 
fountain drinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't say that the refill has to be the same day,'' he  
wrote. ``Do you see theater owners patting down hundreds of people 
looking for cup smugglers? Just a question.''

<HEADLINE> No Hormone Test for 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The IOC drug chief on Saturday effectively ruled out  
trying to catch athletes using performance-enhancing human growth 
hormones at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Alexandre de Merode said the most that can be  
realistically hoped for is that blood samples might be taken at 
those games for research purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the prospects for that, which would amount to testing  
the doping test, are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``About the only thing we can do (at Sydney) would be  
research,'' said de Merode, head of the International Olympic 
Committee's medical commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important progress has been made and we can say a test exists,  
but the main question is whether the test can be used in 
competition or out. Based on the data we have seen, I would say it 
is a test for out of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to use the test in Sydney, it can't be as it is  
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human growth hormone -- or HGH -- helps build muscles and is one  
of two drugs officials believe are most widely-used by athletes who 
cheat. The other -- erythropoietin, or EPO -- is an 
endurance-boosting hormone that increases the blood's ability to 
carry oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Christian Strasburger of Innenstadt University Hospital in  
Munich, Germany, reported Friday that he has developed a new, 
highly accurate blood test to detect HGH. But the IOC repeatedly 
has said it will not introduce blood testing at the Olympics unless 
a 100 percent accurate test is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Substances that mimic naturally occurring hormones in the body  
have become the drugs of choice in sports because they cannot be 
detected by current testing methods, which involve only urine 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode said it's likely that use of an HGH test in 2000 would  
be on an anonymous basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be fair, you can't take a medal away from someone who is  
tested with a method that is still not 100 percent accurate,'' de 
Merode said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke Saturday following three days of meetings between  
officials from the IOC, EU, United Nations and drug-testing labs. 
Other issues he addressed included: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The fight against doping is being hampered by the IOC's  
bribery scandal. ``As the credibility of the IOC is questioned, 
it's harder to carry out our work,'' de Merode acknowledged. ``This 
is about the future of the IOC itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He defended the IOC. ``What has happened is unfortunate, but I'm  
not sure it should be defined as `corruption.' It was really an 
error in conduct and behavior,'' De Merode said. ``If you give me 
cuff links, I'm not going to ask if they are stainless steel or 
gold, or how much they cost. So it's not the person who takes that 
is at fault, but the one who gives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Italy's Acqua Acetosa drug-testing laboratory, which was shut  
down in October after revelations of improper procedures, appears 
to have passed the first step toward being re-accredited, de Merode 
said, and should be up and running within 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Rome sessions were part of a series of meetings aimed at  
standardizing anti-doping efforts -- involving testing facilities, 
national police and Interpol -- across Europe. ``We learned from the 
Tour de France,'' he said, ``that we need tight collaboration from 
government agencies.''

<HEADLINE> Storm Stalls Hundreds of Motorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLBY, Kan. (AP) -- Hundreds of travelers spent the night jammed  
into motels and community shelters while a storm blew more than a 
foot of snow across the central Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The 115-mile-long stretch of Interstate 70 from Wakeeney west to  
the Colorado state line was reopened Saturday but remained 
snow-packed and dangerous, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 travelers spent the night in Colby, filling  
shelters set up by the Red Cross and the National Guard Armory. 
Hundreds more spent the night in Limon, Colo., because of the 
Kansas road closure. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm caught Matt Brahana, a University of Missouri student,  
as he headed back to Columbia, Mo., from Denver, where the Tigers 
basketball team lost in the NCAA tournament Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me four and a half hours to get this far,'' Brahana  
said in Colby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel safe on the roads anymore,'' Brahana said. ``You  
couldn't see at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm moved eastward Saturday, thunderstorms boiled up  
along its southern, warmer side, and the National Weather Service 
issued a tornado watch for sections of Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama and extreme northwestern Florida. Nine traffic deaths were 
blamed on the weather Friday in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were so bad in Colby that restaurants and stores  
closed early Friday. Kayla Korte, manager of a Burger King, said 
she closed three hours early after everyone on the night shift 
called to say they couldn't make it in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were still swamped,'' she said. ``People were pretty  
understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signs posted at Salina and Hays had warned travelers that no  
motel rooms were available in western Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comfort Inn in Colby ran out of rooms but offered lobby  
floor space to stranded travelers, including Joe Day, an amateur 
boxer heading back home to Houston home from a match in Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the breakfast room, laying on the floor watching  
tapes of us getting beat up,'' Day said of himself and his fellow 
boxers. ``It's real fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were kept busy helping motorists whose vehicles went off  
the roads. At the emergency dispatch center in Colby, Sheriff Tom 
Jones and four others answered a constant string of calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a cell phone. People were telling us they  
couldn't see anymore,'' Jones said. ``Some of them were thinking we 
were God or something, asking us when the snow was going to quit. I 
just told them I didn't know.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Prediction Sets Tone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield boxed himself into a corner  
even before he and Lennox Lewis enter the ring to unify the 
heavyweight title tonight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield put himself there with a promise of a third-round  
knockout -- and a claim that he has no backup plan if his prophecy 
doesn't come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a Plan B, so Plan A has to work,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Holyfield finds Lewis still standing after the bell sounds to  
end the third round of the scheduled 12-round fight, he'll have 
only a minute or so to figure out what to do the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't seem terribly concerned that will happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking Lennox down. Lennox is good,'' Holyfield said.  
``You have the best of the best in this fight. Because you have the 
best of the best, a knockout has to take place. When you have two 
people truly trying to win, somebody is going to get knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield risks his WBA and IBF versions of the heavyweight  
title when he meets Lewis, holder of the WBC crown. The first 
unification of the sport's most prized crown will take place 
sometime around 11:30 p.m. EST before a sellout crowd of some 
20,000 people who paid anywhere from $100 to $1,500 for the right 
to witness a slice of history. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, though, will need some cooperation from Lewis to  
fulfill his promise of ending the fight in the third round. That's 
what happened when Holyfield beat James ``Buster'' Douglas in 
October 1990 to capture the undisputed title, and it happened again 
later when Tyson bit him in the same round. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts) will enter the ring with  
``Warrior'' stitched across the front of his trunks, Lewis has been 
more of a reluctant warrior at times. He might decide to fight 
cautiously early, hoping to catch Holyfield in the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you can hit somebody is when they're trying to  
hit you,'' Holyfield conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis will bring a big physical presence into the fight that  
will likely define a career that has been noted so far more for the 
fights he has missed out on than the ones he has been involved in. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis stands 6-foot-5 and weighed 246 pounds at Thursday's  
weigh-in, 31 more than Holyfield, who has always had problems with 
bigger heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holyfield has fought -- and beaten -- the best of his era,  
winning fights with Mike Tyson, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, 
George Foreman and Larry Holmes. A look at the record of Lewis 
(34-1, 27 knockouts) reveals the likes of Oliver McCall, Henry 
Akinwande and Andrew Golota at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fight that has been eluding me a long time,'' said  
the 33-year-old Lewis, who won an Olympic gold medal for Canada in 
the 1988 Olympics, but claims British residency. ``It will be a 
great fight for me to make a mark and prove that I'm the best 
heavyweight on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a purely physical level the fight could turn on Holyfield's  
ability to get inside on Lewis, who possesses a heavy and active 
left jab, and Lewis' chances of landing his big right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But what might be the key to the fight is which fighter can  
answer the questions posed of him. In Holyfield's case, it is his 
relatively advanced age of 36, which showed in a lackluster 
decision over Vaughn Bean his last time out. For Lewis, it is 
whether he has it inside of him to brawl with and beat one of the 
best heavyweights around. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare they question my heart,'' Lewis said. ``Evander  
Holyfield doesn't have the monopoly on hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield will make $20 million for the fight, bringing his  
earnings in four fights since upsetting Tyson in their first bout 
to some $80 million. Lewis will get $10 million for the chance to 
establish himself as the biggest heavyweight in town. 
</P>
<P>
	On the undercard, James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of Pittsburg,  
Calif., will defend the WBA welterweight title against Sam Garr 
(25-2, 23 knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.; and Fernando Vargas 
(15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF junior 
middleweight title against Howard Clarke (26-10-2, 8 knockouts) of 
England.

<HEADLINE> Suspicious Bag Shuts Down Runway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Authorities were investigating an  
unaccompanied piece of luggage at the Port Columbus International 
Airport that led to the shutdown of a runway for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	WCMH-TV reported Saturday that Mary Schiavo, a former inspector  
general of the Department of Transportation, checked a bag Friday 
as part of a story the station was doing on airport security, but 
didn't board the flight to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The station showed the contents of her bag, which included what  
appeared to be a tape recorder, an alarm clock and wiring. Ms. 
Schiavo had put identification on the bag, the station reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The station also said it informed airport official David  
Whitaker that Ms. Schiavo checked a bag and didn't get on the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Schiavo nor Whitaker returned messages seeking  
comment. WCMH, in a written statement early Sunday, said that Port 
Columbus officials did not confirm that the package found in the 
airport concourse has any connection to the station's story on 
airport safety. WCMH said it is cooperating fully with airport 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators concluded there were no explosives in the suitcase  
that shut down the runway Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard L. Morgan, director of public safety at Port Columbus,  
said he didn't know whether the station or Ms. Schiavo were 
connected to the suspicious bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we are trying to determine everything that  
happened from the beginning,'' he said, adding that the FBI would 
assist in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  
criticizing the Federal Aviation Administration on several 
occasions. She has since published a book accusing the FAA of 
sloppy inspections, lax airport security and disregard for bogus 
airplane parts.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Ends Uruguay Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- Prince Charles wound up his trip to  
Uruguay by watching a soccer game and visiting a beach resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prince of Wales popped in for the first half of a soccer  
match Saturday at Centenario Stadium, then left midway through the 
match to head to Punta del Este, a popular Uruguayan beach resort 
along the country's Atlantic coast. There, he was slated to tour a 
naval base housing helicopters donated by his country to Uruguay. 
He was also to visit a local art museum. 
</P>
<P>
	His 48-hour visit to Uruguay followed a three-day trip to  
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Prince Charles will travel to the Falkland Islands,  
the last stop on his South American tour, for a two day visit. 
Prince Charles returns to Britain on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Favored in Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- It's sink or swim in the Florida Derby.  
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, the Fountain of Youth Stakes winner, heads a field of 10  
3-year-olds in today's $750,000 Florida Derby, one of several 
Kentucky Derby prep races this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done well in the shallow end of the pool,'' Carl Nafzger,  
Vicar's trainer, said. ``Now it's time to jump into the deep end. 
With the way this horse has been training, I'd be surprised if he 
didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar is the 3-1 favorite in the 1 1/8-mile Florida Derby at  
Gulfstream Park, with Cat Thief considered his chief threat after 
losing by a neck to Nafzger's colt in the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger revealed earlier this week that Vicar had a breathing  
problem after a dull fifth-place finish in the Holy Bull Stakes on 
Jan. 16, and that it was corrected by minor surgery a few days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar came back strong to win the Fountain of Youth and improved  
his career record to three wins and a second in five starts. A win 
today and Vicar stamps himself as the best in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, is one of five challengers  
from the Fountain of Youth. The others are the third and 
fourth-place finishers in Certain and Grits'n Hard Toast, as well 
as Aly's Alley and Casanova Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Also trying to run down Vicar was Valid Trefaire, a sprinter  
expected to set the pace; the Nick Zito-trained duo of Adonis and 
Wondertross; and First American. Adonis and Wondertross were not 
coupled in the wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, the impressive filly who was entered Wednesday, but  
drew an unfavorable outside post position, was to be scratched 
today, trainer Eddie Plesa Jr., said. Three Ring will run instead 
in the $200,000 Bonnie Miss Stakes for fillies Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Florida Derby (ABC, post time 5:41 p.m.),  
there are four other races -- two each in California and Louisiana -- 
with Kentucky Derby implications. And trainer Bob Baffert has the 
horses to beat in all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert saddles the current Kentucky Derby favorite Exploit and  
Prime Timber in the San Felipe Stakes today at Santa Anita and the 
filly Silverbulletday today in the Fair Grounds Oaks in New 
Orleans; on Sunday, he's got General Challenge in the Louisiana 
Derby and the filly Excellent Meeting in the Santa Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge will be tested by Answer Lively, winner of the  
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but looking for his first win as a 
3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert nearly captured the Triple Crown the past two years,  
winning the Derby and Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997 and with 
Real Quiet in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	While Baffert is looking for an unprecedented third straight  
Derby win, Nafzger is looking for a second trip to Louisville on 
the first Saturday in May. In 1990, Unbridled won the Florida 
Derby, then went on to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar isn't alone in needing a big race to keep Derby dreams  
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief has been improving steadily, with a third-place finish  
in the Hutcheson Stakes followed by his strong effort in the 
Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has moved forward since the Fountain of Youth,''  
Lukas said Friday of his main Kentucky Derby prospect. ``You'll 
hear some trainers say that horses never lie. Well, I'm here to 
tell you that they do lie, but he has given me every indication 
that he is moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Azpurua Jr., who trains Certain, also expects improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's as ready as he can be,'' Azpurua said after Certain  
galloped at Calder Friday. Certain, to be ridden by Kent 
Desormeaux, entered the Fountain of Youth undefeated in four starts 
around two turns. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the Florida Derby card is the $100,000 Swale Stakes,  
with Texas Glitter the 6-5 favorite in a field of six 3-year-olds.

<HEADLINE> Tulsa Facing Big Challenge in Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- There's more bad news for the rest of the  
NCAA tournament field attempting to knock off No. 1 Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski said 3-point ace Trajan Langdon will start  
Sunday against Tulsa in the second round of the East Regional. The 
senior and team's second-leading scorer had missed the last three 
games with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Blue Devils (33-1) didn't seem to miss a beat  
without Langdon, winning the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament 
before dusting off 16th-seeded Florida A&AMP;M 99-58 Friday night in 
the opening round of the NCAAs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krzyzewski said Langdon's return is important to a team,  
that believe it or not, he thinks can get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we want him back is obvious; he's good and we're a  
better team, but also you start picking up bad habits, primarily in 
pace,'' Krzyzewski said Saturday. ``You are playing hard but you're 
still pacing because you know there isn't a fifth perimeter guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pick up bad habits when you pace, maybe you don't deny  
as hard or you don't pressure as hard because you know you have to 
be in there a few extra minutes. We want to get away from that 
because we attack through our defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duke has won 28 straight and is the prohibitive favorite  
to win the national title, No. 9 seed Tulsa (23-9) will be looking 
to advance to the round of 16 for the third time in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Hurricane played Duke tough in the Preseason NIT two  
seasons ago before losing 72-67, but Bill Self was not the team's 
coach and most of Duke's star players were still in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the 11-point lead we had at halftime and at the end  
of the game Coach Krzyzewski said, `Man, can they guard,''' said 
Tulsa's Michael Ruffin. ``We matched their intensity at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in control throughout the entire game, but at the end  
we let their pressure get to us. On Sunday, we're going to have to 
come out there and execute against their pressure and take care of 
the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa's downfall all season has been turnovers, and its  
first-round win over College of Charleston was no different. The 
Golden Hurricane coughed it up 25 times and almost blew a 26-point 
second-half lead before hanging on 62-53. 
</P>
<P>
	Self tried to diffuse the pressure of a matchup with powerhouse  
Duke, saying he likes the role of underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, we're a huge underdog,'' he said. ``But I'll go to  
bed and I hope our players go to bed thinking it's going to be a 
special day and history will be made in a positive way for us. 
We've got nothing to lose and let's go let it all hang out and see 
what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Self admitted a victory over the high-scoring Blue  
Devils, who he called the best team in the post-Wooden era, would 
be extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``That D.U.K.E. on the front of their jerseys is worth about 10  
or 15 points,'' Self said. ``Hopefully, it will be a situation 
where our guys think they are playing in a park in Durham or a park 
in north Tulsa and we're playing shirts and skins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be a special day for us to have an opportunity to  
win the basketball game. But there have been a lot of special days 
in this NCAA tournament for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second game at the Charlotte Coliseum will feature No. 4  
seed Tennessee (21-8) against 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State 
(21-10). 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers were knocked out of the NCAAs a year ago in the  
first round by another Missouri Valley Conference school -- Illinois 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, players for Southwest Missouri said they needed to  
``calm down'' following the team's first-round upset over No. 5 
seed Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Alford relaxed his players by chest-bumping with  
them in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked to hear that more coaches don't chest bump,''  
said Alford, a star guard for Indiana's 1987 national championship 
team. ``We just have to relax and play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the 12th seed, and we weren't champions of the SEC and  
we haven't been ranked in the top 25 or 30 all year. But we've had 
an outstanding year. This has been a very consistent team, and one 
that has been able to play a lot of different styles.''

<HEADLINE> Professor Convicted in Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A University of Puerto Rico professor who favors  
independence for the Caribbean island has been convicted of 
planting a bomb that wrecked a car outside a Chicago military 
recruiting office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Solis Jordan, 46, faces six years in prison at his  
sentencing scheduled for July. His lawyer said he would appeal 
Friday's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan allegedly planted two bombs near a military recruiting  
office in December 1992. One was disarmed before it could go off. 
The other did not explode but caught fire, destroying a Marine 
Corps car. 
</P>
<P>
	Solis, who holds a doctoral degree from the University of  
Illinois, was teaching at DePaul University in Chicago at the time. 
FBI agents testified that Solis acknowledged planting the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	In a December referendum, 46.5 percent of Puerto Rico's voters  
backed statehood for the island while just 2.5 percent supported 
independence. But 50.3 percent voted for ``none of the above.''

<HEADLINE> Austrian Wins Women's Slalom Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria  
claimed the World Cup season giant slalom title today, adding to 
the overall season crown she clinched last week and the season 
super-G title she sewed up on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Meissnitzer's three titles, and season titles to fellow  
Austrians Sabine Egger (slalom) and Renate Goetschl (downhill), the 
Austrians swept all five women's '99 discipline championships. The 
Swiss women were the last to achieve that in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian men won an unprecedented five titles last season,  
but can get no more than three this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Anita Wachter won today's World Cup Final slalom in a  
combined 2 minutes, 8.81 seconds. Second went to Anna Ottosson of 
Sweden (2:10.54), followed by Norway's Andrine Flemmen (2:10.59). 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer finished eighth in today's season's finale (2:12.01)  
for women, picking up 32 points to give her 652 for the season. 
Wachter, with her fourth World Cup slalom win of the season, gained 
100 points to finish with 636. Meissnitzer also won four slaloms 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni of Italy skied in  
the race and then confirmed her retirement, which was widely 
reported several days ago. The 28-year-old has been plagued by 
injury and serious illness in recent seasons.

<HEADLINE> T'Wolves Blame Changes on Marbury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- When the final buzzer sounded in last  
season's playoff-ending loss to the Seattle SuperSonics, the 
Minnesota Timberwolves could take heart in a future that looked 
brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months and one collective bargaining agreement later, the  
picture is very different, and for that the Wolves blame Stephon 
Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complexion of our team has changed drastically in the last  
three months because of Steph,'' coach Flip Saunders said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves believe Marbury's unwillingness to play in Minnesota  
not only cost them his considerable talents, but also those of 
former All-Star Tom Gugliotta and veteran guard Terry Porter, an 
important leader on a young team. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice president of basketball operations Kevin McHale said the  
Wolves were forced to trade Marbury to the New Jersey Nets on 
Thursday when the New York City native said he couldn't play on the 
same team as Kevin Garnett, who last year signed a $126 million 
contract, the richest long-term deal in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephon Marbury expressed some real concern that he wouldn't  
be able to make the kind of money that Kevin Garnett makes, and 
that was kind of bothersome to him,'' McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said he tried to explain that the NBA's new collective  
bargaining agreement, ratified in January after a six-month 
lockout, strictly limits how much a player can earn. Marbury was 
unwilling to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to explain to (Marbury) about the importance of  
winning and being in a good situation,'' Saunders said. ``He said, 
`Hey Flip, it's business. Right now, whether it is right or wrong, 
I have a tough time playing with (Garnett) and having to play where 
(Garnett) makes the amount of money he makes, and I'm only going to 
make $71 million.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract extension with  
the Nets on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the Wolves' only beef with Marbury, though. They  
believe they lost Gugliotta to Phoenix because he didn't want to 
play with Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``His agent made it very clear to me, if we would have agreed to  
trade Stephon, Tommy would agree to come back to Minnesota,'' 
Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves were unwilling to trade Marbury because they thought  
there was a chance they could re-sign him, either during the season 
or in July, after his three-year rookie contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for Gugliotta to make up his mind, the Wolves lost  
Porter, who signed with Miami because the Wolves couldn't address 
his contract situation until Gugliotta's was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of having Garnett, Marbury and Gugliotta, three of  
the NBA's best players, as the nucleus of a team poised to become 
one of the NBA's elite, they have Garnett surrounded by a virtually 
brand new supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Smith took Gugliotta's place at power forward, a shrewd move  
the Wolves made quickly when it appeared Gugliotta would reject 
their contract offer and sign with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Malik Sealy, Bobby Jackson and Dean Garrett all were added  
before the start of the season, and now Terrell Brandon inherits 
Marbury's job at point guard after coming over from Milwaukee in 
Thursday's nine-player trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves also have two first-round draft picks from the Nets,  
one this year and one down the road, with which to continue 
building a Western Conference contender. 
</P>
<P>
	If keeping Marbury was as unlikely as the Wolves make it seem,  
they once again appear to have come through with a solid Plan B, as 
they did by replacing Gugliotta with Smith, the No. 1 overall pick 
in the 1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But it remains to be seen how this latest shakeup will affect  
their immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Saunders' confidence comes from what he expects from  
Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, who is averaging 13.5 points and 6.9 assists per game  
this season -- compared to Marbury's 17.7 points and 9.3 assists -- 
was an All-Star in 1996 and '97 when he played for the Cleveland 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to the Bucks in a three-team deal before last  
season. When approached by Bucks management to re-sign, Brandon 
made it clear he had little interest in staying in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year veteran, Brandon will be a free agent after the  
season, but indications are he will re-sign with the Wolves. Bill 
Duffy, who was a teammate of McHale's at the University of 
Minnesota for two seasons in the late 1970s, said Brandon is 
excited about joining the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had no reservations whatsoever,'' Duffy said.

</P>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Les Barcus, inventor of an electronic  
pickup that could be used on an array of instruments from acoustic 
guitars to flutes, died March 4 at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barcus-Berry pickup, first produced in the 1960s, allowed  
clear amplification of traditional non-electric instruments and led 
to new possibilities in performance. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, John Berry brought him a violin, hoping Barcus could  
improve its recorded sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcus built a small transducer that picked up the energy  
reverberating from the strings as it passed to the bridge of the 
instrument. The invention led to formation of Barcus-Berry Inc., 
which began operation in 1964.

researcher, died March 11 of liver disease. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Franken, former director of the University of Arizona Optical  
Sciences Center, is considered the father of non-linear optics for 
having discovered that the color of a laser beam can be changed by

</P>
<P>
	The co-founder and former chairman of Best Products Inc. had  
been in ill health for a number of years. The company, founded in

youthful virtuosity grew into one of the great musical talents of 
the 20th century, died Friday of pneumonia and heart failure. He 
was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin was both an American citizen and a British subject, and  
was made a baron in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin was only 7 when he amazed a San Francisco audience with  
a brilliant debut violin performance. Four years later, he played 
at New York's Carnegie Hall with the New York Symphony Orchestra. 
By 13, he had already won accolades in Berlin, Paris and London. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Menuhin gave 500 concerts for U.S. and  
Allied troops and for Red Cross funds. He offended many Israelis, 
however, by performing for Germans in Berlin only two years after 
the war. 
</P>

soprano whose pure, silvery voice and personal charm made her one 
of the most beloved opera singers of the 1930s and '40s, died 
Friday from complications of pneumonia. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayao's crystalline voice enchanted conductor Arturo Toscanini,  
and he trained her for her U.S. debut in Carnegie Hall in 1934. She 
made a triumphant Metropolitan Opera debut during the 1936-37 
season singing the title role of Massenet's ``Manon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her Met career covered 236 performances in 12 roles and lasted  
until 1952. It included such lyric and coloratura soprano roles as 
Mimi in Puccini's ``La Boheme,'' Melisande in Debussy's ``Pelleas 
and Melisande'' and Susanna in Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sayao also made extensive concert tours, performing in 49  
states. To show her gratitude for her adopted homeland, Sayao sang 
for wounded soldiers returning from World War II. She became a U.S. 
citizen in 1959.

system of mobile blood banks credited with saving many lives during 
World War II, died March 3. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan, a microbiologist and specialist in internal medicine,  
was awarded the Legion of Merit for establishing the blood bank

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Gets Off to Wild Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood wasn't looking to do much in his  
1999 debut and he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, finally recovered from an upper  
respiratory and gastrointestinal illness that sidelined him for the 
early part of spring training, couldn't find the plate Saturday as 
a Chicago Cubs' split squad lost to the Anaheim Angels 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to be out there,'' he said, still sweating from  
his in-game laps across the outfield. ``It's been a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander allowed three runs and three hits  
in 1 1-3 innings, walking two and striking out none. He threw to 
nine batters, and 16 of his 26 pitches were balls. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sun-spalshed 80-degree afternoon, he threw just one pitch a  
batter missed -- not surprising since it was known in advance he 
would be throwing 100 percent fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased I got accomplished what I wanted to get  
accomplished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA last season, gave up an RBI single to  
Tim Salmon in the first but generally had his command. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the second, he lost it, throwing 10 consecutive balls at  
one point and prompting manager Jim Riggleman to make a trip to the 
mound. Wood threw a run-scoring wild pitch and gave up a sacrifice 
fly to Luis Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little out of whack across the body at the end,'' he said of  
his problem. ``I was trying to throw strikes. They could have hit 
me out of the park, I wouldn't have cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman knows Wood is a big part of the Cubs' season -- and  
their hope to win the World Series for the first time since 1908. 
When Wood was sidelined last September by elbow soreness, Chicago 
struggled to a 14-11 record following a 14-14 August, nearly 
blowing the NL's wild-card berth 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little jittery,'' Riggleman said. ``Basically, I just  
wanted him to throw his pitches, throw his fastball, show him arm 
is healthy. Just let it fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, pitching in a game for the first time since the division  
series-ending loss to Atlanta, said he had 90-95 percent of his 
velocity, and he would start throwing breaking balls -- ``spinners'' 
he called them -- before his next start. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the illness, he'll probably get only three or four  
more starts before the Cubs start the season at Houston, the NL 
Central champion, on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he thinks he'll be ready to throw 100 pitches by his  
first regular-season start. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably stretching it a little,'' Riggleman said,  
``but we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood burst on the scene with his 20-strikeout game against the  
Astros last May 6, tying Roger Clemens' record for a nine-inning 
game. He wound up with 233 in 166 2-3 innings, and has 573 in 445 
innings in his pro career -- allowing just 24 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rewarded with a raise from $170,000 to $690,000 a record  
for a player with less than one year of major league service. A 
bunch of Cubs' fans in the crowd on 7,411 at Tempe Diablo Stadium 
wore jerseys with his No. 34. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that, some would feel pressure. Wood says there's none.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to go out and throw 30 in a row as hard as I  
can,'' he said. ``I'll take it slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Winner Ken Hill pitched 2 2-3 innings, allowing a pair of  
unearned runs, four hits and four walks. Wood was the loser, and 
Shigetoshi Hasegawa allowed two hits in 2 2-3 shutout innings for 
the save. ... Alan Zinter homered for the Cubs. ... Anaheim won for 
only the third time in nine spring games. ... Salmon was 3-for-3 
with two RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sale Nears Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The sale of the Washington Redskins remained on  
hold Saturday, although there were signs that the $800 million deal 
is inching closer to approval by NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we made substantial progress toward getting this thing  
structured,'' commissioner Paul Tagliabue said after four hours of 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the hours were among the finance committee, which was  
joined for the last hour by the purchasers, Howard and Edward 
Milstein and Daniel Snyder, who were the high bidders to buy the 
team from the trustees for the estate of the team's late owner, 
Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance committee will meet again Sunday and the owners are  
expected to vote next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The major issue has been the terms of a $400 million loan to  
finance the purchase. The Milsteins want to use the Redskins as 
collateral, the league wants them to put up personal assets 
instead.

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Escape With Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The IOC's chief investigator knows there's a  
fine line between action that gets a member kicked out of the club 
and action that brings a heavy slap on the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding at times like an umpire explaining his strike zone,  
International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound defended 
the latest recommendations from his internal investigation of the 
Olympics' worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member panel recommended stern warnings for two IOC  
leaders, executive committee member Kim Un-yong of South Korea and 
Phil Coles, who helped win the 2000 Summer Games for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no regulation about `severe censure' in the IOC  
charter. I understand I will get a very serious warning,'' Kim told 
The Associated Press before leaving for a special IOC general 
assembly in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they provoke me further, I am not going to fight the  
warning,'' Kim added. ``I am, have always been, committed to IOC 
work. I will continue to work with the Olympic family to promote 
the Olympic goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It gave lesser rebukes to seven others, including former IOC  
vice president Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, and cleared three members 
implicated in the million-dollar gifts-and-favors scheme that Salt 
Lake City waged as it won the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's only recommendation for expulsion in the latest  
batch of cases was saved for a minor member from the South Pacific 
island of Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork, an IOC member since 1987 but never a  
member of the leadership, was targeted for ouster because of a 
$30,000 loan his wife received from Salt Lake's top bidder, which 
was later paid in full. Wallwork denied knowing about the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders said for several weeks that the latest batch of  
alleged infractions were minor compared with the earlier ones, in 
which nine members were expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	But big money -- and big names -- are still involved, and Pound  
had to repeatedly defend the report against charges of whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a judgment call,'' the Montreal lawyer said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said his panel tried to distinguish between members who  
sought to enrich themselves and those ``who were careless about 
what they should do and not attentive to what people might think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report accused Kim and Coles of serious conflicts of  
interest or lapses in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	It warned that they could be expelled if misconduct recurred.  
And Pound said he suspected that there was evidence, yet uncovered, 
that would call for Kim's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission believes there is additional evidence still out  
there,'' Pound said. He added, however, that it was time to close 
the file and get ready for the IOC's watershed session in 
Switzerland next Wednesday and Thursday, changes stemming from the 
Salt Lake scandal will be debated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been a work in progress,'' he said. ``There  
are times when you have to take a photograph and make a report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, president of both the international Taekwondo federation  
and the confederation of Olympic sports bodies, allegedly used his 
Olympic position to help land lucrative jobs in telecommunications 
and music for his two children -- daughter Kim Hae-jung, a concert 
pianist, and son Kim Jung-hoon, a satellite TV executive also known 
as John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC commission concluded its work on allegations involving  
concert dates and recording contracts for Kim Hae-jung, which it 
said ``created at least a very serious appearance of conflict of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the investigation remained open on allegations that Kim  
Un-yong knew that Salt Lake City bidders helped pay for a job for 
his son at Keystone Communications in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it was ``highly unlikely'' that Kim Un-yong did not know  
of the arrangement, although ``evidence available as of this day is 
not entirely conclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the allegations be fully established, which is not the  
case, the commission would consider that such behavior by an IOC 
member would justify expulsion from the IOC,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, in a statement released by his New York-based publicist,  
said he was ``carefully reviewing the report, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with my colleagues in the IOC and the Olympic 
family toward advancing the goals of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the best-liked members of the clubby IOC, was  
accused of accepting some $60,000 in travel benefits from Salt Lake 
bidders, including trips to ski resorts and the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was similar to that of Agustin Arroyo, the IOC member  
from Ecuador who has been ousted, but Pound said there were 
differences that made Coles' case less severe, most notably the 
fact that the Australian was legitimately in the United States when 
the Salt Lake City-paid travel began. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pound said, ``alarm bells'' should have sounded for Coles  
when offers of trips kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least a warning light should have gone off in his head,''  
the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork's wife, Julia, borrowed the money from Tom Welch, the  
former head of Salt Lake's Olympic efforts. A Salt Lake ethics 
report said Welch had to withdraw the money from his children's 
trust funds, and the loan was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork told the IOC that he knew nothing about the loan and  
that he and his wife were separated at the time. But the Pound 
commission said faxes about the loan were sent from Welch to 
Wallwork's office, and that the Wallwork family received $67,585 in 
travel benefits from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his commission found nothing to call for more  
expulsions in the responses from 37 cities that bid for the games 
from 1996 onward. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said all of that information should be turned over to a  
standing ethics panel, part of the reform package due for adoption 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that panel might also consider the case of Anita  
DeFrantz, a vice president from the United States. While DeFrantz 
has repeatedly denied any knowledge of wrongdoing, reports this 
week quoted Welch and former Salt Lake Olympic vice president Dave 
Johnson as saying they discussed everything about the gift program 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always said that if there are facts to back up the  
allegations, we will look at it,'' Pound said. ``But so far, she 
says she did not know. We'll give the benefit of the doubt to Anita 
at this time.''

Indianapolis, signed with the Wildcats in November. He died Friday 
night after collapsing during a state tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky players weren't told about Stewart's death until after  
their 82-60 victory over New Mexico State in the NCAA Midwest 
Regional game Friday night. Smith knew before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to move on, but certainly having to hear it is  
depressing,'' Smith said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Smith said, he began visualizing himself ``coaching  
John'' during Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three Kentucky players taking part in an interview  
session Saturday, only Scott Padgett answered when asked about the 
situation. Wayne Turner declined comment and Heshimu Evans just sat 
there with a blank expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is still kind of in disbelief,'' Padgett said. ``His  
parents said (Stewart) would want us to come out and play our best 
for him and ourselves, which we will try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky plays Kansas on Sunday in the Superdome.

<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONELY COLES:* Miami of Ohio coach Charlie Coles treasures  
every moment on the court with his players. And the NCAA tournament 
provides some extra time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have got to remember that not everyone gets to go to the  
NCAA every year, but I coach every year,'' Coles said. ``By being 
here, it extends the time I'm coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to keep the season going because the spring, summer and  
fall are the loneliest times of the year for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, whose team plays Utah on Sunday, also is appreciative for  
other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Mid-American Conference tournament game on Feb. 28,  
1998, Coles suffered a cardiac arrest. Physicians worked on him for 
20 minutes before he was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fully recovered and back to normal on the sideline, from  
where he watched his 10th-seeded Red Hawks beat Washington 59-58 in 
the first round of the NCAA Midwest Regional on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUKE INVITATIONAL:* Many have said that this year's NCAA  
tournament is a race to see who will play Duke in the national 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Rick Majerus agrees that Duke ``has done everything  
and done it well'' and has a good chance to win another title. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister in her pool picked Duke to win it all,'' Majerus  
said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILIAR BEGINNINGS:* Roy Williams and Tubby Smith now coach  
two of the winningest teams in college basketball. The two 
49-year-old coaches have come a long way from coaching at North 
Carolina high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The first job for Kansas' Williams was at Swannanoa (N.C.) Owen  
High School from 1973-78. Smith, who won the national championship 
last year with Kentucky, spent two years during that same span at 
Hoke County High in Raeford, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BETTER FEELING:* Kansas forward T.J. Pugh is in better shape  
than he was the first time the Jayhawks played Kentucky this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two teams played Dec. 1, it was only his second game  
back from ankle surgery. He was held to three points -- all on free 
throws -- and missed all four field goals in the 63-45 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Pugh said his health ``wasn't too good at the time. I hope it  
will be better for me'' when the two teams play in the second round 
of the NCAA tournament Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Storm Stalls Hundreds of Motorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLBY, Kan. (AP) -- Hundreds of travelers spent the night jammed  
into motels and community shelters while a storm blew more than a 
foot of snow across the central Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The 115-mile-long stretch of Interstate 70 from Wakeeney west to  
the Colorado state line was reopened Saturday but remained 
snow-packed and dangerous, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 travelers spent the night in Colby, filling  
shelters set up by the Red Cross and the National Guard Armory. 
Hundreds more spent the night in Limon, Colo., because of the 
Kansas road closure. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm caught Matt Brahana, a University of Missouri student,  
as he headed back to Columbia, Mo., from Denver, where the Tigers 
basketball team lost in the NCAA tournament Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me four and a half hours to get this far,'' Brahana  
said in Colby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel safe on the roads anymore,'' Brahana said. ``You  
couldn't see at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm moved eastward Saturday, thunderstorms boiled up  
along its southern, warmer side, and the National Weather Service 
issued a tornado watch for sections of Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama and extreme northwestern Florida. Nine traffic deaths were 
blamed on the weather Friday in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were so bad in Colby that restaurants and stores  
closed early Friday. Kayla Korte, manager of a Burger King, said 
she closed three hours early after everyone on the night shift 
called to say they couldn't make it in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were still swamped,'' she said. ``People were pretty  
understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signs posted at Salina and Hays had warned travelers that no  
motel rooms were available in western Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comfort Inn in Colby ran out of rooms but offered lobby  
floor space to stranded travelers, including Joe Day, an amateur 
boxer heading back home to Houston home from a match in Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the breakfast room, laying on the floor watching  
tapes of us getting beat up,'' Day said of himself and his fellow 
boxers. ``It's real fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were kept busy helping motorists whose vehicles went off  
the roads. At the emergency dispatch center in Colby, Sheriff Tom 
Jones and four others answered a constant string of calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a cell phone. People were telling us they  
couldn't see anymore,'' Jones said. ``Some of them were thinking we 
were God or something, asking us when the snow was going to quit. I 
just told them I didn't know.''

<HEADLINE> Harnisch Likely Will Open Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Harnisch is following a predictable  
path toward his probable Opening Day start for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch knew that after strong outings in his first two spring  
training appearances, he was due to struggle the next time out. On 
Friday, he labored through four innings in a 5-2 loss to the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	He had entered the dreaded ``dead-arm'' period all pitchers go  
through for about a week-to-10 days before the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through it 10 times,'' Harnisch said of the spring  
routine. ``Those are things you live through and learn from. I know 
what to expect. It's not a panic situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch, however, is critical of his performance. He allowed  
two runs on five hits while walking four in four innings. He had 
retired 24 of the previous 27 batters he faced over eight scoreless 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I had the focus I should have,'' he said. ``If  
you relax your concentration level, you're not going to get 
anything accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harnisch, who overcame shoulder injuries and clinical  
depression to go 14-7 for the Reds last season, can use a subpar 
game as motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get right back in there and work on stuff,'' he said.  
``I'm not proud of the way I threw the ball. ... But it happens. 
I'm not worried about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch's work ethic is one of the reasons pitching coach Don  
Gullett feels the 32-year-old right-hander will be ready when the 
season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Jack McKeon hasn't officially named Harnisch the starter  
for the April 5 opener with the San Francisco Giants at Cinergy 
Field, but lefty Denny Neagle's slow progress from a sore shoulder 
makes it virtually certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the hardest workers as far as conditioning and  
what he needs to do to get ready,'' pitching coach Don Gullett said 
of Harnisch. ``He's a professional.''

<HEADLINE> High School Star Dies During Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) -- The high school basketball star who  
collapsed and died during a tournament game Friday night had a 
heart attack and had suffered from asthma, according to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner said 18-year-old John Stewart had an enlarged heart.  
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot senior, who had signed to go to Kentucky next year,  
collapsed during the third quarter of a Class 4A regional game at 
Columbus North High School. He was treated on the court and then 
taken to Columbus Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Felicia Stewart, said a heart attack killed her son,  
who had used inhalers because he was asthmatic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barthlomew County coroner, Joyce Fisher, said Stewart had  
had an enlarged heart. The official cause of death would not be 
known until after an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy occurred during what was the weekend's marquee  
matchup among boy's regional basketball tournaments, pitting 
Stewart's No. 2 Lawrence North squard against top-ranked 
Bloomington South. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart scored 22 points, pulled down 13 rebounds and blocked  
two shots before collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was the neatest young man I've ever coached,'' said  
Lawrence Keefer, the coach at Lawrence North. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after his team's NCAA tournament game Friday night,  
Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith was emotional, choking up while talking 
about Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts playing a game in perspective because life is so  
fragile for these young men,'' Smith said. This was a beautiful 
young man from a great family who was so looking forward to being 
part of Kentucky, which he always will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to his loved ones. I think all the guys (on  
the team) felt like he was already part of Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart started the second half by scoring 10 straight points.  
With about two minutes to play in the third quarter, he asked to be 
taken out of the game, saying he was having trouble breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nat Hill, a senior from Bloomington South, said that moments  
after Stewart came out of the game, he fell backwards in his seat 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers rushed around him and the fans couldn't really tell  
what was going on, Hill said. Emergency personnel administered CPR 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart arrived at the hospital, doctors tried for 90  
minutes to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 9:30 p.m., the entire Lawrence North basketball team,  
some still in sweats, others wearing letter jackets, came out of a 
back corridor of the hospital into the lobby where a crowd of fans 
and parents had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	The team formed a human chain, each holding the hand of the  
person behind him, as they walked through the lobby to the team 
bus. Some were crying, others just had blank stares, having just 
said good-bye to their dead teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough thing to tell kids,'' Keefer said. ``They  
gotta wonder why. It's the whole gamut of emotions. It's totally 
devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Shadiow, a senior at Lawrence North, stood with friends in  
the Columbus North parking lot after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear about this happening to guys in college and the pros  
but you just don't think about it happening at a high school 
game,'' Shadiow said. ``He was our age, I just can't believe 
something like this happened at our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When news that Stewart was dead reached the fans, many broke  
down and fell to the ground sobbing.

<HEADLINE> Europe Mergers Don't Hurt US Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Like pro wrestlers on steroids, European  
businesses are merging and consolidating to bulk up for competition 
in a single-currency arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent wave of mergers that created powerhouses like auto  
maker DaimlerChrysler AG would seem at first to present a stiff 
challenge to U.S. companies looking to enter Europe in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
	But Americans have little to fear -- and maybe even something to  
gain -- from dealing with European firms that are shrinking in 
number and growing in size, analysts and executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity,'' argues Philippe Haspeslagh, a  
professor of corporate strategy at INSEAD, an international 
business school in Fontainebleau, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``A typical American company has tended to focus on what's  
common in Europe, whereas many European companies for a long time 
have focused on what makes each country different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By adopting the euro and reducing the cost of currency  
transactions, 11 European countries have made it easier for 
companies to merge across borders. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $33 billion combination of Daimler Benz and  
Chrysler last year, the biggest deals include Deutsche Bank, which 
is buying New York-based Bankers Trust for $10 billion and Ford, 
which will take over the car division of Sweden's Volvo for $6.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Governments in Europe have only recently deregulated or  
privatized key industries like telecommunications, creating 
opportunities in Italy, for example, for Olivetti SpA to launch a 
takeover bid last month for a much bigger rival, Telecom Italia 
SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy companies that are heavily regulated in Europe are  
preparing for competition at home by expanding into Latin America, 
where markets are more open. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for some European players now entering the merger  
game is that they are playing ``a game of catch-up,'' said Margaret 
Young, the head of mergers and acquisitions in Europe for 
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, a U.S. investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In some fields, like auto manufacturing, European companies are  
already falling farther behind. By virtue of the size of its 
European business alone, General Motors Corp. ranks as the region's 
second-largest car company. Ford ranks fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the U.S. companies in Europe are already so large that  
perhaps Daimler-Benz needed to be part of Chrysler in order to 
compete,'' said Christopher Will, European auto analyst for Lehman 
Brothers in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Will said medium-sized producers like Renault SA of France and  
Fiat SpA of Italy should be forming alliances to compete more 
effectively in the future, but that they have little incentive to 
do so in the current climate of healthy profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The attempt this past week by Banque National de Paris to take  
over two French banking groups Societe Generale and Banque Paribas 
suggests a different problem: nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Europeans still are resentful of commercial incursions by  
foreigners. BNP's bid to form the world's largest bank from purely 
French components smacks of chauvinism, but also makes it harder to 
trim payrolls and close excess branches because of France's high 
unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consolidation is absolutely vital to the European banks, but  
it can't be simply in-country mergers,'' said Herbert Aspbury, the 
London-based regional executive for Chase Manhattan Bank. ``To be 
really compelling, it has to be truly cross-border.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the consolidation may actually be counterproductive in  
the long-run. Ego satisfaction, more than economic logic, has 
motivated some recent deals, said Mathew Hayward, who teaches 
international management at the London Business School. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not attempts to position companies for the future,''  
he said of takeover bids like the one by BNP. 
</P>
<P>
	While these companies may try to strip costs out of the system  
and charge higher prices, they may not be properly positioning 
themselves in new businesses in a way that will improve their 
growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real losers in the current consolidation craze are  
likely to be small- and medium-sized European firms. As 
manufacturers grow larger and their ranks grow thinner, they will 
look increasingly for bigger, and fewer, suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, smaller firms will find it more costly to  
raise capital. Investment fund managers are starting to look for 
opportunities on a Europe-wide basis and are devoting less capital 
to small firms in each country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of having 11 countries you can be a big fish in,  
you're now going to be that much smaller,'' Young said. ``You're 
going to get pushed farther down the food chain.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Detection Enhanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A high-tech company known for diagnostic  
systems used in medical tests has adapted the technology to detect 
E. coli bacteria in food. Experts say it could help combat 
foodborne pathogens by offering faster and more accurate test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	IGEN International Inc. long has supplied a technology called  
ORIGEN for use in medical laboratory tests. Last year, the 
Gaithersburg, Md.-based company decided to expand and see if the 
sensitive testing procedure would work on food. 
</P>
<P>
	It did, say Agriculture Department researchers. The result: a  
test from 10 to 100 times more sensitive than other tests for E. 
coli 0157:H7, a rare and often dangerous strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows the producer or the regulatory agency to have a  
better picture of how prevalent this bacteria is, to keep things 
out of the food chain,'' said C. Gerald Crawford, the 
Philadelphia-based USDA researcher who developed the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is not the magic bullet,'' Crawford said. ``It's  
another tool. . . a very rapid tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli is a common bacterium that lives in the digestive tracts  
of humans and animals. Some E. coli strains sicken people; one 
strain -- E. coli O157 -- is highly toxic, causing bloody diarrhea 
and severe cramps and sometimes even kidney damage or death. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate E. coli  
0157 sickens up to 20,000 Americans each year, killing several 
hundred. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli can get into beef during slaughter, from contamination  
with cattle feces. Thorough cooking, especially of hamburger, kills 
E. coli, but outbreaks from undercooked meat or poor kitchen 
sanitation increasingly make headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA researchers used IGEN's technology in a public-private  
partnership to develop the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, which is for beef, could benefit consumers who must  
deal with foodborne illnesses. Figures released last week by the 
CDC showed E. coli 0157:H7 infections increased 22 percent from 
1997 to 1998, after a 15 percent decline from 1996 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is vital that the meat and poultry industry develop and  
utilize quicker tests to find hazards in the food supply,'' said 
Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest. ``Quick tests for hazards in the 
food supply will result in significantly safer food in the long 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the nation's largest meat recall, Hudson Foods in August 1997  
recalled 25 million pounds of E. coli-contaminated ground beef. The 
meat sickened 15 people in Colorado and one in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The current tests for E. coli use a dipstick method, much like a  
home pregnancy test, and can take more than a workday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tests are not conducive to being done in a simple, fast  
format,'' said Bob Connelly, vice president of sales and marketing 
for IGEN. ``We can offer a test than can be done in the same day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IGEN's food technology works much like it's medical technology.  
Beef is ground to a liquid sample and placed in a test tube with 
IGEN's chemicals and later analyzed for E. coli. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new test, results are available in about six hours.  
</P>
<P>
	``What it means for consumers is this technology can be,  
hopefully will be, implemented to make their food safer,'' Connelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at USDA's food safety and inspection service lab in  
Athens, Ga., are testing with the new technology. If the food 
safety division likes it, the government may incorporate the 
technology into tests by its inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	IGEN also is working to put the product on the commercial  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	More research is under way to develop tests for other foodborne  
pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes and salmonella, officials 
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Crash Kills Motorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) -- A motorist died and a truck driver was  
critically injured when a tanker carrying 8,000 gallons of fuel 
overturned and exploded on a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
	The trucker sustained second- and third-degree burns to 75  
percent of his body in Friday's accident, California Highway Patrol 
Officer Denise Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw this guy come out of the truck fully engulfed in  
flames and just running,'' witness Vanessa Juarez said. ``His whole 
body was on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old man was airlifted to University of California,  
Irvine, Medical Center and was listed in critical condition early 
today. 
</P>

	The motorist, burned beyond recognition, was found in the  
wreckage of a car more than an hour after the crash, authorities 
said.

<P>
	The truck, carrying 5,000 gallons of diesel and 3,000 gallons of

about 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, the Highway 
Patrol said.

<HEADLINE> Bergoust Wins Freestyle World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEIRINGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- American Eric Bergoust, competing  
on the skis he used to win Olympic gold a year ago, added the world 
championship to his Olympic aerials title Saturday, and two other 
U.S. skiers collected bronze medals at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was huge for me,'' said Bergoust, who is refining a  
technique which he hopes will make him the first skier to complete 
five twists in a jump. ``I've been working all summer just for this 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew, because of the changes I'm working on in my technique,  
that it wouldn't be a good season results-wise on the World Cup ... 
so I focused on being ready for this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bergoust, 29, a two-time Olympian from Missoula, Mont., landed a  
perfect jump in the final round after posting the highest-scoring 
jump in the first round. He finished with 253.04 points to 245.04 
for Christian Rijavec of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Pack, a former world junior aerials champion from Park City,  
Utah, who missed the 1998 season with a knee injury, earned the 
bronze medal with 238.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqui Cooper of Australia, the 1997 world champion who failed  
to reach the Olympic finals a year ago, took her second women's 
title in a row. She received 197.83 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilde Lid of Norway was the silver medalist with 185.15, and  
Olympic champion Nikki Stone of Westborough, Mass., was third with 
180.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergoust said he prepared for the finals by breaking with his  
training routine and taking Friday off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took about twice as much as I normally would, and I jumped  
myself into the ground,'' he said of his practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That paid off Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I ended up jumping out of my mind,'' Bergoust said. ``My  
second jump was perfect. I couldn't have done it any better.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Hits 10,000 in Theory Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It never actually happened on Wall Street, but  
some financial tables will show the Dow Jones industrial average 
cracked the 10,000 barrier on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its attempt to shatter the five-digit barrier, the Dow got as  
high as 9,958.77 during early trading Friday, or 41.23 points shy 
of 10,000. It settled with a loss of 21.09 points at 9,876.35, or 
123.65 points below the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	But one financial table, based on theoretical calculations and  
appearing in many newspapers, will show the Dow rising as high as 
10,042.58 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That table dates back to the days before computers made it  
possible to track every move of all 30 blue-chip stocks that make 
up the Dow industrials. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of listing the day's actual high and low of the Dow, the  
theoretical table simply takes the high trade and the low trade of 
the day for each component of average, regardless of when the 
trades took place, and uses those figures to compute the high and 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, the theoretical high will almost always be higher  
than the actual high, and the theoretical low lower than the actual 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened Friday. Not only was the theoretical high  
almost 84 points above the actual high, but the theoretical low of 
9,779.78 was more than 82 points below the actual low of 9,861.92. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press provides its members with both the actual  
and theoretical tables.

<HEADLINE> Wells Makes Debut for Blue Jays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells didn't care that this was an  
exhibition game at Dunedin Stadium as opposed to the World Series 
at sold-out Yankee Stadium. Just getting back on the mound was 
enough to excite the Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells pitched one perfect inning of relief in his first outing  
of the year as the Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
7-5 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The adrenaline was pumping out there,'' said Wells, who was  
traded from the World Series champion New York Yankees to Toronto 
last month for Roger Clemens. ``It doesn't matter if its preseason 
or postseason. The butterflies are there anytime you face major 
league hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells threw only 11 pitches in the sixth inning, retiring Ivan  
Cruz on a grounder to second, striking out Brant Brown and getting 
Al Martin on a weak popup to short. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to be out there all day,'' he said. ``My  
philosophy has always been strike one, strike two and whatever 
happens, happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells threw seven strikes, mixing in a few breaking pitches with  
a fastball that topped out at 92 mph. His first couple of pitches 
to Cruz were up in the strike zone, but he quickly settled down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally you don't see David work that high in the strike  
zone, but the adrenaline was pumping,'' pitching coach Mel Queen 
said. ``He was excited. Overall, it was a good outing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells' return to the Blue Jays was delayed by back spasms that  
sidelined him for five days earlier this month. He will throw on 
the side Monday and the Blue Jays plan to start him against the 
Phillies Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back feels fine,'' he said. ``There was a little cringe in  
my side when I followed through. I felt a pinch a couple of times, 
but hopefully it's not too big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who has always been a Yankees fan, became a star in New  
York by pitching a perfect game against Minnesota last May. After 
last month's trade, he went into hiding for a few days before 
reporting to Blue Jays camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, he said his heart was still with the Yankees. That  
was especially true this week when manager Joe Torre said he had 
prostate cancer, Darryl Strawberry returned from cancer and Joe 
DiMaggio died. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wonder why this stuff always seems to happen to the  
Yankees,'' Wells said. ``It always seems to happen to good guys. 
Darryl overcame one of the worst things that can happen to you. Joe 
(Torre) will do the same. He's a fighter. My heart goes out to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays starter Pat Hentgen pitched five innings, allowing  
four hits, including a three-run homer by Cruz in the third. The 
Pirates added four runs in the eighth off loser Steve Sinclair on a 
two-run homer by Freddy Garcia and a two-run double by Doug 
Strange. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates starter Pete Schourek pitched five innings, allowing  
five hits and two runs. Scott Sauerbeck pitched one inning for the 
win and Todd Van Poppel pitched the ninth for the save. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Former Blue Jay Ed Sprague, who called Toronto manager Tim  
Johnson ``a backstabber'' earlier this week and said he should be 
fired, did not make the trip with the Pirates. ... The Blue Jays 
reassigned RHP Mike Gordon to minor league camp. ... Monday is At 
Par Day at Dunedin Stadium, with the Blue Jays accepting Canadian 
dollars at the same rate as U.S. money. Currently, a Canadian 
dollar is worth about 65 cents.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sen. Mack Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Now that he's not seeking a third term,  
Sen. Connie Mack said today he is ready to begin a new life outside 
of politics when he leaves office in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's natural for someone approaching the age of 60 ... to say  
`OK, where do I go with the rest of my life?''' said Mack, 58, a 
Republican who was first elected to the Senate in 1988 after 
serving six years in the U.S. House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack made his resignation official Saturday; the Associated  
Press reported earlier this month that he intended to retire. Mack 
said his only specific plan for the future is to finish out his 
term. After that, he will wait to see what grabs his interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack made his announcement before about 150 supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	The future will not include a run for another office, even if he  
is asked to join a bid for the White House, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking for being on anyone's ticket,'' Mack said.  
``My political career has two more years to go. I will not seek 
another office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His decision is expected to generate a stampede to replace him,  
with a handful of Republicans and Democrats already considering a 
run.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Comp. Payments Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Workers' compensation benefits and costs  
declined between 1995 and 1996, continuing a four-year trend, the 
National Academy of Social Insurance reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its survey of state-run workers' compensation programs, the  
academy found payments declined 2.4 percent from $43.4 billion in 
1995 to $42.4 billion in 1996. These benefit payments include cash 
benefits that partially replace lost wages and medical care for 
workers with job-related injuries or illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs to employers, such as premiums they pay for insurance  
and the cost of administering benefits by self-insured employers, 
dropped by 3.3 percent. In 1996, these costs fell to $55.2 billion 
from $57 billion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say several factors account for the fall in benefits and  
costs. In response to rapid increases in workers' compensation 
payments during the late 1980s and early 1990s, employers placed 
greater emphasis on safety, said Daniel Mont, a senior research 
associate at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helped work-related injury and illness rates on the job  
go down,'' Mont said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers also increasingly began using managed care for  
workers' compensation and improved the management of disability 
cases, he said. And at the same time, many states tightened their 
compensation and benefit levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers are not getting the same levels of benefits,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers' compensation benefit payments peaked in 1992 at $45.2  
billion. Employer costs associated with the programs peaked in 1993 
at $60.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Each state has its own workers' compensation program. They  
differ in terms of benefits, financing, administration and 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, benefits paid for medical care totaled about 41  
percent or $16.8 billion of all payments. Cash benefits to replace 
lost wages accounted for the other 59 percent or $25.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Beyond Dow 10,000 Is Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow 10,000 is pretty much a slam dunk; it's what  
could come after that is far less sure. The blue-chip index never 
did make it to five digits this past week, but many analysts are 
convinced it's just a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow average ended 21.09 points lower at 9,876.35.  
But it gained 140.27 for the week and hit two record highs, the 
latest on Thursday at 9,897.44. It ended 123.65 points shy of 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The market is being propelled by an extraordinary confluence of  
powerful forces that economists assume won't last forever -- 
sustained U.S. economic growth, low inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The trick of investing, of course, is to try to anticipate which  
trends that support the market will fade and when, and what will 
replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no magic in numbers (like 10,000),'' said Robert  
Heisterberg, market analyst at Alliance Capital Management in San 
Francisco. ``You still have to look at the fundamentals and 
determine, stock by stock, what you're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bull market was born in the early 1990's along with a  
technological revolution that would make corporations more 
productive, spark growth, and keep inflation -- and therefore 
interest rates -- low. 
</P>
<P>
	Low rates boosted stocks in other ways. They kept the returns on  
bonds so low that investors had to choose stocks over bonds if they 
wanted a decent return. They kept corporate costs down and profits 
stable. And they kept American consumers spending, which fed 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Added to that were very low prices on commodities, especially  
oil, which didn't help places like Texas and Oklahoma, but 
certainly helped keep inflation at bay across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an exceptional decline in oil prices and mortgages,  
which provided a bonanza for consumers' spending and psychology,'' 
said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets 
Group in Charlotte, N.C. ``That provided the superburner under the 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although profits of some U.S. exporters have suffered as a  
result of severe economic downturns overseas, the market has 
actually benefited in some ways. Cheaper imports to the United 
States have helped keep inflation and interest rates down. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of all of this is the Internet, which added demand for  
stocks as thousands of people began buying and selling shares from 
their living rooms for $5 a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet also added to the supply of stocks, as corporations  
-- many of the same ones that were making online trading possible -- 
went public by issuing stock, which hyped the market even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations around the world sold a total of $237 trillion  
worth of stock in initial public offerings since 1992, including 
5.69 trillion so far this year, according to Securities Data Co. 
</P>
<P>
	So what could hurt stocks in the future?  
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have already started to rise. So far that has only  
boosted oil stocks, but if it keeps up, it's bound to be 
inflationary, and that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates and stamp out the roaring stock market, warned J. 
Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings were flat last year, largely due to less  
demand overseas. For the Dow to maintain its upward momentum, 
profits will have to head back up, said Barbara Marcin, senior 
portfolio manager at Citibank Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	That isn't likely if this Friday is any indication. The market  
stumbled after Oracle and Microsoft warned of disappointing sales 
and Caterpillar said its profits were suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	If earnings flop, then stock prices won't hold up, either, said  
Richard Jaindrain, chief investment officer for equity securities 
at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The future for U.S. exporters seems mixed. The Asian and  
Brazilian economic crises appear to be improving, but Eastern 
Europe hasn't jelled, and Western Europe appears to be headed for 
some rough sailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of good and lucky,'' Orr said. ``Is the  
United States really that much better than the rest of the world, 
or have we just been luckier? What I would say is, both, but the 
luckier parts, like lower oil prices and the paradoxical benefits 
of Asia's collapse, probably will not stay with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Nasdaq composite index fell 30.72 to 2,381.53, up  
44.42 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.09 to 1,294.59, after hitting  
two record highs last week, the final one on Thursday at 1,297.68. 
The S&AMP;P gained 19.12 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.13 to 611.54, adding 8.4 for the  
week. The American Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.44 to 
721.21 but was up 13.8 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.70 to 398.38,  
but added 0.37 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire 5000 index ended the day at $11.87 trillion, up  
from $11.6 trillion the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Wins Cracker Barrel Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- In qualifying, the one thing a driver  
doesn't want to be in his race car is too comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``To qualify well, you've got to be right on the edge,'' said  
Bobby Labonte, who kept his Pontiac right on the fine line Friday 
to win his second straight Winston Cup pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who took the top qualifying spot a week earlier in Las  
Vegas, turned a lap of 194.957 mph on Friday. That was good enough 
to grab the pole for Sunday's Cracker Barrel 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turns one and two were great,'' he said in describing his  
pole-winning lap on the fast 1.54-mile oval. ``In three and four, 
exiting the corner, I was using up more racetrack than I was 
wanting to. It got my attention. I was right on the edge, but that 
was a little too much on the edge in turn four as far as comfort. 
It's not supposed to be comfortable, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who has 15 career poles, has become one of the best and  
most consistent qualifiers on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be the other way around,'' he said. ``My dad used  
to chew me out because I wouldn't qualify worth a darn in the Busch 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has made the difference for the 34-year-old Labonte, in his  
seventh season on NASCAR's top circuit, is maturity and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just about what your equipment is and what you're  
confident with,'' Labonte said. ``This is one of the fastest tracks 
we run on and you've just got to have confidence in those guys who 
work on your race car and what they do to your race car. You can't 
be second-guessing what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte has plenty of confidence heading into the race at a  
track where he has won three of the last five Winston Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we thought we were headed in the right direction  
with the Pontiacs,'' he said. ``Then NASCAR came out with the new 
spoiler and air dam rule and I think that helped us. It helped make 
the racing part better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now all the racing models can race a little bit closer and a  
little bit harder. We can do more competitive racing now. The 
Pontiacs are not hurting for anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Skinner, the surprise of the season so far, took the  
outside spot on the front row with a lap of 194.226 in a Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really thought we'd have a shot at it today,'' said Skinner,  
who has two fourths and a sixth this season and is leading the 
standings by 51 points over Rusty Wallace. ``I'd have liked to have 
put a Chevy on the pole at this track, but we're just trying to 
qualify good, keep the fenders on the race car and keep clicking 
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner bumped Tony Stewart, Labonte's teammate at Joe Gibbs  
Racing, off the front row. The rookie will start third after 
qualifying at 194.192. He was followed by the Fords of Dale Jarrett 
at 193.643 and Jeremy Mayfield at 193.239. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were the Chevy of Geoffrey Bodine at  
193.177, the Pontiac of rookie Buckshot Jones at 192.654, the 
Chevys two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon at 
192.594 and Joe Nemechek at 192.386 and the Pontiac of John 
Andretti, last year's pole-winner, at 192.306. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 qualifiers on Friday nailed down spots in the 43-car  
race field, with the rest of the lineup to be determined following 
further qualifying today. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers who will have to choose whether to stand on  
their first-day lap or try again were seven-time Winston Cup 
champion Dale Earnhardt, who was 30th; Las Vegas winner Jeff 
Burton, who was 33rd; and three-time series champ Darrell Waltrip, 
who qualified 45th.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Org Names Ex-Vatican Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Raymond L. Flynn, the former mayor of Boston and  
U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, is taking a new job as head of a 
national Catholic political organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Wednesday, Flynn will head the Catholic Alliance, a  
nonpartisan political action group for Catholic voters that was 
founded in 1995 as a branch of the conservative Christian 
Coalition. It is based in Oakton, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's doing what I believe in and what is consistent with the  
social justice position of the Catholic Church,'' Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn's job will be to encourage Catholics to participate in  
politics and provide a voice for what he termed ``working-class 
Americans'' on issues of social welfare, economic parity and 
opposition to abortion and euthanasia, he said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which claims 125,000 members, broke from the  
Christian Coalition two years ago. Its former president, Keith 
Fournier, recently stepped down and board members elected Flynn 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn, a Democrat, was mayor from 1984 to 1993. He was U.S.  
ambassador to the Vatican from 1993 until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to  
the House seat vacated by former U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, 
D-Mass. Flynn said his opposition to abortion played a role in his 
loss in that race to Michael Capuano, who won the general election.

	DENVER (AP) -- Two years ago, Jess Settles could barely get out

	Settles averaged 15 points in each of his first three seasons  
with Iowa and nearly jumped to the NBA before back problems 
sidelined him for all but three games of the 1996-97 season and all 
of 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Still hungry to play, Settles was granted a medical hardship  
last fall, and he gradually worked his way into the starting 
lineup. His 17 points in Iowa's first-round victory over 
Alabama-Birmingham in the NCAA West Regional reminded people why he 
was a three-time all-Big Ten selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I'd get that second chance,'' Settles said.  
``You always dream as a kid of playing college basketball. I 
probably took it for granted. I just thank God for the second 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His longevity has made Settles easy fodder for his teammates,  
some of whom watched him playing for Iowa while they were still in 
junior high. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of rumors going around on how old he is,''  
junior Jacob Jaacks said. ``We call him 30-something like that old 
TV show. It's kind of like your mom or your grandma. You don't want 
to ask him what his age is. You might offend him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Settles is 24, and he's treating his sixth  
season with the Hawkeyes like it was his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed basketball a whole lot more back then,'' he said. ``I  
was such a driven person trying to maximize my potential. To have 
it taken away from you, you're forced basically to deal with 
reality. I'm a lot more thankful. I'm as driven, but I don't need 
it as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson remembers Settles as a talented  
sophomore on a team that the Razorbacks beat 101-92 in the 
championship game of the 1994 Rainbow Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great player,'' Richardson said. ``I remember him  
playing against our (defending) national championship team, so he's 
been around for a long, long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While fourth-seeded Arkansas (23-10) and No. 5 seed Iowa (19-9)  
get reacquainted in the first of two games at McNichols Arena, 
ninth-seeded New Mexico (25-8) will try to derail top-seeded 
Connecticut (29-2). 
</P>
<P>
	It's a daunting task that Lobos coach Dave Bliss couldn't  
envision while watching Connecticut dismantle St. John's in the 
championship game of the Big East tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The start of the St. John's game is the most impressive 10  
minutes in college basketball I've seen this year,'' Bliss said 
Friday. ``If I'd have known we were going to have to play against 
them, I'd have thrown up on the spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun knows the feeling. He missed the  
Huskies' first-round victory with virus-like symptoms, but hoped to 
return to the bench today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just need to get a little more rest,'' Calhoun said Friday.  
``I'm going to get another shot so I can sleep a little better, but 
obviously I plan to be here at 12 o'clock to face a good New Mexico 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico is in the NCAA tournament for the seventh time in the  
last nine years, but will be playing a No. 1 seed for the first 
time. The Lobos aren't given much of a chance of beating the 
heavily favored Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably play at the fastest speed of any team in the  
country,'' Bliss said. ``They have some very high-profile stars and 
they are on a mission to accomplish what a lot of very good teams 
try to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be reaching the Final Four -- the only missing piece  
on a resume that in the '90s has been one of college basketball's 
most impressive. Connecticut has made three trips to the round of 
eight (1990, 1995, 1998) and three other times reached the round of 
16 (1991, 1994, 1996). 
</P>
<P>
	``With this team, we've been through the hard times,'' point  
guard Khalid El-Amin said. ``We're a lot more mature than last 
year. Once we play the way we're capable of playing, the Final Four 
should take care of itself.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Victims Sue Culkin's Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two survivors of a deadly high-rise fire that  
started in the home of Macauley Culkin's mother are suing for $20 
million each and the mother of a woman who died wants $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Percansky, 36, and her sister, Romy, 27, residents of the  
40th floor of the 51-story Manhattan building, made it down to the 
30th floor during the fire. A neighbor then pulled them into his 
apartment, where they waited to be rescued on an open-air terrace. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they walked down, they were literally tripping over people  
who were passed out in the stairwell,'' said their lawyer, Lawrence 
Wilson. ``Psychologically, it was very traumatic for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also suing Culkin's mother and the building's owners in the  
joint filing is Sarah B. Chappell of Gates, N.C., whose daughter 
Wanda, 40, died in the Dec. 23 fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which killed four, started in one of two 19th-floor  
apartments occupied by Culkin children and their mother, Patricia 
Brentrup. The lawsuit accused Brentrup of negligence for allegedly 
leaving the door ajar as she fled the burning apartment, allowing 
smoke to fill spread through the building.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes Outside N.C. Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A bomb planted outside an abortion clinic  
exploded Saturday, causing no injuries and little damage because it 
detonated only partially. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic, less than 75 miles from the mountainous area where  
serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph is believed to be hiding, 
received no advance warning of the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about a possible link between the explosion and  
Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage, we 
don't discount anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police initially said two bombs had been planted at the Femcare  
clinic, but the FBI determined that a second device found in the 
vicinity was actually a piece of the exploded bomb. However, FBI 
spokeswoman Joanne Morley said the second device had the potential 
to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb had been placed outside the clinic, next to a wall near  
where the waiting room is located, Asheville Police Chief Will 
Annarino said. It went off at about a half-hour before the clinic 
was to open at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared to be a very large device,'' Annarino said. ``I  
really can't get into how large it is right now. But it appears it 
could have caused a lot of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homes and businesses near the building were evacuated and police  
cordoned off the road around the Orange Street clinic in a 
neighborhood several blocks from downtown Asheville. More residents 
were evacuated when the second device was found. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI and Asheville bomb teams disarmed what was left of the bomb.  
Investigators would not elaborate on the makeup of the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that  
received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium 
anthrax. Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Annarino said it was premature to discuss whether the package  
and the explosion are related. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in Little Rock, Ark., said he was deeply  
disturbed to learn about the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that the perpetrators of this terrible act will  
be brought to justice,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been a fugitive since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of  
a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty 
policeman and severely wounded a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three  
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that 
killed one person. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Clinton administration said it plans to seek  
$4.5 million for alarm systems and closed-circuit camera systems to 
protect abortion clinics to counter violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also would be used to determine which clinics were  
most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Prediction Sets Tone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield boxed himself into a corner  
even before he and Lennox Lewis enter the ring to unify the 
heavyweight title tonight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield put himself there with a promise of a third-round  
knockout -- and a claim that he has no backup plan if his prophecy 
doesn't come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a Plan B, so Plan A has to work,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Holyfield finds Lewis still standing after the bell sounds to  
end the third round of the scheduled 12-round fight, he'll have 
only a minute or so to figure out what to do the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't seem terribly concerned that will happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking Lennox down. Lennox is good,'' Holyfield said.  
``You have the best of the best in this fight. Because you have the 
best of the best, a knockout has to take place. When you have two 
people truly trying to win, somebody is going to get knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield risks his WBA and IBF versions of the heavyweight  
title when he meets Lewis, holder of the WBC crown. The first 
unification of the sport's most prized crown will take place 
sometime around 11:30 p.m. EST before a sellout crowd of some 
20,000 people who paid anywhere from $100 to $1,500 for the right 
to witness a slice of history. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, though, will need some cooperation from Lewis to  
fulfill his promise of ending the fight in the third round. That's 
what happened when Holyfield beat James ``Buster'' Douglas in 
October 1990 to capture the undisputed title, and it happened again 
later when Tyson bit him in the same round. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts) will enter the ring with  
``Warrior'' stitched across the front of his trunks, Lewis has been 
more of a reluctant warrior at times. He might decide to fight 
cautiously early, hoping to catch Holyfield in the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you can hit somebody is when they're trying to  
hit you,'' Holyfield conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis will bring a big physical presence into the fight that  
will likely define a career that has been noted so far more for the 
fights he has missed out on than the ones he has been involved in. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis stands 6-foot-5 and weighed 246 pounds at Thursday's  
weigh-in, 31 more than Holyfield, who has always had problems with 
bigger heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holyfield has fought -- and beaten -- the best of his era,  
winning fights with Mike Tyson, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, 
George Foreman and Larry Holmes. A look at the record of Lewis 
(34-1, 27 knockouts) reveals the likes of Oliver McCall, Henry 
Akinwande and Andrew Golota at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fight that has been eluding me a long time,'' said  
the 33-year-old Lewis, who won an Olympic gold medal for Canada in 
the 1988 Olympics, but claims British residency. ``It will be a 
great fight for me to make a mark and prove that I'm the best 
heavyweight on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a purely physical level the fight could turn on Holyfield's  
ability to get inside on Lewis, who possesses a heavy and active 
left jab, and Lewis' chances of landing his big right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But what might be the key to the fight is which fighter can  
answer the questions posed of him. In Holyfield's case, it is his 
relatively advanced age of 36, which showed in a lackluster 
decision over Vaughn Bean his last time out. For Lewis, it is 
whether he has it inside of him to brawl with and beat one of the 
best heavyweights around. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare they question my heart,'' Lewis said. ``Evander  
Holyfield doesn't have the monopoly on hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield will make $20 million for the fight, bringing his  
earnings in four fights since upsetting Tyson in their first bout 
to some $80 million. Lewis will get $10 million for the chance to 
establish himself as the biggest heavyweight in town. 
</P>
<P>
	On the undercard, James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of Pittsburg,  
Calif., will defend the WBA welterweight title against Sam Garr 
(25-2, 23 knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.; and Fernando Vargas 
(15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will defend the IBF junior 
middleweight title against Howard Clarke (26-10-2, 8 knockouts) of 
England.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Wins Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Vicar did it again, this time nosing out  
Wondertross at the wire after a thrilling four-horse stretch duel 
to win the $750,000 Florida Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, Vicar led from the start and held off Cat Thief  
by a neck to win the Fountain of Youth Stakes. In the Florida 
Derby, Vicar grabbed the lead at the top of the stretch and 
withstood a gallant charge by Wondertross, as well as challenges 
from Cat Thief and Certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar stamped himself as the top 3-year-old in the East, with  
his next start scheduled for the Blue Grass Stakes on April 10 
before heading to Churchill Downs for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, ridden by Shane Sellers, would be trainer Carl Nafzger's  
second Kentucky Derby horse. His first, Unbridled, won the 1990 
Derby after also winning the Florida Derby. Sellers also won the 
'98 Florida Derby, with Cape Town, who was declared the win after 
Lil's Lad was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Sent off as the co-second choice at 9-2 by the crowd of 29,558,  
Vicar stayed just off the pace in the 1 1/8-mile race. Cat Thief, 
ridden by Pat Day, held the lead into the far turn, but Vicar made 
his move heading into the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	As Vicar moved to the middle of the track holding a slight lead,  
he had Cat Thief and Certain on the inside and Wondertross flying 
into contention on the outside. But when Sellers asked Vicar for an 
extra effort, he got it. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, owned by James Tafel, covered the distance in a slow 1:50  
2-5, and boosted his record to four victories and a second in six 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	His only poor outing was a dull fifth in the Holy Bull Stakes on  
Jan. 16. Three days after that race, Vicar underwent minor throat 
surgery to correct a breathing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, a son of Wild Rush, returned $11.20, $6.20 and $3.20.  
Wondertross, trained by Nick Zito, paid $5.60 and $3.40. Cat Thief, 
trained by D. Wayne Lukas, went off as the 9-5 favorite and paid 
$2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three finishers all have Kentucky Derby winning  
trainers. Zito has two Derby wins, with Strike the Gold and Go for 
Gin, and Lukas has three in Winning Colors, Grindstone and Thunder 
Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain, third in the Fountain of Youth, was fourth, followed by  
First American, Adonis, Aly's Alley, Casanova Star, Grits'n Hard 
Toast and Valid Trefaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar collected $450,000, boosting his career earnings to  
$670,756. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Three Ring was scratched.  
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's Fair Grounds Oaks at New Orleans, trainer Bob  
Baffert's Silverbulletday cruised to a four-length victory over 
Runaway Venus to keep her Kentucky Derby hopes alive. 
Silverbulletday, with Gary Stevens aboard, covered 1 1-16 miles in 
1:44 2-5 over a sloppy track. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier stakes races at Gulfstream: Garbu, trained by Bill  
Mott and ridden by Jerry Bailey, beat favored Wild Event by 3 3/4 
lengths to take the $100,000 Fort Lauderdale Handicap in course 
record time of 1:39 1-5 for 1 1-16 miles; Yes It's True beat Texas 
Glitter by a head in the $100,000 Swale Stakes for 3-year-olds; and 
Jazz Club won the $75,000 Creme Fraiche Handicap.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Men's Basketball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Once again, a highly seeded Arizona team was knocked out in the  
first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Humphrey's tip-in with 21 seconds left lifted Oklahoma over  
the fourth-seeded Wildcats 61-60 Friday at the Midwest Regional in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Arizona's fourth opening-round loss this decade to a big  
underdog. The Wildcats won the national title in 1997, but lost in 
the opening round as a No. 3 seed in 1992, No. 2 seed in 1993 and 
No. 5 seed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make one thing clear: This group of seniors is 11-3  
in the NCAA tournament,'' coach Lute Olson said. ``They can't do 
anything about what happened eight years ago or four years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was confusion about the winning basket.  
</P>
<P>
	After Eric Martin missed a 3-pointer for 13th-seeded Oklahoma  
(21-10), Eduardo Najera followed with a layup attempt. While Najera 
says his shot was good, Humphrey admits he got a hand on it, and it 
was Humphrey who got credit for the basket in the official 
play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was coming out and I might have had a fingertip on it,''  
Humphrey said. ``As long as we won, that's the only thing that 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Jason Terry thought Humphrey touched the ball on the  
rim and should have been called for offensive goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did touch the ball, but that's just something that  
happens,'' Terry said. ``It was definitely goaltending, but it 
wasn't called, so I guess not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (22-7) had a final chance, but Terry missed a fallaway  
10-footer with three seconds left. Richard Jefferson then missed a 
tip-in, got the rebound and missed another shot as he fell in the 
lane at the buzzer.

a chance to set up for a potential game-winning shot. The Huskies

Aces' high-scoring offense in the second half. Evansville hit only 
37 percent from the field after halftime, including 4-of-16 from

</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (33-1) shot 66 percent in the first half and  
extended their school-record winning streak to 28. Florida A&AMP;M 
(12-19) was the only squad in the 64-team field with a losing 
record. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Tulsa 62, Charleston 53    	
</P>
<P>
	The College of Charleston's string of 25 consecutive victories  
came to an end, with Tulsa building a 26-point lead, then holding 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Hurricane (23-9) turned it over on six consecutive  
possessions, helping fuel a 25-1 run by Charleston that cut the 
Cougars' deficit to 53-51 with 3:20 left before Tulsa steadied 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ruffin, Brandon Kurtz and Tony Heard had 11 points  
apiece for the Golden Hurricane. Sedric Webber had 15 points for 
Charleston (28-3). 
</P>
<P>
                      *Tennessee 62, Delaware 52    	
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee overcame a miserable offensive start to win its first  
NCAA tournament game in 16 years and snap Delaware's 13-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was an offensive nightmare for both clubs. Neither team  
shot better than 33 percent and they combined for 37 turnovers. 
Tennessee (21-8) missed 17 of its first 20 shots, but managed to 
win its first NCAA tourney game since 1983 because Delaware (25-6) 
shot a season-low 28.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
                   *SW Missouri St. 43, Wisconsin 32    	
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri State held Wisconsin to the lowest point  
total in an NCAA tournament game since the introduction of the shot 
clock in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Moore had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Bears,  
(21-10), who got their first victory ever against a Big Ten team 
and their first NCAA tournament victory since 1987. Wisconsin 
(22-10) scored only 12 points in the first half and shot 26 percent 
from the field for the game. 
</P>
<P>
                             *At Boston    	
</P>
<P>
                         *Purdue 58, Texas 54    	
</P>
<P>
	Low-scoring Cameron Stephens hit a jumper with 4.8 seconds  
remaining as Purdue overcame a strong game by 7-foot Chris Mihm, 
who had 21 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens, averaging just 3.3 points, took a pass from Tony  
Mayfield and made just his second basket of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenth-seeded Purdue (20-12), which had lost five of its previous  
six games, got 18 points from Jaraan Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Cincinnati 72, George Mason 48    	
</P>
<P>
	Pete Mickeal scored 18 points and Cincinnati held George Mason  
to its worst shooting game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (27-5) took control over the last 10 minutes of the  
first half, using a 26-6 run to take a 41-17 lead. Jason Miskiri 
scored 13 points for George Mason (19-11), which had its 10-game 
winning streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Temple 61, Kent 54    	
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed Brokenborough and Pepe Sanchez each scored 15 points as  
Temple beat Kent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Owls (22-10), playing in their 10th straight NCAA  
tournament, took control with a 17-2 run that gave them a 50-33 
lead with 10:22 left. Kent (23-7), playing in its first NCAA 
tournament, was led by John Whorton's 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Miami 75, Lafayette 54    	
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Hemsley had nine 3-pointers and 31 points to lead Miami  
to its first NCAA tournament victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes (23-6) lost their two other NCAA games, in 1960  
and last season. Hemsley finished two 3-pointers shy of the 
tournament record set by Jeff Fryer of Loyola Marymount against 
Michigan in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Upset Focuses Ohio State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- There's going to be a reunion when Detroit  
and Ohio State clash in the second round of the NCAA South 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Ohio State starters -- Ken Johnson and Jason Singleton -- are  
from Detroit. Both were unsuccessfully recruited by Detroit coach 
Perry Watson, who has four starters from the Motor City. 
</P>
<P>
	Jermaine Jackson, the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Player of  
the Year, was Johnson's host on a recruiting visit to Detroit. When 
he learned Johnson wanted to go to a larger Big Ten school and 
attend school away from his hometown, Jackson said that their teams 
would meet someday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today is that day, and a trip to Knoxville, Tenn., for the  
regional semifinals will be on the line in the RCA Dome when 
fourth-seeded Ohio State (24-8) seeks to uphold the prestige of the 
Big Ten against 12th-seeded Detroit (25-5) of the lightly regarded 
MCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninth-seeded Oklahoma State (23-10) plays top-seeded Auburn  
(28-3) in today's other second-round game. Today's winners will 
clash in the regional semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Johnson is a far different player than the one  
Watson attempted to recruit. He finished second in the Big Ten in 
blocked shots and added five to his season total in Thursday's 
72-58 victory over Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my life, I was told I was a project,'' he said. ``I was  
tired of it. I went out to work on my game to prove I'm a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was a teammate of Singleton on an AAU team one summer,  
and Singleton's school, Southgate Aquinas, is near Detroit 
Southwestern, where Watson coached for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson's team has produced an upset in the opening round of the  
tournament two consecutive years. Last year, the Titans ousted St. 
John's and then lost to Purdue of the Big Ten. This year, Detroit 
eliminated 11-time national champion UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson doesn't anticipate his team will be in awe of playing a  
Big Ten team. He says they've prepared for the physical game in 
summer workouts that include competing with NBA players from the 
area like Jalen Rose, Grant Hill, Jerry Stackhouse, Robert Traylor 
and Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing about city kids, especially in our situation,''  
Watson said. ``They're not intimidated by playing against anybody. 
Playing with those guys -- not saying they beat them or anything -- 
but at least they get a chance to compete against them. We're 
willing to play anybody anywhere, and we've done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Detroit beat Big Ten champion Michigan State three  
consecutive years until the Titans came off the Spartans' schedule 
for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Oklahoma State has no problem being cast as the  
underdog against Auburn, ranked No. 4 in the final Associated Press 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of like the role,'' guard Adrian Peterson said Friday.  
``It makes you go out and play loose, like to have nothing to lose. 
... Auburn, there is a team that has everything to lose, being the 
No. 1 seed. It's the kind of a role you can get some positive 
things out of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson's coach Eddie Sutton isn't certain about that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little surprised when I saw how much we were the  
underdog,'' Sutton said. ``But I can understand why after looking 
at them on film. Auburn is a terrific basketball team. We have a 
big task ahead of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys will have to slow down Auburn to produce the upset.  
The Tigers are averaging 81.8 points, and they're no slouches on 
defense, having produced an average of more than 20 turnovers per 
game while holding opponents to 60.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've played a team as athletic as Auburn is or  
who thrives off its press like Auburn does,'' Peterson said. 
``We've played teams that press 40 or 50 percent of the game, but 
Auburn presses just about the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton's teams play more of a halfcourt game and will likely try  
to slow the game down. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they slow it down, we are going to have to execute on both  
ends of the floor,'' Auburn guard Doc Robinson said. ``We like to 
play up-tempo, but we feel we can be a pretty good halfcourt team, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get into the NCAA tournament, every team is good or  
they wouldn't be here,'' said Sutton, who is in the tournament as a 
coach for the 18th time since 1974 and is 10th on the tournament 
victory list with 29. ``Somebody has to be a favorite and somebody 
has to be the underdog.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Exits Early Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Arizona coach Lute Olson doesn't want seniors  
A.J. Bramlett and Jason Terry getting stuck with the same ``early 
exit'' tag that so many of his Wildcats carried for their NCAA 
misadventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make one thing clear: This group of seniors is 11-3  
in the NCAA tournament,'' Olson said after the fourth-seeded 
Wildcats were upset 61-60 by 13th-seeded Oklahoma on Friday. ``They 
can't do anything about what happened eight years ago or four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``These seniors have given us 11 wins and three losses. Most  
programs across the country would be happy with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Wildcats have made a habit of getting knocked out early.  
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma (21-10) will play fifth-seeded North Carolina-Charlotte  
(23-10) in the second round. The fifth-seeded 49ers defeated 
12th-seeded Rhode Island 81-70 in overtime earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seed Michigan State (30-4), which survived a sluggish start  
to rout Mount St. Mary's 76-53, the Spartans' 19th straight win, 
plays Ole Miss on Sunday at the Bradley Center. The short and 
speedy Rebels (20-12) beat Villanova 72-70 for their third straight 
20-win season, a first in the program's 89-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Four times in the 1990s, the Wildcats have strutted into the  
NCAA tournament as one of the top five seeds. And four times 
they've been sent packing in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest one might be the toughest to swallow, though.  
Oklahoma's 61-60 upset came on a tip-in with 21 seconds left that 
may or may not have been offensive goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	After Eric Martin missed a 3-pointer for Oklahoma (21-10),  
Eduardo Najera followed with a layup attempt. While Najera says his 
shot was good, Ryan Humphrey admits he got a hand on it, and it was 
Humphrey who got credit for the basket in the official 
play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I made the shot,'' said Najera, who led the Sooners  
with 17 points and 13 rebounds. ``It doesn't matter who touched it. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that matters is we won.''  
</P>
<P>
	And that the Wildcats (22-7) lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Arizona had one last chance to win the game, but Terry missed a  
fallaway 10-footer with about three seconds left. Then complete 
chaos set in. Freshman Richard Jefferson missed a one-handed 
tip-in, got the rebound and missed another shot as he fell in the 
lane at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put it in the hands of the guy that got us here,'' Olson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners -- the last at-large team to get a bid -- stormed the  
court, hugging each other and jumping around. Terry, the Pac-10 
player of the year, was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely disbelief,'' said Terry, who scored 15  
points. ``The last couple of seconds, I was reminiscing about all 
the good days. Today wasn't one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite winning a national title in 1997, there haven't been  
many good days in the first round for the Wildcats. They lost their 
first game as the No. 3 seed in 1992, No. 2 seed in 1993 and No. 5 
seed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Wildcats have been in the tournament every year  
since 1985, they've failed to get out of the first round seven 
times during that span. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe we went out like this,'' Terry said. ``I'm  
still thinking like we've got practice tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to go out this way,'' Bramlett agreed. ``But we  
played our hearts out, right down to the last second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Spartans started sluggish and finished sloppy.  
But in between they displayed enough talent to keep Mount St. 
Mary's, the smallest school in the NCAA tournament, from pulling 
off the biggest upset. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans won despite getting just eight points from  
All-American point guard Mateen Cleaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount St. Mary's (15-15), a school of 1,309 students in central  
Maryland -- or 32 times smaller than Michigan State -- stayed with 
the Spartans until Cleaves scored his first points with 7:25 left 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came out and made some big shots,'' Cleaves said. ``We  
didn't take them lightly, they just played well early. We knew if 
we wanted to pull away from them, we had to step up our defense.''	   They did, outrebounding the Mountaineers 46-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't sharp early, but there was a little nervousness,''  
Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. ``I've been saying all year there are 
new things we need to learn how to handle and deal with. I'm sure 
being a No. 1 seed was one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina-Charlotte overcame yet another obstacle in a  
season of hurdles. The 49ers, who lost players to injury, illness 
and international paperwork problems this season, overcame Rhode 
Island and sophomore sensation Lamar Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a great job on me today,'' said Odom, who finished  
with 16 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Miss, which lost in the first round the last two seasons,  
had never won an NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really felt good to get that monkey off our back,'' senior  
guard Michael White said. ``When the buzzer went off it was a 
feeling of relief. It's a great feeling.''

<HEADLINE> Bordick Plans To Steal More Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Slick-fielding shortstop Mike  
Bordick added a new dimension to his game last year, recording 
career highs in homers and doubles while hitting a respectable 
.260. 
</P>
<P>
	This season he plans to do some damage with his legs, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Bordick spent a good deal of his offseason adhering to a  
torturous training program devised by Baltimore Orioles strength 
and conditioning coach Tim Bishop. Bordick was a regular at Camden 
Yards in January and February, spending hours each day working with 
weights and on the treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really focused on running this offseason,'' he said. ``Maybe  
I can help by stealing a few bases, scoring from second or going 
from first to third in a single. Hopefully I can give the team more 
speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results have been on full display this spring.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's in better shape and he's faster,'' Orioles manager Ray  
Miller noted. ``I expect him to be as good as he was last year, 
even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken's storied reign as Baltimore's shortstop ended when  
Bordick signed as a free agent before the 1997 season. He was 
acquired primarily because of his prowess in the field, and the 
Orioles figured any contribution Bordick made at the plate would be 
a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he gave them more than they bargained for. In  
addition to compiling a career-best .990 fielding percentage, 
second among AL shortstops behind Cleveland's Omar Vizquel, Bordick 
had 13 homers and 29 doubles. His 51 RBIs were three short of his 
career high. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, Bordick dispelled the notion that he's a  
one-dimensional player. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there's anything wrong with that.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to say what they want. As long as they say  
one good thing, I'm happy,'' Bordick said. ``My whole career, I've 
always felt that if I can't drive a run in, I can feel good about 
stopping a run from scoring. You take that approach, you're going 
to help your team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bordick, 33, spent the first seven years as a slap-hitter,  
spraying the ball the opposite way whenever possible. Last year he 
decided to take aim at left field when given an inside pitch to 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He never before hit two homers in a game, but last year he did  
it twice. Bordick didn't always go deep, though -- he led the AL 
with 15 sacrifice bunts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody wants to be a well-rounded player. I take  
pride in my defense and work hard at that, but I take pride in my 
offense, too,'' he said. ``I like bunting and setting things up for 
the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bordick is signed through this season, but if he reaches 500  
at-bats the Orioles will be obligated to sign him for the year 
2000. The point is moot; Bordick said he wants to finish his career 
in Baltimore, and Miller can't imagine what life would be like 
without having him in the middle of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously (shortstop Derek) Jeter and (Alex) Rodriguez get all  
the hype, but every manager you talk to will tell you Bordy is 
money in the bank. He just gets the outs for you. Plus, he's 
getting better and better offensively,'' Miller said. ``He can play 
for me as long as he wants.''

<HEADLINE> Heavyweights Return to the Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nothing quickens the pulse of Madison Square  
Garden quite like a heavyweight championship fight, and there was a 
rare air of extra electricity Saturday night for the Evander 
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis bout. 
</P>
<P>
	A celebrity-studded sellout crowd of 21,284, paying prices from  
$100 to $1,500, turned the Garden into the center of the boxing 
universe for the first time in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first undisputed heavyweight title fight at the arena  
since Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier in 1971, and the first sellout for a 
fight of any type in the big arena since Roberto Duran fought Davey 
Moore in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four hundred bucks will get you upstairs. Anything good  
downstairs, that's at least $1,500,'' a scalper said outside the 
``World's Most Famous Arena.'' There were plenty of takers, too, as 
would-be customers appeared to outnumber loose tickets by a wide 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, John F.  
Kennedy Jr., Jack Nicholson, Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump, Sean 
``Puffy'' Combs, Bill Parcells, Patrick Ewing, Spike Lee and 
Michael Douglas were among the celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	For each of them, there were legions of wannabees. Hipsters in  
thousand-dollar suits, glamorous women who turned dozens of heads 
at a time, actors and models complimenting each other on their 
looks. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the cell phone and business suit crowd that  
frequents Knicks and Rangers games. This was more of a cash crowd, 
the type of people that pull out diamond-studded money clips of 
$100 bills when buying their hot dogs and popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
	A large and vocal contingent of Brits were in attendance, too,  
having made the trip overseas to cheer on Lewis, a Jamaican who 
grew up in Canada and fights out of England. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the scalper ranks were speckled with a few fellows whose  
roots were closer to York than New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any spares?'' a man with a cockney accents asked, which earned  
him little but quizzical stares. 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Madison Square Garden were once synonymous with  
championship boxing, but that was decades ago when the old Garden 
was located 18 blocks uptown. In the years since, the casinos in 
Las Vegas and Atlantic City have monopolized the sport's biggest 
bouts because of the type of high-rolling crowd it attracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The gambling for this fight was kept underground since wagering  
on sports is illegal everywhere except Nevada. In Las Vegas, 
Holyfield was a slight favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the pre-fight hype recalled the 1971 Frazier-Ali fight,  
a classic that was photographed for Life magazine by Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're happy to get the opportunity to fight there,''  
Holyfield said of the Garden. ``That's how you become a part of 
what they call history.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- There was no doubting who were  
the most popular winners Saturday in final competition at the ISU 
Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheered on by a loud capacity crowd at their home Detroit  
Skating Club, Americans Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek capped 
an outstanding season by winning the dance championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Restencourt of France overtook Russians Ilia Klimkin and  
Alexei Vasilevsky to win the men's gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Viktoria Volchkova jumped from third to first among the  
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukranians Yulia Obertas and Dmitry Palamarchuk skated to the  
pairs title. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crowd came to see Silverstein and Pekarek, and they  
weren't disappointed. Probably skating as juniors for the last 
time, the duo added the Grand Prix title to the U.S. and world 
junior championships they already hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very relieved because we've had such a good season, and  
I didn't want to spoil anything,'' said Silverstein, 15. ``I was 
especially nervous for this because it was here, but it went 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pekarek, 17, said he felt relaxed through the entire weekend,  
especially once he and Silverstein led following Friday's 
compulsory and original dances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted a really good free dance to go out,'' Pekarek said.  
``The hometown crowd really helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both skaters said they were amazed at their improvement the past  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to just move up as much as we could,'' Pekarek  
said. ``This far exceeded our expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italians Federica Faiella and Luciana Milo finished second, and  
Natalia Romaniuta and Daniel Barantsev of Russia were third. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the last major international competition before the  
world championships begin March 22 in Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Klimkin and Vasilevsky were 1-2 after Friday's men's short  
program, but both fell in Saturday's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Restencourt also fell landing a jump, but still had the highest  
marks from all seven judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Klimkin and Restencourt had finished 1-2, respectively, at the  
world junior championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Volchkova, who finished third in this year's world and European  
championships, performed a flawless free skate to the theme from 
``Gone With The Wind'' and won the women's gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen-year-old Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., who will  
compete for the U.S. team in the world championships, held on to 
second place while reigning world junior champion Daria Timoshenko 
of Russia was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Irina Nikolaeva, who led after Friday's short program,  
fell four times in her free skate and finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Obertas and Palamarchuk added the Grand Prix pairs championship  
to the world junior crown they already hold. Americans Laura Handy 
and Paul Binnebose, second at the worlds, were runners-up again and 
Viktoria Maksiuta and Vladislav Zhovnirsky jumped from fourth to 
third.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Court Rejects Tax Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The Supreme Court of New Hampshire has  
blocked an effort to put an income tax proposal to the voters 
through a referendum, ruling that state lawmakers have to make the 
hard decision about enacting the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The court on Thursday blocked the attempt by Democratic Gov.  
Jeanne Shaheen to put two tax proposals to a public vote in a state 
famously intolerant of any broad-based taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the bill proposes an unconstitutional  
delegation of power from the Legislature,'' the court said. ``If 
the people are to say, by way of popular vote, whether or not an 
act shall become law, they are put in the place of the 
Legislature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire is one of only two states with no general sales  
tax, no state property tax and no income tax. Alaska is the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is under pressure to enact an income tax or a uniform  
statewide property tax because of an April 1 deadline by the 
Supreme Court to come up with a fairer way of paying for the 
state's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Republican-dominated House shocked the state by  
passing an income tax and sending the measure to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen had proposed leaving the decision up to the voters  
instead, with a referendum in which they could choose between an 
income tax and a package of taxes that would include a uniform 
statewide property tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that a referendum has been ruled out, Shaheen said an income  
tax is ``off the table'' as a possible solution.

<HEADLINE> Early Vote Lead May Not Be Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans have sent early campaign leaders  
to their presidential nominations more often than Democrats have, 
front-runner lore that points to the rewards and risks awaiting 
initial favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 2000 campaign, that means Texas Gov. George W. Bush and  
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Gore observed in discounting polls that rate both Bush  
and Elizabeth Dole ahead of him in a final contest for the White 
House, the 1999 surveys are predictions too far in advance to 
foretell the next election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls will not determine the outcome in any way,'' Gore told  
CNN. ``Ideas will.'' And money. In that crucial competition, the 
early polls do help leaders draw donors. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been six open contests, without incumbents running,  
for Republican nominations since 1960, and in four of them, the 
leaders in the early polls won the nomination. In six open 
Democratic campaigns, the pre-season front-runner won only once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press tracked the  
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	Two early Democratic leaders chose not to run, Mario Cuomo in  
1992, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in the 1976 competition. President 
Clinton and former President Carter won those nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others, in both parties, there are lessons that could  
apply this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie in 1972, for example. He was  
the towering early favorite, after a winning performance in a 
losing campaign for vice president. Muskie reaped Democratic 
endorsements, campaigned in a style tailored to an obvious winner 
who didn't want to risk blunders, and made them as soon as the real 
competition began. His lead vanished and so did his chances. It was 
said at the time that his support had been as broad as it was 
shallow. Sen. George McGovern won that nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Gov. George Romney of Michigan, the earliest leader among GOP  
candidates for 1968. He'd just swept to re-election by a landslide. 
He had gained broad support among minority voters, including 30 
percent of the black vote, unmatched for a Republican in that era. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential preference polls reflected it; for six months,  
he was rated a likely winner over President Lyndon B. Johnson in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stumbled as a national campaigner, lacking the  
organization and adroitness of Richard M. Nixon, who quickly 
displaced him as the leading entry. Romney was out of it before the 
first primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bush has the early advantages of both. He's been endorsed  
for the 2000 nomination by more than half the 31 Republican 
governors, and by more than 80 Republicans in Congress. Party 
leaders have been coming to him in Austin; he's campaigning at home 
through the spring, saying he won't travel nationally until the 
Texas Legislature adjourns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole is his closest rival in the early polls, with the rest  
of a nine-man field trailing them. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened in Des Moines, Iowa, presenting herself as a  
nonpolitician -- although she has been in government longer than the 
others, and campaigned nationally for her husband, Bob Dole, the 
1996 GOP nominee. ``I'm not a politician, and frankly, I think 
that's a plus today,'' she said. Although she did mention in 
passing that she's been in all 99 counties of Iowa, where the first 
contest of 2000 will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the crowded GOP field, there are only two  
Democrats running, Gore, with former Sen. Bill Bradley of New 
Jersey campaigning to overtake him. ``My guess is it will remain a 
two-person race, which will be an interesting dynamic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew survey notes that Gore's poll standing is not unlike  
that of Vice President George Bush 12 years ago, when he was rated 
behind the leading Democratic prospects. They faltered, and he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is viewed favorably by 58 percent of Americans now, a solid  
rating but not as good as Bush's at this point in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	All those numbers add up only to a guessing game. But they also  
show what can happen to candidates who look like sure winners this 
far in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are simply predictions of the future,'' Gore said,  
although pollsters call them snapshots of the present. Either way, 
they can change overnight when the real competition begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you know the old saying that six months is a lifetime in  
politics,'' the vice president said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Celtics Sign Potapenko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two days after acquiring Vitaly Potapenko from the  
Cleveland Cavaliers, the Boston Celtics announced Saturday the 
signing of the center-forward to a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but The Boston Globe  
reported Saturday that the contract was expected be for around $33 
million over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Potapenko, 23, was acquired by the Celtics on Thursday for  
Andrew DeClercq and a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives us a work ethic and an inside presence that is very  
much needed, particularly on the defensive end,'' Celtics coach 
Rick Pitino said in a statement. ``Vitaly is a young, strong, big 
man with great upside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Ukrainian-born Potapenko played his first game  
with Boston on Friday, a 93-83 loss to Detroit. He had eight 
points, three rebounds and two assists in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 17 games with Cleveland this season, he averaged 8.4 points  
and 5.5 rebounds. He was selected by Cleveland as the 12th pick 
overall in the 1996 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the trade, Cleveland gets a first-round draft pick  
between now and 2001. The Cavs have the option of when to use the 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, Cleveland's pick cannot be among  
the top three this year. A pick in the following two years would be 
unprotected.

<HEADLINE> Night Slalom Called Off in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Women World Cup slalom skiers called  
it taking a stand. Spanish World Cup organizers called it lack of 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	After a chaotic first slalom run disrupted by powerful winds and  
rutted snow at the World Cup finals, organizers -- faced with a 
boycott -- canceled the race altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to say no sometimes because we had so many bad races  
this year, especially in slalom,'' said Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, 
one of the four skiers with a chance to win the season slalom 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I'm a little bit disappointed because I had the chance  
to win this cup, I know for the women's World Cup in general it's a 
good decision,'' Wiberg said. ``We have to say no to running in 
such bad and dangerous conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slalom racers often complain they must ski in difficult  
conditions that would never be contemplated in the high-speed 
downhill or super-G. The women agreed that only two or three World 
Cup slaloms have been satisfactory all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so sad,'' Spela Pretnar of Slovenia said. ``I had the  
impression they were playing with us. All year it's been bad, it's 
a bad commercial for skiing. And today was just plain dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race chief Eduardo Valenzuela, meanwhile, said a lack of  
motivation was behind the women's strike threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the women's teams are not interested in having more  
races because the (overall) World Cup title has already been 
decided,'' Valenzuela said. ``I feel they are not willing to run 
the races. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the men's side, they want to race. The overall rankings are  
not settled yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women, however, insisted they are more than willing to race,  
and hoped the slalom could somehow be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to be rude, we just want to run in better  
conditions,'' American Kristina Koznick said. ``And if not, we'll 
wait. We would rather it was postponed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FIS -- the world governing body of skiing -- decided to cancel the  
race and not reschedule it, saying there was no time left in the 
season, which ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, chosen to speak for the other skiers, said the course  
was not well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela, who insisted course conditions were adequate, said  
organizers followed FIS instructions on preparing the course and 
had been grooming the course for the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers followed FIS instructions and mixed the new snow  
with the old, which he said should not have been done. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, we could have carried out the race,''  
Valenzuela said. ``Maybe not in prefect conditions, but good 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran French racer Florence Masnada said she could not recall  
a race being wiped out in this fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	FIS spokesman Christian Knauth said the decision had nothing to  
do with the skiers' threatened boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``During inspection from the athletes and jury, the jury made  
the decision it's not OK for the second run,'' Knauth said. ``The 
cancellation was not about the activities of the athletes. It was a 
jury decision on the hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation means Sabine Egger of Austria -- who entered as  
the overall point leader in slalom -- picks up her first World Cup 
season slalom title. Wiberg, just 10 points behind, settled for 
runnerup in the season standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, fellow Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer  
claimed the season super-G title when similar weather wiped out 
that race. 
</P>
<P>
	FIS said it hoped to run today's races as scheduled -- the men's  
slalom and women's giant slalom. In the men's slalom, Norway's 
Lasse Kjus could wrap up the overall World Cup title, the most 
important of the season.

<HEADLINE> Houston Bidder Promises NFL Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston businessman Bob McNair has guaranteed  
sellouts at every home game for five years should he get an NFL 
expansion football team, a pledge that would prevent local 
television blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials, preparing to gather in Phoenix on Sunday for a  
meeting to decide their next expansion team, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair's audacious promise, reported by Houston television  
station KRIV late Friday and the Houston Chronicle in Saturday 
editions, is aimed at gaining an upper hand over Los Angeles, which 
has more than a 3-1 edge in the number of TV households. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said he would devise a system to give to charity any  
tickets not sold by the deadline for a blackout. NFL rules dictate 
that if a game is not a sellout 72 hours before kickoff, it is not 
televised within 75 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	However, network officials have said they would prefer that the  
NFL be in a town that can guarantee sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm that confident we will succeed,'' McNair said. ``We're  
telling television that you're not going to suffer blackouts in 
Houston. That should be a big challenge to Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups in Los Angeles are competing for a team. Hollywood  
dealmaker Michael Ovitz wants to build a new stadium in suburban 
Carson atop a waste dump. Real estate developer Ed Roski and 
billionaire Eli Broad want to remodel the L.A. Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has been stepping up his challenges to Los Angeles  
television market. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear a lot of talk about the fact that Houston is the  
11th-rated media market and Los Angeles is the second-rated 
market,'' McNair told KRIV. ``That's very superficial. That doesn't 
tell the whole story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, he distributed a report to team owners  
showing that while Los Angeles has a larger base of viewers who 
watch NFL games, having a home team in that city does not produce a 
large gain over having a new team in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Using network records for the 1993 and 1994 seasons, the  
incremental gain of a Los Angeles Raiders game was only about 
28,000 more than the incremental gain of a Houston Oilers' game. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cities lost their NFL franchises in 1995, with Los Angeles  
also losing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Texas' two U.S. senators and the region's seven House  
members have sent NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue a letter asking 
that he hold to his word. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three years ago, Tagliabue stood in Houston's City Hall  
and said the city would likely get another football team if it put 
together a state-of-the-art stadium deal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the group -- led by Republican Sens. Phil Gramm and  
Kay Bailey Hutchison -- implored the league to give Houston the 32nd 
franchise over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter reminded Tagliabue of his comments May 29, 1996,  
after meeting with Gramm, then-Mayor Bob Lanier, Harris County 
Judge Robert Eckels and others in wake of the Oilers' departure for 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said Houston's proposed $310 million,  
retractable-roof stadium ``meets all the requirements set by you.''

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Reputation on the Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch surveyed his  
booming Olympic empire and liked what he saw -- billions of 
television and sponsorship dollars, dozens of cities vying to stage 
the games, the five-ring logo spreading to all corners of the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch figured all this was too good to give up. So rather  
than retire, he decided to stay for another term as IOC president 
until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``The happiest moments of my life are when I come to the  
headquarters of the IOC and open the door to my office,'' he said 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	That was two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has a different perspective now.  
</P>
<P>
	His credibility, future and legacy will all be on the line when  
the International Olympic Committee holds a watershed meeting this 
week to deal with the biggest crisis in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard has become the lightning rod for  
criticism in the vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Olympics have endured world wars, terrorism and  
political boycotts, the IOC is battling for survival against an 
onslaught of condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the toughest challenge of his 19-year presidency, Samaranch  
is under tremendous pressure to deliver on his promises to clean 
house and enact major reforms. If he fails, his position will 
become untenable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is going to retain the presidency and remain in power,  
he has to resolve this,'' British IOC member Craig Reedie said. 
``The ball is in his court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With critics outside the IOC clamoring for his resignation and  
some officials within the committee now speculating about a 
possible early departure, Samaranch knows the stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider (the session) one of the most important in our  
history, and the most important of my presidency,'' he said in a 
letter to IOC members last week. ``Our duty requires that we take 
concrete decisions, in some case painful ones, for the whole world 
will be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC general assembly, which convenes Wednesday and Thursday  
after a two-day meeting of the executive board, will be asked to 
take the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Endorse Samaranch, either by secret ballot or, more likely, by  
public acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ratify the expulsions of six IOC members accused of receiving  
cash payments or other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. 
Four other implicated members have resigned, 10 received warnings, 
three were exonerated and one died. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Set up an ethics committee, including outside members, and  
establish a code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a reform commission including outside experts to study  
structural changes of the IOC. Samaranch has mentioned Henry 
Kissinger as a possible panel member. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Adopt a new Olympic bidding and site-selection process. For  
the 2006 Winter Games, member visits to bid cities would be banned 
and the general assembly would select the site after the field is 
narrowed to two finalists by a small panel. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt that Samaranch will win a vote of  
confidence from the 90-plus members, most of whom he appointed to 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But the expulsions could pose a risk. Samaranch had hoped  
members would resign rather than be kicked out. 
</P>
<P>
	But six are fighting dismissal: Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador),  
Jean-Claude Ganga (Congo Republic), Gen. Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel 
Gadir (Sudan), Lamine Keita (Mali), Sergio Santander (Chile) and 
Seiuli Paul Wallwork (Western Samoa). 
</P>
<P>
	They will be given 20 minutes each to defend themselves in front  
of the assembly before facing expulsion votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Expulsion requires a two-thirds majority, and it's possible some  
of the six could find enough sympathy among the rank-and-file to 
defeat the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Samaranch and members of the executive board would  
be under pressure to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC avoided one potential crisis by deciding not to seek the  
expulsion of South Korea's Kim Un-yong, a powerful executive board 
member and the highest-ranking official implicated in the Salt Lake 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, accused of using his influence to land jobs in  
telecommunications and music for his two children, escaped with a 
severe warning from the IOC's inquiry panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has suggested he is the victim of a plot to undermine his  
chances of becoming IOC president. Had he faced expulsion, he could 
have provoked vicious infighting at the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if all of Samaranch's proposals are approved at the  
meeting, it's uncertain whether the actions will be enough to 
restore public confidence in the scandal-shaken IOC and its 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate sponsors who finance the Olympics are restless and  
putting pressure on the IOC to act decisively or risk a rebellion. 
One company, John Hancock insurance, has canceled negotiations with 
NBC for $20 million in Olympic advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're telling the sponsors that we expect the completion of  
the cleaning of the house and the beginning of reforms,'' IOC 
marketing director Michael Payne said. ``We are saying there is no 
doubt in the IOC's resolve to go all the way on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC officials say the reform process will take time, that  
the world shouldn't expect an overnight revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't do it so fast that we will be destabilized by public  
opinion,'' executive board member Kevan Gosper said. ``You can't 
panic yourself to take changes. The problem is everyone thinks they 
own the Olympic rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Samaranch took over in 1980, the IOC was virtually broke,  
the Olympics were torn by boycotts and few -- if any -- cities wanted 
anything to do with the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his leadership, the Olympics grew into a  
multibillion-dollar industry. The games became so successful that 
cities began waging fierce bidding wars for the right to stage 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of rumors of bribery, the issue exploded into the  
open with revelations that Salt Lake officials paid more than $1 
million in cash, travel, gifts, scholarships, jobs and other 
inducements to IOC members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Samaranch must be held accountable for the scandals  
and should resign because the abuses happened on his watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee has backed off its previous  
unqualified support for Samaranch and now stops just short of 
calling for him to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Associated Press interviews with dozens of IOC members over  
the past month have found overwhelming support for Samaranch. 
International sports federations and national Olympic committees 
also have rallied around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely adamant that Samaranch should stay until the  
end of his mandate,'' executive board member Jacques Rogge said. 
``We have to do what's best for the IOC. We don't have to do 
something just to please the critics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question of Samaranch's departure is clouded because he has  
no obvious successor. If he resigned, it could lead to a divisive 
election that would drag the IOC further into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of presidential contenders includes Rogge, Gosper and  
vice presidents Dick Pound and Anita DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch hinted last week that he has an heir apparent in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the IOC, there has historically been an Anglo-Saxon and a  
Latin bloc, which have managed to coexist correctly,'' he said. 
``For my successor, I see a person totally above the parties. But 
his name remains a secret in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been increasing speculation that Samaranch might  
decide to step down early, perhaps later this year or early next 
year, once the crisis has died down, the reforms are in place and a 
stable transition has been assured. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Samaranch delivers the reforms, thereafter his only  
remaining duty is to arrange an orderly transfer of power,'' said 
Reedie, the British IOC member. ``It will be his call when he does 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One theory, floated last week in the Wall Street Journal, is  
that Samaranch is leaning toward stepping down in November and that 
he would remain in a leadership role -- possibly a transitional 
co-presidency -- through the 2000 Sydney Games. IOC officials denied 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever Samaranch decides to leave, it probably will be on his  
own terms. He doesn't want to go down in history as the IOC 
president who resigned in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job to lead the IOC out of the storm,'' he said. ``I  
want to walk out the front door with my head high.''

<HEADLINE> Italian Skiing Star Retires at 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Deborah Compagnoni, a three-time  
Olympic champion and winner of 16 World Cup races, retired from 
competitive skiing Saturday, driven from the sport by injury and 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by the 28-year-old Italian was expected, but  
still drew a crush of reporters, skiers and autograph-seekers to 
the finish area after final giant slalom, in which she was seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Near tears and her voice quivering, Compagnoni said she was  
calling it quits to preserve her health. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where I end my career,'' Compagnoni said. ``It makes  
me unhappy to leave, but I must think of my health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is because of my physical problems I am quitting, not  
because of my season's results. This is not a decision I wanted to 
take, but rather one I was forced to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compagnoni missed several events this season and failed to win a  
single race. 
</P>
<P>
	Her World Cup career, which started in 1987, was plagued by  
chronic ailments. She has had numerous operations, suffered 
injuries to both knees and nearly died of an intestinal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Compagnoni had surgery to have a part of her intestine  
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Compagnoni's most recent health woes included back problems and  
painful knees, which hampered her preparation for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic giant slalom champion and slalom silver medalist in  
1998, she finished fourth overall in the World Cup standings last 
year -- an impressive feat considering she stopped racing both 
downhill and super-G in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Her gold in Japan, to go with gold in the giant slalom in 1994  
and another in super-G in 1992, made her the first Alpine skier to 
win gold at three Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Compagnoni finished 22nd in the overall standings,  
and ninth in the giant slalom, her best discipline this season. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the gold in the slalom and giant slalom at the 1997  
world championships at her home base Sestriere, Italy, but failed 
to defend her titles in Vail, Colo., last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she settled for seventh in the giant slalom and eighth  
in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Compagnoni did not say what she planned to do next. Her recent  
projects have included a brief modeling career for bras and pasta 
advertising.

<HEADLINE> Jonrowe Quits Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE ISLAND, Alaska (AP) -- DeeDee Jonrowe, one of the pre-race  
favorites in this year's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, quit the 
trail Saturday after her 12-dog team stopped running along the 
frozen Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonrowe, 43, of Willow, Alaska, scratched while running the  
60-mile stretch of trail between the checkpoints of Grayling and 
Eagle Island in Alaska's vast Interior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dogs come first, and they just don't belong out here right  
now, for whatever reason,'' she told KNOM radio and the Alaska 
Public Radio Network while waiting for a plane to airlift her team 
from the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	Her team of young dogs stopped about 25 miles outside Eagle  
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she played with them and tried to cajole them, but she  
said it was clear to her that the dogs didn't have the will to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're creatures of habit, and they no longer trust what  
happening,'' Jonrowe said. ``It's mental -- it's not physical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time she was in fourth place behind Doug Swingley of  
Lincoln, Mont., Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, and Rick Swenson 
of Two Rivers, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she may have left Grayling too soon, without giving the  
team enough rest in the extremely cold conditions. Jonrowe spent 
only an hour in the checkpoint before setting out in pursuit of the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Yukon, temperatures early Saturday were reported at 30  
below zero, with a 20 mph headwind for mushers. 
</P>
<P>
	The scratch was the first ever for Jonrowe, who was competing in  
her 17th Iditarod. She has come close to winning several times, 
placing second last year and in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were two things I hadn't done: I hadn't won and I hadn't  
scratched,'' she said. ``I was hoping it was much more likely to 
win than to scratch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the 1999 Iditarod, Jonrowe had 11 straight finishes  
in the top 10 that earned her more than $250,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the seventh scratch among the 56 mushers who started the  
1,100-mile race March 6 in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the 1995 winner from Lincoln, Mont., made it to Eagle  
Island at 5:27 a.m. (9:27 a.m. EST) Saturday with 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser, a three-time Iditarod winner, arrived second at 8:51 a.m.  
with 10 dogs, and Swenson, who has won the race five times, was 
third into the checkpoint an hour later with 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jonrowe's scratch, defending champion Jeff King of Denali  
Park, Alaska, moved up to fourth. King left Grayling at 7:02 a.m. 
after a five-hour rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were Alaskans Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof,  
Ramey Smyth of Big Lake, Vern Halter of Willow, Bill Cotter of 
Nenana and Charlie Boulding of Manley and race rookie Harald 
Tunheim of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley has racked up a number of firsts so far in the race. He  
earned $3,000 by being first into the namesake checkpoint of 
Iditarod, and another $3,500 for being first to reach the Yukon 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	His success came despite breaking two sleds -- and quickly  
repairing them well enough to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dogs are running fine,'' Swingley said Friday in Anvik.  
``I'm just having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Barron from Sheep Creek, Alaska, declared himself out of  
the race overnight back at the midpoint Gold Rush ghost town of 
Iditarod. Barron -- the sixth scratch in the race -- said his young 
dogs simply were too tired to continue. He finished 12th in last 
year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner gets $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize money is  
paid to the first 20 finishers.

	Violence Escalates in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three bombs went off this afternoon  
in two government-controlled cities in Kosovo, killing at least six 
people and injuring more than 60. In one of the cities, Kosovska 
Mitrovica, the blast occurred next to a mosque in a fruit and 
vegetable market packed with weekend shoppers. Meanwhile, ethnic 
Albanian delegates said today they were ready to sign a U.S.-backed 
Kosovo peace plan if the Serb-led government backs down on its 
opposition to allowing NATO troops to enforce it. Peace talks 
continue Monday in France.

	Bomb Explodes Outside N.C. Clinic  
</P>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- One of two bombs planted outside an  
abortion clinic exploded today, causing no injuries and little 
damage because it detonated only partially. The clinic, less than 
75 miles from the mountainous area where serial bombing suspect 
Eric Rudolph is believed to be hiding, received no advance warning 
of the bombs. Homes and businesses near the building were evacuated 
and police cordoned off the road around the Orange Street clinic in 
a neighborhood several blocks from downtown Asheville. More 
residents were evacuated when the second device was found.

	Report: Marine Jet Not Authorized  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The Marine jet that severed a ski lift's cable and  
sent 20 skiers plunging to their deaths last year was not 
authorized to fly near the cable car, newspapers said today, 
quoting Italian investigators. Only F-16 fighter jets were 
authorized to fly in the area of the Alps where the Feb. 3, 1998, 
accident took place. The daily newspaper La Stampa said that Italy 
limited flights in the area of the accident to F-16 aircraft in 
1997 because of complaints about the noise of lower-level flights. 
As a result, the fatal Prowler flight was unauthorized, the 
newspaper quoted Italian investigators as saying.

	Clinton Urges More Police Training

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Expressing concern that recent charges  
of police misconduct could undermine the fight against crime, 
President Clinton today proposed improved training and other steps 
to restore ``the bonds of trust'' between the public and law 
enforcement. Clinton touted the steady drop in crime nationwide 
since his administration began promoting community policing. But he 
cautioned that those advances could be undermined if public trust 
in the police waned. In his weekly radio address today, Clinton 
offered a series of federal initiatives and policy suggestions 
designed to bolster public confidence in law enforcement.

	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- At least 13 people were killed today  
after attackers set a crowded six-story department store on fire. 
It was one of Turkey's deadliest attacks in years. President 
Suleyman Demirel condemned the attack, and Prime Minister Bulent 
Ecevit said it was part of a campaign aimed at disrupting the April 
18 national elections. Police immediately beefed up security in 
this city of 12 million people, conducting identity checks on 
public transportation and warning people not to take parcels from 
strangers.

required that Indonesia open up its shattered economy in exchange 
for billions of dollars of loans. ``This is a sweeping set of 
fundamental reforms designed to bring our banking system back to 
financial health,'' said Indonesian Senior Economics Minister 
Ginandjar Kartasasmita.

	DENVER (AP) -- Kent McCausland hit five second-half 3-pointers  
and Iowa adapted its half-court game to match high-paced Arkansas, 
outlasting the Razorbacks 82-72 today in the second round of the 
NCAA tournament. McCausland finished with 17 points and Dean 
Oliver, harassed all day by Arkansas' pressure defense, added 17 
for the Hawkeyes, who overcame a 13-point deficit to advance to the 
round of 16 for the third time under outgoing coach Tom Davis. 
Chris Walker scored 22 points and Kareem Reid had 18 points and 11 
assists for Arkansas (23-11). Iowa will play top-seeded Connecticut

Sampras at the top of the men's rankings, and Serena Williams upset 
Steffi Graf. Moya, the 1998 French Open champion, defeated Gustavo 
Kuerten 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 in their Newsweek Champions Cup semifinal to 
bolt ahead of Sampras in the point standings. Sampras lost in the 
second round of the tournament. Williams won for the second time in 
a week as she wore down Graf, a winner of 21 grand slam titles, 
6-3, 3-6, 7-5 in the Evert Cup final.

one of Turkey's deadliest attacks in years. There were differing 
accounts what happened, with Istanbul's fire chief describing it as

gratitude to those who stood up for him throughout the impeachment 
process. On Saturday night, Clinton was the featured guest at an 
Arkansas state Democratic party salute to Dale Bumpers, who

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Residents of a town southeast of  
the Argentine capital searched the garbage dumps Saturday for a 
valuable statuette of the Virgin of Mercy which was stolen from the 
Roman Catholic cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue was made in Peru in the late 18th century and brought  
to Chascomus, 75 miles from Buenos Aires by town founder Pedro 
Escribano. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-inch high porcelain statuette, valued at $10,000, has a  
silver crown, golden rings, earrings and brooches and a mantle 
covered with precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
	The robbers may have thrown away the statue after stripping it  
of its ornaments and mantle, cathedral notary Hugo Gezzi told the 
news agency Noticias Argentinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the statue was stolen late Thursday.

	HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- Thirty Cuban railway guards who looted  
shipments of peas, rice, detergent and cigarettes they were 
supposed to protect have been sentenced to prison, the Communist 
Party daily Granma reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief guard at the rail depot, Norge Chacon Diaz, apparently  
oversaw the theft of shipments meant for communities in eastern 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper put the value of the stolen items at roughly  
$50,000. However, Cuban prices for such goods -- all part of state 
rations -- are a tiny fraction of those anywhere else in the world, 
often just a few cents per pound or package. 
</P>
<P>
	Granma said Chacon was sentenced to 14 years in prison and six  
guards each were sentenced to 12 years. The 23 others received 
terms between six and nine years.

<P>
	Brazil has about 2.2 million Internet users who pay roughly $27  
a month for unlimited access -- slightly higher than typical U.S. 
rates.

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panamanian politicians and students  
laid flowers Saturday at the tombs of 20 people killed by U.S. 
soldiers during a 1964 clash that broke out when students tried to 
hang Panama's flag in the canal zone ruled by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35th anniversary of the clash comes in the final year of  
U.S. control of the canal. Panama will take charge of the canal and 
U.S. military property on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 9, 1964, hundreds of students attempted to hang the  
Panamanian flag in front of a high school in Panama City's Balboa 
section, which then was under U.S. administration.

<P>
	The guards planned to provoke unrest at the jail in Tipitapa, 15  
miles east of the capital, Managua, on Friday when they refused to 
allow families to visit the inmates, said national prison 
spokesman, Juan Ramon Huerta. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police were called in to maintain order, and President  
Arnoldo Aleman ordered the government to fire any prison officials 
who had participated in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison guards complain their monthly salaries of roughly $50,  
are too low and that Nicaraguan prisons are overcrowded.

<HEADLINE> Six Children Dead in St. Louis Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The woman's screams shot out from her  
third-story window toward the busy intersection and Fire Station 8 
across the street. Save my children, she cried before plunging from 
her flaming apartment to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	But the blaze, apparently sparked out of fury after a fight,  
moved too fast even for the neighboring firefighters. Six children 
were trapped and none survived. Three of them were found huddling 
together inside a closet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tragic waste of human life,'' said Fire Chief Neil  
Svetanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Friday's fire, authorities arrested a 23-year-old  
man -- police said he was the boyfriend of the frantic victim -- at 
his home just nine blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said he and the woman had been fighting outside the  
brick apartment building earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters across the street also reported seeing a man  
outside the building with what may have been a red gasoline 
container. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an altercation prior to the fire and that may have  
led to the fire,'' said Police Chief Ron Henderson. ``We're very, 
very sure that we have the person responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Names of the victims were not immediately released, but  
officials said the children ranged in age from 7 months to 9 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who apparently was the only adult inside the  
apartment, suffered a broken leg and head injuries after falling 
from her window. She had lost her grip while desperately shouting 
to firefighters, witnesses said, and continued her pleas even after 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw the fire and then we saw a girl hanging out the window  
crying 'Help me, help me and my kids.''' said Selina Bailey, a 
neighbor. ``This is a sad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said many, but not all, of the victims were related. A  
woman who lived in the apartment and was believed to be the mother 
of some of the children arrived home just as firefighters were 
extinguishing the blaze, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not reveal details on how the blaze may have  
started, but said there was little doubt it was arson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a fire at 4:30 p.m. on one of the busiest  
intersections in St. Louis, 50 feet from the firehouse, and it is 
fully engulfed in flames within minutes, there's a pretty strong 
indication it was intentional,'' Svetanics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighter Tim Dangos was among the first to encounter the  
fast-moving flames on the third floor. Through the smoke he saw a 
baby carriage and diapers. And in the confusion he thought he heard 
voices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking that I had to get those kids out of there,''  
Dangos told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Before he could, though, 
the fire intensified, forcing him to dive out a window. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene of the deadliest blaze in St. Louis since 1988 moved  
many firefighters to tears, according to Svetanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Said a drenched and soot-covered Dangos, ``This was bad ... I've  
been on for 14 years, and I've never seen one this bad.''

<HEADLINE> Temple-Cincinnati Rivalry Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For the third time in five years, Temple and  
Cincinnati will meet in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's second-round matchup at the FleetCenter will again be  
between teams that stress defense first and with experienced, 
successful coaches on both benches. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple coach John Chaney was asked Saturday about himself and  
Cincinnati's Bob Huggins. He sat at the table on the stage and 
laughed, his rugged 67-year-old face well-hidden with a black 
baseball cap pulled down tight to his eyes and the collar of a 
black trenchcoat turned up. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at Bobby and you look at me are there any  
similarities at all?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The laughter picked up around the room where the 45-year-old  
Huggins had just been, his attire a smart school warmup. With his 
well-groomed hair and wire-rimmed glasses, he looked like a 
businessman on a day off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby's players even have names like `Levitate,''' Chaney  
said, playing off the name of Cincinnati guard Melvin Levett. ``My 
players are meek and young and I will challenge them and use all 
the blasphemous words I can. Bobby's able to generate a high level 
of aggressiveness from his players and he's always been able to do 
that. My players, I don't even want to call them what they are. You 
saw them yesterday. You aren't afraid of them. Those little boys 
were running around everywhere. Bobby's boys live in that paint and 
they just beat the hell out of you. Bobby's got that big old eraser 
he uses and the refs don't call the fouls. You know they commit 
more fouls than is on that piece of paper you guys got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, Chaney felt he had to politic with the officials as  
he gets the sixth-seeded Owls (22-10) ready for the third-seeded 
Bearcats (27-5). 
</P>
<P>
	Temple advanced with a 61-54 victory over 11th-seeded Kent,  
while Cincinnati beat 14th-seeded George Mason 72-48. The Bearcats 
beat Temple in the first round in 1995 and in the second round the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams are hard to score against,'' Huggins said. ``They  
play the matchup and three different zones. John does a great job 
of mixing them and makes them hard to recognize. We're a man-to-man 
team and we try to make every shot as tough as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means don't expect a whole lot of offense Sunday and that  
could mean trouble for the Bearcats. In its five losses this 
season, Cincinnati scored 60 or less in each. Temple, a team that 
has struggled from the outside all season, averages 66.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to slow it down but they'll want to beat the zone down  
court so we can't set up,'' Temple's Quincy Wadley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to speed things up and get them out of their game  
so their guards aren't comfortable,'' Cincinnati's Pete Mickeal 
said. ``We have to force turnovers and get them in transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same scenario will be true in the other game in the  
doubleheader when second-seeded Miami (23-6) faces 10th-seeded 
Purdue (20-12). 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes advanced with a 75-54 victory over 15th-seeded  
Lafayette as Johnny Hemsley scored 31 points, including a 
school-record nine 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue used quite a bit of zone defense in beating  
seventh-seeded Texas 58-54 in a first-round game that could only be 
described as ugly. 
</P>
<P>
	``People used to think they could shut us down with a zone but  
with Johnny being so hot, we'll take that,'' Miami center Mario 
Bland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the first ever for Miami in its third NCAA  
tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sweet 16 would be a tremendous feat for us,'' Hemsley  
said. ``But Purdue's a good team and they did a lot of good things 
against Texas. We'll have our hands full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers, who came into the tournament having lost five  
of six games, feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to compete on the glass and we are going  
to have to get back on defense in transition,'' Purdue's Alan 
Eldridge said. ``When we get our shooters the ball it will have to 
be when they have an opportunity to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's winners advance to next week's East Regional at East  
Rutherford, N.J., along with the two winners from the subregional 
at Charlotte, N.C.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Kittles Signs 6-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Kerry Kittles, the athletic  
shooting guard who was the eighth pick in the 1996 NBA draft, 
signed a six-year contract extension with the New Jersey Nets on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets spokesman Gary Sussman said the team would not disclose  
terms of the deal. Kittles was not immediately available for 
comment with the team in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing comes just one day after New Jersey conditionally  
signed point guard Stephon Marbury to a six-year, $70.9 million 
contract. The deal won't go into effect unless the Nets' 
nine-player trade involving Milwaukee and Minnesota is finalized 
with all the players involved passing physicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, Kittles and power forward Keith Van Horn are all  
represented by super agent David Falk. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittles and the Nets had until midnight Saturday to reach an  
agreement on the extension. If they had not, Kittles would have 
become a free agent on July 1, eligible to negotiate with all 29 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittles had a spectacular first two seasons with New Jersey,  
averaging 16.4 and 17.2 points respectively. However, with contract 
problems hanging over his head this season and a pre-season knee 
injury bothering him, he has slumped this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 games, Kittles has averaged 13.4 points while shooting  
just 34 percent from the field. He's also averaging 4.6 rebounds 
and 3.7 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Kittles is a key ingredient in John Calipari's  
style of up-and-down-the-court play. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittles' career highs were 40 points in his rookie year against  
Milwaukee and 13 rebounds last season against Vancouver. The 
Villanova product only missed five games in his first two seasons, 
although the knee injury caused him to miss three this year.

<HEADLINE> Tip O'Neill Cleared of Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 20-month investigation by the FBI that spanned a  
dozen states and used electronically wired informants showed no 
political corruption by the late House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' 
O'Neill Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret probe lasted from 1979 to 1981 when the U.S. House  
speaker was playing a major role in national affairs as an ally of 
President Jimmy Carter, The Boston Globe reported Saturday. The 
newspaper obtained government documents through requests under the 
federal Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI suspected O'Neill used his political clout to win about  
$3 million in federal loans and guarantees for projects in which he 
and his associates had financial interests. For a time, the FBI 
suspected that O'Neill had received $65,000 in kickbacks for his 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI fitted an informant, who told investigators that O'Neill  
had received payoffs, with a transmitter and recording device to 
record conversations with O'Neill and his associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI suspected from three hours of recorded conversations  
that one or more of O'Neill's associates was involved in some 
unspecified ``illegal acts'' on behalf of the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher O'Neill, son of the late Massachusetts political  
legend, said his father had been aware of the investigation at the 
time it was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not have any doubts he would be vindicated,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man's Death Spurred Reform of IRS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DERRY, N.H. (AP) -- At 8 o'clock one August night, Bruce Barron  
left his father's birthday party at a nursing home, saying he had 
to finish some work at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	There, he opened a bank foreclosure notice on his home in Derry  
and a Cape Cod vacation home in Chatham, Mass. The Internal Revenue 
Service had placed liens on both. 
</P>
<P>
	He called his wife, Shirley, to say he was working late, then  
drove 100 miles to Chatham, parked his car in the garage and left 
the motor running. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother and his sister found the body of the 47-year-old  
attorney the next morning when they arrived for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	He left a brief handwritten note, blaming the bank, which he  
said ``needs to clear its books,'' and the IRS, which ``sits, does 
nothing and watches you die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped his life insurance would satisfy the debts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Killing myself is much harder than I thought it would be,'' he  
wrote. ``Carrie (his daughter) will need everyone's love. I wish I 
could stay and see her continue to grow. There is no good solution. 
I'm sorry for hurting everyone by doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Barron says her husband was put through hell by the IRS  
for three years, but that she had no clue that he was thinking 
about suicide that night in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. No. No,'' she says. ``We wanted the IRS problem to go  
away, and we worked with them to make that happen, but it just 
didn't happen soon enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until last May, just short of the second anniversary of  
Bruce's death, when the IRS agreed to an out of court settlement of 
a $1 million wrongful death lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS forgave more than $400,000 in tax debt, lifted all of  
its liens, including one on $200,000 in life insurance money, and 
paid Mrs. Barron's legal fees of $44,000, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Pyrek, a spokesman for the IRS in Washington, declined  
comment, saying the agency is prohibited from publicly discussing 
any taxpayer's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a letter dated May 12, 1997, from the IRS to the Barrons'  
lawyers denying a claim for civil damages, the agency says, ``There 
is no evidence or reason to find that any of the Internal Revenue 
Service employees named acted recklessly or with intentional 
disregard'' of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did any of the named employees undertake a course  
of action to intentionally embarrass, harass or humiliate'' the 
Barrons. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Barron says the settlement ``got them off my back.''  
</P>
<P>
	She added, ``I couldn't have won (in court), but I knew that  
entering. ... And all I really wanted was for them to leave me 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says the lawsuit, filed on June 30, 1997, was well-timed.  
``It was when the IRS was being investigated for other abuses. When 
I settled, it corresponded to when they began to reform the IRS. 
They wanted to get people like me squared away. It didn't help 
their cause to have someone like me talking about their 
atrocities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last June passed a reform law designed to make the IRS  
a more service-oriented agency, one that might have helped the 
Barrons. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, it expands taxpayer rights when the IRS  
seeks to collect past-due taxes. The agency now has the burden of 
proving taxpayer liability. The law includes a taxpayers' bill of 
rights that went into effect Jan. 19, designed to insure due 
process when the IRS takes action to collect tax debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers have the right to request an appeal hearing when IRS  
officials seek to place a lien on property or actually take the 
property to pay tax debt. No action can be taken until a finding is 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxpayer also has 30 days to decide whether to challenge the  
administrative ruling in U.S. Tax Court or in U.S. District Court. 
Again, the IRS cannot seize a taxpayer's property while the case is 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS must now consider all other payment possibilities before  
claiming a taxpayer's principal home or business assets. A court 
order is required if the agency moves to seize the principal home. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers now can seek civil damages of up to $100,000 if IRS  
agents negligently disregard the tax code or collection 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safeguarding taxpayer rights is something we take seriously,''  
new IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti said in unveiling the 
taxpayers' bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the horror stories of past IRS excesses, Shirley Barron's  
stands out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came after me in a full fury'' even after her husband's  
death, she said. ``They took Bruce's life insurance money after 
they killed him, basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says her case helped turn the tide for IRS reform and  
brought attention to the power wielded by some agents. ``I think it 
created some awareness because we went public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One agent, who she said was discrediting her husband before he  
died, has since left the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember he was a lawyer in the small town we both  
grew up in. This agent was going from courthouse to courthouse 
getting client lists, talking to opposing counsels, saying, `If you 
settle this, I want the money.' Going to his clients directly. `I 
want you to pay me what you owe Bruce Barron.' The only thing a 
lawyer has is his reputation. He's not the hardware store selling 
knives and screwdrivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agent, she said, ``was systematically destroying him.''  
</P>
<P>
	The IRS said in its May 12, 1997, letter that ``contacts made  
with third parties in this matter were made to assist in 
determining the collectibility of delinquent federal taxes... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Barrons have lived in a seven-room, classic Cape farmhouse  
on about five acres of land for 20 years. Ordering an appraisal 
after one had already been completed, the agent -- a ``real rogue 
with no supervision'' -- wanted to carry it out personally and 
``walked through each and every room, including my bedroom and my 
daughter's room,'' Mrs. Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to her attorney, William E. Brennan, the agent  
harassed the family: Mrs. Barron's IRA was temporarily seized; her 
wages from the town of Londonderry, where she worked as a 
librarian, were attached; even $300 from their daughter's savings 
account was claimed. The agent even demanded to see six months of 
grocery receipts, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another agent, Mrs. Barron says, showed up at her back door in  
February 1997 and attempted to serve her with a subpoena. She 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I opened up the top of the Dutch door, and he flashed a badge  
and an ID in my face,'' she recalls. ``And he was a very large man. 
And I said to him, `I cannot believe you are standing here in front 
of me now when you killed my husband, and you're coming after me 
now. You're trying to kill me now.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce's suicide left her alone to raise their 16-year-old  
daughter, Carrie Elizabeth, a junior in high school. Carrie was 
very close to her father, often joining him for skiing and biking, 
sometimes accompanying him to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	The family used to go to their Cape Cod home almost every  
weekend, and spent Thanksgiving there every other year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce was the cook,'' Mrs. Barron recalls. ``He'd be the one  
that would get up at five in the morning and stuff the bird. He was 
just the life of the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank foreclosed on that vacation home, a seven-room  
contemporary Cape, and auctioned it off. With more time, Mrs. 
Barron believes she could have sold it for tens of thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
	The only income she had was $530 a week from the Londonderry  
library and a part-time job at a college library. 
</P>
<P>
	She went to Washington in September 1997, the one year  
anniversary of Bruce's suicide, and met with the chief investigator 
for the Senate Finance Committee. ``My life has been destroyed by 
the IRS' abuses,'' she told him. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were terrible times. Sleepless nights. Headaches. A  
nervous stomach. Weight she gained from the emotional stress, and, 
correspondingly, weight her daughter lost, so much that she looked 
like a skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrie Elizabeth's grades dropped and she failed Algebra II  
after receiving A's in Algebra I. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barron is using part of the insurance money to send her  
daughter, now 19, to Champlain College in Burlington, Vt., where 
she is a freshman. She also paid off part of the mortgage on her 
Derry home. 
</P>
<P>
	She believes the IRS reforms will protect others from some of  
the horrors she and her family went through. Particularly 
important, she says, was reforming the agency's use of penalties, 
which grew and grew as the Barrons' case dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time they notified us of what we owed, it was far too  
great,'' Mrs. Barron says. At the time of Bruce's death, the 
couple's tax debt, with interest and penalties, was more than 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute arose after they lost $80,000 in a mid-1980s  
recycling plant investment, a loss they deducted from their taxes 
on advice of their accountant. Six years later, the IRS audited the 
Barrons and disallowed the deduction. The agency then assessed them 
tax liabilities of more than $225,000, including interest, for the 
years 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1992, Brennan says. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of real estate and business losses during the early  
1990s' economic slump, the Barrons were unable to pay the 
staggering tax liability, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the January IRS reforms is to suspend interest and most  
penalties for individual taxpayers if the IRS fails to provide a 
tax liability notice within 18 months after a return is filed in a 
timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barrons offered a compromise settlement of $30,500, Brennan  
says, but an agent rejected it in 1995 and resumed collection 
efforts, which the IRS defended at the time as legal. In an 
internal memo, the agent said the offer would have been accepted if 
increased by just $2,610, but the Barrons were not told this. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barron says the IRS settlement was a vindication -- and a  
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't enjoy suing the federal government ...,'' she says.  
``It certainly dominated my life.''

<HEADLINE> Aamodt Nears Kjus; Maier Is Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt closed  
within 32 points of teammate Lasse Kjus today in the battle for the 
overall World Cup season title, which will be decided in Sunday's 
season-ending giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt finished second in today's slalom in a combined time of 1  
minute, 50.67 seconds, just behind winner Thomas Stangassinger of 
Austria in 1:50.44. Third went to Italy's Marco Casanova (1:51.19). 
The win gave Stangassinger his first World Cup season slalom title 
after being runner-up the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus finished 13th in 1:54.05.  
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt's second-place finish was worth 80 points, pushing his  
season total to 1,397. Kjus got 20 points for 13th, moving his 
total to 1,429 in one of the closest finishes of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermann Maier, last year's overall champion and the only other  
skier with a chance for the season title, finished 16th, got no 
points and was eliminated with 1,307 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure has been on the both of us,'' Kjus said of  
Aamodt. ``Tomorrow will be difficult, but I can only do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would liked to have had this wrapped up a long time ago,''  
added Kjus, who predicted he might clinch the title today. ``But 
that's what's exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt was more than happy with his slalom.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping for a chance to gain some points on Lasse. This  
is more than I expected,'' Aamodt said. ``I've had pressure before 
to catch up and now the pressure is on both of us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've both been skiing for 10 years. It will be a championship  
race tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maier made a joke about skiing in slalom, his worst event, after  
saying earlier in the week he would skip it. Maier wore a bright 
yellow wig and smiled broadly after he was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my season and I'm not angry,'' he said. ``I've  
had a fabulous two years. I've got two Olympic golds, two golds 
from the world championships, the overall last year and so on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In giant slalom, Aamodt has a better season World Cup record  
than Kjus. Aamodt, the 1994 overall World Cup champion, has 
finished in the top four three times this season. Kjus, the '96 
overall winner, has yet to crack the top four. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt also has six World Cup wins in giant slalom, to Kjus'  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Stangassinger, runner-up the last two seasons in slalom to  
injured teammate Thomas Sykora and the 1994 Olympic slalom 
champion, finished the season with 566 points. Of the season's nine 
races, he won two and was second three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The course -- still choppy and rutted -- was better prepared under  
sunny skies after women slalom skiers threatened a strike Friday 
and refused to ski the second leg of the race, forcing organizers 
to cancel the slalom event.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Blast Kills One Motorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A tanker truck carrying thousands of  
gallons of fuel overturned and exploded on a freeway Friday night, 
killing a motorist, hurling flaming debris for 60 yards and 
stopping traffic for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanker's driver sustained second- and third-degree burns on  
75 percent of his body, said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Denise Medina. He was airlifted to a hospital where he was in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw this guy come out of the truck fully engulfed in  
flames and just running,'' said witness Vanessa Juarez. ``His whole 
body was on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motorist was found in the wreckage of a car after  
firefighters had controlled the intense flames. The identity of the 
victim was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck overturned around 9 p.m. on northbound Interstate 5  
about 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. It was not clear 
what caused the tanker driver to lose control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bunch of burned vehicles and it's quite a mess out  
there,'' Medina said. ``The Fire Department is out there trying to 
disentangle the vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Highway Patrol spokesman Mark Reeves said the interstate was  
expected to remain closed for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of the explosion hurled flaming pieces of the truck  
more than 60 yards, said Robyn Butler, a spokeswoman for the 
Anaheim Fire Department.

<HEADLINE> Blast Outside N.C. Abortion Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A bomb exploded outside an abortion  
clinic Saturday, causing no injuries and little damage because the 
device only detonated partially. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was placed outside the Femcare clinic, next to a wall  
near where the waiting room is located, said Police Chief Will 
Annarino. It went off at about a half-hour before the clinic was to 
open at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared to be a very large device,'' Annarino said. ``I  
really can't get into how large it is right now. But it appears it 
could have caused a lot of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that  
received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium 
anthrax. Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	It was premature to discuss whether the package and the  
explosion are related, Annarino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had no immediate comment on the explosion. Agents with  
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also were called 
in to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Asheville is in western North Carolina, about 125 miles west of  
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph is believed to be hiding in  
the mountains of western North Carolina. He has been a fugitive 
since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion 
clinic that killed an off-duty policeman and severely wounded a 
nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three  
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that 
killed one person. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Clinton administration said it plans to seek  
$4.5 million for alarm systems and closed-circuit camera systems to 
protect abortion clinics to counter violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also would be used to determine which clinics were  
most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Program Would Allow DNA Tracking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- One stick of a pin. A couple drops of  
blood. Proof of identity for a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Department of Law Enforcement figures it makes too  
much sense not to try. After all, DNA can be used to prove guilt or 
innocence, identify infants switched at birth and identify bodies 
when a loved one is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when the department offered three school districts an  
opportunity to give parents a free ID kit with their children's 
DNA, only one district agreed. And that district, Leon County 
schools, used only 300 of the 500 donated kits. 
</P>
<P>
	Such reluctance is a mystery to law enforcement officers at all  
levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the whole privacy issue,'' said John Rabun, vice  
president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children. ``Parents are saying, 'Wait a minute, this is me on that 
sample, or my child. I don't want outsiders deciding what to do 
with that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But under the FDLE's pilot program, an outsider wouldn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Children gave blood at three Leon County elementary schools in  
February, but only with parental permission, and parents were 
required to be present. And once the drop of blood was sealed on a 
special chemical paper for long-term storage, it was sent home with 
the parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a drop was kept by the government. But this program has been  
adopted in no state, even though the cost is less than $1.50 per 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the `Big Brother is watching' syndrome,'' said Bill  
Johnson, spokesman for the Brevard County School District, which 
turned down the program. ``Everybody's concerned that we are 
tracking people and that kind of thing. The concerns are 
unjustified in my view. I think we need to do everything and 
anything we can to protect our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County schools also rejected the DNA program.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the testing of students,'' Deputy Superintendent Henry  
Fraind said. ``We just don't get involved if we don't have to. We 
get offered so many different things with various ID cards or blood 
tests. For us, everything seems to be a liability issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has heard all of these concerns before. Bill Hagmaier,  
chief of the bureau's violent crime analysis lab in Quantico, Va., 
said fingerprinting also once concerned the public, and that people 
will learn to like DNA when they better understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	Its most valuable asset to law enforcement is its ability to  
identify a decomposed or dismembered body. Although such a tragedy 
is unimaginable, especially for a parent, Hagmaier said it happens 
more often than people think. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a week that goes by where there aren't remains  
found somewhere of some human being,'' Hagmaier said. ``The key is 
the investigator finding some way to identify the victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When 9-year-old Jimmy Ryce was abducted in Miami in September  
1995, raped and dismembered, authorities had to resort to using DNA 
from the boy's parents to get a positive identification of the 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you'd just had another Jimmy Ryce case, I can guarantee you  
all three schools would have done it, and you'd have run out of 
(DNA) paper,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA kits were offered by Life Technologies of Rockville, Md.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it had forensic value,'' said Markus Hunkeler, the  
company's senior business manager for genetic and identity testing 
products. ``An infant footprint or fingerprint will change over 
time. The genetic material of a person at birth will never 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All members of the military must now give a DNA sample, which  
means there is virtually no chance that the United States will ever 
bury another unknown soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the general wariness, Leon County Superintendent Bill  
Montford called the pilot program a success. Other schools have 
called wanting to sample their children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction was also positive from parents who took their  
children to Pineview Elementary one evening for the samples, 
although children had mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's that? She's gonna stick me,'' 6-year-old Carl Bryan  
protested when a nurse assistant brought out a needle. 
</P>
<P>
	He cried, kicked and screamed until his mother agreed to do  
without the sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl couldn't be persuaded by an offer of pizza, a $1 bribe or  
even the proud announcement by 8-year-old Eboni Major that ``It 
didn't hurt. I wasn't scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents, on the other hand, were grateful.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm keeping this in the envelope with the birth  
certificates,'' Sharon Conyers said of the DNA sample from her 
12-year-old son, Cedrick. ``It'll be one of my most important 
papers.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA South Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Coach Mike Jarvis thought it was an omen  
when he lost the blue jewel in his Sweet 16 ring that he earned 
with George Washington in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The stone fell out in the middle of the Red Storm's 86-61  
victory over Indiana on Saturday in the second round at the South 
Regional. Student manager Alex Perez found the stone under the 
bench and held on to it until the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was halfway through the first half when I noticed the stone  
in his ring had popped out,'' said Perez, who put it in his coat 
pocket and didn't mention it to Jarvis until after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to replace this one anyway,'' Jarvis told Perez.  
``It's time to put in a red one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez responded ``the only difference is the new one will say  
Final Four on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis smiled and said, ``that's right.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IN THE ZONE:* Mike Jarvis may have learned the finer points of  
man-to-man defense from Indiana coach Bob Knight, but the St. 
John's coach knew better than to try to beat the master at his own 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm trailed 15-9 in the first half before Jarvis  
switched to a zone. ``We weren't going to play Indiana for 40 
minutes man-to-man,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's went on a 36-15 run to close out the first half.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was the most zone we've played all season and possibly in  
my life,'' Jarvis said. ``We decided to stay with it until they 
scored three baskets in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoosiers, who made their first three 3-pointers, went just  
1-for-15 from behind the arc against the zone and couldn't hit 
three straight hoops until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOODBYE, DOC:* Throughout the South Regional, Creighton coach  
Dana Altman found himself thinking about a loyal Bluejays 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Bevilacqua, who passed away in October, had come around the  
school every day for the last 30 years and gotten to know the 
players and Altman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made me feel like the most important person in the world,''  
Altman said. ``But then I found out he made everyone who knew him 
feel like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bluejays dedicated the season to ``Doc'' and wore a patch on  
their shorts to remember him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd be extremely proud of the way we fought back,'' Creighton  
star Rodney Buford said after the Cardinals' 75-63 loss to 
Maryland. ``He's probably clapping right now because we turned the 
program around. We made it to the tournament and that's all he 
wanted us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HORNS:* The Orlando Arena horn, which shorted out on Thursday,  
was fixed on Saturday. The replacement parts didn't arrive in time 
for Saturday's games, so a Mac Truck horn was used instead. In fact 
the horn seemed to work too well, once going off in the middle of a 
play. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE REBOUND:* Indiana's vaunted defense allowed St. John's  
45 points to in the first half, two days after giving up 57 to 
George Washington in the second half. ... Maryland was the highest 
ranked opponent that Creighton played since the 1975 NCAA 
tournament when the Bluejays lost to the second-ranked Terrapins. 
... Indiana freshman center Kirk Haston, who was playing with a 
thick bandage on his broken left hand, had 43 points and 19 
rebounds in the two games to lead the Hoosiers.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Fan Became Lawyer, Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The one-story building where Morris Engelberg has a law office  
is identified by a large sign as the Yankee Clipper Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dozen or so parking spaces in front of the building in  
Hollywood, Fla., was one reserved for the Yankee Clipper himself, 
Joe DiMaggio. It was space No. 5, the number he wore. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg's spot is right next to it -- that's how close the  
lawyer had become to the Hall of Fame centerfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	He was DiMaggio's lawyer, his next-door neighbor, the executor  
of his will and the buffer between the baseball great and anyone 
who wanted to get near him -- fans, media and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very protective of DiMaggio. He kept Joe in a cocoon,  
which is exactly what DiMaggio wanted,'' said Marty Appel, a former 
Yankees public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
	``DiMaggio always had someone like that in his life. Morris  
Engelberg was the last one. But Joe always made the decisions, 
especially when it came to the business of memorabilia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Engelberg, however, the relationship went beyond business  
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	When DiMaggio died Monday shortly after midnight, Engelberg was  
at his bedside. And on Thursday, he was a pallbearer at the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``An Orthodox Jew a pallbearer at a Catholic funeral. What do  
you think of that?'' Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first time their religions had crossed.  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio held Engelberg's grandson, Harrison, when the baby had  
his ritual circumcision, an honor usually reserved for a religious, 
righteous man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rabbi asked me, `He's not Jewish?' I said, `No, but he is  
righteous,' '' Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how close they were became apparent in December, when  
DiMaggio was fighting the lung infection that eventually killed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in bad shape, in and out of a coma, he was bleeding  
from the nose, he couldn't breathe. I figured this was it,'' 
Engelberg said. ``That's when I realized the date, December 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``I squeezed his hand and said, `Joe, you can't die the same day  
as my father.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	His dad had died three months before Engelberg was born, and  
some might say DiMaggio was the father he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Brooklyn where everyone was a Dodgers fan, but I  
was a Joe DiMaggio fan,'' Engelberg said. ``I had pictures of him, 
I memorized his statistics. When I was 10 years old I combed my 
hair in a pompadour like DiMaggio did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg turned 59 the day before his hero died, and it was the  
first time in 16 years that DiMaggio was unable to give him an 
autographed baseball bat as a birthday present. Engelberg's 
favorite was the one he got when he turned 56. DiMaggio wrote: 
``Keep the streak alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg never lost his adoration of the Yankee Clipper, even  
as an adult. At 6-foot-5 and with the trim build of an athlete, 
Engelberg even resembled DiMaggio from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg prefers dark-colored, well-tailored suits, white  
shirts and conservative ties, carefully knotted -- just the way Joe 
D. used to dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg, who played basketball at Brooklyn College, emulated  
DiMaggio's batting stance and smooth gait in the outfield when he 
played sandlot baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran in a couple of New York Marathons, and when I finally  
completed one, my uncle said, `Well, now you've accomplished your 
goal,' and I told him, `All I have to do now is meet Joe DiMaggio,' 
'' Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got that opportunity, he was stunned.  
</P>
<P>
	A client with an interest in a Florida golf resort had hired  
DiMaggio as a public relations spokesman and asked him to call the 
lawyer at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife answered the phone, and said it was Joe DiMaggio. I  
couldn't speak,'' Engelberg said. ``I had to compose myself, and 
told her, `Tell him I'll call him back.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, they met at the resort for breakfast.  
</P>
<P>
	By now, Engelberg was a successful business lawyer and DiMaggio  
confided that he was concerned about losing his job as a spokesman 
for the Bowery Savings Bank in New York. He appeared in television 
commercials and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he needed the income,'' Engelberg said. ``He was  
getting well under six figures a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two went to New York to negotiate a new contract, and  
Engelberg said he got a three-year deal that put another digit in 
front of what DiMaggio had been making. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called Joe and told him to meet me at the Stage Deli,''  
Engelberg said. ``I told him what the deal was. He reached into his 
inside jacket pocket, took out a checkbook and wrote a check for 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way I was going to take money from the man I had  
worshipped. I tore up the check, dropped the pieces on the table 
and told him his fee was the tab for the corned beef sandwiches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there also were deals that never came off, like the one  
Simon &AMP; Schuster thought it had wrapped up for a DiMaggio book. 
Engelberg thought so, too, but DiMaggio skimmed the outline and 
vetoed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were about nine pages dealing with DiMaggio's marriages  
to Dorothy Arnold and Marilyn Monroe, and the rest had to do with 
his baseball career,'' Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Joe said, `I'll be going on all those TV shows for  
interviews and all they'll want to talk about is Marilyn.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He turned down a lot of money because of that, but Joe was not  
impressed with wealth. He would say, `How much do I need?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said DiMaggio never forgot his background.  
</P>
<P>
	``Joe came from a poor family. He slept in the same bed with his  
brothers when they were growing up,'' he said. ``They didn't have 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For much of his adult life DiMaggio lived in hotels. But,  
finally, he found himself in an elegant resort community in Florida 
that was not near restaurants where he could get pasta, pizza or 
kosher-style deli food, and he grew unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Engelberg persuaded him to move to a home built  
right next to his in a gated community. They spent a great deal of 
time in each other's den, watching baseball and football, and 
playing with Engelberg's grandchildren and DiMaggio's 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``The houses are almost duplicates,'' Engelberg said. ``The only  
thing different are the keys.''

<HEADLINE> Pac-10 Packs up Early in Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The first reaction in the Stanford locker room:  
shocked silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the tears.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts deeply,'' said Arthur Lee, the guard who ended his  
college career by leading the Cardinal with 24 points Saturday but 
couldn't stop the 3-point shelling by Gonzaga in an 82-74 upset. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a Stanford team led by four senior starters that had  
gone so far a year ago, reaching the Final Four before falling to 
the eventual champion, and had begun this season with every 
expectation of going farther. 
</P>
<P>
	Those expectations weren't based just on the polls that ranked  
them so high all year, or the boasts of their fans, who rocked 
their home court with all the spirit of championship contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	To a man, Stanford's players had written down in preseason  
practice the goal of winning the Pac-10 title and going back to the 
Final Four and taking it all. 
</P>
<P>
	They met the first challenge, but fell flat in the NCAA  
tournament against a smaller, quicker Gonzaga team that shredded 
them with 11-for-20 3-point shooting and outhustled them for a 
47-33 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a Stanford team of experienced players losing to a tiny  
Jesuit school in Spokane, Wash., named for the patron saint of 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give them a lot of credit for the way they played and the  
heart they had on the inside,'' Stanford's Mark Madsen said. ``They 
may not have been the quickest players, but they had a lot of 
heart, and that goes a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pac-10 packed up early this year, UCLA, Arizona and  
Washington bowing out in the first round, Stanford in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	All that proud tradition -- the 15 NCAA titles, the 30 Final Four  
appearances, the oh-so-close finish by Stanford a year ago -- meant 
nothing to the upstarts who quickly ambushed all four Pac-10 teams 
in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very surprised,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said of  
the conference's collapse. ``If you asked us what happened, each of 
us would have our own little story to tell. And those four stories 
add up the fact that we're all out. We will certainly pay a price, 
and we'll be reading about this and hearing about this for a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery sought to ease the burden of expectations on his team  
all season, saying they came from other people. He tried to do the 
same thing after the loss Saturday, claiming ``the Final Four thing 
(from last year) is totally out of whack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the team had come close to the championship last  
year, he said, didn't mean it would be able to do it again. 
Especially with four players injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectations were difficult for us,'' he said.  
``Everything we did was not quite good enough. Today it's extremely 
disappointing, but it doesn't diminish what we accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford players could, indeed, take pride in putting the  
school back on the basketball map the last two years after decades 
of trying. But there was no hiding how deeply this loss cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew what we were capable of doing,'' senior Peter Sauer  
said, ``and we didn't do it.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Wants FCC Revamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency responsible for overseeing  
television and telephone companies needs to be revamped to have a 
competitive rather than regulatory mission, one of the House's top 
telecommunications lawmakers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee is holding a  
hearing on the Federal Communications Commission next week. The 
panel's chairman, Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., said he hopes to have a 
bill drafted by June detailing some changes in the FCC's mission 
and structure. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Tauzin said he doesn't have many specifics and is open  
to suggestions. FCC Chairman Bill Kennard has said he's interested 
in working with lawmakers to help the agency run effectively into 
the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said Friday that he will present at the hearing a  
blueprint for restructuring the agency that would be open to public 
comment. He said that by the fall he would like to have a final 
plan, some of which the FCC could implement on its own and other 
parts that would require congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard indicated he would be open to further reorganization and  
streamlining, but the plan wouldn't reduce the number of FCC 
commissioners, currently five. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need change, but we don't need chaos,'' Kennard said,  
adding that it's important that the agency's work not be 
interrupted by the restructuring debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the GOP-controlled Congress have criticized the  
FCC for acting too regulatory, particularly in its implementation 
of a 1996 law freeing cable, local and long-distance companies to 
get into each other's business. But it's not clear whether any 
measure to overhaul the FCC could pass Congress and be signed into 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their role is not to meticulously regulate; their role is to  
find every way not to do that -- but every way to find the 
competitive alternative,'' Tauzin told reporters after giving a 
speech to telecommunications analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard's blueprint will include a goal that in five years, with  
the FCC's guidance, the telecommunications market will be fully 
competitive and free of many regulations that now apply to dominant 
telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said he hopes the debate over revamping the FCC doesn't  
become ``a backdoor attempt to rewrite the 1996 act,'' which he 
called ``fundamentally sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin expressed concerns that the FCC takes too much time to  
decide various requests made by businesses, including requests for 
corporate mergers. As a result, his bill could include ``reasonable 
time limits'' for the FCC to act on such applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said his blueprint deals with how to speed up FCC  
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, meanwhile, didn't rule out trying to limit the FCC's  
authority to review mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard defended continuing the FCC's authority in this  
area. ``Fundamentally this agency has a role in merger review 
because it is not duplicative of what the Department of Justice 
does,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the Justice Department or the Federal Trade  
Commission conducts antitrust reviews on mergers involving 
telecommunications companies to determine whether they would be 
good for competition and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has a broader legal standard involving the public  
interest, which can include antitrust considerations.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Marks Day Ship Finally Sank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- The bow portion of the New Carissa has  
finally sunk to the ocean floor. Now attention turns to the last 
chunk of the ship that has been mired in the sands off the Oregon 
coast for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Kitzhaber declared the day the freighter sank  
``Two-thirds of the New Carissa at the Bottom of the Ocean Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing more stubborn and uncooperative than Mother  
Nature was the New Carissa herself,'' Kitzhaber wrote in his 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Coast Guard officials said that a Friday flyover of the  
site found that about 500 gallons of oil had spilled during the 
sinking the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy demolitions experts first blew holes in the broken bow  
section of the New Carissa with explosives, then a destroyer 
riddled the wreck with 70 artillery rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	When the stubborn ship insisted on staying afloat, they had a  
nuclear submarine fire a torpedo. That provided the knockout blast. 
The ship now sits two miles down, where its remaining 130,000 
gallons of fuel oil can do no more harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight oil slicks on the surface were too small to skim and  
would likely never reach shore, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll just swirl out there,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr.  
Dawayne Penberthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot New Carissa first washed ashore at Coos Bay on Feb.  
4 and began leaking oil four days later. Efforts to burn the 
400,000 gallons of fuel oil on board succeeded in burning only half 
of it away. The ship split in two and spilled 70,000 gallons on 
southern Oregon's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	When salvage crews tried to tow it out to sea last week, it  
broke away from the tow line and again washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining third of the wreck is still stuck in the surf near  
Coos Bay. The Coast Guard, salvage officials and others plan to 
meet next Friday to consider their options. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Kitzhaber has said he wants a $25 million bond posted by  
the ship's Japanese owners to assure that the problem will be dealt 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is worried about liability if someone gets hurt at the  
stern wreck, which is on property controlled by the Division of 
State Lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nor is it enthusiastic about the image of that ship on its  
shores,'' said Langdon Marsh, the head of the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Friday, more than 774 dead birds have washed up on shore,  
351 of them splotched with oil.

<HEADLINE> Nothing Found in Ex-Speaker Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 20-month investigation by the FBI that spanned a  
dozen states and used electronically wired informants showed no 
political corruption by the late House Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr., 
The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret probe lasted from 1979 to 1981 when the House speaker  
was playing a major role in national affairs as an ally of 
President Jimmy Carter, said the newspaper, which obtained 
government documents through requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI suspected O'Neill used his political clout to win about  
$3 million in federal loans and guarantees for projects in which he 
and his associates had financial interests. For a time, the FBI 
suspected that O'Neill had received $65,000 in kickbacks for his 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI fitted an informant, who told investigators that O'Neill  
had received payoffs, with a transmitter and recording device to 
record conversations with O'Neill and his associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI suspected from three hours of recorded conversations  
that one or more of O'Neill's associates was involved in some 
unspecified ``illegal acts'' on behalf of the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	At the peak of the investigation in February 1981, the FBI  
conducted 25 interviews. However, FBI records conclude the 
investigation met with ``negative results regarding allegations 
concerning Congressman O'Neill and the misuse of his office,'' the 
Globe said.

<HEADLINE> Smithers Wins NCAA Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWRY, N.H. (AP) -- Jayme Smithers had to be consoled by his  
Denver teammates when he finished 25th in the giant slalom in the 
NCAA Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	When he won the slalom Friday, his teammates tackled and jumped  
on him, the difference between losing and winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithers, a sophomore from British Columbia, came from fifth  
place to win his first collegiate race and keep alive Denver's 
slipping hopes for its first title since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's race, Linda Wikstrom, skiing for her late  
roommate, won and helped move defending champion Colorado back into 
first place with only today's classical cross-country races 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Wikstrom, second after the first run at Sunday River, overtook  
Dartmouth's Jennifer Collins to win in 1 minute, 45.08 seconds. 
Collins finished in 1:45.93. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all for her,'' Wikstrom said of Lucie Hasunova, a  
member of the team who was killed in a snowmobile accident in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado team has dedicated these championships to her  
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, the defending champion, led after the first-day's  
giant slalom races, but Utah took a 1 1/2-point lead over the 
Buffaloes after Thursday's freestyle cross-country races. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of Friday's races, Colorado was back on top with 514  
points. Utah had one of its women disqualified and fell back with 
494.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont was third with 481, Dartmouth fourth at 434 and Denver,  
one of the favorites, fifth at 429. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty good cushion,'' Colorado coach Richard Rokos  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithers started 17th in the first run of the slalom and was  
1.37 seconds behind Stefan Lanziner of New Mexico. But the hard, 
fast snow gave him a chance to make it up for his first college 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start first, you have to go for it; it's a clean  
course,'' Denver coach Kurt Smitz said. ``He seized the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smithers won in 1:33.32, with Lanziner second in 1:33.39.

<HEADLINE> NCAA South Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Auburn teammates Adrian Chilliest and Mark  
McGadney may want to stay away from one another next game. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Chilliest punched his teammate midway through the  
second half of Auburn's second-round victory over Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a deliberate blow. Chilliest was just celebrating an  
Auburn basket and throwing a couple of punches in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	McGadney just happened to be standing nearby and the blow from  
the 6-foot-5, 235-pound Chilliest resulted in the 6-7, 215-pound 
McGadney keeping an ice pack on his chin for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONG ABSENCE:* Auburn is in the NCAA tournament for the first  
time since 1988 and it's been even longer since the Tigers were 
among the final 16 teams competing for a championship. The last 
time they advanced past the second round was in 1986 when they lost 
to eventual national champion Louisville in the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's 81-74 victory over Oklahoma State gave it bragging  
rights in the state of Alabama. It was Auburn's 29th triumph, 
giving it more victories than any other college team in the state. 
The Crimson Tide of Alabama held the record at 28 until this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ELLIS UNDEFEATED:* Auburn coach Cliff Ellis has an  
accomplishment that few college coaches can claim. He's never lost 
a game to a team coached by Eddie Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Saturday was only the second time the two were on  
opposing benches. The previous meeting came when Ellis was coaching 
Clemson and his team upset No. 20 Oklahoma State 68-65 in the 1993 
Rainbow Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Both coaches can boast of impressive success. Sutton is 632-252  
in 29 years and ranks third among active coaches in victories. 
Ellis heads to the regional semifinals with a 444-270 mark in 24 
years as a Division I coach. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MISSING BUCKEYE:* Big Ten runner-up Ohio State advanced to a  
regional semifinal date with top-seeded Auburn despite being 
without one of its top reserves for both games in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Neshaun Coleman arrived here with a strep throat and he remained  
in the team's hotel through its two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran a temperature as high as 103,'' said coach Jim O'Brien,  
who is hoping Coleman can play in Thursday's game at Knoxville, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman is one of Ohio State's top 3-point shooters, having hit  
37 percent (32-of-86) this season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PENN'S REBOUNDS:* Scoonie Penn's shooting touch may not be  
there, but he's contributing in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, Ohio State's 5-foot-10 guard, pulled down a career-high 12  
rebounds Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my shot is not on, I'm not going to worry about it,'' he  
said. ``That is the most rebounds in my life, college, high school 
or anywhere. ... I can be a floor leader or a rebounder like I was 
today, whatever it takes to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's previous high in a game this season was seven and his  
career-high in college was 10 against Massachusetts when he was 
playing for Boston College in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went into his rebounding game,'' O'Brien said. ``He figures  
he's going to get double-figure rebounds because he can't make the 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOPEFULLY NOT:* Oklahoma State point guard Doug Gottlieb had a  
tiring job on Saturday. The nation's leader in assists was guarding 
Auburn guard Scott Pohlman much of the game and was also defended 
by him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pohlman ran me to death,'' said Gottlieb, who had 12 assists  
to finish the season with 288 and a school-record 500 in two 
seasons. ``He moved without the ball well, obviously, he was 
feeling it and he got some good looks. He hit big shots and every 
time he got open, it seemed like he hit the shot.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Exec: Utah Gov. Knew Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The former head of Salt Lake's bid  
committee says Gov. Mike Leavitt knew relatives of International 
Olympic Committee members were getting scholarships from Olympic 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Former bid committee president Tom Welch said Leavitt even  
considered soliciting scholarships from local colleges on behalf of 
the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, whose Olympic role thus far has been righteous  
indignation at the scandal and who spearheaded the reform movement, 
denies the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch told The Salt Lake Tribune in a copyright story that he  
met with Leavitt in early 1993 to discuss how the new governor 
could help Salt Lake City land the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholarships to Utah schools for IOC children, Welch said,  
helped promote the state as a friendly place where foreign visitors 
could fit in. Welch said bid-committee vice president Dave Johnson 
and committee chairman Frank Joklik also were at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a pretty Caucasian slice of America,'' Welch said  
Friday. ``There were questions about the kind of community we were. 
Our thinking was the best thing we could do is have (IOC members') 
kids come and have a good experience here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said one of the things (Leavitt) could do is to get the  
schools to pay for the scholarships. He said he would look into it. 
I don't know that it was ever pursued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt has denied any knowledge of $1 million given to IOC  
members and their relatives for tuition, rent, health care, cash 
payments and other inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik also denied discussing scholarships with Welch or  
Leavitt. Neither Johnson nor his attorney, Max Wheeler, could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's comments echo those of Ken Bullock, who said he alerted  
Leavitt, executive-committee members and reporters to the 
scholarships and lavish treatment of IOC members more than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock was appointed to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
board in 1995, after Salt Lake won the bid. He said he pieced the 
National Olympic Committee assistance program together by examining 
the budget and asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't give you time, dates and locations,'' Bullock said.  
``I never in my wildest dreams thought that I needed to keep a 
diary. ... What the governor says is his business. But I know what 
I know and I know who I told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, city officials learned the 2002 Winter Games will  
carry a $22.8 million price tag. Officials anticipate covering 
about $13.4 million of that total with grants, sponsorship revenue 
and other revenue. But that still leaves $9.4 million unfunded. 
</P>
<P>
	``That number is our worst-case scenario at this stage of the  
game,'' city Management Services director Roger Black said. ``This 
is our first stab at putting this on the table. ... There is a 
great deal of refinement that has to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black also is a member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures, in the preliminary ``Olympic Opportunities Master  
Plan'' released Friday, detail the city's cost for extra 
infrastructure, police and fire protection, street maintenance and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the additional expenses forecast are increased airport  
security, downtown decorations and pageantry, visitor entertainment 
away from Olympic venues, beefed-up police and fire protection and 
Olympic-related library programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Policing the games alone will cost an additional $10.5 million,  
according to the report. Bracing for potential electrical fires at 
the media center at the Salt Palace will cost $3 million and 
additional, multilingual airport security could run $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenses in the report are separate from the $1.45 billion  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee budget, which only covers expenses 
related to the games themselves -- housing athletes and media, 
providing services at events, venues and opening and closing 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are working with SLOC officials to hammer out an  
agreement spelling out in detail the responsibilities of each.

when Furlough outgamed heavily-favored Catinca for a head victory 
in the 45th running of the $174,350, Grade II event. Tomorrows 
Sunshine was another length back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGaughey sent out Cadillacing to win the Distaff for owner

Honorable Miss Stakes last Aug. 5. The 5-year-old Easy Goer mare 
earned $104,510 with her seventh win in 25 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Furlough returned $30.20, $7.20 and $4.60. Catinca paid $2.60

<HEADLINE> Some Actors Outraged by Kazan Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Phoebe Brand cannot excuse Elia Kazan. She  
cannot forget that nearly 47 years ago, the great director named 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	She cannot forget because hers was one of those names.  
</P>
<P>
	``I forgive,'' she says. ``I forgive a lot, but I don't think I  
can forgive Kazan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Kazan told a congressional committee that Miss Brand had  
been a member of the Communist Party, he punched her ticket for the 
blacklist. Forty years would pass before the actress would appear 
in a film. 
</P>
<P>
	But at that same moment, Kazan sealed his own fate. For the rest  
of his life, Kazan would be known as Broadway's best director -- AND 
as a McCarthy-era Judas. He would be remembered for films like ``On 
the Waterfront'' and ``East of Eden'' -- AND for destroying 
colleagues' careers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 89 years old now. Next Sunday night his own career will be  
crowned with a signal honor, an Academy Award for lifetime 
achievement. But the honor has been overshadowed by screams of 
outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Age and ability in the arts or anything else, in my opinion,  
does not excuse a crime,'' says Rod Steiger, star of ``On the 
Waterfront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the good guys win,'' rejoins Charleton Heston.  
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the lifetime achievement award is a deathless pause in  
the Oscars' relentless pageant of glitz. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year will be different. Expect protests and  
counter-demonstrations, lusty cheers and stone silence -- all 
because of something that happened before many of us were born, at 
a time when Americans hated and feared the Soviet Union, a country 
that no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other figure who testified, Kazan remains a  
lightning rod for those who despise what happened in those days, 
even as others applaud him as a truth-telling hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	Because a half-century after America went on a hunt for  
Communists in its government, its media and all its closets, the 
hunt -- and the fruits of that hunt -- remain a matter of contention. 
And because Kazan was the most celebrated witness to give the House 
Committee on Un-American Activities what it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he was the best director of the theater in my  
time,'' says playwright Arthur Laurents, himself a victim of the 
blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan brought ``Death of a Salesman'' and ``A Streetcar Named  
Desire'' to the stage and continued to direct the best work of two 
titans, Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams. He won praise for 
films like ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' and an Oscar for 
``Gentleman's Agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every play of worth intended for Broadway was offered me  
first. I had to shrug them off,'' Kazan recalled in ``A Life,'' his 
1988 autobiography. ``In films it was only a matter of what I 
wanted to do, name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he was at the top of the entertainment world, he wasn't born  
anywhere near it. He came into this world as Elia Kazanjioglou, and 
arrived in the United States from Turkey when he was 4. Always, he 
wrote in his memoirs, he has felt like an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan rejected the life his father expected of him: working at  
the family carpet company. Instead, he wound up at Yale Drama 
School, and then at New York's Group Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group was devoted to performing new plays that turned a  
penetrating light on American life. Its leaders were Harold Clurman 
and Lee Strasberg, perhaps two of the most influential figures in 
the history of the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Kazan who shouted ``Strike!'' at the end of Clifford  
Odets' ``Waiting for Lefty,'' a 1935 play about a taxi drivers' 
walkout. The audience roared ``Strike!'' in response -- an 
electrifying, legendary moment. 
</P>
<P>
	By this time, Kazan was a member of the Communist Party -- there  
was and is no law against it -- and he was not alone among members 
of the Group. In his book, he said there was a cell that met on 
Tuesday nights in actor Joseph Bromberg's dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Kazan, the success of ``Waiting for Lefty''  
encouraged party leaders to take a stronger hand. They told Kazan 
to inform the cell that it must lead other actors in an 
insurrection, taking control of the Group from its directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan says he did as he was told, but then told the cell that he  
disagreed with the plan. The party pressured Kazan to change his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he quit. He had been a member for less than two years,  
from the summer of 1934 to the spring of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	So much changed in the next 16 years. The Depression ended,  
taking with it many of the radical impulses of a nation in peril. 
And with World War II and its aftermath, feelings toward the Soviet 
Union evolved from suspicion to camaraderie to enmity. 
</P>
<P>
	The blacklist began in 1947 when hearings into Communist  
involvement in the film industry led to contempt charges against 
the Hollywood Ten, screenwriters who would not answer the 
committee's questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Your career could be destroyed because you refused to talk, or  
because you were named as a party member, or because ``Red 
Channels'' or some other publication reported that you were 
politically suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare, it was, and even as I talk to you about it  
now, I can feel my body being disturbed,'' says Betsy Blair Reisz. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reisz, first wife of actor Gene Kelly, was listed in ``Red  
Channels'' though she was not a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kelly's insistence, she was given a major part in the movie  
``Marty,'' for which she received an Oscar nomination, but that was 
just a chink in the blacklist. Aside from one B movie in 1959, 
Hollywood shunned her. She moved to France, then England making 
films in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It knocked people out of the box for 15 years,'' says Victor  
Navasky, editor of ``The Nation'' and author of ``Naming Names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1952, Kazan testified before the House committee.  
Yes, he said, he had been a Communist. No, he said, he would not 
name others he knew to be members of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months later, he did just that.  
</P>
<P>
	What happened in the meantime? Kazan, in his book, said that  
producer Darryl Zanuck's pleas did not move him to name names; 
instead, he said he came to realize that he no longer agreed with 
the Communist program, and he abhorred the party's stealth. 
</P>
<P>
	And so he named:  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Leverett. Joseph Bromberg. Phoebe Brand and her husband,  
Morris Carnovsky. Odets. Paula Miller (Lee Strasberg's wife). Art 
Smith. And others he knew who were not members of the Group 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	Most, if not all, had been named by others. Bromberg had died  
that year; he was already blacklisted, and had gone to London for 
work despite a weak heart. Kazan said he and Odets had agreed to 
name each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan testified in executive session. The next day, the  
committee released his testimony. And the day after that, Kazan 
placed an ad in The New York Times -- a defiant explanation of what 
he had done, written by his wife, Molly, under his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secrecy serves the Communists,'' the statement insisted. ``At  
the other pole, it serves those who are interested in silencing 
liberal voices. The employment of good liberals is threatened 
because they have allowed themselves to become associated with or 
silenced by the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Liberals must speak out.''  
</P>
<P>
	The response was immediate. Old friends -- friends who knew him  
by his nickname, ``Gadg,'' short for ``Gadget'' -- cut him dead, 
turning their heads when they saw him on the street. The statement 
in the Times didn't mollify them; it infuriated them. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Karl Malden gave him tickets for his new play, ``The  
Desperate Hours.'' He also gave tickets to actor Sam Jaffe, but 
when Jaffe learned that Kazan would be sitting in the same row, he 
canceled his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tony Kraber, a fellow member of the Group, was called to  
testify, he was asked if Kazan's testimony was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this the Kazan who signed a contract for $500,000 the day  
after he gave names to the committee?'' Kraber replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan denied it. But even if it wasn't true, Kazan's detractors  
said, he was wealthy and could have lived well without the movies. 
He could have hewed to the stage, where no blacklist existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also,'' says Arthur Laurents, ``he was in a very strong  
position. ... He could have made the committee look bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Navasky: ``He was at the top of his form when he was  
called, and people felt if he couldn't resist, how could they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he was known as a director with a social conscience,  
creator of such films as ``Gentleman's Agreement,'' which condemned 
anti-Semitism. ``He was thought to be a man of moral fiber,'' says 
Navasky, so many on the left were shocked at what they considered a 
betrayal of friends and colleagues, and his reasons are disputed to 
this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He DIDN'T name everyone in the cell,'' says Patrick  
McGilligan, co-author of ``Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the 
Hollywood Blacklist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He named the people he didn't like. He named the people who he  
felt condescended to him. ... He was a cutthroat guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many on the right, Kazan acted as a hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``The villains and victims have been inverted. The Communists  
should have apologized. They should have been charged with 
treason,'' says Scott McConnell, a spokesman for the Ayn Rand 
Institute who is organizing counter-demonstrations in Los Angeles 
to support Kazan on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell insists that Communists did subvert films, both with  
overt propaganda in movies like ``Mission to Moscow'' and ``Song of 
Russia,'' and with other movies that glorified self-sacrifice and 
collective work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonsense, says Laurents, whose newest play, ``Jolson Sings  
Again,'' is the story of a director who informs. ``Nobody has been 
able to point to one movie that was propaganda for the Soviet 
Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Group Theatre, ``it was not political. Everyone tried  
to make it seem so, and it was not,'' says Phoebe Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an argument that is still played out in any discussion of  
the Red Scare. American Communists were subversive agents of 
Stalin, says one side. No, says the other: They were well-meaning 
Social Democrats, though perhaps they were naive. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, the argument is an unending loop, and they cannot bear  
to discuss it or Kazan any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't talk about that. Not a word. It makes me sick,'' says  
Jules Dassin, the director who fled to Greece when he was 
blacklisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I can't talk about it,'' says Karl Malden, who as a member  
of the Academy's board proposed the lifetime achievement award for 
Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan himself is not talking. He told his story in ``A Life,''  
and some would say he told it in ``On the Waterfront,'' in which 
informing is a virtue. His lawyer, Floria V. Lasky, says he will 
not apologize when he receives the award. ``Apologize for what?'' 
she asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Bentley believes Kazan deserves the honor, and he thinks  
the firestorm he must endure is unfair. The Communists were shifty, 
he says, and Kazan acted out of principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentley didn't always feel that way. Once, he wrote a play --  
``Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?'' -- in which Kazan was one of 
the villains. Relations between the two men were less than 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he encountered Kazan at a gathering at cartoonist Al  
Hirschfeld's place. Someone who was unaware of their history tried 
to introduce them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan is ``quite coherent when he speaks ... (but) his brain is  
somewhere else a lot of the time now,'' Bentley says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put his arms around me, which is pretty hard to do, because  
he's a lot shorter than I am. And he said, `Eric, we always got 
along fine, we did.' And I thought, `No, we didn't.' But I didn't 
say anything.''

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Appeals Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian has appealed the  
first-degree murder charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The assisted suicide advocate is charged with first-degree  
murder and delivery of a controlled substance in the Sept. 17 death 
of Thomas Youk, whose death was videotaped and later shown on CBS' 
``60 Minutes.'' Youk, 52, was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian filed the emergency appeal Friday with the Michigan  
Court of Appeals just hours after prosecutors dropped the assisted 
suicide charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal, which Kevorkian attorney David Gorosh said his  
client wrote and filed himself, also asks the appellate court to 
delay the trial, scheduled to begin March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In his filing, Kevorkian contends that the Ninth Amendment  
ensures people the ``right to end their suffering,'' Gorosh told 
The Oakland Press for a story Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John N. O'Brien called Kevorkian's filing a sham.  
</P>
<P>
	``He demanded that he be charged by the prosecution and now he's  
appealing,'' O'Brien said. ``We're confident the appeal will be 
denied.''

<HEADLINE> Klondike Named Nation's Big Cheese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- In the land where cheese is king, a new  
king of cheese reigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A sturdy brick cheese made by the Klondike Cheese Co. of Monroe  
won the top prize at the U.S. Championship Cheese Contest. Klondike 
also won an award for its feta cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Milfred Severson, head cheesemaker at Klondike Cheese, has won  
four best-of-class awards at the cheese championships, but it was 
his first national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working on it for 30 years,'' Severson said. ``I  
can't describe it. I'm excited and worked up. I can hardly sit 
still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Severson's brick, bearing the Country Cheese brand, stood out  
for its flavor and appearance, said Bill Schinslog, chief judge of 
the contest where judges spent the week evaluating 577 cheeses, 
selecting best-of-class winners in 22 categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheese, chosen Thursday over the rest of the category  
winners, finished just ahead of a baby Havarti cheese from 
Tholstrup Dairies in Muskegon, Mich. Third place went to a cheddar 
made by Cabot Creamery Cooperative in Cabot, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	Entries from Wisconsin, a dairy state renowned for its devotion  
to cheese, took 36 of 66 awards in this year's contest.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gopher Says He Did His Own Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Former University of Minnesota basketball  
player Courtney James has denied that a former school staffer wrote 
papers for him while he was a student, a published report said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	James made the denial in a story published in the Star Tribune.  
He spoke to the newspaper Friday night following his team's CBA 
game in La Crosse, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	His account contrasted with other recent reports about  
allegations from Jan Gangelhoff, a former secretary in the 
university's academic counseling unit, who has said she did course 
work for at least 20 current and former Gopher basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported Wednesday that James  
confirmed that course work was prepared for him in possible 
violation of NCAA rules. The Pioneer Press quoted him as saying an 
assistant coach drove him and another player to Gangelhoff's 
residence for tutoring, another possible violation. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Paul newspaper quoted James as saying he lied, saying  
``no,'' when an investigator asked whether Gangelhoff did papers, 
to protect Gangelhoff and coach Clem Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	But James told the Star Tribune on Friday that Gangelhoff  
``never did nothing for me. She might have proofread something for 
me, but she never did any papers ... I wrote them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant professor Sander Latts told the Star Tribune earlier  
that James handed in a paper in March 1997 titled ``The Fair 
Housing Act and Black Americans,'' that was the best report ever 
submitted to him in nearly 40 years. Latts said James told him he 
wrote it in his hotel room ``while everybody else was out partying 
during their Final Four weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latts also said didn't believe James had written the paper but  
gave him a passing grade because he couldn't prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	James said Friday he didn't remember that paper, and also said  
he never went to Gangelhoff's house. ``Some players might have 
went; I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Creighton Seeks Second Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Indiana has Bob Knight coaching on the  
sidelines. Maryland has Steve Francis starring on the court. St. 
John's has Lou Carnesecca cheering in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	And Creighton? The Bluejays have high hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	``People don't know too much about us,'' top scorer Rodney  
Buford said Friday, ``but we feel we're going to be something 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton proved it belonged in the NCAA tournament by going 8-1  
against teams that made this March's field. Then, it upended 
Louisville 62-58 in the first round of the South Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 10th-seeded Bluejays meet second-seeded Maryland. In  
the other second-round game, No. 3 seed St. John's takes on No. 6 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton and Maryland have met only once, with the Terrapins  
winning 83-79 in the 1975 NCAA tournament. At the time, Maryland 
was building up its basketball tradition while Creighton was 
starting a long slide in which did not win a postseason game until 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize we've had a drought and we have to make a name for  
ourselves again,'' coach Dana Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even a big name and tradition does not ensure success at  
this time of year -- North Carolina and UCLA learned that Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure history is for everyone,'' Knight said. ``I'm not  
sure it makes a lot of difference to the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton overcame a 13-point deficit in the final 16 minutes to  
beat Louisville. Altman immediately began looking ahead, warily, to 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to play better than we have all season if  
we're going to have a chance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big win for us, but that's behind us,'' he said. ``We  
need to forget about it. But that can be tough to do when you 
haven't been in this situation before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland, expected by many to reach the Final Four, beat  
Valparaiso by 22 points in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Louisville is a name when we go into the NCAA  
tournament that obviously gets everyone's attention, so I guess a 
lot of people are surprised that we're playing Creighton,'' 
Terrapins coach Gary Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you look at the game (Thursday) and you watch how  
they played in terms of their intensity and in terms of their 
willingness to just hang in there when things weren't going their 
way, you can see why they're where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the highest scoring of their 74 NCAA tournament games,  
Indiana beat George Washington 108-88. Knight, however, noticed 
that his team gave up 57 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing against St. John's that way will allow us to do one  
thing -- get beat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's beat Samford by 26 points in the opening round. The  
Red Storm played Indiana once before in the tournament -- the 
Hoosiers won in 1976 on their way to the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play Indiana, you are playing against a system. And  
coach Knight is the master of that system,'' St. John's coach Mike 
Jarvis said.

<HEADLINE> Weber State Has Coaching Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Weber State coach Ron Abegglen's feelings this  
week must be decidedly mixed. His Wildcats have just pulled off the 
biggest victory in the history of the school, and he's about to 
lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The diminutive 62-year-old coach with the world-weary eyes will  
be prowling the sidelines at least one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats, on the heels of their stunning upset of North  
Carolina, will try to become the first Big Sky Conference team in 
22 years to advance past the second round when they play Florida 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great run,'' he said of his 38-year coaching  
career, the last eight of them at Weber State. ``How many coaches 
do you know that have lasted 38 years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abegglen would prefer to go out on his own terms. But last  
August, after his wife suffered a broken wrist in a heated argument 
with Abegglen and accused him of domestic abuse, the university 
suspended the coach for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned to the job, he announced he would retire at the  
end of the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was by mutual agreement with the administration,'' Abegglen  
insists. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the lame-duck status of the coach, the Wildcats entered  
the season with modest expectations. But with spectacular Harold 
Arceneaux providing most of the offense, surrounded by a cast of 
solid role players, Weber State dethroned veteran-laden Northern 
Arizona as the Big Sky champion, then pulled off the stunning 76-74 
victory over North Carolina on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Abegglen and his staff have tried to shield the players from any  
impact of the unusual coaching situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying to you if I said it's been easy,'' he said, ``but  
it's actually gone better than I thought it would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His players seem to have been able to put the coaching issue  
aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was there in the back of our minds, but we didn't let it  
get to us,'' senior guard Marc Lawson said. ``We tried to block it 
out, and for the most part we've been able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abegglen will match wits with one of the country's up-and-coming  
young coaches, Florida's Billy Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators' high-pressure style of play is a reflection of  
Donovan's intense personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very demanding style of play,'' Donovan said. ``People  
watch it on television and it's obviously entertaining, but I don't 
think they understand the type of shape you have to be in to play 
40 minutes of that type of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's first game at Seattle's Key Arena has Stanford, the only  
Pac-10 team still alive in the tournament, going against Gonzaga, 
which won its first NCAA tourney game ever when it beat Minnesota 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have gone into uncharted waters,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson  
said. ``If we win tomorrow, it would be even more uncharted waters. 
We'd like to get out in the ocean, and test all the waters out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga's players and coach have seen Stanford all season on  
television and are not in awe of the matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The door is open. We need to go through it. We have the  
ability, if we play well, to win,'' Monson said. ``I know everybody 
wants to pit tiny Gonzaga against big Stanford, but to me it's two 
quality basketball teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford again will be without reserve forward Jarron Collins,  
who has missed the last two games with a sprained ankle. With 
Collins out, the Cardinal has gotten little help from its subs, and 
is counting on its veteran starting five -- four seniors and a 
junior -- to get the team back to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience is definitely key right now,'' Lee said. ``We have  
been here before and we need to rely on our experience and history 
in these situations.''

<HEADLINE> Kansas, Kentucky To Square Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There's a history that entwines Kansas,  
Kentucky and North Carolina, the three teams that have won more 
games than any others in the history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But only one of trio of big-time programs will have a chance to  
win the last national championship in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky (26-8) or Kansas (23-9), playing each other in the NCAA  
tournament for the first time, will be eliminated Sunday in the 
Midwest Regional. North Carolina is already out of the tourney 
after a stunning 76-74 first-round loss to 14th-seeded Weber State. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a combined 3,434 victories between Kentucky (1,746)  
and Kansas (1,688), but the coaches realize only one will be able 
to add to that total Sunday. History will have to step aside for 
the game at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it can add any more. ... We are just concerned  
with preparing and playing the game,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams 
said Saturday. ``To the coaches and players, it's a big game 
regardless. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it is in the NCAA tournament, and it is single  
elimination, adds to it. But I think that adds to it more than the 
fact that we are playing Kentucky or they are playing Kansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-Kansas winner advances to a round-of-16 game  
against either Utah (27-4) or Miami, Ohio (23-7), who meet in 
Sunday's other game. Utah would probably just as soon play Kansas, 
because the Utes have been eliminated by Kentucky four times in the 
last five years. Kentucky won the school's seventh national title 
by beating Utah in last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, in its record 41st NCAA tourney, is the winningest  
team in history with 1,746 victories, followed by North Carolina 
(1,733) and Kansas (1,688) -- whose 286 victories in the 1990s are 
six more than the Wildcats this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it brings out the best in our players, and I know it  
will bring out best in their players,'' Kentucky coach Tubby Smith 
said. ``It's a measuring stick for each program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But again, Smith insists, it's just the next game in Kentucky's  
attempt to play in a fourth straight NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the connection among Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina,  
it dates back to the beginning of the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
	James Naismith, the inventor of the game, was the first Kansas  
coach. One of his players was Phog Allen, who went on to coach the 
Jayhawks for 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolph Rupp won 876 games in 42 years as Kentucky's coach after  
playing at Kansas under Allen. Williams, in his 11th season at 
Kansas, is a North Carolina alumnus and former assistant there for 
Dean Smith, also a former player at Kansas under Allen and the only 
coach to win more games that Rupp. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Williams is still looking for his first national  
championship. Tubby Smith is going for his second title in as many 
seasons at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats, who lost four straight road games to end the  
regular season with their most losses since 1990, have won their 
four postseason games by an average of 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this season in the Great Eight tournament in Chicago,  
Kentucky beat Kansas 63-45, holding the Jayhawks to a season-low 
15-of-51 shooing (29.4 percent). The Wildcats led 41-22 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember being embarrassed, especially the feeling in the  
locker room at halftime when we just simply got outplayed in every 
respect of the game,'' Kansas forward T.J. Pugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Eric Chenoweth, that first meeting ``is pretty much like a  
blur. It was up and down, up and down. We just couldn't get 
anything going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky has an 18-3 series advantage after winning that Dec. 1  
meeting that was the first between the teams since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams earned the rematch with convincing first-round  
victories at the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Heshimu Evans scored nine points in a 21-0 second-half spurt as  
Kentucky finally shook off New Mexico State and won 82-60. The 
defending national champs also won the title in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas had five players in double figures and a 45-15 rebounding  
advantage in a 95-74 victory over Evansville.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Fined for Refusing Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chicago hospital that did nothing to help a  
young gunshot victim dying just outside its doors has agreed to pay 
$40,000 to settle a federal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center also agreed to remind the  
community that it accepts all patients with emergency medical 
conditions. It promised to buy two quarter-page advertisements over 
the next year in Sunday editions of the Chicago Sun-Times declaring 
that Ravenswood examines patients ``without delay and regardless of 
their ability to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law requires hospitals that accept Medicare payments to  
screen and stabilize all patients who show up at their emergency 
rooms. The maximum fine for violations is $50,000. The law also 
prevents hospitals from transferring, or ``dumping,'' undesirable 
patients to other facilities if they need immediate attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed last week by lawyers for the inspector  
general of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is 
charged with enforcing this law. A copy of the agreement, signed by 
hospital president John E. Blair late last month, was obtained 
Friday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the hospital -- which could still face  
private lawsuits -- admits no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital also faced loss of Medicare payments, but the HHS  
agency that runs Medicare determined that it had adequately revised 
its emergency room policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say 15-year-old Christopher Sercye was an innocent  
bystander in a gang shooting last May, shot while playing 
basketball in an alley near the hospital. He was carried to within 
steps of the hospital by friends but sat outside for 30 minutes 
until a frustrated police officer brought him inside. He died an 
hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Ravenswood refused to leave the building to treat him  
because they thought it would have violated hospital policy. The 
hospital has since told its employees that they should help 
patients in the immediate vicinity of the building. 
</P>
<P>
	To have survived, the medical examiner found, Christopher would  
have needed an immediate operation to repair his aorta, and there 
is no way to know whether quicker action would have saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal enforcement of the ``patient dumping'' law has stepped  
up in recent years, as the HHS inspector general has used increased 
funding to go after more hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1986 to 1996, there were 66 settlements and judgments,  
totaling $1.45 million in fines. In 1997 and 1998 alone, 67 cases 
were closed, with $2.31 million in fines.

	FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) -- A tanker carrying 8,000 gallons of fuel  
overturned and exploded on a freeway, hurling fiery debris and 
killing a motorist and the trucker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old driver of the tanker succumbed to his burns  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw this guy come out of truck fully engulfed in flames

	The motorist, burned beyond recognition, was found in the  
wreckage of a car more than an hour after the crash, authorities 
said. The car and tanker collided, but it was unclear whether that 
happened before or after the truck went out of control.

<HEADLINE> Reno Denies Passing Over Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is denying a GOP  
senator's charge that federal prosecutor Charles LaBella was 
punished for disagreeing with her on how to proceed with a campaign 
fund-raising probe. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Friday, Sen. Arlen  
Specter, R-Pa., told Reno that her plan to replace LaBella, who is 
interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, with 
a subordinate, creates the ``possible inference'' that LaBella was 
passed over as a punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inference is plain wrong,'' Reno replied. ``Chuck  
LaBella's disagreement with me had nothing to do with who the U.S. 
attorney is for the Southern District of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella headed the Justice Department's campaign-finance task  
force until he left in July to become acting U.S. attorney in San 
Diego. He said he resigned last month after being told by Deputy 
Attorney General Eric Holder that the department will ask the San 
Diego federal judges to replace him with Gregory Vega, a 
subordinate federal prosecutor recommended for the job by Sen. 
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter has said Reno's move ``has all the indications of  
retribution'' for LaBella's recommendation last July that an 
independent counsel investigate allegations of abuses, chiefly by 
Democrats, in fund raising for the 1996 elections. Reno has 
repeatedly refused to appoint an independent counsel for that 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I left I didn't even get a 'Thank you for your services,'  
'' LaBella told the San Diego Union-Tribune last month, describing 
what he considered fallout from the work of his campaign-financing 
task force. ``I think that crystallizes just how out of favor I was 
with the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Reno told Specter that LaBella served the  
department ``with distinction,'' and pointed out that senators 
recommend and confirm such nominations. The attorney general, 
however, gives the White House final approval for candidates before 
the president sends nominations to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said LaBella should not have expected the nomination.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody should have an expectation of being U.S. attorney,''  
Reno said. ``I don't think anybody should anticipate that they're 
going to be 'it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange came during the Judiciary Committee's review of the  
agency's budget request, the third such congressional session Reno 
has attended this week. During the sessions, she has come under 
heavy criticism from Republicans for the department's problems 
handling immigration and border patrol issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on both the Senate panel and the House subcommittee  
that oversees the Justice Department's budget took issue with the 
fact that Reno has not requested money for more border patrol 
agents next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not negligence, it was not sloppiness, it was not  
malice or evilness or badness or dumbness'' that led her to hold up 
on a request for more money, Reno told the House panel on Thursday. 
Rather, she said, the force is suffering from a flood of 
inexperienced border patrol agents and wants to wait until they are 
properly trained before hiring new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service, said subcommittee  
Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., has failed to correct case load, 
detention and other problems despite receiving increases federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems every year we are called upon to bail out some  
massive mistake that the INS has done, in spite of the fact that 
you have told us ... that you are going to personally oversee the 
problems at the INS,'' Rogers told Reno during a hearing Thursday 
before the House subcommittee on Commerce, Justice State and the 
Judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the INS -- one of the government's fastest growing  
agencies -- has taken steps to resolve problems. ``They have done a 
job that indicates that they can solve problems, just not fast 
enough,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> City Settles Cop Sex Harass Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHAWNEE, Kan. (AP) -- Three detectives who said a supervisor  
subjected them to unwelcome homosexual advances have settled their 
lawsuit against the city for $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If the cases had gone to trial, they would have been among the  
first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last March that sexual 
harassment can be illegal even when the offender and the victim are 
of the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives Delbert Nicholas, Tom Carney and John Wells sued last  
year, alleging police Lt. Walter McDaniel subjected them to 
unwanted touching and requests for sexual favors in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, McDaniel said he would unzip his pants, grab  
his crotch and show a lewd photograph of a boy as a way of breaking 
the ice with co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The detectives charged that the police chief considered the  
activity mere office horseplay and did not handle the complaints 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	The city contended that it had sexual harassment policies in  
place and that no inappropriate conduct took place once officials 
were notified.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	David Wells and Kerry Wood made belated spring debuts with very  
different results. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, sidelined by back spasms earlier this month, pitched one  
perfect inning in his first outing since Game 1 of the World Series 
as the Toronto Blue Jays lost to Pittsburgh 7-5 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The adrenaline was pumping out there,'' said Wells, who was  
traded from the New York Yankees to Toronto last month for Roger 
Clemens. ``It doesn't matter if it's preseason or postseason. The 
butterflies are there anytime you face major league hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, finally recovered from an upper respiratory and  
gastrointestinal illness that sidelined him for the early part of 
spring training, couldn't find the plate Saturday as a Chicago 
Cubs' split squad lost to the Anaheim Angels 6-5 at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to be out there,'' he said, still sweating from  
his in-game laps across the outfield. ``It's been a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's NL Rookie of the Year allowed three runs and three  
hits in 1 1-3 innings, walking two and striking out none. He threw 
to nine batters, and 16 of his 26 pitches were balls. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in the second inning, Wood threw 10 consecutive  
balls, prompting manager Jim Riggleman to make a trip to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little out of whack across the body at the end,'' Wood said  
of his problem. ``I was trying to throw strikes. They could have 
hit me out of the park, I wouldn't have cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., Wells threw only 11 pitches in the sixth  
inning, retiring Ivan Cruz on a grounder to second, striking out 
Brant Brown and getting Al Martin on a weak popup to short. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to be out there all day,'' Wells said. ``My  
philosophy has always been strike one, strike two and whatever 
happens, happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Phoenix, A misplay by country-music performer Garth Brooks  
contributed to the San Diego Padres' 2-1 loss to the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, playing left field in the ninth, stepped back, then  
sprinted forward and fell as a sinking drive by Milwaukee's Alex 
Ochoa fell off his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Ochoa was credited with a double and scored moments later on a  
single to center by Todd Dunn, giving the Brewers the victory over 
the split-squad Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I let these guys down,'' said Brooks, hitless in  
two trips to the plate. ``I dropped that ball in the ninth with two 
out. It just kills me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter Fla., Marlins starter Brian Meadows allowed two runs  
in four innings, but was booed after walking Mark McGwire in 
Florida's 3-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry they didn't get to see an 800-foot home run, but I  
didn't try to walk him,'' Meadows said. ``I like to see him hit 
home runs just as much as they do, but I don't want any to come off 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was 0-for-2, including the fourth-inning walk. Darren  
Bragg homered for St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Sting Operation Rips Apart Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- This was a sting operation that Janice  
Peck says stung too close to home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Division of Wildlife assigned her husband, Randal, and  
a female agent to set up house and pose as lovers in order to bring 
down a poaching operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ``cloak-and-dagger deal,'' she says, also took down a  
family with two college-age children -- all for the sake of a few 
elk and moose. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't put a woman and man together in that kind of  
environment and expect nothing to happen,'' Janice Peck said, 
calling the state the ``biggest culprit'' in the breakup of her 
23-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The undercover couple fell in love, the Pecks divorced, and  
Janice Peck sued the division and agent Jodi Becker for alienation 
of affection. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the suit was settled, with Janice Peck getting the  
equity the former couple had in their home, according to Becker, 
who is now married to Randal Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	The state agency went overboard, she maintains, by assigning the  
fish-and-game officers to an extended ``James Bond'' mission 
against a small band of gritty poachers in the remote Uinta 
Mountains of northern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck and Becker openly hugged, kissed and shared the same bed in  
a camping trailer over six months while befriending the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The state argued it had no responsibility for the romance that  
took root in a beat-up, 1963 trailer parked at Mud Lake. A judge 
agreed and dropped the agency from the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, it's Janice Peck vs. Jodi Becker, who has been  
married to Randal Peck, 49, for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assumed a man that old can make up his own mind,'' Becker  
said. ``I didn't pursue him any more than he pursued me. I met him 
at work -- and that's unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, 33, kept her job even as her new husband was forced to  
retire, and the couple is raising a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She counts herself unlucky to live in Utah, one of the few  
states that still allows legal claims for alienation of affection -- 
a common-law throwback to a time when women were considered the 
property of men that is now being used in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
	State attorneys say that Janice Peck, 50, should have taken up  
any legal cause for betrayal in her 1995 divorce, which was settled 
amicably. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Randal Peck was pressured to retire with a pension  
``for bringing discredit on the agency,'' said J. Wesley Robinson, 
an assistant attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert F. Elswood, the division's law enforcement chief, said  
pairing undercover agents as intimate couples is a common practice 
even for fish-and-game officers -- ``and we don't expect them to 
have affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sting led to as many as nine convictions, including the  
ring's leader, Eugene ``Shorty'' Banks. Banks had been suspected of 
poaching since the 1970s, Elswood said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peck, state officials say, carried his assignment too far.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sleeping arrangements were never discussed. There are two  
bunks in that trailer at opposite ends. Randy decided they had to 
sleep together to maintain their cover,'' Robinson said. ``We don't 
buy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Peck explained it in a pretrial deposition, the poachers  
could have barged into their camp trailer any time. Locking the 
door only raised suspicions, and the poachers had even accused Peck 
of being an undercover game officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were suspicious about almost anything,'' Peck said in the  
deposition. ``I was portraying Jodi as my girlfriend. We both felt 
it would be tough to explain why she may be in the front bunk and 
I'd be in the back bunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for genuine romance to blossom. The agents,  
according to his testimony, started having sex the second weekend 
they shared the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the assignment started, Peck told his wife he'd be  
sharing the trailer with a female agent. But he didn't tell her he 
would be sharing a bed with Becker for many weekends and some 
weekdays over six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Peck has accepted responsibility for the breakup of his  
marriage, his ex-wife isn't satisfied. She also blames the 
``irresponsible'' wildlife agency and officer Becker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she didn't intend to break up this marriage, I'd like to  
know what she was trying to do,'' said Janice Peck.

<HEADLINE> DuPont, Pioneer Hi-Bred Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Chemical giant DuPont Co., which wants a  
bigger presence in the life sciences industry, is discussing making 
a deal with Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the world's largest 
seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DuPont cautioned that there was no assurance any  
transaction will be concluded, the disclosure of the talks sent 
Pioneer stock up 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont already owns 20 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred and indicated  
earlier this week it wants to expand in the areas of agriculture, 
biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief announcement Friday, DuPont said it is in talks with  
Pioneer ``regarding a possible business combination.'' A 
spokeswoman for the Wilmington, Del.-based company said there would 
be no further comment until an agreement is reached or terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Pioneer Hi-Bred, based in Des Moines, did not  
return a telephone call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pioneer shares rose $9.81 1/4 to $34.31 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange while DuPont shares fell $1.37 1/2 a share to 
$57.75. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont has been the focus of much speculation in recent weeks  
with analysts predicting the company could be looking to buy 
Monsanto Co., a large life sciences company which last year failed 
in an effort to merge with drug maker American Home Products. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto makes Celebrex, a new arthritis pain medication and  
just one of the company's products that would make it an attractive 
target for DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Brown, an analyst with Rutherford Brown &AMP; Catherwood in  
North Carolina, said even if a business venture with Pioneer is in 
the offing, it doesn't necessarily mean an agreement cannot be 
reached with Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fits into DuPont's larger plan. Anything they can do to  
enhance that area (life sciences) is a plus,'' Brown said. ``(A 
deal with Pioneer) would be a plus for DuPont, but nothing like the 
plus of taking over Monsanto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's business moves have been swift in the life sciences  
area the last few years. Two years ago, it spent $1.7 billion to 
buy 20 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred, with the companies creating a 
joint venture for crop research. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, DuPont spent $2.6 billion to buy out Merck Co.'s  
share in a joint venture between the two, creating DuPont 
Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's life sciences business totaled $4.3 billion in sales  
last year -- less than 20 percent of the company's total sales.

<HEADLINE> Prime Timber Wins San Felipe Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Prime Timber, wearing blinkers for the  
first time, handed stablemate and Kentucky Derby future book 
favorite Exploit his first loss Saturday, winning the $250,000 San 
Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by David Flores and carrying 116 pounds, Prime Timber  
covered 1 1-16 miles in 1:42, 4-5 of a second off the stakes record 
set by Pole Position 20 years ago. Prime Timber paid $7.20, $2.80 
and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber's victory in the race for 3-year-olds, the final  
prep for the April 3 Santa Anita Derby, was his third in five 
starts. He was second on the other two, beaten a neck in the 
Hollywood Futurity and by one-half length in the San Rafael. He 
earned $150,000 to increase his career earnings to $308,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber collared 3-5 favorite Exploit and jockey Chris  
McCarron in midstretch and then drew away. 
</P>
<P>
	Flores had Prime Timber in fourth, within two lengths of  
Exploit, before making his move. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke really good, and I just sat there comfortable in a  
good spot,'' Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
	High Wire Act set the pace until caught by Exploit at the head  
of the stretch, but was able to hold on for third, one-half length 
behind the runnerup. Finder's Gold finished fourth, 4 1/2 lengths 
behind High Wire Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploit, carrying 122 pounds, paid $2.20 and $2.10. High Wire  
Act, with Eddie Delahoussaye aboard at 116 pounds, paid $2.10 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploit is the consensus favorite to win the May 1 Kentucky  
Derby. He was unbeaten in five starts and had won his only start of 
1999, the San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, the San Felipe runners-up have had good luck. Real  
Quiet and Silver Charm, the runners-up the last two years, went on 
to win the Kentucky Derby.

</P>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Peter A. Franken, a pioneering laser  
researcher, died March 11 of liver disease. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Franken, former director of the University of Arizona Optical  
Sciences Center, is considered the father of non-linear optics for 
having discovered that the color of a laser beam can be changed by 
passing it through a crystal. 
</P>
<P>
	His research included use of lasers for burn treatments,  
disposal of radioactive waste and optical methods for early 
detection of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught physics at Stanford and the University of Michigan  
before coming to the University of Arizona in 1973.

	 *Garson Kanin    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Garson Kanin, a prolific playwright who created  
the Broadway and Hollywood classic ``Born Yesterday,'' died 
Saturday of heart failure after a long illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin's place in entertainment history would have been assured  
had Kanin done no more than write and direct ``Born Yesterday,'' 
the oft-revived play that made Judy Holliday a star of the theater 
in 1946 and won her an Oscar for the movie version in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin was the author or director of numerous stage and movie  
hits, including some of the celebrated screen pairings of Spencer 
Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	In collaboration with his wife of 43 years, actress Ruth Gordon,  
he wrote the screenplays of Tracy and Hepburn's ``Adam's Rib'' in 
1949 and ``Pat and Mike'' in 1952. He and his wife also received an 
Academy Award nomination for writing ``A Double Life,'' the 1948 
movie for which Ronald Colman received a best-actor Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gordon died in 1985. In 1990, Kanin married actress Marian  
Seldes, who was with him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin claimed collaboration in the first Tracy-Hepburn teaming,  
``Woman of the Year,'' in 1942. His screenwriter brother, Michael 
Kanin, and Ring Lardner Jr. were the officially credited writers 
and won an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said ``The More the Merrier,'' the delicious 1943 comedy  
of wartime Washington, was his brainchild, but the screenplay is 
credited to four other writers. The comedy of political corruption 
and personal redemption, which ran for 1,642 performances on 
Broadway, boomed anew during the latter Nixon years. 
</P>
<P>
	As an officer in an Army film unit during World War II, Kanin  
was co-director, with Carol Reed, of ``The True Glory,'' which won 
the Oscar for best documentary in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote some 14 books of fact and fiction and published  
numerous articles and short stories everywhere from Good 
Housekeeping to Penthouse.

<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Sydney Lewis, who with his wife pioneered  
the catalog showroom business and became an internationally known 
art collector, died Friday at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-founder and former chairman of Best Products Inc. had  
been in ill health for a number of years. The company, founded in 
1958, grew to sales of more than $2 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and his wife, Frances, became known throughout the world  
for their art deco and art nouveau collections, now housed in the 
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts' Sydney and Frances Lewis Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s, the Lewises gave more than $11 million to  
colleges, universities, museums and medical schools. The couple 
also gave $9 million to Washington and Lee University to build a 
larger law school.

<P>
	McCurdy began his coaching career at Harvard in 1950. His tenure  
included a 201-62-1 record for cross country, with 10 Greater 
Boston Championship titles.

<HEADLINE> Affleck: I Wasn't Always a Hunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ben Affleck, unattached again after romancing  
Gwyneth Paltrow, wasn't always the sought-after bachelor that movie 
stardom has made him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a kid, I was the kind of guy who got dumped a lot,'' he  
says in the April issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, remembering 
himself as a gangly, clumsy teen. ``I don't think the ladies were 
saying, `I'm looking for somebody awkward and beanpole-like who 
doesn't have control of his own limbs.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With film credits including ``School Ties,'' ``Good Will  
Hunting'' and ``Armageddon,'' the 26-year-old actor has improved 
his dating quotient considerably since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely amused at seeing my love life on the evening  
news,'' he admits.
