<HEADLINE> Taliban Leader to Visit Pakistan Soon: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Afghan
Taliban Interim Council, Mulla Mohammad Rabbani, will soon visit
Pakistan for talks on bilateral issues, Afghan sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The date for the visit has not been fixed yet and the two sides
are coordinating to finalize the plan for the trip, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
It will be Rabbani's first visit to Pakistan after the military
takeover in Islamabad in October last year. Rabbani, number two in
the Taliban hierarchy, had visited Pakistan when deposed prime
minister Nawaz Sharif was in office.
</P>
<P>
The issue of terrorism is likely to be on the top of the agenda,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif had accused the Taliban of allowing some Pakistani
students of religious schools to receive training in terrorist
camps in their controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement may be
another major issue for discussion. The Taliban are under pressure
from Afghan traders to resolve the long-standing dispute with
Pakistan over the transit trade.

<HEADLINE> Peace Water Project Completed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is now ready to export
water to Israel and other Middle East and African countries after
the implementation of the Manavgat Water Project in the south, the
Anatolia News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, located in the Mediterranean port city of Antalya,
was also known as the "Peace Water Project" which was launched in
1992 to sell potable water from Turkey's Manavgat River to Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the project came to a halt due to
opposition by Israel's powerful religious Shas party which then
controlled Israel's Ministry of Infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government invested a total of 122 million U.S.
dollars in the project and anticipated a revenue of 300 million
dollars annually from water export.
</P>
<P>
Purified water from the Manavgat River will be transferred to
two floating platforms 1,300 meters offshore and then shipped via
giant tankers to other countries that need it, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials told Anatolia that water sale is expected to
become one of Turkey's major foreign currency earners as the
country is increasingly tapping the great potential of water supply
on commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
With a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, water from the
Manavgat River and other rivers may go to Syria, Israel, Jordan,
the Palestinian self-rule areas, Saudi Arabia and even other Gulf
countries to alleviate these countries' water shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
To mark the occasion, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the
Israel Defense Forces Uzi Dayan visited the site Monday.
</P>
<P>
And visiting Jordanian Minister of Water and Irrigation Kamel
Mahadin will tour water facilities on the Manavgat river Tuesday.
Mahadin arrived here on Monday for three days of talks on
purchasing water from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan had in the past tried to join hands in
producing potable water through desalination of sea water, but the
costs were too high. Thus they approached Turkey for water which
turned out to be more feasible and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage in operation, water will go to Israel, the
Gaza Strip, Malta and Libya, the report added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide 129 Million Euro in Aid to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will provide
some 129 million Euro (130 million U.S. dollars) in aid to Jordan
in the year 2000 in addition to various assistance by EU countries
under bilateral agreements, a senior EU representative said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid package, including grants and soft loans, will be
channeled into four sectors to improve the economic performance of
the kingdom, said head of the EU office in Amman James Moran in a
statement carried by the official news agency Petra.
</P>
<P>
The first program under the EU aid will support the state budget
and the economic reform program in general, he said.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is struggling to keep its budget deficit below 7
percent of its total of 3.09 billion U.S. dollars budget for the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The second program is aimed at supporting the private sector to
improve its productivity and competitiveness as called by King
Abdullah and the government to play a more active role in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The third category of EU aid will be used to protect cultural
and historical relics, including the development of a series of
archaeological and tourist sites to increase the tourism revenues.
</P>
<P>
Tourists brought in 700 to 900 million dollars annually after
they toured ancient cities of Petra and Jerash as well as Dead Sea
resorts which lies between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The forth project is to help rehabilitate aging pipelines of the
water supply system in Amman, where water leakage are incurring
millions of dollars of losses annually to the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
The EU is known as the second largest donor next to the United
States which provided some 300 million dollars under an aid package
to the kingdom in the year 1999.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls Taliban's Recognition of Chechnya's Independence Meaningless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Monday denounced the Afghan Islamic opposition Taliban's
recognition of Chechnya as an independent state, calling it "
meaningless in law."
</P>
<P>
"This step by the Taliban, who are using force against the
legitimate Burhanutdin Rabbani government to achieve superiority,
is trifling from a legal point of view," the ministry said in a
statement, describing the Taliban's decision as an attempt to set
up a kind of "gangster international."
</P>
<P>
"Politically, this statement by a regime which is illegal and
unrecognized by the international community and against which U.N.
sanctions are in place once again testifies to a link between
Chechnya's terrorists and the forces of belligerent religious
extremism," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council resolution of November 14, 1999
concerning the introduction of international anti-terrorist
sanctions against the Taliban movement stipulates that additional,
stricter measures can be applied against it in case of necessity,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's open support for terrorists acting in a Russian
region "gives serious grounds for raising the issue of stricter
sanctions against the Taliban," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This step by the Taliban is more evidence of "the urgent
necessity for the international community to pool efforts in the
struggle against terrorism," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls For Ceasefire, Dialogue In Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Monday that it urges Angola's UNITA to cease immediately its
military activities and reaffirms its determination to continue
supporting all the international efforts to tighten the U.N.
Security Council sanctions against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union appeals to all those within UNITA who stand
ready to abide by the rules enshrined in the Lusaka Protocol to
demonstrate their unequivocal will to enter into a meaningful
dialogue with the government, and encourages the Angolan
authorities to respond favorably to that commitment," the EU said
in a presidency statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU also encourages the Angolan government to create the
appropriate political, social and economic environment for
democracy and the rule of law to flourish in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the European Union believes that the
government has a special responsibility for the promotion of human
rights, including in those areas which were under UNITA's control,
of democratic principles, good governance and the strengthening of
a free civil society," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union is concerned at the recent fighting between
the Angolan Armed Forces and UNITA across international borders
and stresses the importance of stability and inter-state dialogue
and cooperation for the security and economic development of the
region," the current presidency holder Portugal said on behalf of
the EU.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Attaches Great Importance to Development Issue (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- After the mankind
entered the new Millennium, the world is demanding more and more
of the 188-member United Nations, which is primarily responsible
for the world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the new Millennium greets the great progress
the mankind made over the past 100 years, but also groans under
the stark realities that the people living in poverty are
increasing every day across the world.
</P>
<P>
The challenge of development remains paramount in a world where
one-fifth of humanity is forced to fend for itself on a meager one
U.S. dollar a day, one-third of all Africans are not expected to
survive past the age of 40, nearly 40 percent of women in
developing countries are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
The sad picture persist despite the fact that the past half-
century has witnessed one of the longest periods of economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The world is crying out for development, which, together with
peace, makes the two main themes of our times. The ongoing
conflicts in poor countries, to a large extent, demonstrates that
peace and development are interrelated, peace creates favorable
environment for development, and development promotes sustainable
peace.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the strong appeals across the world, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced last week that United
Nations will continue to focus on the issue of development in the
years ahead after its efforts over past years to make the issue a
central work of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"Development -- and especially international cooperation for
development -- continues to occupy a central place in our work,"
Kofi Annan said. "In the year to come, as in the year or two that
have just passed, much of that work will no doubt focus on the
impact and implications of globalization."
</P>
<P>
First, the 10th session of the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), to be held just four weeks from now, offers
a major opportunity to strengthen and advance the position of
developing countries in the area of trade.
</P>
<P>
"After the imbroglio in Seattle, it is vital that we pick up
the pieces and explore ways of making trade work better for the
poor," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the World Trade Organization held talks
in Seattle, Washington States in the U.S., but the talks met with
fierce opposition from demonstrators, who had blocked Annan and
other dignitaries from traveling from their hotels to deliver the
prepared speeches at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the General Assembly will be discussing the
organizational and substantive details of the international event
on financing for development, which it has agreed to hold in 2001.
</P>
<P>
At present, unprecedented consultations between the United
Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Trade Organization (WTO) are underway in preparation for
a high-level meeting on financing for development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will involve policy makers at the ministerial level
or higher in talks on the strength and stability of international
financial systems and on measures to be taken at the national and
international levels to carry out action plans agreed to at the
relevant U.N. conferences of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, this year's high-level segment of the U.N. Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) will address the issue of information
technology and its role as the backbone of today's knowledge-based
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries cannot afford not to master its
technology, if they are to win their rightful place at
globalization's banquet," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond these three areas, the year will also feature vital
follow-up meetings to the Beijing and Copehhagen conferences," he
said. "And all of this activity will culminate, in the autumn,
with the Millennium Assembly and Millennium Summit," which will be
convened in September this year.
</P>
<P>
"These meetings offer us a great chance to think through the
challenges that lie ahead of all our Member States, and to ensure
that the United Nations provides them with the service they will
need," he said. "But the chances will be lost unless developing
countries play a full part, not only in the Assembly and Summit
themselves but in the process leading up to them."
</P>
<P>
In general, the United Nations should work harder for a fair
international political and economic system, a crucial vehicle to
ensure developing countries benefit from globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of millions of people are completely excluded from
globalization's benefits," Annan said. "Attacking these inequities
-- within and among nations -- and bringing these people in from
the margins is certainly one of the biggest projects for the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations can play an important role in gathering
ideas and resources for development in poor countries. However, to
promote world development is not simply the job for the United
Nations only. Other groups, particularly the rich nations, also
have the unshakable responsibility in taking practical steps,
including external aid and debt relief, to promote development in
less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The volume of external aid to developing countries has declined
steadily throughout the last decade, and now stands at 0.22
percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the industrial
countries -- only 0.19 percent for the group of seven major
industrialized countries, which includes the world's richest among
them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign direct investment has not compensated for
the decline in aid. Many developing countries, including some of
the poorest, remain subject to the crushing burdens of external
debt.
</P>
<P>
In short, there will be no development and prosperity in the
world at large without social progress and economic growth in
developing nations, and international cooperation for development
is the one of the effective ways to achieve the global advancement.

WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican John McCain
and Democratic Bill Bradley lead slightly among the likely voters
with the help of women and independents in New Hampshire as the
campaign's first presidential primary nears, a new poll shows.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll Sunday,
McCain had 42 percent support to 33 percent for national front-

On Sunday a Syrian official said that a decision had not bee

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Namibian police will be
installing more military posts and deploy more guards along the
border with Angola to check border attacks on tourists, the South
African Press Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after seven people were killed in ambushes in the
past two weeks, said Brigadier Ruben Ashipala of the Namibian
Special Field Force, a police paramilitary unit.
</P>
<P>
A dusk-to-dawn curfew has also been imposed along the affected
area in the remote Caprivi Strip, the police officer was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Bandits ambushed a taxi van Friday, killing four people
including three nurses, and wounding five others 12 kilometers
west of the military base of Omega in Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
In the same area on January 3, bandits attacked a family of
French tourists, killing three children and wounding their
parents.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were believed to be carried out by Angolan rebels
in retaliation for Namibian decision last month to allow Angolan
government forces to use Namibian territory to launch attacks
against the rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> EU Still Concerned At Indonesian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Monday that it is deeply concerned over the situation in Indonesia,
especially "the appalling violence in the Moluccas, the tensions
in Irian Jaya and the persisting conflict in Aceh."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Indonesian President Wahid's visit to Europe, the
EU also reaffirmed its "support for a strong, united and
democratic Indonesia and offers its help to the new Indonesian
government in overcoming these challenges in order to strengthen
the ties which bind together the European Union and a democratic
Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
The EU said in its presidency declaration that it supports the
efforts of the new government and welcomes the steps taken by
President Wahid to strengthen the country's democracy, to reform
the military and judicial systems, to restore the vitality of its
economy and to solve its internal conflicts through dialogue
rather than force.
</P>
<P>
"The EU therefore believes that the restrictive measures taken
against the previous Indonesian government in September 1999, and
which expired today, need not be renewed but notes that the EU
policy regarding arms exports will be governed by strict
implementation of the EU Code of Conduct. In this context the EU
will continue to follow closely events in Indonesia," the
declaration said.

ATHENS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The search operation for the
missing Greek Air Force F-4 fighter jet with two pilots on board
continued late Monday, but rescue teams have turned their
attention to Mountain Parnassos.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Air Force have launched a massive land and sea search
after the F-4 fighter jet disappeared from radar Monday morning
during a training flight over the Greek islands of Eubia and
Skyros.
</P>
<P>
The jet, which took off from the Andravida air base at a low
altitude due to the adverse weather conditions, might crash on a
mountain side, according to a statement from the Greek Air Force
General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Four helicopters, a C-130 transport plane, three navy ships as
well as passenger ships are participating in the search operation.
</P>
<P>
Following fruitless search of the sea between the Tanagra Air
Force base in the southwestern Peleponnessos peninsula, search and
rescue crews are now combing the area between the town of Itea and
Mountain Parnassos.
</P>
<P>
It is the first jet crash accident for the Greek Air Force this
year, but the Air Force has lost more than 73 planes and 43 pilots
in training accidents since January 1987.

<HEADLINE> Kagera Basin Organization in Critical Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The organization meant to
develop the Kagera River Basin is in critical financial situation
that has rendered the secretariat unable to operate and fulfill
the organization's aspirations, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report presented to the Council of Ministers of
the organization, the outstanding balances unpaid in form of
arrears was at the tune of 4.2 million U.S. dollars by December
1999 for all four member states, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The current financial problem is a result of laxity of prompt
payment of the annual contributions that have been on a downward
trend for the past four years, from 223,100 dollars in 1996 to a
mere 70,000 dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This unhealthy financial situation has led to gross
indebtedness by the secretariat, which owes 557,900 dollars to
staff in lieu of unpaid salaries, and 171,400 dollars in lieu of
goods and services received but unpaid for from suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, external donors that had earlier shown interest in
the organization have lost zeal.
</P>
<P>
Two willing donors, Belgium and the European Union, have shown
restraint to assist because of seeming lack of interest and
seriousness amongst member state of the Kagera River Basin.
</P>
<P>
The just concluded council of ministers in Kigali recommended
among other things that, a round table conference of donors should
be convened to address the crucial issue of funding.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Survey Black Participation in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is to
conduct a survey to ascertain the level of involvement of black
Zimbabweans in various sectors of the economy, a senior official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study will assist in the formulation of
appropriate strategies for the future implementation of the
indigenization policy, said Cephas Msipa, Minister of State
Enterprises and Indigenization.
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be a very important study as far as we are
concerned because we have been operating the policy for the last
four or five years and we want to know how far we have gone," the
Zimbabwe News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Estimates place at 20 percent the level of ownership of the
national economy by the indigenous people, but Msipa said there is
no empirical evidence to prove the figure.
</P>
<P>
The country's indigenization policy aims at bringing economic
justice and creating favorable economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary committee recently criticized the
indigenization policy, saying that it is not coherent.
</P>
<P>
But Msipa said there is nothing wrong with the policy
framework.
</P>
<P>
In light of the punitive interest rates at financial
institutions, he said that his department is promoting the
establishment of community banks which has proved to be an
empowerment tool as well as a source of cheap development finance.
</P>
<P>
Successful community banks are operating in various districts
in the southern African country and members have borrowed to
establish many viable projects.

KIBONDO, Tanzania, January 17 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) chief Sadako Ogata Monday urged
international community to continue offering their support to U.N.
refugee work and help countries producing refugees to solve their
basic problems.
</P>
<P>
On a visit to the Karago and Mtendeli refugee camps in
Tanzania's western Kigoma Region bordering Burundi, the UNHCR
chief stressed that the key to solve refugee problems is to help
the related nations to find justified and persistent political
solutions to their civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring peace to the Great Lakes region,
international community should give their energetic support to the
peace process mediated by former South African President Nelson
Mandela and urge the nations concerned to observe the Lusaka
agreement to end the fighting in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), said Ogata.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi army's forced resettlement of more than 300,000
Hutu civilians into camps should be stopped as quickly as
possible, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR chief arrived in Tanzania Sunday, starting her 10-day
three- nation African tour, which will also bring her to South
Africa and Zambia after her three-day stop in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the UNHCR currently
provides protection and assistance to some 415,000 refugees from
Burundi, the DRC, Rwanda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian authorities are hoping the visit by the U.N. refugee
chief will attract more international attention on the plight of
refugees hosted by the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Security Cooperation Tops Agenda of Turko-Iranian FM Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said Monday that security cooperation will be on top of the
agenda of the talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks prior to his meeting on the same day with
Kharrazi, who arrived in Ankara earlier Monday for a two-day
official visit. "Bilateral and regional issues will be taken up
during the meetings," the Turkish minister added.
</P>
<P>
The Turko-Iranian ties has been strained since last July when
Turkey accused Iran of supporting rebel Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) near the borders of the two countries and launched cross-
border anti-PKK campaign which caused alleged casualties on Iranian
territories.
</P>
<P>
There has been a flurry of claims from Teheran that Turkish jets
violated Iranian air space and bombed one of its border posts.
Teheran requested for compensation and rejected the Turkish claim
that there were some 50 PKK bases inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said,"It is
certain that many PKK members took shelter in Iran. We will convey
our uneasiness to Iranian officials and ask them to take more
effective measures."
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Cem, Kharrazi said that Iran and Turkey "have
important responsibilities" in realizing peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that he was pleased to come to Turkey,
adding the two neighboring countries share a great historical
heritage and have economic links.
</P>
<P>
Security dialogues between the two neighboring countries began
last August, raising hopes for improving bilateral ties. The latest
sign of rapprochement between the two sides was the recent visit to
Teheran by a Turkish delegation to discuss Iran's supply of natural
gas to Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 235 Tons of Drugs in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran confiscated a total of 235
tons of various narcotics in 1999, Iranian Vice President for
Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the First International
Conference of Drug Liaison Officers, Hashemi said 740 drug
traffickers were killed in the year, but Iran also lost 183
policemen in fighting against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The large number of casualties has indicated how important it is
to carry out anti-drug operations in Iran, the Islamic Republic
News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the growing output of poppy crops in Afghanistan, the
Iranian official said that an intensified campaign on the Iranian
northeastern borders has now channeled the trafficking activities
to southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the need for setting up of a security belt around
Afghanistan and putting pressure on the Afghan rulers, he also
called on European countries to make more contributions to the
Iranian campaign against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian operations to intercept convoys of drugs will help
the European countries save their population, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the
Iranian Majlis or parliament passed an anti-drug law authorizing
capital punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
A commander of the Iranian security forces said last November
that the country has spent one billion U.S. dollars on combating
drug trafficking since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP) in Iran Antonio Mazzitelli expressed hope that the
conference will prepare the ground for extensive international
cooperation to fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The interception of any kilogram of drugs in Iran prevents
distribution of thousands of doses of heroin in other countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Britain, Belgium, France, Australia, Italy,
Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Norway as well as the Economic
Cooperation Organization attended the three-day conference
sponsored by UNDCP.

After meeting with his Israeli counterpart David Levy, Khatib

peace in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy, in reply, agreed with Khatib's remarks about the
importance of advancing those two tracks forward, saying Israel
will continue to try its best to conduct the final-status talks
with the Palestinians while holding peace talks with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Levy also promised that Israel will not conduct the peace talks
with the Syrians at the expenses of the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Khatib is here for a short visit during which he and Levy held
their first working meeting after the current Israeli government
came to power last July.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khatib updated Levy about the efforts made
by King Abdullah II in advancing the Middle East peace process
while Levy briefed him about what has been achieved during the last
two rounds of Israeli-Syrian talks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed bilateral issues such as economic
cooperation between the two countries, but nothing has been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria ended their second round of talks in the United
States early last week, but the two sides were reluctant to tell
whether some progress has been made in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks are scheduled to begin in the U.S. on
Wednesday, but Syria said it will not return to the talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed their peace treaty in 1994. But
bilateral relations remain cool due to the lack of progress in the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Barak Hints Talks with Syria may be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Monday he is still undecided over whether to return to
the United States this week for another round of peace talks with
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"We do not take dictates from anyone on earth, but we highly
respect (Syrian) President (Hafez) al-Assad. And if he needs some
time before the negotiations are to be resumed, we respect it and
we will wait." he told reporters after briefing the Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he will fly to the U.S. this week, Barak said "I
don't know and you will know that in about two days."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Barak was hinting that the third round of
peace talks with Syria, scheduled to be held in the U.S. Wednesday,
may be postponed, after news emerged that Syria has cast doubts on
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Lebanese television quoted an official source in
Damascus as saying that the Syria-Israel talks have been
indefinitely postponed.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian official also told reporters Sunday that the Syrian
government was making "necessary evaluation and assessment of the
previous talks" before taking a decision on a date for the new
round.
</P>
<P>
Surprised by the news, Barak's office on Monday morning said in
a statement that Israel knew nothing about a plan to put off the
talks. However, if Syria wants a delay, Israel will have no problem
with that, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The news also prompted some Likud Knesset members to urge Barak
not to go back to the negotiation table unless Assad himself shows
up. Otherwise, they said, Barak should send Foreign Minister David
Levy as his representative in the talks instead.
</P>
<P>
However, reports say that Barak intends to leave for Washington
on Tuesday as planned for a three-way meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat this week to
discuss the outstanding problems in the Israeli-Palestinian final-
status talks.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Abu Dis Unlikely to be Included in Next Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Monday that Israel is unlikely to hand over the Arab
village of Abu Dis in a suburb of Jerusalem to the Palestinians in
the coming withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Knesset (parliament) Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee, Barak said Israel will implement the third stage of
troops withdrawal from the West Bank as stipulated by the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum within three weeks, but he did not foresee Abu
Dis as part of it.
</P>
<P>
Barak angered the Palestinians Sunday by announcing that Israel
will not carry out the coming withdrawal as originally slated for
Thursday. Israel is expected to hand over 6.1 percent of the West
Bank to Palestinian control at that stage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians denounced the unilateral decision of Israel as
unacceptable. But Barak said the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed
last September allows Israel to postpone the pullback by up to
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources have said that Barak wants to put off the
pullback until a full picture of the final-status negotiations with
the Palestinians becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have set an ambitious goal of reaching a framework
agreement on a permanent peace by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, Barak again played down the delay by saying
that he hopes Israel and the Palestinians will finalize an
agreement over the third withdrawal within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Another controversial issue about the next withdrawal is the
land Israel will relinquish. The Palestinians reportedly expect the
next hand-over to include land in and around Abu Dis, hoping to
gain control over the suburb of Jerusalem before the final-status
talks end.
</P>
<P>
Several ministers in Barak's cabinet have publicly expressed
support for transferring some villages outside Jerusalem, including
Abu Dis, to the Palestinians, but the final decision on the maps is
up to Barak.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war
and has since declared the whole city of Jerusalem as its eternal
capital. The Palestinians, however, want East Jerusalem as the
capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
The debate over whether Abu Dis should be handed over in the
next withdrawal is seen by observers as a fight between the two
sides over the final fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak has carried out a hard-line policy over Jerusalem,
claiming that the holy city will remain under permanent Israeli
control even under a final-status peace treaty with the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Talks with Syrians Postponed Indefinitely:Barak's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The third round of Syrian-
Israeli peace talks scheduled for Wednesday in the U.S. has been
postponed indefinitely, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office in a statement announced "the postponement of the
next round of talks," and added that "the Prime Minister will not
leave tomorrow for the United States."
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give a reason for the postponement and did
not say whether it was at Syria's request.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after news emerged that Syria has cast
doubts on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>

Israel and Syria resumed their peace talks in Washington last
December after a nearly four-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to hold the third round of talks in the U.
S. on January 19 after a second round of talks held early this
month in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, failed to produce concrete
results.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.N. Council Deadlocked Over Choosing Chief Arms Inspector For  Iraq (by Xie Meihua) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan failed to appoint the chairman of a new U.N. arms
regime for Iraq as the deadline of midnight Sunday passed, thus
creating procedural and possibly legal problems.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council narrowly adopted a resolution on Iraq on
December 17 which established the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq to
replace the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The resolution
requested the U.N. secretary-general to name the chairman of the
UNMOVIC within 30 days after the adoption of the resolution, with
the consultations and approval of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
For the past weeks, Annan gave a list of 18 candidates for the
Security Council to consider and the council did not reach
consensus on any of the candidates after rounds of discussions and
consultations with the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
On the top of the list are Rolf Ekeus, who led the UNSCOM from
1991 to 1997 and now Sweden's ambassador to the United States; and
Celso Amorim, Brazil's former permanent representative to the
United Nations, now at the United Nations in Geneva, who chaired
the three panels last year on U.N. new policy towards Iraq and
disarmament experts from Finland, Hungary, Canada and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, especially the five permanent members,
namely China, Russia, France, Britain and the United States, have
their own favorites. Russia said it opposed a candidate for any of
the NATO countries; France prefers Celso Amorim; China maintained
the post should be occupied by a candidate from developing
countries; and Britain and the United States favored the Finnish
disarmament expert.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief Annan hinted that Rolf Ekeus would be proper for the
post and members of the council would likely support the nominee.
But Annan has been informed that Iraq has strong opposition. The
chief arms inspector would not be able to implement the
disarmament tasks assigned by the Security Council if he does not
get agreement and full cooperation from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, ignoring the warning and
objections from some members of the Security Council, pressed the
council to adopt the resolution last month, during which three of
the five permanent members -- China, Russia and France --
abstained.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was intentionally ambiguous about the remaining
questions which Iraq has to clarify regarding to the fields of
biological and chemical weapons in order to get the U.N. sanctions
lifted and the standards that Iraq should give cooperation to the
new arms regime, making it more difficult and complicated for the
future chief arms inspector to fulfill the disarmament tasks. U.N.
diplomats said there had been five candidates who withdrew from
the list due to this reason.
</P>
<P>
Chief arms inspector is widely seen as a controversial post.
Former Chairman of the UNSCOM Richard Butler frequently prompted
confrontations with Iraq during his tenure from 1997 to 1999,
which finally led to the U.S.-led military air strikes against
Iraq in December 1998. There had been no arms inspections in Iraq
since December 1998, when the UNSCOM evacuated its staff in the
face of American and British bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief Kofi Annan said last week that it had been more
difficult and complicated to name the potential candidate than he
had expected.

<HEADLINE> UK Tops European E-Commerce League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-five percent of business
executives in Britain use the Internet for electronic commerce --
the highest usage in Europe, according to the latest findings from
UPS Europe Business Monitor, an annual survey of senior business
opinion.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that UK companies topped the league
for having a web site (95 percent) and that UK business executives
receive more e-mails a day than any other western European nation,
with the number of e-mails sent each day averaging 29 compared to
the European average of 20.
</P>
<P>
In spite of Britain's reputation as a nation reluctant to learn
foreign languages, Europe's business leaders voted UK and Dutch
executives the most international in their outlook.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Light, business development director UPS UK, said, "It's
great to see the UK taking the lead in the e-commerce revolution
sweeping Europe, and with a new e-commerce bill being taken
forward by the government this can only help to consolidate the UK
's favorable position."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the UK's record for learning foreign languages,
he said, "The Dutch are arguably the best in Europe at learning
foreign languages and are certainly masters of English."
</P>
<P>
"So, if business executives from the UK and the Netherlands are
seen as the most international in their outlook, perhaps this goes
to show that English is still the international language of
business," he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to name Rolf Ekeus as the chairman of a new
U.N. arms inspection regime for Iraq, U.N. sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the deadline of midnight Sunday passed.
The nominee must be approved by the 15-member Security Council
which has been deadlocked over the nominee in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the United States, led
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from 1991-1997.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM was created in 1991 as part of the cease-fire
resolution ending the Persian Gulf War. The arms regime withdrew
from Iraq days before the U.S.-led military strikes against the
country in December 1998. Iraq has barred it from returning.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council on December 17 narrowly
adopted a resolution on Iraq which created the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to
replace the UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Defense Ministers Discuss Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the Chinese
Central Military Council and Defense Minister Chi Haotian and
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev discussed here the
international situation, regional security and bilateral
cooperation Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chi Haotian expressed the hope that the two
countries will strengthen broader cooperation, especially in the
military sphere.
</P>
<P>
"We are strongly convinced that under acting Russian President
and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's help and support, our good-
neighbor relations will become stronger," he said
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian praised "the great contribution" that Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and first Russian President Boris Yeltsin
made to the two countries' friendly relations. "It is with great
joy that we are witnessing the bilateral friendly ties expand
further on the turn of the centuries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The common understanding the two leaders forged has brought
about deeper partnership and strategic cooperation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said, in his turn, that the Russian and Chinese
defense ministries "are intensively expanding" their contacts. "We
welcome each meeting with our Chinese friends. Our mutual
understanding on all issues grows deeper and broader as we meet
more frequently," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also criticized U.S. plans to unveil a
national anti-ballistic missile system.
</P>
<P>
"China's government is standing up to U.S. attempts to set up
both a national anti-ballistic missile system and a theater of war
anti-ballistic missile system. Attempts (by the U.S.) to make
Taiwan join the creation and unveiling of a theater of war anti-
ballistic missile system are a serious interference into China's
internal affairs and will necessarily be seriously repulsed by the
Chinese people," Chi Haotian said.
</P>
<P>
"If ever the U.S. leaves the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile)
treaty of 1972, the international situation will start to
deteriorate," warned Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev noted that if Washington linked its intention to set
up a national ABM system to NATO's new strategic concept, it "
could add elements of tension" to international issues.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said after the meeting that military and technical
cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is "developing dynamically"
and has broad prospects.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral military and technical cooperation is not aimed
against third countries and "only serves to raise the defense
capacity of our nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers signed a memorandum on mutual understanding at
the end of their talks, which addresses military and military-
technical cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The sides also discussed the current state and prospects of
bilateral cooperation in defense, arms trade and related services,
exchanged opinions on pressing international affairs of common
interest, in particular on the strengthening of security in
Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian arrived in Moscow Sunday for a three-day official
visit. Tuesday he is expected to meet acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is in
charge of the military and industrial complex.

<HEADLINE> Italian Textiles to Find Markets in China, India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy's important fashion and
textiles industries will once more look to their export
performance this year to offset the gloom of 1999, an industry
survey said Monday, claiming that one condition for success will
be greater access to the Chinese and Indian markets.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the final figures yet, but 1999 closed badly,"
said an official at the industry's economic observatory run by the
textile manufacturers' federation and Snia, the fiber
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to get scared," said Moritz Mantero, one of the
federation's deputy chairmen.
</P>
<P>
"The future looks more rosy and exports could start growing
again if certain conditions are fulfilled, first of all, greater
access to the Indian and Chinese markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
With full figures for the first eight months of 1999 now
available, observatory saw a fall in textile and clothing exports
of 3.6 percent in quantity and 8.2 percent in value as imports
climbed by 2 percent in quantity and fell down by 3.2 percent in
value.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Promotion of Angolan Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, issued here Monday,
Annan said, "I urge the donor community to respond as generous as
possible to the 2000 United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency
Appeal for Angola."
</P>
<P>
"I earnestly hope that the draft Status-of-Mission Agreement
can be concluded without any further delay, so that UNOA (U.N.
Office in Angola) may begin to assume its functions, in accordance
with the Security Council resolution," which was adopted on
October 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Following a major military offensive throughout the country in
recent months, the Angolan Government has gradually re-established
its authority in areas formerly controlled by the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), including the
rebels' strongholds in central highlands.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, some measure of stability has been achieved in
several regions" in the southwestern African country, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the hostilities, which affected several regions of
Angola, have continued to cause immense suffering for the Angolan
people and the destruction of the country's infrastructure," Annan
said. "The recent escalation of fighting into Namibia is also a
major source of concern."
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian situation, which affects a growing number of
vulnerable people, remains extremely alarming," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 peace deal crumbled when fighting erupted again in
Angola in December 1998. Over the past four months, government
troops have captured several rebel bases and pushed UNITA to the
far south and east.
</P>
<P>
"The Government has maintained the position that it does not
consider Mr. Jonas Savimbi (the UNITA leader) a credible partner
for dialogue, given his record of not implementing his previous
undertakings in good faith," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, only a political solution can help to restore
durable peace and security in Angola," Annan said. "In this spirit,
I welcome the recent indication by the Angolan authorities that
the Lusaka Protocol remains a valid basis for the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge UNITA to demonstrate convincingly that it is
prepared to fulfill its commitments under the Lusaka Protocol,"
signed in July last year, "to seek genuine national reconciliation,
" Annan added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to meet on Angola Tuesday with

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Floods of the Kwanza River and
Lukala River have driven more than 20,000 residents in Angola's
central province of Kwanza-Norte to desperation, the official
Angolan news agency Angop reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the government of the Kambambe Municipality, the
village of Massangano has suffered much from the flood, which
devastated most of the agricultural fields in the village, leaving
the residents in dire need of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Reports on casualties and injuries are not available yet.
</P>
<P>
The fierce floods were attributed to the recent heavy rains in
the central-north region of Angola, where the mentioned rivers
rise in.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have also caused inundations in the central coastal
province of Benguela, killing 16 and displaced 2,000 families.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has declared the state of emergency in
the town of Dombe-Grande, which was ruined by the Coporolo River.
</P>
<P>
The central government is currently discussing how to avoid
heavy losses and preparing for sending humanitarian assistance to

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Rwandan Teachers Threaten to Demonstrate for Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 15,000 members of Rwanda's
Primary Teachers Syndicate have threatened to hold demonstrations
if their salary and medication problems are not immediately
solved, the Rwanda News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Salaries are not paid in the expected time and sometimes less
amount is received," Kayiranga Narcisse, president of the teachers
group, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"No accommodation and transport allowances are paid to them
like other civil servants," Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
"If such problems are not solved immediately, especially the
medication problem, teachers will demonstrate," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Teachers contribute five percent of their salaries for
medication that "is never rendered to them, for they are usually
tossed around in health centers and government hospitals,"
Narcisse pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to a teacher who preferred anonymity, "if the
government can not provide health services to teachers, no such
service fee should be deducted because that is being unfair."
</P>
<P>
However, Gatera John, who is in charge of primary schools
salary section, said that "teachers are paid in time like other
civil servants."
</P>
<P>
There is a four-month thorough program for reviewing teachers
qualifications and their salary structure and arrears are paid, he
said, noting that "some teachers do not have complete documents
for proper establishment of their qualifications."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has a total of 26,000 primary teachers, of whom 15,047
are members of the Primary Teachers Syndicate.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (
ADB)is likely to double its loan to India to about 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars this year, a senior ADB official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"ADB loan to India is likely to go up to 1.3 to 1.6 billion
dollars this calendar year as against a mere 625 million dollars
in 1999,"India's Executive Director to the Manila-based
multilateral funding agency C. Ramachandran told the media after a
meeting between visiting ADB president Tadao Chino and Indian
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha.
</P>
<P>
ADB had recognized that both India and China were eligible for
concessional assistance from one-billion-dollar Asian Development
Fund(ADF), said Ramachandaran, who was former expenditure
secretary in the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Though India is eligible to get up to one billion dollar loan
from ADB annually, it was not gone beyond 645 million dollars a
year in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the ADB president, Sinha reportedly
urged ADB to increase its loan to India to two billion dollars
with the possible clearance of two major projects in railways and
power sectors.

<HEADLINE> Militiaman, Civilian Killed in Explosions in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A militiaman of the Israeli-
backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed by a bomb attack in
southern Lebanon on Monday, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The roadside bomb attack, claimed by the Hezbollah guerrilla,
targeted an SLA patrol near the village of Houla in an Israeli-
occupied border enclave, the officials said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The ambush drew retaliatory artillery fire from Israeli gunners
who blasted suspected guerrilla infiltration trails in villages
across from Houla, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in another area in southern Lebanon, a Lebanese
civilian was killed and another was wounded Monday in a land mine
explosion. The mine was planted at a site where the SLA vacated one
week ago.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israel and its
allied militiamen of the SLA from the occupied zone, which Israel
set up in 1985 to protect its northern towns from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli warplanes carried out a series of airstrikes
on guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon following guerrilla
attacks that killed one and wounded another.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Visits Syria to Promote Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of State for
Maritime Transport and Meteorology Ramazan Mirzaoglu arrived here
Monday morning to promote bilateral ties, especially in transport
and meteorological fields.
</P>
<P>
Mirzaolglu was greeted at the Damascus International Airport by
Syrian Transportation Minister Mufid Abdel Karim.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Mirzaoglu told reporters that
his visit will be a prelude for boosting bilateral ties in all
areas, with the economic and commercial relations as the
priorities.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Karim on ways of boosting cooperation in
transportation, especially the maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
The then deputy Turkish prime minister Hikmet Ulugbay visited
Syria last March, the first time in 12 years that the two sides sat
down to discuss ways of strengthening economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic ties weakened recent years as a result of
Syria's support for the Turkish outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), which has been waging a war since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military threat to Syria, where PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan had taken shelter, led to the rebel chieftain's leave of the
country and his final arrest.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's increasingly close military link with Israel, the
former arch-foe of Syria, also has drawn concern and criticism
among the Arab states, including Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the Mideast peace talks, Mirzaoglu said that, with the
negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track resumed last December and
to enter the third round Wednesday, Turkey favors a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.  
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has forged an ever-stronger partnership with
Israel and are at odds with Syria over the last 15 years, has been
following the talks very closely. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish concerns are centered on the water issue, the
redeployment of Syrian troops, the Syrian stance on PKK rebels in
its territory, future U.S.-Syrian relations and the effects of a
Syrian-Israeli peace on Turkish-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
The Euphrates River which originates in Turkey flows down
through Syria and Iraq is often the source of disputes among the
three states.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Israel to Delay West Bank Pullout by 3 Weeks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said on Monday that he has decided to postpone a partial
Israeli troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank by up to
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the upcoming withdrawal, originally scheduled
for later this week, will not cover the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Within three weeks we will implement the next stage of 6.1
percent. I don't believe that Abu Dis will be a part of it," Barak
told reporters Monday after briefing the Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee of the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed between Israel and
the Palestinians last September, Israel has to withdraw on January
20 from another 6.1 percent of West Bank territories, following its
long-delayed second pullout from 5 percent of the West Bank earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Israel carried out its first withdrawal last September, handing
over 7 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the third redeployment, the two sides have some
differences over which areas should be included.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants Abu Dis, east of Jerusalem, and
several Arab villages north of the city to be included in the next
redeployment, but the Israeli side has not decided on that.

<HEADLINE> Women Leaders Vow to Seek Enhanced Women Empowerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Women leaders from all over the
world vowed to pursue their drive for more enhanced women
empowerment at their Global Forum which opened Monday at the
Philippine International Convention Center here.
</P>
<P>
Attending the forum are women politicians, academicians, issue
advocacy activists, policy makers and business leaders. They
examined the impact of women's political leadership on public
policy, political processes and governing institutions.
</P>
<P>
The women leaders have expressed their commitment to promote
the equitable participation of women in politics and decision-
making, and focused the forum discussions on changes in women's
power and decision-making since women won the right to vote and
hold public office several decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The reasons identified why women are not represented in power
and decision-making include lack of access to information, low
economic status, lack of financial support and the need to balance
family life with other demands.
</P>
<P>
The forum speakers pointed out that the penalties of unequal
access to power are not only borne by women but by the whole world
as well. They also noted that despite the obstacles, women are
breaking new grounds all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The Global Forum adopted a 10-point "New Millennium, New Rules"
guidelines to reflect their commitment and vision on the future of
women's leadership, which urges the female gender to:
</P>
<P>
1. Transform the process of politics to reflect the lives,
needs and aspirations of women;
</P>
<P>
2. Level the playing fields;
</P>
<P>
3. Put our money where our beliefs are;
</P>
<P>
4. Assume responsibility for our own equality;
</P>
<P>
5. Inspire our daughters to embrace leadership and power;
</P>
<P>
6. Get guns, goons and gold out of politics;
</P>
<P>
7. Share all strategic and tactical information about winning
elections and toppling dictators;
</P>
<P>
8. Balance the power: "if we make up half of the population, we
should manage half the power;"
</P>
<P>
9. Be proactive not reactive; and
</P>
<P>
10. No more waiting.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and
former Philippine president Corazon Aquino are among the speakers
of the forum that will run until January 19, 2000.

MOGADISHU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Somali young lady got a
15-day imprisonment and 25 whips on Saturday for behaving like a
man, which is considered a serious violation against the Islamic

<HEADLINE> Angolan Currency Devalues 405 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan national currency
devalued 404.5 percent in 1999, depriving the population of 80.2
percent of their deposits, official source said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1999, the exchange rate in the country was
one U.S. dollar for 1.1 million Readjusted Kwanzas, but at the end
of the year, this rate changed to one U.S. dollar for some 5.5
million Readjusted Kwanzas.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan population suffered the most serious loss during
August last year, with a 39 percent depreciation rate of the
national currency. In July,

September and April, the devaluation rates also exceeded 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous year, the devaluation rate of 1999
increased by 110 percent, which was the highest rate in the latest
three years since 1997 when the government began exerting pressure
upon the exchange market, mainly through the control of emission
of currency.
</P>
<P>
Due to the stricter measures adopted by the government, the
devaluation rates in the recent three years were much less than
the rates before the year of 1997, which registered respectively
at 1450, 1150, 1800 and 950 percent in the four years following
1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the National Bank of Angola replaced the Readjusted
Kwanza with the new monetary unit Kwanza, setting the price of
Kwanza at one Kwanza equivalent to one million Readjusted Kwanzas.

<HEADLINE> EU: Agreement Under Convention of Biodiversity Must be Concluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Monday that it considers that an international environmental
agreement under the Convention of Biodiversity must be concluded
when an environmental conference is held from next Monday to
Friday in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU executive branch, said the
concerned protocol aims to facilitate a proper risk assessment
prior to cross-border movements of Living Modified Organisms
derived from biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
A primary objective of this protocol is to enable developing
countries often lacking adequate legislation and administrative
capacity to take well founded decisions on the import of living
genetically modified organisms and thereby to protect their
biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said in a statement that the international
community must demonstrate that it takes the concerns of the
public about the safety of biotechnology seriously.
</P>
<P>
The final negotiation meeting of the Protocol on Biosafety will
be held in Montreal on January 24-28. This would be the first
protocol under the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted at
the Rio Conference in 1992. Formal negotiations were kicked off by
the second Conference of the parties to that convention in 1995 in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The previous efforts to finalize the protocol in Cartagena,
Columbia, in February 1999, ended without agreement after the
Miami group, comprising six major crop exporting countries
including the U.S., opposed an EU compromise proposal supported by
all other participants, the European Commission said.

<HEADLINE> Machinery Industry Reports Sound Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry
reported sound growth in the first 11 months of 1999, thanks to
the deepening of reform last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the total added value of the
industry between January and November last year stood at 490.4
billion yuan (about 60 billion U.S. dollars), surging 12.3 percent
on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The industry reported a profit of 8.9 billion yuan (about 1.1
billion U.S. dollars) in the January-October period, soaring 52
percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
China's economic policies aimed at stimulating domestic demand
have in turn given a boost to the machinery industry, which showed
accelerated growth last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the product/sales ratio of the industry also
improved, reaching 96.44 percent from January to October last year.
</P>
<P>
The industry is expected to score a ten-percent growth in
output value next year with profits increasing by five percent,
according to the State Administration of Machinery Industry (SAMI).
</P>
<P>
However, problems such as outdated technologies and poor
management in some companies are hindering the sound development
of the industry, said Wu Xiaohua, director of the SAMI.
</P>
<P>
China will push to optimize the structure of its machinery
industry by promoting technical upgrading and finely-tuning its
competitive edge, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The SAMI is also set to remove products which are heavy-
polluting and energy-wasting.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Visits Syria to Promote Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of State for
Maritime Transport and Meteorology Merza Ughlu arrived here Monday
morning to promote bilateral ties, especially in transport and
meteorological fields.
</P>
<P>
Ughlu was greeted at the Damascus international airport by
Syrian Transportation Minister Mufid Abdel Karim.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Ughlu told reporters that his
visit will be a prelude for boosting bilateral ties in all areas,
with the economic and commercial relations as the priorities.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Karim on ways of boosting cooperation in
transportation, especially the maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
Turkish then deputy Prime Minister Hikmet Ulugbay visited Syria
last March, the first time in 12 years that the two sides sat down
to discuss ways of strengthening economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic ties weakened recent years as a result of
Syria's support for the Turkish outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), which has been waging a war since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military threat to Syria, where PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan had taken shelter, led to the rebel chieftain's leave of the
country and his final arrest.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's increasingly close military link with Israel, the
former arch-foe of Syria, also has drawn concern and criticism
among the Arab states, including Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the Mideast Peace talks, with the negotiations on the Syrian-
Israeli track resumed last December and to enter the third round
Wednesday, Ughlu said Turkey favor a just and comprehensive peace
in the region.   Turkey, forging an ever-stronger partnership with
Israel, and at odds with Syria over the last 15 years, has been
following the talks very closely.  Turkish concerns are centered
on the water issue, the redeployment of Syrian troops, the Syrian
stance on PKK rebels in its territory, future U.S.-Syrian relations
and the effects of a Syrian-Israeli peace on Turkish-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
The Euphrates River which originates in Turkey flows down
through Syria and Iraq is often the source of disputes among the
three states.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Spiritual Leader Stresses Return of Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of
the Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas, said Monday that the
return of all Palestinian refugees to their homeland, rather than
the declaration of an independent state, was the core in solving
the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a meeting in his office in Palestinian-
ruled Gaza with a delegation of U.S. university students, local
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Yassin said the Palestinian people look forward to an all-out
and just peace that brings back all their legitimate rights and
allows the return of all Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
A just peace could not be achieved if the refugees could not
return their homes and if the Israeli settlements still remain on
the Palestinian territories, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin chided the U.S., Israel's powerful ally, and the United
Nations for adopting a double-standard policies in dealing with
refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the U.N. is bringing other refugees in the
world back to their countries, it does nothing for the return of
the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader dismissed as "false and untrue" the U.S. charge
that his group is a terrorist group, arguing that Hamas "is not
involved in any terrorist actions but, rather, defends itself, its
people and its homeland."
</P>
<P>
He termed Hamas as not only a military movement, but also a
political, social and humanitarian organization.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or the Palestinian Resistance Movement, has been engaged
in a holy war aimed at liberating all Palestinian territories
occupied by Israel in all previous Middle East wars. It had claimed
responsibilities for several deadly attacks on Israeli targets
since its inception 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
About the ongoing negotiations between Syria and Israel, Yassin
said he welcomes the return of any inch of the occupied Arab
territories, saying the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle
East conflict.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinians were displaced and forced to find
shelters in neighboring Arab countries in the Arab-Israeli
conflicts in the past half century.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that the refugees have the right to go
back to their homeland while Israel bluntly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The refugee issue was among the thorny topics to be dealt with
in the ongoing final-status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Reiterates Disappointment at Seattle WTO Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore reiterated on
Monday its disappointment at the failure of the Seattle WTO
Ministerial Conference to launch a new round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the meeting "is a great disappointment to us,"
Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo said to Parliament Monday
when he was asked to comment on the impact of the failed World
Trade Organization (WTO) meeting on the Singapore economy.
</P>
<P>
Although the failure has no immediate impact on the Singapore
economy, but as a trading nation, Singapore is "naturally
concerned that the momentum of multilateral trade liberalization
could falter as enthusiasm wanes in the wake of Seattle," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Singapore is also concerned about the
systemic implications, in particular the political support for the
institution of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Already, protectionist forces, emboldened by their perceived
victory, are now on the offensive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore will work with other like-minded countries towards
the expeditious resumption of negotiations at Geneva, Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
"A new round which takes into account the interests of all WTO
members would be important in ensuring that the world does not
slip into protectionism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 135 WTO members at the third ministerial
conference last December failed to reach an agreement on the
launch of a new round of trade liberalization talks this year.
</P>
<P>
Since then Singapore officials have repeatedly expressed their
disappointment at the frustration.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Stock Market
started the week with a weaker note as the benchmark Straits Times
Index (STI) ended Monday session down 50.49 points or 2.1 percent
to 2,342.04 points.
</P>
<P>
Total volume contracted to 297.10 million shares worth 565.56
million Singapore dollars (about 338.07 million U.S. dollars).
Declining issues outstripped advancers by 239 to 82 with 182
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The largest block was the 13.69 million parcel by Poh Lian
which was transacted at 0.73 Singapore dollars per share. It was
followed by Datapulse which had 11.48 million shares done.
Kingboard was the next with 10.82 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 topped the gainers list surging up 160 cents to a
close of 29.60 Singapore dollars. StarCru rose 40 cents to finish
at 9.85 U.S. dollars. Chartered and Venture picked up 20 cents to
end at 11.20 and 22.70 Singapore dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, SPH was the biggest loser of the day plunging
by 210 cents to close at 32.90 Singapore dollars. SPH 100
plummeted by 170 cents to finish at 33.20 Singapore dollars. DBS
fell 90 cents to end at 23.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was weighed down by the selling of blue
chips by institutional funds on a combination of factors.
</P>
<P>
They noted that there was some profit-taking on key banking
stocks and also some switching of funds from Singapore into other
regional markets deemed to be laggards.
</P>
<P>
They said Monday's biggest losers were the major blue chips of
banking stocks led by DBS Group Holdings as they lost ground and
put heavy pressure on the STI.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also noted that the bright sparks in the market were
the small cap stocks with all occupying the top actives spots, and
the electronics sector also shone on Monday with the support by
the Nasdaq's strong showing last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said there was interest in the construction-related
stocks as they are seen to be benefiting from the pickup in the
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sharp drop suffered by SPH, analysts said the
correction was to be expected given that funds have been in
overbought positions.

<HEADLINE> Lagos State to Adopt Digital Mapping for Development Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lagos State government plans
to produce the first set of digital maps to guide physical
development efforts in the state, The Guardian newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abiodun Akinyemi, permanent secretary at the Lands Bureau of
Lagos Governor's office, revealed that for the first time in the
history of mapping in Lagos, the digital maps could be ready
within six months.
</P>
<P>
A two-part project is scheduled to take off next month with the
first phase of the project, the aerial photography, fixed between
February and April this year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the digital maps "will make things easier for
us as it will give much more information compared to the analogue
ones."
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary noted that the digital maps which would
replace the last maps produced in 1986 "will not only show the
acreage of land but recent developments because everything
visible to a certain limit will be shown."
</P>
<P>
From the maps, a lot of things can be planned and effectively
monitored, and these things include refuse disposal,
infrastructure provision, income taxation, population projection,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
The exercise of digital mapping is supposed to be done every
five years, so as to keep pace with the fast rate of development
in a place like Lagos,

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic courts in Lower
Shabelleh region of Somalia Monday captured over 1,000 kilograms
of drug known as Hashish in Boslay village, some 10 kilometers
south of Bulo Marer near the southern port town of Merca.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdinasir Dahir Mohamed, the Islamic courts
militia leader in Bulo Marer village about 130 kilometers south of
the capital, his men discovered that Monday was the harvesting
time for Hashish to be distributed throughout Southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 heavily armed Islamic militiamen on two battle wagons
surrounded the Hashish farm at a time when the Hashish growers had
filled ten big sacks each carrying 100 kilograms, with a total
market value of 500 million Somali shillings (about 50,000 U.S.
dollars), ready to be loaded on a lorry.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Mohamed said the consignment of the
greatest racket in the drug trafficking business in the region had
been brought to their office together with a culprit arrested at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic judges, three other drug dealers
escaped and are being pursued in the jungle surrounding the
village.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the Islamic courts intelligence services have
been conducting a general surveillance in the region in
controlling farmers suspected of growing illegal crops such as
Hashish and Marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Just the day before, the Islamic court militiamen apprehended
another drug dealer, Hajji Hassan Abukar, who was caught
red-handed selling 10 kilograms of Hashish in an underground
market in the Bulo Marer village.
</P>
<P>
The drug dealer was then subjected to Islamic trial and
sentenced to one year term imprisonment and 40 lashes in public.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi and Lindsay
Davenport scored easy wins at the Australian Open on Monday while
Sweden's Thomas Enqvist became another seed victim after being
upset by Australian journeyman Richard Fromberg in the first Grand
Slam of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the men's top seed, advanced into the second round with
a 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Argentine Mariano Puerta on the
center court at Melbourne Park on the opening day of the first
Grand Slam of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Women's number two seed Davenport also sailed into the second
round as she disposed of Frenchwoman Sarah Pitkowski 6-3, 6-1 in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Pete Sampras, seeking a record 13th Grand Slam title,
rounded off the day's play with a confident 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 win
against host Wayne Arthurs in the last match on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Enqvist, seeded sixth after making the final last year,
became the first big name to fall when Fromberg scored a gripping
6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 3-6, 10-8 win after three hours and 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Russian Anna Kournikova took the shortest matches of the
opening day, whitewashing a hapless Patricia Wartusch of Austria 6-
0, 6-0 in only 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo, who reached the Open final in 1999, is seeded seventh
this year and brushed aside Spaniard Cristina Torrens Valero 6-1,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Much of the early drama was provided by British hope Tim Henman,
the 11th seed who stumbled his way to a 6-7, 6-3, 7-6, 7-6 win
over Frenchman Jerome Golmard.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Todd Martin of the United States also had a tough
opener, fighting back from two sets down to beat plucky Byron
Black of Zimbabwe 5-7 6-7 6-4 6-2 8-6 in another early marathon.
</P>
<P>
Big-serving Australian Mark Philippoussis was made to work
harder than expected before the 16th seed beat Israeli qualifier
Noam Okun 6-4, 6-2, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The first seed to fall was Anke Huber of Germany, the women's
15th seed beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Karol Kucera, the men's 14th seed, then fell 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3
to Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan, the Slovak saying his own poor
play had more to do with the loss than Paradorn.

BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China returned some 400,000
hectares of cultivated land to forest, pasture and lakes in 1999
as part of its ambitious environmental improvement program.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Land and Resources show that
China returned 40 percent more land to nature last year than in

<HEADLINE> College Entrepreneurs Attract Huge Risk Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Lu Jun and his four classmates
can rest easy about their fledgling computer company's future now
that a 6.6-million-yuan risk fund deal has been clinched with a
Shanghai-based investor.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based FanSo Company, which was established last
September and provides on-line information services, is the
brainchild of five students at Qinghua University, one of China's
most prestigious schools in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The university introduced a new regulation recently that allows
students to defer study for up to two years in exchange for
practical experience in the working world.
</P>
<P>
Lu and his friends are the first group of young people at
Qinghua to test the waters of big business, and their efforts have
paid off: In less than six months since it was established, more
than 100 investors nationwide have shown interest in their company,
and many have even offered risk investment.
</P>
<P>
After serious consideration, the young entrepreneurs chose the
Shanghai Pudong Fortune Capital, an capital management firm which
specializes in the Internet, as their leading investor. FanSo also
signed deals with Siemens and several other companies in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Yi Wei, president of the Shanghai-based company, praised FanSo'
s "team spirit" and said the huge potential for networking with
college students was a determining factor in the decision to back
the five students.
</P>
<P>
Currently, FanSo employs 60 computer professionals, 20 of whom
are still students and computer whizzes. The board of directors
and high-level managers are all students, Lu Jun said.
</P>
<P>
"Currently our business scope is focused on providing
information for students on campus, as we know exactly what
college students are interested in," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of China's four million Internet surfers
are college students, and 80-90 percent of university students are
skilled in computer science.

<HEADLINE> Power Sector Expects 8.6 Billion Yuan in Profit This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The China State Power Corp (
CSPC) expects to sell 836 billion kwh of electricity and make a
profit of 8.6 billion yuan by the end of this year by
restructuring the power industry and developing power grids.
</P>
<P>
According to CSPC president Gao Yan, China plans to set up the
modern corporate system in the power sector this year and aims to
squeeze the SCPC onto the list of the world's top 500 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country has done a lot to perfect the newly-established
State Power Corporation in the past year, and has made remarkable
progress in transforming it into a giant corporation with more
modern operating methods and a share-holding system, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China witnessed overall growth in its power
sector in 1999, adding that the country has made headway in
developing and renovating the urban and rural power grids,
including 87 urban grid projects and 1,590 rural ones.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country has effectively restructured its power-
generation industry in shutting down a large number of small
thermal power plants with high coal consumption, heavy pollution
and poor economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao, China's power industry will undergo
nationwide technological renovations this year, which are designed
to control pollution, increase economic returns and guarantee safe
operations.

<HEADLINE> Economy Stabilized in Pakistan, Musharraf Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf has said that the economy of the country
has been stabilized and the government is looking forward to an
economic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua prior to his leaving for
China early Monday morning, General Musharraf said that his
government had inherited a precarious economic situation.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has stabilized the economy by quickly
concluding rescheduling agreements with Paris Club members and
commercial creditors and successfully launching a recovery
campaign against loan defaulters, the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
The new Economic Revival Plan was then worked out through a
broad-based consultative process involving some 200 experts from
various economic disciplines, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Its strategic objective is to achieve self-reliance, by
reducing the debt burden and following a sustainable path of
economic development," Musharraf said.
</P>
<P>
According to the chief executive, this is the first time such a
focus has been developed and his government is encouraged by the
positive response it is receiving from donors and lenders for such
"a shift in policy."
</P>
<P>
"There are already signs that indicate a turnaround in economic
conditions," General Musharraf observed, citing "the stock market
rebound, textiles boom, stable prices, improved recoveries of
government and bank dues and acceptance of our bonds of extended
maturity."
</P>
<P>
The chief executive noted that an Economic Advisory Board has
been established to take charge of monitoring the implementation
of the economic policy. "I am sure that the momentum we have
unleashed will be preserved and accelerated over time," he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Largest Debt Restructuring Deal Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Petrochemical Industry's (
TPI) long-delayed 3.4 billion U.S. dollars debt restructuring deal
is finally reached by the deadline on Monday, with creditors
holding 30 percent of TPI's enlarged share capital through a debt
to equity conversion.
</P>
<P>
The company and its creditors announced that they have reached
an agreement in submitting a "consensual and comprehensive" debt
restructuring plan to a local court in order to restore the
company to sound financial health, according to a press release
issued by the Steering Committee of TPI Creditors and TPI.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the agreed Rehabilitation Plan will gain
acceptance by the court without dissent," the press release said,
adding that the court's statutory timetable will allow for final
approval of the agreed restructuring plan by no later than June,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreed plan, TPI executive will assume the role of
planner, retain day-to-day management of the company with the
committee monitoring the business.
</P>
<P>
The company will work with the steering committee to reduce
debt to manageable levels over a five-year period, while allowing
TPI's existing management to focus on its core business.
</P>
<P>
TPI, Thailand's largest debtor, defaulted soon after the
effective devaluation of the Thai baht on July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The debt deal has been under negotiation with the company's 148
creditors since August 1997, when the company declared a
unilateral moratorium on debt interest and principal payments,
citing losses because of the baht's sudden slide from around 25.8
baht per dollar in July 1997 to around 32 by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Among TPI's main foreign creditors are the World Bank's
International Finance Corp, Bank of America, Citibank, Australia
and New Zealand Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Sanawa Bank.
</P>
<P>
Major local creditors are Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank and
Bank of Ayudhya.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the creditors were determined to
force TPI to go through the bankruptcy court for business
restructuring if the company could not meet the deadline of
January 17.

LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Sunday in the country's capital Abuja approved the
release of 100 million naira (about one million U.S. dollars) for
the forthcoming African Heads of State summit on Malaria.
</P>
<P>
The summit will take place in April in Abuja to check the
rising incidence of the disease in the continent, according to a
report by the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of a national steering committee
on the summit, Health Minister Tim Menakaya said the group, whose
membership is drawn from a cross-section of the private and public
health sector, international health agencies and other
stakeholders, is expected to brainstorm on modalities to renew
action towards eradicating the devastating malaria.
</P>
<P>
Affirming that 300,000 children under the age of five globally
die yearly from malaria infection, Menakaya urged members of the
organized private sector and stakeholders in the health sector to
mobilize support towards a successful summit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Halts Troop Withdrawal from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has halted its withdrawal
of its troops in Sierra Leone to prevent dangerous vacuum in the
war-torn West African country, said the commander of t he West
Africa Peace Keeping Force (ECOMOG) at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted ECOMOG
 Commander Major Gen. Gabriel Kpamber as saying on Sunday that the
halt was to enable full deployment of United Nations peacekeeping
force in the country.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG was not meant to stay in Sierra Leone forever, but we
will continue until the UN peacekeepers are fully deployed,"
Kpamber said.
</P>
<P>
Kpamber made the remarks during his visit in the rebel
stronghold of Koidu in northern Sierra Leone at the weekend for
the first time since the signing of the peace accord in Lome last
July. He was accompanied by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
leader Foday Sankoh during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit was made to strengthen and promote reconciliation
among the rival combatants after almost a decade of brutal
fighting.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo during his inauguration on May 29
last year had vowed to withdraw Nigerian troops in phases as the
country could no longer sustain the cost of maintaining the
peacekeepers alone.
</P>
<P>
But to prevent further armed struggle, the UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan last year proposed a 6,000 strong intervention force
comprising Nigerian, Kenyan and Indian forces to be led by an
Indian commander under UN auspices.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage has brought a huge relief to most Sierra Leoneans
and the UN,
</P>
<P>
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
More than one third of the 10,000 Nigerian troops had been
pulled out as it is now obvious that the rest will remain behind.

LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) should emulate
Nigeria's efforts to facilitate regional integration, the ECOWAS
secretariat said in a statement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted the statement as saying
that Nigeria has done a good job in the implementation of the
protocol on free movement of persons, goods and capital signed in
Lome, Togo in December last year at the 22nd ECOWAS summit.

<P>
All the road blocks along the highways linking the most
populous African country with its neighboring ECOWAS states have

integration, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "the ECOWAS executive secretariat is pleased at
this positive development and commends the Nigerian authorities
for the bold move which, it is hoped, will serve as an example to
the whole sub-region."
</P>
<P>
The secretariat called on community citizens to demonstrate
civic responsibility and obey the different laws in force in
member states, particularly those relating to law and order.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves rose to 75.6 billion U.S. dollars as of last Saturday,
the Bank of Korea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the foreign exchange reserves came from the
repayment of foreign currency deposits by domestic banks and
financial institutions to the central bank, said a bank spokesman.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves stood at some four
billion U.S. dollars when the nation borrowed 58 billion U.S.
dollars from the International Monetary Fund in December 1997
after it was gripped by a financial crisis caused by corporate
failures and bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign exchange reserves increased to 48.51
billion U.S. dollars in December 1998 and then to 74.05 billion at
the end of last year along with the economic recovery in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government announced Monday that it would
raise its foreign exchange reserves to 90 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of this year.

Zhu said that both countries are able to maintain stable
development in bilateral relations because they strictly adhere to
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan, both developing countries, consistently

and have carried out successful cooperation both in the cause of
building their own countries and in international affairs, said
Zhu, adding that the Chinese government and people are satisfied
with the growth of bilateral relations.

"Pakistan is a country that loves peace, and will contribute to
peace and stability in South Asia," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the internal affairs of a country should
and must be handled by its own people, which is not only the core
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but also a basic
policy China has steadfastly pursued and carried out in handling
relations between different countries.
</P>
<P>
China believes that Musharaf will continue to properly handle
the various issues presently facing Pakistan and will win more
understanding and support from the international community, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning bilateral economic and trade ties, both sides
promised to work together to explore new approaches and new ways
to promote bilateral trade and economic developments.
</P>
<P>
Zhu suggested that both sides further enhance macro-directions
for bilateral economic and trade activities, pointing out that
contract cooperation should be expanded and Chinese enterprises
will, as always, be encouraged to invest in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Zhu and Musharaf attended the signing ceremony
of a cooperation agreement on economic technology between both
governments.

saying that this is not only an important agreement reached by the
two countries, but is also the common aspiration of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
The land border treaty contributes to the further growth of
bilateral relations, and will serve to maintain regional peace and
stability, Bui Hong Phuc said. He expressed the conviction that
all the agreements will be translated into action, and Sino-
Vietnamese relations will substantially develop in the years ahead.

<HEADLINE> CAS to Launch Program to Develop West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will launch a scientific and technological program to help
develop the vast area of west China, CAS President Lu Yongxiang
said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the CAS will increase spending in research
projects for the development of areas in west China and will try
to attract more young scientists to work in those areas, Lu told a
working conference of the CAS, which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that since it was founded in 1949, the CAS has
established a group of research institutes in west China to meet
the demands of national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Since the knowledge innovation program started in 1998, the
academy has reformed some of the institutes and set up a research
center for environment resources and sustainable development in
northwest China as well as a center for studies and use of
biological diversity and biological resources in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will carry out surveys on biological resources and
environment in western areas, and launch high-technology projects
on the development of petroleum, natural gas and some new kinds of
energy, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the academy will further cooperate with local
governments and all kinds of economic entities in west China and
play a more active role in the scientific and technological
progress in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will also increase the annual funding for the "Light of
West China" program, which is aimed to cultivate leading
researchers and scientists in west China, from three million yuan
to five million yuan (about 60 million U.S. dollars). The program
is expected to attract more young scientists to work in the
western region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
vowed to firmly safeguard social stability, saying it is of vital
importance to China's reform and development in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, made the remark at the first
plenary meeting of the Central Commission for Comprehensive
Management of Social Problems, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Luo, also director of the commission, said that in 1999,
various member departments under the commission had centered on
economic construction, stuck to anti-crime campaign, and promoted
the building of safe communities, making great contributions to
China's reform and development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in 2000, priority should be given to the
crackdown on those illicit activities hampering the development of
state-owned enterprises, and on violent crimes involving firearms,
explosives and criminal rings.
</P>
<P>
Luo added that the strike on the Falun Gong cult, pornography,
gambling and narcotics will be continued.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that departments including public security,
railways, communications, and civil aviation, should work hard to
ensure traffic safety and a stable social environment, especially
in the forthcoming Spring Festival, China's lunar new year, which
falls on February 5.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A newly-opened subway passing
through the heart of the Chinese capital was closed today due to a
sudden power failure.
</P>
<P>
The power outage occurred this morning after a transformer
substation was submerged by water leaking from a broken pipeline,
according to the accident investigator. All 11 stations along the
line have been closed and emergency repair work is underway.
</P>
<P>
The east-to-west Fuxingmen-Bawangfen subway, which connects
with the old westbound subway, is an underground traffic trunk of
Beijing which runs through the city's busiest areas, including the
Tiananmen Square and the Wangfujing shopping district.
</P>
<P>
The 13.5-kilometer line opened last September after ten years
of construction, which cost 7.57 billion yuan (about 900 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has two intersecting subway lines with a total
length of 54 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Enzhu Briefs Media on Renaming of Xinhua Branches in HK, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch will be renamed the Liaison Office of the Central
People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) as from January 18, said Jiang Enzhu, director of the body,
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch will be renamed
the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR), said Jiang at a tea party
held for the media.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has appointed Jiang Enzhu and Wang Qiren as
directors of the liaison offices of the Central People's
Government in the HKSAR and the MSAR, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since both Hong Kong and Macao have returned to China, it is
necessary for the representative offices of the Central People's
Government in the HKSAR and the MSAR to have names which match
their nature, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The decision to rename the two bodies has also been made to
promote the implementation of the policies of "One Country, Two
Systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "Macao people
governing Macao," and a high degree of autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the main duties of the new Liaison Office
in Hong Kong include maintaining contact with the Office of the
Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PLA
Garrison in the HKSAR and helping relevant governmental
departments on the mainland manage mainland organizations and
enterprises in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Liaison Office will also promote cooperation between Hong
Kong and the mainland in a number of areas including education,
science and technology, culture and sports and further develop
exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong. Other functions
include dealing with matters related to Taiwan and duties assigned
by the Central People's Government.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Japan Fail to Reach Agreement on Oil Concession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Minister of
International Trade and Industry Takashi Fukaya left Riyadh Monday
without sealing a deal on the renewal of a crucial Japanese oil
concession in the neutral zone Saudi Arabia shares with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A 20-member delegation headed by Fukaya arrived in Saudi Arabia
late Friday to discuss the renewal of the drilling rights of the
Tokyo-based Arabian Oil Company (AOC) in the Saudi portion of the
neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
But two days of intensive talks between Japanese and Saudi
officials ended fruitless, according to reports reaching here from
the Saudi capital.
</P>
<P>
Even a promise made by the Japanese side to support Riyadh's bid
to join the World Trade Organization did not do much help.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle has been a Saudi demand that Japan invest more
than 2 billion U.S. dollars in a Saudi railway project to improve
access to remote mining areas. Riyadh was also said to have asked
for an increase in Japanese import of crude oil from Saudi Arabia,
the world's biggest oil producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports about 1 million barrels of the Saudi oil per day,
accounting for nearly 22 percent of its needs.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Japanese delegation was quoted as saying on
Sunday that they "offered the Saudis a loan to finance the railway
but the Saudis insisted on direct investment." But he expected
another round of talks in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies hold 78 percent of AOC's shares, while Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait each own 11 percent.  AOC's production in the
fields on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border was estimated at 280,000 barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
Its 40-year concession with Saudi Arabia will expire on February
27, while the concession with Kuwait expires in 2003.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team in Baghdad to Assess Condition of Iraq's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. oil expert team arrived
in Baghdad early Monday for a comprehensive survey of the condition
of the Iraqi oil production sector and of its needs for spare parts
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The team, which comprises experts from Britain, Jordan, the
Netherlands and Russia, was established by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to report on alternatives for increasing Iraq's oil
production and export capacity, and on options for involving
foreign oil companies in Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
These oil experts will also assess the impact of holds placed by
the U.N. Sanctions Committee on Iraq, on contracts for spare parts
and equipment for the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest U.N. Security Council's omnibus resolution on
Iraq adopted last December, a group of oil experts will have to
report by March 26 to the Security Council on Iraq's existing oil
production and export capacity and to make recommendations in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said in the resolution that it is ready to
authorize additions to the current allocation for oil spare parts
and equipment on the basis of report and recommendations of this
oil expert team.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program which started
in May 1998, Iraq has been allowed by the Security Council to spend
300 million U.S. dollars from its oil revenues on oil spare parts
and equipment in each phase of six months.
</P>
<P>
However, Baghdad has argued that the sum is far from enough to
rehabilitate its dilapidated oil industry and asked for raising
allocations for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Though Iraq has openly rejected the latest U.N. Security Council
resolution, it has not voiced any opposition to the visit of this
U.N. oil expert team.

<HEADLINE> Blast Injures 20 in Israeli Coastal Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Monday that he took "a grave view" over a pipe bomb blast in
northern coastal city of Hadera and that Israel would use all its
means to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Barak said the Israeli
government would act at all its might and take all necessary
measures to smash terrorist activities aimed at derailing the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the comment after at least 20 people were injured in
the explosion that occurred near a bank in downtown Hadera, north
of Tel Aviv. Israeli police are treating the matter as a
nationalist incident committed by Arab militants.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel Radio that he
believed the explosion was carried out by "elements hostile to the
peace process," noting that the means was similar to a pipe bombing
in another coastal city of Netanya, not far from Hadera, last
November.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people were injured in the explosion in Netanya, on
November 7, one day before Israel and the Palestinians formally
launched the final-status talks. Palestinian militants were blamed
for that attack.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the
explosion in Hadera, but Israeli security facilities were trying to
find out if the perpetrators came from the West Bank, which is not
far from Hadera, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has warned the Israeli public of possible terror attacks
as the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks made progress. Militant
Palestinian groups opposed to the peace process have carried out a
series of attacks in Israel since 1993, when the peace process was
kicked off.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, tackling final-status and
interim issues, have been moving on in the last several months,
although at a snail's pace.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Give Priority to Settling Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the riot-torn
Maluku, Indonesia, has been under control and the central
government would give priority to settling communal violence there,
senior government officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with the National Supreme Advisory
Council (DPA) here, Commander of the Indonesian Military (TNI) Adm.
Widodo A.S. said the TNI had taken necessary measures to overcome
communal clashes in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"And with such actions, the situation (in Maluku province) has
been under control. The most important thing is how to maintain
the momentum and settle (the conflict there) through
reconciliation and rehabilitation," Widodo said.
</P>
<P>
Territorial Chief of Staff of the TNI Lieut. Gen. Agus Widjojo
also said the situation in Maluku Province has been much better.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the security situation in Maluku has been improving.
.. And the situation in Ternate, North Halmahera and South
Halmahera can be controlled," Widjojo was quoted by Antara News
Agency as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Minister of Home Affairs Surjadi Soedirdja said the
government would give priority to settling violence in Maluku as
well as Aceh.
</P>
<P>
"We want such a problem to die down soon," Surjadi said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we could not set a time frame when the government
could end the ethnic bloodshed there," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say quantitatively when violence in Ambon will end.
But the sooner, the better. And the government along with security
forces has been working out (to settle the Ambon case very soon),"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However he admitted that the Ambon tragedy was very sad as it
has lasted for a year and claimed many civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
Based on official reports, about 1,130 people have died since
the conflict began in January last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Abdurrahman Wahid expected that the conflict
in Ambon would die down within two months.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked the people in the troubled region to
forget the tragedy they had experienced and try to think only of
the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Amid rising rumors about a
possible military coup in Indonesia, president Abdurrahman Wahid
insisted on Monday that the Indonesian Military (TNI) will not do
that.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Bina Graha Presidential Office, Wahid
said he had never thought that such an action (a military coup)
will take place.
</P>
<P>
"I never think that it will happen," the president was quoted
by the national Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a military coup have been rising in Indonesia due to
the unstable security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Denying that he would dismiss Coordinating Minister of Politics
and Security Gen. Wiranto, the president also insisted that he had
never thought at all to reshuffle his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"I never think of that," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Commander of the TNI Adm. Widodo A.S. also denied a
possible military coup in Indonesia due to the security situation
in some areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Who will launch a coup d'etat? You should look into (TNI)
history that so far the TNI has never launched a coup d'etat,"
Widodo was quoted by the agency as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the MPR Amien Rais also said the TNI would not
launch a coup against President Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe at all that the TNI would launch a coup d'etat
against President Abdurrahman Wahid," Amien was quoted by Suara
Pembaruan daily as saying.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Meet to Assess Achievements in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- In the past 10 years, the
number of primary school children in the Asia-Pacific region has
grown from about 330 million to about 400 million, some 400
participants attending a U.N. conference were told here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The region also saw dramatic improvement in early child
education and development, said the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in a report for the Asia-
Pacific Conference on Education for All 2000 Assessment, which was
inaugurated here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Victor Ordonez, director of the UNESCO Principal Regional
Office for Asia and the Pacific, also noted that in the area of
primary schooling enrollment, China is the most successful in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 20 years, China had done the nearly miraculous
feat of moving participation in schools from 30-40 percent to over
95 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's success lay on a strong political will of the central
government and a continuity of leadership and authority at the
local and provincial levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for many countries hit by the Asian financial crisis, such
as Thailand, the governments have preserved the education budget
because they know that it is a long-run investment, Ordonez said.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
his country has been working hard to provide children and youth
with greater educational opportunities and eradicate illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand adopted a new constitution in 1997, which stipulates
a 12-year compulsory education for every Thai citizen, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This new law will help modernize our teaching-learning process,
improve educational administration and management, mobilize

<HEADLINE> Sharif's Trial Adjourned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- An anti-terrorism court in
the southern Pakistani city of Karachi Monday adjourned again the
hearing into the charges of criminal conspiracy and hijacking
against ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, sources from Karachi
said.
</P>
<P>
Judge Rehmet Hussain Jaffari announced the adjournment after
Sharif's lawyers said they were still waiting for the cassette
recording of conversations that occurred on October 12, 1999, in
the control tower of the Karachi International Airport, which was
said to be extra evidence.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was removed from power in a military coup on October 12
last year. The military government later charged him with
attempted murder, hijacking, criminal conspiracy and waging war
against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It says the ousted prime minister jeopardized the lives of
Pakistan's military head General Pervez Musharraf and some 200
other passengers when their plane was prevented from landing at
the Karachi airport on the night of the coup.
</P>
<P>
The hearing into the case had been postponed several times.
During the last hearing on January 12, Justice Shabbir Ahmed of
the High Court of Sindh Province declared that he could not
conduct a fair trial because of the presence of intelligence
officials in the courtroom and transferred the case to the anti-
terrorism court.

Kumaratunga on Monday escaped another attempt on her life as a

President Kumaratunga is still recovering from her injuries
after a suicide bomber launched an attack at an election rally

</P>
<P>
That attack has been blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam(LTTE) who has been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Claims Positive Visit to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- President of the U.N. Angolan
Sanctions Committee Robert Fowler has qualified his visit to
Angola as positive, according to a report by the official
newspaper Jornal de Angola here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-day visit to Angola, Fowler met with many VIPs
of various circles, including the repentant rebel military leader
Jacinto Bandua, and obtained much important information from talks
and the on-the- spot investigation.
</P>
<P>
Fowler said that his talks with Bandua gave him a lot of useful
 information for locating the routes and the individuals involved
in the arms traffic for the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"We had a long-lasting meeting with General Jacinto Bandua, and
we will get together the information we got from him," said
Fowler, who was in Angola to seek better ways for reinforcing the
sanctions against the Savimbists who were accused of violating the
Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
After his return to New York, Fowler will take advantage of the
 information obtained in Angola to accomplish a special report on
the sanctions against Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Fowler will in March this year submit the report to the U.N.
Security Council , which will propose new measures to further
effectuate the sanctions imposed by the international community.
</P>
<P>
According to Fowler, his visit to Angola is also aimed to
protect the will of the international community from being
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Fowler had a field work in the two
newly-conquered cities by the government troops Andulo and
Bailundo, where he saw diverse weapons and other military
materials captured by the Armed Forces of Angola during the recent
highland offensive.

<P>
They have also called for the resignation of the Inspector
General of Police Musiliu Smith and Police Affairs Minister David
Jemibewon, according to This Day, a leading Nigerian newspaper on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the same day, some House representatives in Abuja, the
country's capital, asked the federal government to ban the
radical ethnic groups including Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC),
Arewa Peoples Congress (APC), which were believed to be behind
the violent scenes in Lagos recently.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the paper quoted its own sources as saying
that President Olusegun Obasanjo had directed, over the weekend,
Lagos Police Command to immediately initiate strategies to pacify
the worrisome situation there.
</P>
<P>
The presidential order was made at a time that Lagos State
Police had just received a boost with some 5,000 man on special
duty being added to its force.
</P>
<P>
The boost came when about 100 suspects were to be charged at
Lagos court this week over last week's bloody shed in Lagos, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
But for the second time within three days, Lagos State
governor, Bola Tinubu, has rebutted on Saturday in Lagos
President Olusegun Obasanjo's indictment of inaction over the
security situation in Lagos State.
</P>
<P>
He was also opposed to the imposing of a state of emergency in
his state.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Warns Oil Firms on Environmental Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Federal government
Sunday warned some of the oil and gas companies operating in the
country's Niger delta region to abide by the environmental
protection rules or face severe punishments.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the oil companies to absolve themselves of blame in
the devastation of the the environment of the area are
unacceptable, the Guardian newspaper Monday quoted Minister of
Environment Alhaji Adamu and Minister of State of Environment Imeh
Okopido as saying in the country's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Although most oil companies gave themselves a clean bill of
health in response to probing by the ministry on the status of
their environmental compliance, it is evident that they have
failed to adhere to the international standards prescribed for
them, the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between the ministries and senior executives
of oil and gas companies in Abuja, Adamu said the Niger Delta
"still suffers on a daily basis from gas flare, discharge of
drilling cuttings, cutting of mangrove and consequent loss of
bio-diversity."
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, land subsidence, oil spills,
introduction of invasive weeds by oil rigs and similar vessels,
cultural corruption and social dislocation are the main disasters
threatening the area.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he warned that the Federal government through the
Ministry of Environment is poised to sanctioning any company which
fails to comply with the laws regulating oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
Okopido echoed the warnings of his colleague, saying that
except Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited and South Atlantic
Petroleum Limited, all others provided unsatisfactory response to
the inquiries made by the ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Local police in Changchun,
capital of Jilin province in northeast China disclosed the cause
of a fire which broke out in a bathhouse killing 20 persons in
late December last year.
</P>
<P>

"I once thought of opening a noodle restaurant two years ago,
but because I did not have enough registration money, I gave up
the idea," said Meng Dan, a young man working at a Beijing-based
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
"Now the new regulation makes it possible, and I'll return home
and open a noodle restaurant with my relatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hailin, an official with the Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprise Department under the State Economic and Trade
Commission, pointed out that the Chinese government has attached
increasing importance to the development of small and medium-sized
enterprises in recent years in a bid to nurture the private sector.
</P>
<P>
China has put forward a number of favorable policies to support
these enterprises and will introduce more, he said.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of individual capital in the domestic market will
facilitate the establishment of a healthy and diversified
investment environment and pave a way for huge overseas funds in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, local law workers have cautioned individual investors
should misunderstand the new regulation because it does not mean
that one has to pay his debts only according to the amount of the
registered capital of his firm when it goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics show that by the end of 1999, there
were 1.48 million registered private firms employing a work force
of 19 million.

<HEADLINE> China Lowers Threshold for Individual Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- It is still a dream for
individual Chinese to establish a private firm with a registered
capital of only one yuan, but a new regulation published today has
undoubtedly lowered the long-standing high threshold for Chinese
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Procedures for the Registration of Individually-Funded
Enterprises announced by the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce does not specify the minimum sum of money individuals
need to establish such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation provides detailed rules for the
implementation of the Law on Solely Individual-Invested
Enterprises that took effect as of January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The new regulation has left out the need to produce a bank
certificate when a person registers an enterprise. All one needs
to do now is to declare the amount of investment," said Hu Xiugan,
director of the self-employed economy supervision department.
</P>
<P>
This means that the government has greatly relaxed the
restrictions on the investment of private enterprises, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the regulation also abolishes the requirements for
the minimum number of employees, and reduces restrictions on
differentiating a self-employed businessmen and an enterprise
owner according to the number of employees.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that lightening restrictions on individual
investors will play an active role in spurring non-governmental
investment, increasing job opportunities and increasing domestic
consumer demand, and greatly promote the development of China's
private sector.

BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China has received more than
one million patent applications since the first patent was
approved in 1985, the state's top intellectual property official

WIPO) in 1980, China signed a series of international covenants
and conventions governing the patent mechanism.
</P>
<P>
China is also considering making some changes in the present
patent law this year after the first law revision in 1992.

important bearing on the overall quality of China's national
economy and its competitive edge on the international market,"

<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally-
adjusted unemployment rate in Hong Kong for October-December 1999
was 6 percent and the underemployment rate 2.8 percent, both
showing a decrease, the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
For the September-November period, both the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate and the underemployment rate were confirmed to
be the same as the previously released provisional figures of 6.1
percent and 3 percent, the department said in its latest labor
force statistics.
</P>
<P>
Comparing October-December 1999 with a year earlier, decreases
in the unemployment rate were seen in the decoration and
maintenance, transport, business services and personal services
sectors.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, decreases were seen mainly in
the construction and transport sectors, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
For September-November 1999, the size of the total labor force
was 3.51 million, of whom 3.28 million were employed and 225,700

<HEADLINE> Saddam Defiant on Gulf War Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Marking the ninth anniversary of
the Gulf War Monday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urged his
people to keep enduring the U.N. sanctions through frugal living
and hard working.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to the nation, Saddam said the nine-year-
old embargo would not force his country to change its policies.
</P>
<P>
"Those who delude themselves into believing that the prolonged
march may break the willpower of the Iraqis have to stop relishing
that delusion," Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
The president cursed that those "evil-doers" will have to beg
for forgiveness from God for "the crimes they have committed
against" the Iraqi people, apparently referring to the U.S. and
British insistence that the sanctions not be lifted until Saddam's
regime carries out all responsibilities under U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led multinational forces launched the six-week Gulf War
on January 17, 1991, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait on
February 28. And the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq shortly after
its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Baghdad called on Iraqis throughout the
country to take to streets for 45 consecutive days to protest
against the continuation of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The latest resolution on Iraq adopted by the U.N. Security
Council on December 17, already rejected by Iraq, envisages that
sanctions could be suspended in the event of Iraq's full
cooperation with a new weapons inspection commission.

<HEADLINE> 2 Algerian Soldiers Killed in Rebel Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attack launched by members from Da'wa wal Jihad (Appeal and
Struggle) took place on Saturday, two days after their leader
Hassan Hattab withdrew from peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Hattab opted out of the talks Thursday, the deadline for
government amnesty, after his members opposed to the peace talks
shot dead one of his aid.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the rebels set off a roadside bomb as a vehicle
carrying soldiers passed near Tigzirt in Tizi-Ouzou province, 90
kilometers east of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
When the bomb exploded, the fighters hiding on both sides of the
road machinegunned the soliders, killing two and injuring several
others, it added.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking power, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said
he would pardon all rebels who committed no rape and murder and if
they lay down their arms. But he vowed to wipe out those defying
his amnesty offer.
</P>
<P>
The relatively moderate Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) and the
Islamic League for Appeal and Struggle disbanded before last
Thursday's amensty deadline.
</P>
<P>
Only Hattab's group and another hardline faction, the Armed
Islamic Group (GIA), with an estimated strength of 5,000, have
failed to take up an amnesty, leaving them to face an all-out army
assault, which is reported to start this week.
</P>
<P>
Insurgency erupted in 1992 following the then government's cancel
of a general election in which opposition stood to win. Bouteflika
has said 100,000 people have been killed since then.

JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were

There were no immediately claims of responsibility for the

police are treating the matter as a nationalist incident
perpetrated by Arab militants attempting to derail the peace

Eighteen people were lightly or moderately injured in a pipe

<HEADLINE> Musharraf Sees Potential for Pak-China Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf has said there is great potential for the
further growth of the mutually beneficial relations between
Pakistan and China, especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua before his departure for a
two-day visit to China on early Monday morning, General Musharraf
said his visit is intended to "reaffirm our close and cordial ties.
"
</P>
<P>
"The long-standing ties between our two countries are
underpinned by mutual trust and confidence. With the passage of
time, our relations with China have gained greater strength and
vitality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general said he is fully satisfied with the "vibrant"Pak-
China relations, which have been "nurtured and enriched by
frequent high-level contacts and consultations."
</P>
<P>
"The peoples of Pakistan and China share their joys and sorrows.
Our hearts beat in unison," he said, adding, "I am sanguine that
our friendship would continue to flourish in the new millennium
with traditional vigor and enthusiasm."
</P>
<P>
On the international front, General Musharraf said Pakistan
will continue to extend "unreserved support" to China for the
establishment of "a just and coercion-free international world
order, where every nation, big or small, can progress in
accordance with its national aspirations."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan and China, being two developing countries,
traditionally cooperate in multilateral fora to attain the
ultimate goal of peace and development in the region and beyond,"
he observed.
</P>
<P>
"The two fraternal nations share the vision for a just, fair
and equitable political and economic order in the new century."
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf expressed his belief that China "is destined
to play a critically significant role in the global affairs" as "
an important pillar in the emerging multipolar world."
</P>
<P>
"We would further intensify our consultations and direct our
mutual efforts for realization of this objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf is on his first visit to China since he
assumed the office of chief executive in October last year. The
visit is also his first to a country outside the Islamic world.

<HEADLINE> Giants Merge Creates World's Largest Drugs Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's drugs giants Glaxo
Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham confirmed Monday their plans to
merge into the World's biggest pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo shareholders will own 58.75 percent and SmithKline
investors 41.25 percent of the new group, worth 114 billion pounds
(about 187.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new group, to be called Glaxo SmithKline, will be headed by
Jean-Pierre Garnier, currently number two at SmithKline, who takes
the role of chief executive, while Glaxo's head Richard Sykes is
to be non-executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
Its headquarters will be in London, while its operational base
will be in the United States. It will be listed on both the London
and New York stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The group said job cut is inevitable but has not confirmed the
numbers. Unions fear that up 15,000 posts may be affected.
</P>
<P>
"Staff have been kept completely in the dark and we need to now
know how a company whose chief executive is going to live in the
United States is going to have the same commitment to a company
that has traditionally been the jewel in the British
pharmaceutical crown," Roger Lyons, a leading trade unionist said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite reports that the Syrians will not return to peace
talks with Israel on Wednesday, the U.S. and Israel said Sunday
they still expect the talks to resume on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese television reported Sunday that the talks have been
indefinitely postponed. But Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
intends to leave for Washington Tuesday as planned, and has not
been told there will be any delay in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak envisages a three-stage withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, to be spread out for four years, while Syria wants a two-
stage withdrawal over 16 months, according to the draft timetable
attached to the draft treaty between Israel and Syria presented by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In the timetable document, it appears the Syrians are ready to
establish diplomatic ties six months before the end of the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Schools will be closed again Monday and prospect for an
extended strike grew increasingly likely after talks between the
Teachers Union and the Finance Ministry broke down over wage
disputes.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the two sides amounts to 1.65 billion U.S.
dollars, according to union and Treasury figures. The union
declined the compromise measure offered by the Treasury that every
teacher be given a one-time salary increment of 900 shekels (about
220 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- David Klein, Barak's controversial choice for Bank of Israel
governor, won a narrow vote of approval in the cabinet Sunday,
after an intensive lobbying campaign by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The vote of 10-7 with five abstentions came after some 10 hours
of cabinet debate and sideline lobbying. Barak convinced some
ministers to change their minds by saying that they should not let
this issue to drag the foot of the critical Israeli-Syrian talks.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, MILF Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiations between the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
resumed Monday in the southern Philippines, Filipino News Channel
ABS-CBN said.
</P>
<P>
Only technical committees of the two peace panels were said to
have met in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao, to draft the framework of
the peace accord, at the second round of talks since the two sides
held formal peace talks last October.
</P>
<P>
ABS-CBN quoted Defense Undersecretary Orlando Soriano, also
head of the government peace panel, as saying he is confident that
the two panels would reconcile issues that have delayed the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MILF Vice-Chair for Political Affairs Ghadzali
Jaafar assured that last week's fighting between the military and
the MILF in Shariff Aguak, Datu Piang and Talayan, all in
Maguindanao, will not affect the on-going talks.
</P>
<P>
However, media reports here deemed the prospects of the peace
talks as "bleak" for the government and the MILF to arrive at a
common ground.
</P>
<P>
Actually, through the years, the MILF has not changed its hard-
line stance on the issue of an independent Mindanao, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the recent hostilities between government troops
and MILF fighters show that the Muslim rebels are reluctant to
compromise with the national government.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of fresh fighting broke out between the government
forces and MILF fighters in the southern Philippines since last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The series of armed encounters left at least 10 MILF fighters
and one government soldier dead. Twenty-one government troops were
also wounded.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada earlier gave the Muslim rebels until
June to return to the fold of the law.
</P>
<P>
After this period, Estrada said, the government will make it
clear and will assert its stand before all rebel groups that "
there is only one armed forces" in the country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese City Plans to Achieve 7-PC GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's
biggest economic hub, has set a target of achieving a 7-percent
growth in its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The target was decided at a meeting of the Municipal People's
Council last weekend, according to a report of Vietnam News Agency
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other major socioeconomic targets of the city for this year,
which were also decided at the meeting, included an 11-percent
growth in industrial output value, a 2.5-percent growth in
agricultural production value, a 6-percent rise in revenues from
the service sector and a 14-percent increase in export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City also strives to attract foreign direct
investment worth 600 million U.S. dollars, generate employment
opportunities for 185,000 local people, help 10,000 poor families
get rid of poverty,and reduce the population growth rate to below
1.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting agreed that the city in 2000 should
exert greater efforts to prevent the declining trend in GDP growth,
raising the competitiveness of locally-made products and the
efficiency of businesses, improving investment effectiveness and
accelerating the on-going process of restructuring the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
The city registered a 6.2-percent GDP growth last year, lower
than the figure recorded in 1998 but higher than the country's
average of nearly 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output value of the city in 1999 grew by 2.9
percent, its service revenues rose 5.1 percent and its export
earnings saw a year-on-year increase of 23.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Labor Market Said to Be Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's labor market
was stable in November last year, according to the Human Resources
Ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was based on the ratio of 12 new job seekers against 12
vacancies in comparison with eight new registrants out of 10
available vacancies, the ministry said in its monthly job demand
and vacancy statistics report released here.
</P>
<P>
In November, the number of new job seekers saw a drop of about
7 percent to 8,777 from 9,479 a month earlier and this was also a
decline of 6.5 percent against that in the same month of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing was still the main sector with the most vacancies
of 4,419, sharing 60.5 percent of the total vacancies.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector had the second largest number of
vacancies with 1,133 or 15.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The administration and management group had the highest
competition with 10 new registrants for every vacancy, followed by
clerical and related services at 6:1 and professional and
technical services at 5:1, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of 1999, 27,990 job seekers found jobs,
including 24 percent who had lost their jobs earlier.

<HEADLINE> China-U.S. WTO Agreement Important, People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The China-U.S. bilateral
agreement on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO), which was signed last November, is significant in terms of
China's economic reform, China-U.S. relations and the world
economy, the People's Daily said today in a signed article.
</P>
<P>
The front-page article titled "Significance of the Bilateral
Agreement Between China and the United States on China's Accession
to the WTO" said that the agreement has won wide-spread support
from China, the U.S. and other countries across the world.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was reached after talks which lasted for
six days on the basis of mutual concession, equality and mutual
benefit, was widely considered a "win-win" deal.
</P>
<P>
China's bid to enter the WTO started in 1986. Following its
bilateral agreement with the U.S., China still needs to strike a
deal with another 21 WTO members including the European Union on
its accession.
</P>
<P>
By reaching a deal with the U.S., the article says, China has
demonstrated to the world that it is determined to continue its
reform and opening drive and has promised to abide by WTO rules
and open its market gradually.
</P>
<P>
"To join the WTO is an issue related to China's overall
development and further expanding to overseas markets," it says,
adding that entry into the WTO will further deepen China's reform
and the restructuring of the Chinese economy.

<P>
China will also face risks and challenges by joining the WTO,
says the article. "It is the price we must pay to gain accession
to the WTO," and "we are fully confident that we have the ability
to face any kind of challenge."
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the China-U.S. agreement, which will
undoubtedly see a healthy and stable growth of China-U.S. trade
and economic cooperation, the remaining 21 members that are yet to
reach a deal with China have all said they will accelerate the
negotiation process with China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, trade between China and the United
States has grown enormously. The U.S. is now the second largest
trading partner of China while China is the fourth largest trading
partner of the U.S. There are 28,000 U.S.-invested projects in
China with the largest number of contractual investment among
other countries.
</P>
<P>
However, China-U.S. trade has not always been smooth especially
in the last ten years. The annual renewal of the normal trade
relations (NTR) status, formally known as the most favored trading
status, has been a destabilizing factor in trade relations between
the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
The annual assessment of the NTR has become a forum where all
kinds of anti-China forces are trying to defame China, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration clearly promised to the Chinese side
during the last round of bilateral negotiations that it will try
its best to resolve the NTR issue. "We hope that the U.S. keeps
its promise to resolve the problem completely as soon as possible.
"
</P>
<P>
The article concludes that it is natural the differences exist
between China and the U.S. in the political system, ideological
points of view, and the concept of value because of the different
situations of the tow countries.
</P>
<P>
The vicissitudes of China-U.S. relations tell us that the
future between the two countries will not always be run smoothly,
it says.
</P>
<P>
"But as long as both sides keep in mind the spirit of equality,
mutual benefit and respect, seek common ground while reserving
differences, and take a broad and long-term view, there will be
room for bilateral cooperation in such major issues as the
fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people, world
peace and development."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Enzhu on Renaming Xinhua Hong Kong Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said today that it is quite
natural for the Central People's Government to have a
representative office in Hong Kong under a new name.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will be the newly-appointed director of the Liaison
Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
in July 1997, Jiang said that the State Council decided to change
the name to promote the "One Country, Two Systems" concept as well
as "the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong" and the Basic Law.
The new name also guarantees the Central People's Government
representative organ in Hong Kong to perform its duties
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the State Council also decided to change the name of
Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch into the Liaison Office of the
Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative
Region for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Branch continued to perform its duties in the
region after Hong Kong's return to China in July 1997, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On December 28, 1999, the 24th Executive Meeting of the State
Council made the decision to change the name of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch into the Liaison Office of the Central
People's Government in HKSAR as of January 18, 2000, and
officially notified HKSAR government, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite natural for the Central People's Government to
have a representative organ in Hong Kong," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the main duties of the new Liaison Office
include maintaining contact with the Office of the Commissioner of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PLA Garrison in the HKSAR
and helping relevant governmental departments on the mainland
manage mainland organizations and enterprises in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Liaison Office will also promote cooperation between Hong
Kong and the mainland in a number of areas including education,
science and technology, culture and sports and further develop
exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong. Other functions
include dealing with matters related to Taiwan and duties assigned
by the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
All these functions, stressed Jiang, were performed by the
former Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
The new office and staff will strictly follow the Basic Law and
local laws, and perform their duties in accordance with these laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as the HKSAR is directly under the jurisdiction
of the Central People's government, there is no subordinate
relations between the HKSAR government and the office. His office
will perform its duties strictly in accordance with the Central
People's Government and abide by the policies of "One Country, Two
Systems", "the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's office will support the HKSAR government's
administration in accordance with the Basic Law and help maintain
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Brach was established in May, 1947,
with Qiao Guanhua as its first director.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's China in 1949, the Agency
was authorized to keep contact with the British Hong Kong
government because it was not possible for the Central People's
Government to establish a representative organization in Hong Kong
under the British Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
From September 31, 1978, the Agency held an annual National Day
reception inviting the Governor of Hong Kong to attend until China
resumed sovereignty of the region in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
There have only been minor administrative changes at the Agency
since July 1997. The Agency has continued to serve as one of the
authorized agencies representing the Central People's Government
as stated in the HKSAR government gazette on July 2, 1997.

ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said the Kurdish separatist
chieftain Abdullah Ocalan will not be permitted to use Imrali, the
island where he was jailed, as a political platform.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement by Ocalan through his lawyers on the
government's decision of his execution stay, Ecevit said "terrorism
in Turkey has not yet come to an end. There are some people who
want to bring it back to life. We have to be wary of a possible
return of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The chief prosecutor of Turkish Supreme Court of Appeal Vural
Savas will give a statement Tuesday, calling for banning the
opposition Virtue Party.
</P>
<P>
Savas said that the party is against the Constitution because
many of its members were transferred from deputies of the
previously banned pro-Islamic Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Transport Minister Enis Oksuz said the Ankara-
Istanbul railway upgrading project has been opened to international
bidding through the Internet, saying it will be completed in 2.5
years at the latest and will operate trains with a speed of 200
kilometers per hour.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit Turkey to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi is due in Ankara Monday for a two-day visit in an apparent
bid to improve the cool relations between the two large Islamic
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi will discuss with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem a
variety of topics covering bilateral and regional issues, but
security is expected to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Tehran, Iran is very much worried
about the military ties between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The growing threats of the Zionist regime (Israel) in the
region and its cooperation with the Turkish government is one of
Iran's concerns," the Iranian News Agency (IRNA) quoted Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamidreza Asefi as saying. "Kharrazi will hold
talks on this issue with Turkish officials."
</P>
<P>
Iran, which does not recognize Israel, has strongly criticized
cooperation between Israel and Iran's western neighbor Turkey,
especially concerning their growing military links. Israel also
regards Iran as its potential chief enemy.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Kharrazi's visit coincides with the arrival of
Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Uzi Dayan, a showcase of close
military ties between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The relations between officially secular Turkey and Islamic Iran
are often tense, with Turkey accusing Iran of aiding its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been waging a war since
1984 for an independent state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two neighbors intensified last July when
Iran charged Turkey warplanes and soliders with violating its
border and bombing near its border village.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said last Monday that some
terrorists of the PKK were still being sheltered in Iran despite
Turkey's warning to Tehran. Ecevit also said that during Kharrazi's
visit Turkey would put the security issue on the table.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA reported that an Iranian Foreign Ministry source
denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
During Kharrazi's stay in Turkey, other political issues as well
as the prospects of economic and cultural cooperation between
Ankara and Tehran will also be taken up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the Iranian foreign minister's trip
is a positive step toward an all-round detente of ties between the
two big Islamic powers in the region.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Defense Chief on Regional Security Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Defense Tony Tan said here Monday that
globalization presents new and complex challenges to regional
security and there is need to strengthen multinational efforts to
ensure regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening of the two-day Millennium Conference
of Singapore's Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies on "
Security Challenges and Response in the 21st Century," Tan said
there are grounds for optimism that regional peace and stability
will be preserved but the world continues to be plagued by
conflicts and tensions, including in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that while the effects of globalization in the
economic and financial spheres are more evident, the security
implications of globalization are less well understood.
</P>
<P>
Tan drew attention to two "clearer" trends resulting from the
twin forces of trade globalization and rapid technology advance.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, "the interconnectedness of markets means that
any instability in one part of the world will have faster and more
far-reaching knock-on effects on other countries in the global
system."
</P>
<P>
Second, he continued, "we will face challenges that will be
multi-faceted and more complex and cannot be handled by any single
nation alone."
</P>
<P>
On responses to security challenges in the region in the 21st
century, Tan highlighted the need to strengthen the nexus between
economics and security, to enhance international, multilateral and
bilateral cooperation between regional countries, to make
multilateral efforts to tackle problems concerning security and to
give a bigger play to existing multilateral processes such as the
ASEAN Regional Forum.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 17 (Xinhua) -- An air services agreement
was signed between China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) and the Kingdom of Cambodia here Monday to develop closer
ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Signing the accord were Stephen Ip, secretary for economic
services of the Hong Kong SAR and Pok Sam Ell, secretary of state
in charge of the State Secretariat of Civil Aviation of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Yan Tingai was also present at
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Ip said, "Air services would play a vital role in strengthening
the ties between the two places. The signing of the agreement
today would provide a legal framework for their further
development."
</P>
<P>
The air linkage between Hong Kong and Cambodia was established
in 1993. Dragon Air of the Hong Kong SAR now has three direct
flights a week to Phnom Penh carrying many tourists and business
people to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong and Cambodia can offer each other a lot of business
opportunities," Ip said, adding, "Hong Kong is an international
trade, financial, tourist and aviation center. Cambodia, on the
other hand, is a beautiful country endowed with rich natural
resources and great development potential."
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to seeing further expansion of services by the
airlines of both sides," Ip said.

<HEADLINE> 25 People Massacred by Rebels in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) massacred at least 25 people and injured 17 others
in their latest attack on a camp for the displaced in western
Uganda over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Three ADF rebels were reportedly killed Saturday afternoon in
their attack on the Kirindi camp in Bundibugyo district, the New
Vision daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the camp, which houses up to 1,000
displaced people, was set ablaze at 2:00 p.m. local time by an
unknown number of ADF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that the rebels also attacked the
motorcade of Uganda People's Defense Forces Chief of Staff John
Kazini on his way to Bundibugyo to assess the security situation
there.
</P>
<P>
This is the second massacre of civilians by the ADF rebels in
less than two weeks. About 100 rebels attacked the Bundwarume camp
last week, killing 10 and injuring 10 others.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels, who recently entered Uganda from their bases in the
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, launched a
spate of attacks on civilian and security targets. On December 20,
1999, they made a surprise attack on Katojo prison in Fort Portal
town and abducted over 300 inmates. About 90 inmates were killed
and an equal number rescued.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start AIDS Vaccine Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- AIDS researchers in Kenya have
finalized preparations for the trial of a vaccine from September
this year.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, developed jointly with British researchers, is
currently being tested for safety in 40 volunteers in Oxford
University in the United Kingdom, the January 17 to 23 issue of
the East African weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The same number of subjects will initially be involved in the
Kenyan trials, according to Dr. Joshua Kimani, a Kenya researcher
on the development of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
All volunteers will be required to be HIV-negative, over 18
years old, of sound mind and of good general health. Pregnant
women will be excluded from the trial because it is unknown
whether the vaccine has potential harm to a foetus.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate follow-up during the course of the trials, all
the 40 volunteers will be expected to come from around the Kenyan
capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the second country in sub-Sahara region to be involved
in AIDS vaccine studies after Uganda, where another vaccine is
being tested jointly with American experts.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Faces Refugee Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is exposed to
serious security problems in the western Kigoma and Kagera regions
because of the influx of Burundi refugees, a government official
has said.
</P>
<P>
Some refugees have been engaged in criminal acts and some even
have gone to the extent of coordinating underground political and
military activities against their own countries while in Tanzania,
said Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Ali Muhammed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing visiting United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) chief Sadaka Ogata here on Sunday evening, the minister
said it is discouraging to note that when Tanzania is trying hard
to deal with the security problems caused by rogue refugees, the
Burundi regime has continued to accuse Tanzania of training that
country's rebels.
</P>
<P>
He told the UNHCR chief that another problem which has engulfed
the refugee camps is the shortage of vital working tools such as
vehicles and radio calls for the police personnel to carry out
their duties.
</P>
<P>
There is also the need for refugees to be issued with identity
cards so that they can be easily identified, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata's visit comes as thousands of Burundians flock into
Tanzania each day, filling up the refugee camps in west Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian authorities hope that the visit by the U.N. refugee
chief will attract more international attention on the plight of
thousands of refugees hosted by the country.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Tanzania and Burundi agreed to speed up their
consultations on border issues after two days of top-level talks
between the presidents and security advisors of the two
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Restricts Use of Vehicles, Phones by Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
introduced stringent cost-control measures on the use of vehicles
and phones by government officials in a bid to cut down
expenditure, which stands at 150 billion Kwacha (about 60 million
U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
All officers below the rank of director have been ordered to
surrender their government vehicles, the Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cell phones have been withdrawn from all officers
below the rank of permanent secretary while the direct dialing
facility will now be restricted to directors and above.
</P>
<P>
Refueling of duty vehicles has been restricted to one full tank
per week and officers entrusted with the government vehicles
should ensure that they are not driven by unauthorized persons
like spouses, children, friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, all duty vehicles should be parked by
19:00 local time at designated places to be determined by the
controlling officer.
</P>
<P>
Eligible cell phone using officers are not allowed to accrue a
monthly cell phone bill exceeding 500,000 Kwacha (about 200 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Provision of official telephone facilities at residences by
government is restricted to officers to the rank of director,
equivalent and above.
</P>
<P>
The government will pay permanent secretaries 250,000 Kwacha
(about 100 U.S. dollars) cash towards monthly settlement of bills
for telephone facilities at residences and 150,000 Kwacha (about
60 U.S. dollars) for directors and equivalent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Capriati Come through at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer
Capriati, women stars at the Australian Open tennis championship,
Monday came through on the opening day while Australia's boom
teenager Jelena Dokic went missing after suffering a shock first
round defeat.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon champion and women's No. 2 seed Davenport warmed up
with a 6-3, 6-1 demolition of Frenchwoman Sarah Pitkowski.
</P>
<P>
All players said the conditions - the courts and balls - are
appreciably quicker than they were last year which will be a bonus
for the American's big game.
</P>
<P>
"It's much, much faster than last week in Sydney. It's going to
take a little while to get used to," Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
"But fast courts are to my advantage and if I can get used to
them pretty quick, I think it will help my game a lot here," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former teen star Capriati continued the impressive
resurrection of her career Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Florida-based New Yorker cruised into the
second round with a 6-1, 7-6 victory over Austrian Barbara
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
As a 14-year-old, Capriati became the youngest grand slam semi-
finalist in tennis history at the 1990 French Open before personal
problems forced her off the tour for two years at 18.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, aided by coach Harold Solomon, she made a dramatic
move up the rankings from 112 to her current 21 and won in
Strasbourg - her first title since Sydney in 1993.
</P>
<P>
She also reached the fourth round of both the French and the U.
S. Opens.
</P>
<P>
Capriati began 2000 by beating Mary Pierce and World No. 1
Martina Hingis in the Millennium Cup exhibition in Hong Kong,
China, which she said on Monday gave her confidence another boost.
</P>
<P>
"I'd at least like to win a few matches here and just start off
the year really well to give myself some momentum for the coming
tournaments," Capriati said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong definitely lifted my confidence a lot, and my game.
I couldn't do much better than that, beating Martina," she added.
</P>
<P>
Seemingly deserted by the boundless confidence which carried
her so far last year, 16-year-old Australian Dokic fell to
unheralded Hungarian player Rita Kuti Kis, 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Wimbledon quarter-finalist blasted down eight aces to
nil, but threw in nine double faults and 56 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
"She played badly but I think I had almost as many errors as
Jelena," said Kuti Kis who is ranked No.86.

<HEADLINE> Mount Wuyi Attracts More Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Mount Wuyi in east China's
Fujian Province has become a hot tourist spot since it was
included on UNESCO's World Heritage List December 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Day alone, well over 15,000 people visited the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
The mountain is described as "an outstanding conservation area"
and "a refuge for a large number of animals and plants". It is now
home to 3,728 varieties of plants and 5,110 kinds of animals, many
of which are on the protection list.
</P>
<P>
Mount Wuyi can be dated back almost 4,000 years. The imperial
city ruins of the kingdoms of Min and Yue during Western Han (206
B.C-24A.D.) at Chengcun are one of the best preserved ancient
relics in south China. The ruins were listed under state
protection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the State Council turned Mount Wuyi into a national
scenic area. The area was included in the World Biosphere Network
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the ever increasing number of tourists to Mount
Wuyi, local government departments have implemented a number of
policies to standardize tourism services and held a number of
tourism promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
Mount Wuyi had 1.92 million tourists in 1999, some 11 percent
more than 1998. Overseas tourists made up 120,000 of the total,
up 17.4 percent. According to local sources, the tourism industry
at Wuyi generated 740 million yuan in income last year, up 12.1
percent from 1998.

<HEADLINE> Storm Hits U.S. Pacific Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and
the supply of power was interrupted to hundreds of thousands of
households Sunday after a fierce windstorm swept through the U.S.
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old youth and a 50-year-old architect were killed
inside the State of Washington, local officials reported.
</P>
<P>
Interstate Highway 90, running between Seattle and Spokane, was
shut down periodically Sunday as crews set smaller avalanches to
remove the danger of large ones sweeping down onto the roadway,
said Clarissa Lundeen, spokeswoman for Washington State's
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
"The snow that has already fallen is being weighted down by
rain and wet snow," creating high danger of avalanches, she said.
</P>
<P>
Blown-down trees and limbs caused most of the power outages,
utility officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the Seattle area, at least 24,000 people were without power
after high winds swept through. There were about 300,000 people
without power in western Washington and about 100,000 in the dark
in western Oregon.
</P>
<P>
The winds also forced the precautionary closure of the floating
bridge linking Seattle and its eastern suburbs. An estimated 100,
000 cars use the 520 Bridge each day. The outage left the
Interstate 90 floating bridge, three miles to the south, as the
only cross-lake span.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said moist air streamed across the nation
on the jet stream Sunday, contributing to rain in parts of the U.S.
West and snow showers in the northern Plains states and the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Occasional light showers also stretched from southern
California across southern Nevada into Utah, and across eastern
sections of Oregon and Washington into Idaho, they added.
</P>
<P>
Farther east, the moist air combined with cold air sinking out
of Canada to produce light snow flurries that were scattered
across the Dakotas and Nebraska into southern Minnesota and Iowa,
according to local Television reports.
</P>
<P>
Across the Northeast, light snow fell across wide areas of
northern Pennsylvania and New York State. The snow also extended
into parts of Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and over
most of Maine.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen predicted that accumulations of 5 to 8 inches of
snow were possible by Monday morning in some northern sections of
New England.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Firms Urged to Meet New Millennium  Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz Monday appealed to the
Malaysian corporate sector to make necessary changes and
adjustments to meet the challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call when opening the one-day national
conference on The Vital Corporate Issues in the New Millennium
here sponsored by the Malaysian Investors' Association.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's leading industry experts are to discuss at the
conference various vital current corporate issues such as
transparency and corporate governance of public listed companies
in the 21st century, the association's president P.H.S. Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Opportunities and Challenges in the New Millennium,
Rafidah said the closing years of the 1990's have witnessed
significant, if not radical, changes and developments in the
global economic environment, which have affected and will continue
to have impact on business enterprises everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The advent of information technology (IT) has changed the way
businesses are managed and operated, with IT providing the
ultimate in global exposure to any business, she said. More
importantly, she said, the process of globalization and the
pressures for economies to liberalize their markets, across the
board, have become prime moves for the on-going changes and
adjustments amongst business entities.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah was of the view that such changes and adjustments are
necessary to optimize the benefits of market opening and
globalization as well as to successfully overcome the challenges
brought about by the processes of globalization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the year 2000 will
see mandated negotiations for further liberalization in the
services sector, she said, adding corporate entities in the sector
will continue to consolidate and adjust to maintain and enhance
competitiveness and market shares.
</P>
<P>
For the Malaysian corporate sector, the minister said, there is
the need to closely monitor these global developments, and try to
preempt such developments by making the necessary changes and
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
She said as Malaysia's own market-opening measures will
introduce greater and new competition for domestic companies
within the domestic market itself, they must meet global standards
in every respect in order to remain in the market, and also be
prepared to operate regionally and globally, seeking strategic
networking and alliances to complement and strengthen the
Malaysian operations.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for the country's corporate
entities to undertake operational changes to cater for changes in
technology and to undertake research and development efforts as
integral components of the firms' activities and operations.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that there must be greater collaboration
among the various firms in order to ensure that they can
collectively overcome challenges from external competitors
successfully.
</P>
<P>
She said that in order to succeed in making inroads into the
global markets, the Malaysian corporate entities must be of world
class standards and be able to compete with the best globally.
</P>
<P>
She said the dictates of the global economic and market
environment in the decades of the new millennium will require the
public and the private sectors in Malaysia to develop new and
closer working relationships that can serve the interests of
Malaysian companies in the global market.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Warned to Be on Alert Against  Y2K Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- January 1 was a best case
scenario for the Year 2000 Readiness Commission of New Zealand,
but there are still Y2K hurdles to clear, according to Chairman of
the Commission Basil Logan.
</P>
<P>
"The public and companies should not relax yet," Logan stressed
Monday in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has passed the first hurdle of January 1, and
appears to be clearing the second issue of businesses returning to
work, but problem dates still remain, he said.
</P>
<P>
The next key date is February 29, when computers may fail to
register that 2000 is a leap year, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Logan described February 29 as the third Y2K hurdle New Zealand
will face.
</P>
<P>
"I think people are becoming a little reluctant to be seen as
crying wolf," he said.
</P>
<P>
But people should not throw away their Y2K kits just yet, he
said: "Stay ready anyway, in fact stay ready forever."

<HEADLINE> Ex-rebels in Philippines Seize Mindanao Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- About 70 members of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) seized a major port in Central
Mindanao at dawn Monday and warned of a possible outbreak of
hostilities if their demands were not met, according to a
Philippine News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to negotiations but if government forces provoke
us to fight, we will fight to the end," Billy Abdulsalam, one of
several MNLF commanders holding the Polloc port, was quoted by the
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abdulsalam summed up their demand in two words - equality and
justice.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that our leader has forgotten to us to give us better
lives after we signed a peace pact with the government, " he said
in obvious referral to MNLF chairman and Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) governor Nur Misuari.
</P>
<P>
Misuari was elected to the highest post in the ARMM shortly
after his MNLF organization inked a final peace agreement with the
government on September 2, 1996.  From then on, MNLF members
worked side by side with the Philippine government for the
development of Mindanao through the Southern Philippines Council
for Peace and Development which Misuari also chairs.
</P>
<P>
Many MNLF members, however, expressed disgust over the"snail-
paced" releasing of funds and livelihood projects' implementation
by the ARMM administration for them to start their new lives.
</P>
<P>
Abdulsalam said they will continue holding on to the major port
until they talk with Misuari or Maguindanao Governor Zacaria
Candao over their problems.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Candao, has ordered local police forces to exercise
restraint in dealing with the MNLF men holed up inside the port as
he tries to sort out matters peacefully with their leaders.
</P>
<P>
The men holding Polloc port have called themselves the Unified
Force of the MNLF Mainland.

The firefight lasted for 45 minutes with no casualty reported
on the government side, the report said. It was not immediately
known how many casualty MILF was.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was the first since last Tuesday when government
forces and MILF guerrillas fought sporadic pitch battles for about
a week in the towns of Shariff Aguak, Datu Piang in Maguindanao
province.
</P>
<P>
The series of armed encounters left 10 MILF dead and one
soldier killed. Twenty-one government forces were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
The two round of fresh lashes erupted just ahead of the
resumption of the government-MILF peace talks set to start at 8:00
Monday morning. But the resumed negotiation is yet to be confirmed
due to less immediate report.
</P>
<P>
The fightings are believed here to be ways of the Muslim
separatists to show their reluctance to compromise with the
national government.
</P>
<P>
But other reports quoted Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chair for
political affairs, as saying that the clashes between the MILF
fighters and government troops would not have a negative effect on
the peace negotiation.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf left here early Monday morning for
Beijing on a two-day official visit to China.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Russia to Exchange Artworks Obtained During War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany has agreed to give back
a mural mosaic to Russia in exchange of 101 pieces of German
paintings lost during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Henning Scherf, Minister-President of Germany's northwestern
state of Bremen, said Sunday that his government has reached
agreement with the Russian Culture Ministry on the exchange of
some of the art treasures lost during the war.
</P>
<P>
The exchange is expected to create a way for further solving
the problem of returning lost art works between the two sides, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Russia have had protracted dispute on the reversion
of artworks lost during the war. The German government has
accused the Red Army of transporting about 200,000 pieces of
precious artworks, 2 million volumes of German ancient books and
large amount of archives to the Soviet Union at the end of World
War II, and called for their early return. But the problem had
remained unsolved due to sharp differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, the Russian State Duma passed a bill to the
effect that all "art trophies" the Red Army captured from Germany
belong to the Russian state, sparking strong protests from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The mural mosaic to be returned to Russia is part of the Amber
Room treasures, which Prussian Emperor Friedrich Wilhem I gave
Russian Czar Zaren Peter I in 1716 as presents.
</P>
<P>
In 1941, German troops took back these treasures from the
Soviet Union. But the treasures were reported missing towards the
end of the war, until 1997 when the mosaic was discovered.

<HEADLINE> hke011709-- Order Generally Maintained in Indonesia's Maluku , Says Military Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Maluku Military
Commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela said order had generally been
maintained in the riot-torn Maluku.
</P>
<P>
He said the people of Ambon, capital of Maluku, had stopped
communal clashes and already resumed activities.
</P>
<P>
"People have started to fill the empty streets and there are
temporary markets selling food," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that a bomb blasted the Waihaong housing complex
in Ambon, which he said was aimed at provoking fresh violence.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he was verifying reports of violence on the
remote island of Buano, west of Seram Island.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least three civilians were killed and
four security personnel injured in a fresh violence broke out in
Central Maluku on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The violence occurred when neighboring residents of Wakal and
Hitu villages locked their horns in an armed clash.
</P>
<P>
Tamaela said that the fighting in Central Maluku had nothing to
do with religious issues, saying the warring villagers were of the
same religion.
</P>
<P>
"The causes of the dispute are being investigated," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tamaela said 771 people had been killed in the North Maluku
since the violence erupted on December 26, "not 2,000 as some
media in Jakarta reported."
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid on Saturday said he would assign
Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri to go Maluku and take action
against perpetrators of the violence.
</P>
<P>
The government would now take a central role in resolving the
sectarian conflict in Maluku, which first erupted in mid-January
last year, the president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-two suspected Sri Lankan
Tamil rebels were arrested Sunday night in a joint police and army
lightening search operation conducted at suburban Colombo, police
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The operation at Wattala in the northern suburb of Colombo was
conducted under a five-hour curfew imposed at midnight, which took
residents by surprise, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Of those arrested 10 have been positively identified as active
cadres of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which has
been fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 policemen and 200 army personnel took part in the
operation conducted to flush out the rebels who had infiltrated
into Colombo to target VIPs and prime installations.
</P>
<P>
A similar operation conducted earlier this month in Colombo and
its southern suburbs of Mount Lavinia and Dehiwela had not proved
successful as prior knowledge of the operation had leaked out.
</P>
<P>
The suspected LTTE cadres in those areas had reportedly fled in
boats and taken refuge in the Wattala area.
</P>
<P>
Those who were arrested are being interrogated. The identified
LTTE cadres and all information gathered would be handed over to
the Terrorist Investigation Division and to the National
Intelligence Bureau on Monday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On December 18, an LTTE woman suicide bomber attempted to
assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga at an election rally
in central Colombo where Kumaratunga lost eyesight in her right
eye due to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month a suicide bomber blew herself up opposite
the Prime Minister's Office when she was being searched by
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officials believed that there are at least 10 more
LTTE suicide cadres lurking in or around Colombo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Mission to Visit Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from 30 American
companies is scheduled to make a three-day visit to Indonesia
beginning on Tuesday, according to the Jakarta Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
The business mission will be led by Michael Gadbaw, chairman of
the U.S.-Indonesia Business Committee, and Ernest Z. Bower,
president of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council.
</P>
<P>
"Our upcoming mission will underscore the solid commitment of
the U.S. private sector to Indonesia and our confidence in
Indonesia's potential for economic growth," Gadbaw was quoted by
the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gadbaw, who is also a vice president of the General Electric,
said his committee had consistently engaged Indonesia through
regular missions and ongoing dialogs with Indonesian business
people and government officials.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with President (Abdurrahman) Wahid
and Vice President Megawati (Soekarnoputri) and their Cabinet," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Bower said the size of the delegation was itself a testament to
the tremendous business opportunities in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to discuss both these opportunities and the needs of
the American business community currently operating in and trading
with Indonesia," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the mission will meet with Indonesia's new
political leadership, ministers, legislators and local business
people
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers will
visit Indonesia on January 20 as part of a three-country trip to
Asia that will also bring him to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Summers will pay a courtesy call on President
Wahid and some senior members of the cabinet, according to a
release from the U.S. embassy here.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Indonesia bolsters U.S. support for this largest
archipelagic country's economic recovery and reform measures
designed to promote investment, employment and competitiveness in
a more open and growing global economy, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The visit also provides reinforcement of existing close
economic ties between the two countries, the release added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Debt Hits 49b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debt
rose by almost one billion U.S. dollars to about 49 billion
dollars in the third quarter last year from 48.12 billion dollars
in the previous quarter, a press report said Monday
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post, one of the nation's leading newspapers,
quoted Philippine Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura as
saying in an interview over the weekend that the figure is
preliminary and is still being completed.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said the increase was largely brought about by the
increased foreign borrowings of the national government in 1999,
the proceeds of which were mostly used to support an expansionary
fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
"The trend (in the overall foreign debt stock) is still the
same (on the rise) because of the borrowings made by the
government abroad," Buenaventura said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts approved by or registered with the Philippine
Central Bank do not include other private-sector accounts which
are "loans without the Central Bank approval or registration,"
unregistered obligations under various financial lease agreements"
and "intercompany accounts of foreign bank branches."
</P>
<P>
The government raised close to 2 billion dollars from the
international capital market last year to finance its massive
deficit spending designed to spur economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it incurred a larger than expected budget deficit
of almost 114 billion pesos (2.85 billion dollars) at the end of
1999 compared to the revised ceiling of 101 pesos (2.5 billion
pesos) agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Milan Spends "Sunday on Foot" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Milan, Italy's biggest city, spent
its first "Sunday on foot" on Sunday since the oil crunch in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a decree issued by the Lombard regional government
because of the high concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere,
all private motor vehicles were banned from moving in the city on
the day.
</P>
<P>
The order, which affects several Lombard cities, was carried
out in the last two days on all cars except those fitted with
catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, even the so-called "green" cars were left in
garage. The only vehicles moving in Milan streets were buses,
trams, taxis and electrically-powered cars.
</P>
<P>
Regional President Roberto Formigoni, who got around the city
by bike and underground on the day, said there was no alternative
to the order because of serious smog.
</P>
<P>
"The concentration of dust was too high and dangerous for
people's health," he said.

<HEADLINE> Finland's Presidential Vote Ends in Close Tie, Second Round Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Finland's presidential
election will go to a second round on February 6 as the results
of the first polling, issued late Sunday, showed a close tie
between the two main candidates.
</P>
<P>
Tarja Halonen, foreign minister and a Social Democrat, led in
the poll with 40 percent of the ballots, while Esko Aho, a former
prime minister and leader of the opposition Center Party, followed
with 34.4 percent, leaving the five other candidates far behind.
</P>
<P>
The two leading candidates, who have no major difference in
domestic and foreign policies, are expected to face a hot contest
in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
The winner will succeed Martti Ahtisaari on March 1 as the
country's 18th president.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 77 percent of the country's over 4 million voters turned
out for the voting on Sunday, some 9 percent more than in the
parliamentary election last March.
</P>
<P>
Finland's presidential election is held once every six years
and the current voting is the country's second direct one in
history.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Ruling DS Party Appeals for Coalition Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Democrats of the Left (DS)
party Sunday called for coalition unity, urging fellow party
members to push their party towards a center-left alliance.
</P>
<P>
Walter Veltroni, DS general-secretary, made the appeal in his
closing speech at the party's first formal four-day congress in
the northern city of Turin.
</P>
<P>
He said that the party, the largest in the center-left
government, which was reshaped last month, had rediscovered itself
as a great political force.
</P>
<P>
In response to opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi's accusation
that the congress has turned the Convention Center into a "Temple
of Hate," Veltroni said, "This has been anything but a Temple of
Hate; it has been a temple of political passion for those who see
politics not as a business but as a service to the nation."
</P>
<P>
Blasting the center-right, Veltroni said, "The time has come to
set the record straight. The aggressors cannot turn themselves
into the victims. For a year now we have been under constant
attack by the Right."
</P>
<P>
He challenged to "re-open confrontation with the Right, (and)
to bring out our differences, because this pumps oxygen into
democracy."
</P>
<P>
Veltroni received a standing ovation at the end of his address
and won immediate support from Premier Massimo D'Alema.

Armas blasted a left-foot shot into the net after receiving a
Cobi Jones pass in the 48th minute.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The top ten people and best 100
websites in China's internet industry have been chosen by an on-
line voting contest and industry experts, China Daily reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The Sina company, an internet content provider (ICP) in China,
won the first prize in the category of integrated online services,
which is regarded as the most important prize in the contest. Sina
is followed by CWW, Sohu and Netease on the list.
</P>
<P>
The website of People's Daily, the country's leading newspaper,
came top in the media website category.
</P>
<P>
Top ten stars included bosses of big ICPs such as Ding Lei from
Netease, Wang Zhidong from Sina, Zhang Chaoyang from Sohu, and
internet celebrities such as Tian Suning, Liu Yunjie, Wu Jianping,
Qian Hualin and Zhang Shuxin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Kun, a prominent comic dialogue actor in China, was voted

</P>
<P>
Qian Tianbai, regarded as the father of internet in China, is

<HEADLINE> China Cracking Down on Fake Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China is making further efforts
to stub out cigarettes smuggling and the production and sale of
fake cigarettes this year, Monday's China Daily says.
</P>
<P>
The State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau (STMB), the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce, and several other
departments have jointly launched a campaign to secure the lost
tax income and protect the consumers' interest, according to the
STMB.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that about 875 million cartons of
cigarettes, or one-tenth of the total sold in the Chinese market
each year, are either smuggled or produced by illegal
manufacturers. This incurs about ten billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) losses of tax to the state each year.
</P>
<P>
The production and sale of fake cigarettes are on the rise in
recent years. Illegal producers, concentrated in south China in
the past, have been found in other provinces and even in Beijing.
Some have established complete networks to handle the whole
process from material supply to sales of the products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government tightened control over the cigarette
market. The administrations and bureaus in charge confiscated 60
million cartons of illegal cigarettes valued at 700 million yuan(
84 million U.S.dollars), and closed 300 illegal markets.

<P>
GUIYANG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) is planning to send outstanding scientists and technicians
from across the country to the resource-abundant western region to
carry out scientific research.
</P>
<P>
CAS vice-president Chen Yiyu revealed the plan during a recent
visit to the Natural Resources Laboratory under construction in
the southwestern province.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory, a joint cooperation project between CAS and
Guizhou Province, is the embodiment of CAS's strengthened support
to the government's strategy of developing the western areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will study ways of protecting the ecological
conditions in the western areas and conduct surveys of local
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
CAS also plans to work with local universities to jointly train
graduate students majoring in science, who will be sent to the
laboratory in the next few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
When conditions mature, CAS will establish a graduate school in
the province to help develop local herbal medicine industry and
environmental protection industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has started a national campaign to
develop the country's central and western areas which cover some
56 percent of China's territory and account for 50 percent of
verified deposits of minerals.
</P>
<P>
Policies and measures, including tax incentives, increase of
fixed-asset investment, and preferential terms for overseas
investors, have been adopted to accelerate the development pace of
the region.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani police Sunday
apprehended a staffer of the Indian High Commission to Pakistan
and recovered a remote control of a high-intensity bomb from him,
state-run Pakistan Television (PTV) reported.
</P>
<P>
The accused P. Mosses was alleged to be planning to carry out
the "subversive" act at a busy business center in Rawalpindi, twin
city of Islamabad, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
P. Mosses, who introduced himself as a staff man at the visa
section of the Indian High Commission, was carrying the explosive
device when nabbed at a police blockade here, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
A police official said that a taxicab was stopped at a police
picket and during search a bomb's remote control was recovered
from a packet with the accused.
</P>
<P>
According to PTV, the Indian has confessed the crime. "The
accused has submitted a written statement, and the device was
being delivered to another accomplice at the Rose and Jasmine
garden in Islamabad," the official was quoted as saying.

<P>
The police authorities have further tightened the security in
the capital and have cautioned against subversive attempts by the
Indian intelligence agency RAW, said PTV.

<HEADLINE> Australian Soldiers Warned after E.Timorese Sexually Harassed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Force in
East Timor (Interfet) has issued a special warning to all troops
under its command in East Timor after a group of soldiers
allegedly sexually harassed local women, the Australian newspaper
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that up to six young female members of one
family were "terrorized" over two nights by men believed to be
Australian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The men involved in the incident were described as drunk,
shirtless and as having forced their way into the family's badly
damaged home on November 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident on December 16 led to two soldiers being
detained by military police, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
All unit commanders were told to pass on a warning to troops
under their command, Interfet spokesman Mark Tanzer was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Flies into Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson of the United States arrived at Heathrow
Airport Sunday evening for his controversial fight against Briton
Julius Francis in late January.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of fans and journalists gathered in anticipation of
the boxer's arrival at Terminal 4, after a week of doubt over
whether he would be allowed into the country.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw last week waived immigration rules
which would have normally barred Tyson from entry into Britain,
after he served three years of a six-year sentence for the rape of
a teenage beauty queen contestant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
British rules state that anyone convicted of a crime which
carries a sentence of 12 months or more in Britain should not be
allowed into the country unless they could demonstrate "strong
compassionate reasons" for the trip.
</P>
<P>
But Straw granted Tyson leave to be in Britain until January 30
-- the day after his bout against Francis in Manchester.

LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Duncan Ferguson scored two goals
as Newcastle United thrusted five goals into struggling
Southampton in the English premier league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both teams have been battling in the bottom half of the table.
But Newcastle completely outclassed their visitors in the 5-0
victory, scoring four of their goals before the break.
</P>
<P>
Striker Duncan Ferguson headed in the opening goal in the third
minute before adding a second one minute later with a shot from
the edge of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Nolberto Solano played a clever wall pass with striker
Alan Shearer for their third in the 17th minute before an own goal
from Southampton defender Richard Dryden put the home side four
ahead in the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle could have had one more before the interval with
Shearer hitting a penalty against the bar. Greek defender Nikos
Dabizas completed the rout with a deflected shot in the 83rd
minute.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The trade between northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province and Russia has picked up notably,
official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
 The border trade between the province and Russia hit 1.4
billion U.S. dollars in 1999, up 11 percent over the previous year,
according to statistics released by the government of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
 Land ports in the province handled more than 3.28 million
tons of cargo last year, setting a record high, or a rise of 37
percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Deputy Governor Wang Xianmin said at a recent
meeting here that the trade with Russia is an important part in
the province's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the province should seize opportunities to
expand and deepen co-operation with Russia in the fields of oil,
coal, forestry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Heilongjiang's foreign trade volume reached some 2.
1 billion U.S. dollars, rising five percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The province has set a goal that foreign trade volume should
rise 6.5 percent to reach 2.24 billion U.S. dollars this year, and
a great proportion of the total should come from trade with
Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has always stood for
peaceful and political solution to the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) through dialogue and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, who is on an official
visit to Mozambique, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua
in Maputo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He described the one-day special summit of the Southern African
 Development Community (SADC) on DRC conflict held in Maputo on
Sunday as " another effort made by the countries concerned in
seeking the political settlement of the issue", adding that China
appreciated such effort.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China supports the constructive efforts by the
Organization of African Unity, SADC and the countries concerned
for the the political settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of DRC should be fully respected and guaranteed, and the
settlement of DRC conflict should be based on the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement signed in July last year, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The prime task is not to revise the agreement, but to ensure
the full and earnest implementation of the agreement by all
parties concerned, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council, has always held that the U.N. should attach great
importance to the DRC conflict with practical actions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, it has backed and promoted the deployment
of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to coordinate with the relevant African
countries on this matter in the United Nations, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.N. Nomination of Ekeus As Chief Arms Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday slammed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's nomination of Rolf Ekeus as the
chairman of a new U.N. arms inspection regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told foreign media here
on Monday evening that the nomination of Ekeus as the chairman of
the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC) is out of ill-intention.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Ekeus was the one who created the U.N. Special
Commission(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, who deliberately prolonged
the arms inspection for six years and allowed arms inspectors to
carry out espionage activities against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus was the one who sent former UNSCOM inspector Scott Ritter,
an American whom Iraq branded as "trouble maker", to Israel to
coordinate with Mossad, the Israeli intelligence, Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," Aziz said that "nominating him (Ekeus) as the
chairman of the new commission is out of ill-intention."
</P>
<P>
Under the latest U.N. Security Council's omnibus resolution on
Iraq narrowly adopted on December 17, UNMOVIC should be created to
replace UNSCOM to complete the disarmament task in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The latest resolution on Iraq envisages that sanctions on Iraq
could be suspended in the event of Iraq's full cooperation with the
new arms inspection commission.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requests the U.N. chief to appoint the chairman
of the new arms regime within 30 days after the adoption of the
resolution, with the consultation and approval of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan's nomination of Ekeus as the chairman of UNMOVIC came
after the deadline of midnight Sunday passed.
</P>
<P>
However, the nominee must be approved by the 15-member Security
Council which has been deadlocked over the nominee in the past
weeks.

<HEADLINE> British Ship with Nuclear Waste Passes through Panama Canal. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 17 (Xinhua)--British ship "Pacific Swan",
carrying a load of nuclear waste, passed securely and without
hindrance at dawn Monday after eight hours of trip through Panama
Canal.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Panama Canal Authority (ACP),the
craft with 104 containers of highly radioactive waste material
headed for Japan, where the debris will be processed industrially.
</P>
<P>
In order to assure the successful passage of "Pacific Swan",
canal authorities adopted adequate security measures in
coordination with government security statutes.
</P>
<P>
ACP, which administers the interoceanic pathway since its
return to Panamanian authority last December 31, 1999, maintains
efficient and safe measures for all sea trade vessels traveling
along the canal.
</P>
<P>
Security of the canal has been a hot topic since the United
States handed over control on December 31. Panama has no army,
relying instead on an 18,000-strong national police force.
</P>
<P>
The passage of "Pacific Swan" through Panama Canal took
place Monday in midst of a wave of protests from Panamanian and
international ecology organizations like Greenpeace. These oppose
the transport of nuclear waste owing to its high danger.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Lax Security Found in U.S. State Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a critical audit by the department's inspector
general, 239 of 1,890 "sensitive compartmented information" (SCI)
intelligence reports from the National Security Agency's
Cryptological Support Group had not been returned to the group's
secure facility inside the State Department between August and
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
In one case, a pouch was returned empty; another was returned
open with the key in it, the Post quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Department is substantially not in compliance with the
director of central intelligence's directives that govern the
handling of SCI," the inspector general, Jacqueline Williams-
Bridger, concluded in the report.
</P>
<P>
Auditors also found that State Department security officials
failed to sweep scores of rooms for bugging devices and repeatedly
failed to account for highly classified documents.
</P>
<P>
All this happened before FBI agents discovered a Russia spy
lurking outside the State Department building, leading to the
discovery of a listening device placed in a conference room on the
seventh floor of the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's report, completed in September but kept
largely confidential, was ordered by the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence in 1998 after an earlier seventh-floor security
breach.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a man strolled into the executive secretary's office,
six doors down from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's,
helped himself to classified briefing materials in view of two
secretaries and walked out. The man was never identified and the
materials were never recovered, the post said.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's report also said that thousands of
authorized visitors, including hundreds of foreign government
officials, had enjoyed unescorted access throughout headquarters
once they were cleared by the main security desk.
</P>
<P>
In one two-day period in September 1998, the inspector general
found, 1,726 visitors, including 326 foreign officials, entered
the building and most moved "about the building unescorted."
</P>
<P>
The State Department stopped allowing authorized visitors
unescorted access to its sprawling headquarters last summer.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Rejects Russia's Criticism of Its North Caucasus Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze expressed hope Monday to convince Russian acting
President and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that Moscow's sharp
criticisms of Georgian policy in the North Caucasus are groundless.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Shevardnadze told a
press conference in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, that he will make
Putin sure that the accusations against Georgia are "very distant
from reality" at the upcoming CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent
States) summit in Moscow in late January.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian leadership "has not taken any steps against its
people and conscience or against Russia," Shevardnadze said. He
also expressed the hope that the two countries' leaders will have
the "sufficient will to put Georgian-Russian relations back on a
normal track."
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have repeatedly said that the Georgian
authorities are not taking the appropriate steps to prevent
movement of rebels and arms into Chechnya via Georgia and wounded
Chechen fighters are being treated in Georgian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shevardnadze said he prefers forming a single
regional security system for settling conflicts in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
He said such a system could be supported not only by countries
of the region -- Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan -- but
also by international organizations, the U.S. and other interested
nations.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a Caucasus security pact proposed by Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel visiting Georgia on Saturday
corresponds with similar initiatives other regional leaders had
expressed earlier, Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
The president also suggested that the settlement of the
conflict in Abkhazia be discussed in the general context of the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Georgian Foreign Ministry ruled out the
possibility to recognize the independence of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Europe's First IT Network Set Up in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe's first IT network set up
here on Monday by companies from Italy, France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
With a presence in eight countries, the new company hopes to
become a "European AOL" in the near future, the CEO of one of the
three participating firms said.
</P>
<P>
According to Gerard Philippot, chairman of France's Unilog
software design and consultancy group, the aim is to win
leadership in Europe and compete directly with the U.S. giants.
</P>
<P>
The network, which will certainly become known by its acronym,
Escan, also includes Ibermatica from Spain and, from Italy,
Engineering Ingegneria Elettronica (EIE) SpA, a major supplier of
networks and software solutions to customers such as local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Italian company's CEO, Michele Cinaglia, said Escan expects
to increase its work-force from 7,000 now to 10,000 in 2001 and 12,
000 within 4 years. Current turnover is equivalent to 635 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is designed to turn form a network to pool
experience and know-how for developing innovative IT projects,
solutions and services.
</P>
<P>
The participating companies are all in the top ten of their
field in their respective countries, all of them have been
privately owned from the start, and none of them are tied down by
agreements with hardware makers.
</P>
<P>
Italy's EIE SpA, the second-largest company of its kind in the
country, has turnover of 300 billion lire (about 160 million U.S.
dollars) of which 40-50 billion from internet-linked services.
</P>
<P>
For strategic decisions, the alliance will be managed by an
executive council consisting of the three CEOs - Jose' Luis Larrea
for Ibermatica.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Fails to Determine Cause of Apache Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The investigation has been closed and the cause will be listed
as unknown due to the degree of damage sustained during the crash
sequence, Army spokesman Edwin Veiga said.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, 1999, the Apache was leading a formation of five
helicopters over mountainous terrain in northern Albania when its
nose pitched up and the chopper rolled to the right. It fell 240
meters to the ground and exploded in flames, killing two officers.
</P>
<P>
Veiga said early indications pointed to a mechanical failure,
but investigators were ultimately unable to determine a cause.
</P>
<P>
Apaches are the U.S. Army's best attack helicopters and were
used extensively in the 1991 Gulf War. Over half of the Army's
fleet of 743 Apaches has been grounded since November last year to
replace their tail rotor bearings or to replace transmission parts.
The decision to ground the choppers was made when the Army
determined that the tail rotor bearing was the cause of an Apache
crash in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
All Apaches deployed abroad have already been repaired and
returned to service. The full fleet is scheduled to be back in
operation by April this year.

MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal units launched a

saying.

First raid planes took off from the Mozdok airport at 5:30 a.m.
local time, said the press service.

<HEADLINE> Report: Economic Life to PCs to Shorten to Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Personal computers are
barely managing to hold their value for three years, according to
a new report released Monday by U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Year three is the last point at which PCs hold any measurable
amount of value, and all indications show that value is shrinking
into the second year, said IDC's report on PC life cycle.
</P>
<P>
"Vendors will continue to lower price points as faster
processors are introduced and continue to replace their most
expensive, best equipped systems with even better systems at the
same price point," the report said. "As long as users are able to
continually buy more robust PCs at lower price points, economic
life cycles will continue to shrink -- and this will certainly be
the case for the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
While chipmaker Intel's pace of change holds the greatest
influence over PC economic life cycles, corporations do have some
say over technological life cycles. IDC said that by standardizing
on a stable platform, playing out the full useful life of systems
and upgrading various components, companies could potentially
lengthen corporate life cycles.
</P>
<P>
If companies are to get the most from their PC investments,
according to IDC, they need to understand the life cycles of the
different PCs they have installed and their value on the used
market. As companies cycle out older systems for newer ones, they
often find the cost to get rid of PCs exceeds their value in the
used equipment market.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, IDC said, it could cost as much as 250 U.
S. dollars to simply remove a PC from its work area after tallying
the labor involved in physically removing the system and network
components, disconnecting peripherals, scrubbing the hard disk of
software and sensitive company information, and figuring in the
loss in user productivity during the downtime.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for companies to cover these disposal costs if
they retire their PCs while they still have value in the used
market, IDC said.
