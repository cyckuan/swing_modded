<HEADLINE> Russian President Leaves for Visit to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today left for a two-day visit to Germany which will include talks
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a draft accord on
Russia's relationship with the NATO military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss bilateral economic
ties, European security as well as Russia's full membership of the
Group of Seven industrial nations, the World Trade Organization
and the Paris Club group of creditors, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the
presidential press secretary, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The return of art treasures seized by the Soviet Red
Army from the Nazis during World War II would also be on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been complicated by
the Russian parliament's refusal to allow the return of the World
War II trophy art.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Russia's Federal Council, the upper house of
parliament, is to debate whether to back the lower house in
overruling Yeltsin's veto of a draft law which says the art should
stay in Russia.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Kohl on Thursday, Yeltsin is expected to
receive a "Man of the Year" award from the German media. He is to
return home on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report by Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kohl as
saying that German-Russian relations are based on trust and
cooperation in many fields and both sides are making efforts to
broaden the close partnership.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Construction Declines in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) --As interest rates rising, U.S.
housing construction started to drop in March #,according to a
report from the U.S. Department of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts dropped 6.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.42 million units, both single-family homes and
apartments, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The decline is regarded as the worst in three months, and also
was somewhat larger than that expected by economists.
</P>
<P>
The level of construction in February, a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.52 million, was the highest in nearly three
years, stimulated by low mortgage rates and comparatively mild
weather.
</P>
<P>
However, mortgage rates began rising in March, anticipating
monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve near the end of the
month. Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages now are averaging above 8
percent for the first time since last fall.
</P>
<P>
The monthly decline was focused in single-family construction,
which fell 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.22 million homes. Apartment construction rose 1.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted 308,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Housing permits, a barometer of future construction, ebbed 1.5
percent in March, with single-family homes registering a 5.8
percent decline.

<HEADLINE> Ford Gains Big Earnings to $1.5 bln in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co. announced today
its first-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago to 1.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. second largest automaker's revenues totaled 36.2
billion dollars, a 3 percent increase from 35.2 billion dollars in
the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Ford's automotive operations earned 1 billion dollars, a
sevenfold increase from the 142 million dollars a year ago. Its
U.S. automotive profits were 836 million dollars as compared with
48 million dollars in the first three months last year.
</P>
<P>
Ford attributed its improved performance to sales of
higher-profit vehicles and its Ford 2000 cost-cutting program.
</P>
<P>
The company's earnings from its international automotive
operations were less impressive, but still showed improvement at
168 million dollars, up from 94 million dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The improvements stem from cost reductions, the successful
launch of new products and a resurgence of Ford's business in
South America, the company said.
</P>
<P>
In South America, which has been a major money drain on Ford,
Ford cut its loss to 47 million dollars compared with a 60 million
dollars loss a year ago. Ford has not made a profit there since
the second quarter of 1995.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR to Preserve People's Freedom: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has the strongest
determination to preserve the freedoms that the people of Hong
Kong currently enjoy, said Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a dinner held by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce
this evening, Tung said he will assure everyone in the audience
that the amendments to the two ordinances are not aimed at any
particular groups of persons or any individual organizations.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Chief Executive's Office issued a document to
solicit Hong Kong people's suggestions on the amendments to the
Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Tung said peaceful and lawful demonstrations can and must be
allowed to continue, adding, "I see public demonstrations as a way
for people to express their views and public demonstrations are
now a part of Hong Kong's culture."
</P>
<P>
On the Societies Ordinance, he said that most of the countries
in the world are sensitive about influences of foreign political
parties on their domestic political scene.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Do we want foreigners or foreign political parties to
influence political direction in Hong Kong? I believe that the
community will not want this to happen. Indeed, we should not let
this happen."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Public Order Ordinance, the issue here is to
find the balance between the rights of individuals who want to
demonstrate and the stability and convenience of society as a
whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the consultative exercise will bring our community
together to reach a broad consensus as to the direction we wish to
take and the kind of community we want to live in the 21st
century," he said.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Major technology companies in
the United States are beginning to recover from last year's
recession as they reported better-than-expected profits in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The companies which reported earnings that met or surpassed
expectations Tuesday included Texas Instruments Inc., Sun
Microsystems Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation and the LSI
Logic Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter earnings at Texas Instruments rose to 138
million U.S. dollars, or 70 cents a share from 132 million
dollars, or 68 cents, a year earlier, topping the Wall Street
consensus of 70 cents. Sun Microsystems had earnings of 224

While referring to reports that he might hold direct talks with
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko in South Africa this week, Kabila
said he did not expect to meet Mobutu during his scheduled two-day's
tour to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is not important for me, Who is he?' said the rebel leader.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Mutual Fund Sales Up Despite Market Jitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada's mutual fund industry
posted its record retirement savings plan season this year, taking
in 5.1 billion U.S. dollars from investors last month despite a
slide in stock and bond prices.
</P>
<P>
March's inflows to funds brought sales in the first three
months of the year to 16 billion dollars, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This figure surpassed the previous record of 14.3 billion
dollars in the first quarter of 1994, when low interest rates and
hot stock market sent investors into mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
Despite the big sales, Canada's fund industry assets rose only
1.7 billion dollars to a record 168.8 billion last month.
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates in the U.S. have sent stock and bond
prices tumbling, wiping about 3.4 billion dollars off the value in
mutual funds in March.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the average Canadian equity fund lost 3.8
percent while the average domestic balanced fund fell 2.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Terminal Building Fitout Highlights Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's new airport at Chek
Lap Kok is transforming rapidly from a construction site to an
operating facility, the Airport Authority (AA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The massive passenger terminal building is more apparent in
this field, where the fitout stage is well under way with many
services already reaching their commissioning stage in the run-up
to airport opening in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The transportation center is taking shape at the front door.
This will provide road and rail links to Kowloon and Central Hong
Kong, offering passengers, workers and visitors a level of
convenience available at very few airports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Inside the departure hall, the first of 288 baggage check-in
desks, arranged in nine islands, are being tested. Final fittings
and adjustments are being made to conveyor belts that form part of
the largest airport baggage handling system in the world.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the system is designed to serve 35 million
passengers per year and 13,680 departure bags per hour, almost
twice the number handled by the existing system at the current
Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport. And the system has been designed so
that all baggage should be reclaimed within 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The departure hall and the northern concourse are the sites of
many benchmark fittings. With most of these trials successfully
completed, the fitout is continuing throughout the remainder of
the building, including interior architecture features such as
granite flooring, painting and soffit linings in the ceiling, AA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The passenger terminal is designed to be a low-energy user
compared to other commercial buildings in Hong Kong. Its roof,
for example, is five times more energy-efficient than a typical
Hong Kong roof, and acts as a vast insulator. Ceiling skylights
and reflectors provide generous amounts of natural light to main
halls and lounges which reduces the amount of artificial light
required.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's monthly inflation rose to
19.9 percent in March amid warnings from local banks and economists
that the economy is facing serious inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Market analyst Jason Moore today said, ''the inflation figure for
March is pretty well within our expectations and conforms our
forecast that inflation will be on an upward trend for the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
It is now widely accepted that inflation will continue rising, and
could exceed 20 percent by mid-year before dipping thereafter to end
the year pegged at between 18 and 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which reached a seven-year low of nearly 14 percent in
November 1996, was pegged at 15.8 percent in January this year, and
rose further to 19 percent in February.

The sharp rise in inflation last month was mainly attributed to
the knock-on effects of the increase in fruit and vegetable prices,
which on average soared by about 50 percent following heavy rains
which destroyed some crops, causing a slight shortage on the local
market. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nemtsov Talks About Russia's Railways Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia's state-owned railways
should reduce tariffs for cargo transportation and pay taxes to
the budget in time, First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said
at an extended collegium of the Ministry of the Railways.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency today quoted Nemtsov as saying that
these are the two tasks set for the ministry by President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said the railways will be divided into state, regional
and local in the future, and the responsibility will be divided
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Ministry of the Railways should stop
bartering, which increase the cost of railway transportation
services by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov today also expressed confidence in the new Minister of
Railways Nikolai Aksenenko, saying he will enable the ministry to
work more effectively.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Russian railways account for three percent of the
country's GNP.

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Popularity Drops in Pre-Election Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The chances of the Irish
government winning a second term suffered another setback today
when an opinion poll reveals that the popularity of Labor Party, a
major partner in the three-party coalition, dropped sharply in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Irish Evening Herald newspaper,
was published amid renewed speculation that Prime Minister John
Bruton was likely to call an early election on May 23 in a bid to
capitalize on the country's favorable economic situation, press
reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
The results of this latest poll showed that the Labor Party,
whose leader is Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, could lose up
to six seats in Dublin, where about one third of the country's
parliamentary seats are located.
</P>
<P>
The Labor's support in Dublin, which usually holds the key to a
general election victory, has fallen 26 percent in 1992 elections
to 14 percent this month and that Labor's share of parliamentary
seats could drop from 32 to 26.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poll also revealed that the opposition Fianna
Fail and Progressive Democrat parties, which hold a six-point lead
over the coalition government in most opinion polls, were gaining
more support ahead of the general election.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say that the current situation would be a
severe blow to the government's chances of rebuilding the
coalition of the Fine Gael party, Labor Party and the Democratic
Left.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz Turnover Up 12 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial concern
Daimler-Benz said today group sales in the first quarter of 1997
rose 12 percent to 26 billion marks (1 U.S. dollar=1.9 German
mark) and promised further improvements over the year.
</P>
<P>
The company, which achieved a turnaround in profits in 1996
from a loss of 200 million marks to a profit of 2.4 billion marks,
said the achievement was partly a result of extensive cost cutting,
particularly through portfolio restructuring and divestment of
chronic loss-making areas.
</P>
<P>
Daimler is planning to raise 1.1 billion marks through a
convertible bond issue, convertible into ordinary shares by 2002,
to strengthen its capital base for future growth.
</P>
<P>
From 1997 through 1999, the company said it was planning fixed
asset investment worldwide of nearly 20 billion marks, with a
further 15 billion marks earmarked for research and development.
</P>
<P>
In a profit and loss breakdown for 1996, Daimler said
passenger car production at Mercedes made a profit of 3.1 billion
marks, with commercial vehicles showing a loss of 400 million
marks.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz Aerospace lost 196 million marks, compared with a
7.2 billion mark loss in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, Mercedes-Benz sold 154,000
cars, a 4 percent increase over the first quarter last year,
boosting revenues by 11 percent to 11.4 billion marks, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz, with about 290,000 employees at home and 67,200
abroad, consists of Mercedes-Benz, Daimler-Benz Aerospace and
Daimler-Benz Interservices (DEBIS).

<HEADLINE> Africa Told to Be Wary of Hiv Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Africa must strongly unite in
rejecting Aids clinical trials based on skin colour, University of
Zimbabwe Vice-Chancellor Graham Hill said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the Fifth Congress of the Association of
Medical Laboratory Scientists, Hill said there had to be
justification why a particular country is used for such trials.
</P>
<P>
''Clinical and drug trials have to be exposed to international
scrutiny, and justification given as to why a country becomes a
centre for such Hiv/Aids trials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Trials that only involved developing countries and none of the
industrialised countries should be treated with caution, and their
rationale fully justified before implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hill said, ''Africa should unite in rejecting, in the strongest
terms, trials that are based on the principle of colour, for in fact
they do not seek knowledge, but seek to perpetuate the inequality of
mankind, and proof of idiosynchratic self-appeasing theories.''

NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States
met on Wednesday for the second time in two months on the proposed
four-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in U.N. Plaza Hotel across the street of
the United Nations. A South Korean press officer with access to
the meeting said the DPRK and ROK officials shook hands at the
beginning of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Song Yong Shik, ROK Deputy Foreign Minister for Political
Affairs, said "we are in the middle of the warm Spring and the
meeting will be a very cozy one."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Noticing that there were 21 correspondent at presence, he said:

discussions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to last for only one day. DPRK and
U.S. delegation are going to meet on Friday without the South

<HEADLINE> New Car Sales down in W. Europe in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in western Europe
fell by three percent in March compared with the same month last
year, according to figures released by the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association (EAMA) today.
</P>
<P>
The EAMA said that new car sales last month in France dropped
sharply, down 21.1 percent, while sales in Germany, Europe's
biggest car market, was also weak, down 8.6 percent on last year.
</P>
<P>
It linked the sharp fall in sales to the effect of ending
government and industry incentive schemes this year, which it
believed distorted demand last year and pulled sales forward in
the above two countries.
</P>
<P>
Although sales in Italy soared by 25.1 percent last month also
due to the Italian government's incentive scheme introduced in
January, this was easily overshadowed by the decline in France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that total sales in western Europe would have
dropped by a more dramatic 6.4 percent in March had sales in Italy
remained at last year's level.
</P>
<P>
The situation was also clearly shown in manufacturers'
performance. Fiat's group sales rose by 7.5 percent last month on
the back of sharply higher Italian sales while Renault fell by 8.9
percent and Peugeot-Citroen by 7.4 percent as home market demand
fell.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that South Korean brands, which enjoyed
virtually constant rises in the past two years, also recorded a
surprise downturn last month, with sales falling by 9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Boost Telephone Communication, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will increase
the number of telephone lines in the next six years to six
million -- doubling the present three million, a top official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Two million of these would go to rural areas, squatter camps and
townships, South African Posts and Telecommunications Minister Jay
Naidoo told the parliament, adding that one million analogue
lines would be replaced by digital lines.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said 24,000 priority customers -- such as schools and
clinics-- had been identified and the costs of the first line would
be borne by Telkom, a major telephone enterprise in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said over the next five years, an additional 125,000 public
telephones would be installed, bringing South Africa to above the
average of other middle-income countries -- approximately five public
telephones per thousand people in the rural areas and 3.5 per thousand
in the urban areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to financial support to the great telecommunication
project, the minister expressed that the department concerned would
make full use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The sale of 30 percent of Telkom's equity to a consortium of
Malaysian counterpart and South-Western Bell International has brought
5.5 billion Rands (1.25 billion U.S. dollars), the biggest foreign
investment in frastructure in South Africa since 1994, he said.

<HEADLINE> Inequality Increases Greatly in UK Since 1979: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Policies adopted by the
government, such as cuts in taxes and benefits and growing pay
differentials, have widened social divisions and increased
inequality in Britain since 1979, according to a report published
today.
</P>
<P>
The report by the charity Child Poverty Action Group pointed
out that between 1979 and 1994 the real income of the bottom 10
percent of the population fell by 13 percent while the average
rose 40 percent and the income of the top-ten soared by 65
percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that during the same period, the population living in
poverty, defined as below 50 percent of average income after
housing costs, rose from nine percent to 25 percent, a rise from
five million people to 13.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Britain's rise in inequality was matched only by New Zealand
among the developed countries of the world, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Alan Walker, professor of social policy at the University of
Sheffield, said in the introduction of the report that while the
rise was an international trend, Britain's extreme case was
largely due to the government having "purposely pursued policies
which widened social divisions in British society".
</P>
<P>
The study pointed out that economic inequality in Britain has
grown across a wide range of fields ranging from access to quality
education and health-care to the provision of adequate housing.
</P>
<P>
This is due to a combination of factors including demographic
shifts, tax cuts for the wealthy and a growing number of low-paid
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Sally Witcher, director of the charity, said that the study
showed a desperate need for the growing divide between rich and
poor to be bridged.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
picked up 0.9 percent in March, according to a report from the
Federal Reserve here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth, nearly double what economists expected, brought the
industrial operating rate to 84.1 percent, up from 83.6 percent in
February and the highest level in two years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that an operating rate of around 85
percent is a sign of inflation-producing strains in the production
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Today's report is also regarded as bad news for Wall Street
investors and others worried that inflation pressures will cause
the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates through the
summer in a bid to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices, which had surged Tuesday, slipped this morning
after the housing construction figures were released. Yields on
30-year Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction of
prices, went up to 7.10 percent in early trading from 7.09 percent
late yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Arrived in Germany for Talks with Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian president Boris Yeltsin
arrived in Germany this afternoon for a two-day stay in the
country's famous spa town Baden-Baden on the edge of the Black
Forest, where he was to met with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived at the Stuttgart airport in the company of his
wife Naina and daughter-adviser Tatjana. Since his operation, this
was Yeltsin's second foreign trip. Last month, he held talks with
US president Bill Clinton in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's meeting with Kohl, initially planned as a ceremony
for him to receive a media prize, was the 20th such since he
became Russian president in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Their talks are expected to focus on Moscow's continued
rejection of eastwards expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the German demand for return of art
treasures seized by the former Soviet Union in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Russia demanded firm guarantees that NATO will not extend its
military infrastructure up to its border. NATO noted it was not
willing to make such guarantee though it saw no need to deploy new
forces in Central Europe in the absence of a military threat.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on a NATO-Russia charter in bid to mollify
Moscow over NATO enlargement have thus reached a crucial stage.
Kohl is expected to determine from Thursday talks whether Moscow
means the demand, or only makes it a bargaining ploy before the
hoped-for signing of the charter on May 27.
</P>
<P>
During the Thursday talks, Yeltsin and Kohl would also discuss
the fate of about one million German art treasures, two million
rare books and ancient archives which Bonn said was seized by the
former Soviet Union in 1945 from the defeated Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin supported returning the art treasures, but was blocked
by the Russian parliament Duma, which, just two weeks ago,
overrode Yeltsin's latest veto of the legislation that would made
these works of art Russia's state property.
</P>
<P>
These pieces of art include paintings by Monet, Degas, Renoire,
El Greco, Goya, Rembrandt and Rubens. Among them was also the
legendary golden treasure from Troy, which was unearthed by German
archeologist Heinrich Schliemann.

of South Korea has decided to acquire AST Research Inc. a computer
maker which is based in Irvine, California of the United States,
according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The 170 million U.S. dollar deal is aimed to revive a
once-popular brand name that AST had enjoyed but now is devalued.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Samsung, which is a unit of the Samsung Group of
South Korea, began investing in AST, which acquired reputation for
high quality and performance in 1980's. But the computer maker was
never able to adapt to the more competitive personal computer
market of 1990's. From June 1995 to December 1996, AST accumulated
operating losses of 608 million U.S. dollars. In such
circumstances, Samsung decided to acquire the U.S. computer maker
and sell personal computers under its own name.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that acquisition of the U.S. company reflects
strong long term approach of Samsung to the PC business in the
global markets, especially in the Asian rim countries.

<HEADLINE> EU-Med Conference Highlights Sense of Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, MALTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The second
European-Mediterranean conference closed here today with the 27
participating countries stressing the need of common interests
among them in their cooperation process.
</P>
<P>
In his closing ceremony address, the Maltese Prime Minister
Alfred Sant said the success of the meeting is attributed to
all the countries' "genuine and vested interest in the
(Euro-Mediterranean) Partnership."
</P>
<P>
The meeting has taken place when the Middle East peace
process is at a "most critical and fragile phase."
</P>
<P>
The negative impact of the Middle East peace process on
the EU-Mediterranean cooperation was one of the hottest topics
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony was delayed for five hours due to
the argument in the conference how the stability and security
issues, particularly the Middle East peace process, should be
put in the final document.
</P>
<P>
The draft document accused unilateral violation of signed
Middle East peace agreements, referring to Israeli hardline
policies.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the participating countries
softened their tone by leaving out the hard terms, just
expressing concern and hoping for a lasting peace based on
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that substantial progress in their
cooperation has been achieved, despite the uncertainties of the
regional political and security situation.
</P>
<P>
The EU president Hans Van Mierlo, foreign minister of the
Netherlands, described the meeting as one of the "nicest that
has ever been held."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the conference, Mierlo said one
of the other major achievements at the conference is the
direct meeting of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, brokered by the EU, was the first direct
official one between the two sides since the Middle East peace
process plunged to the worst crisis in its seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Greece and Turkey have achieved
progress in finding solution to their territorial disputes over
Aegean islands, Mierlo said, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The EU also initialed an association agreement with Jordan
in light of the EU-Mediterranean cooperation blueprint. This
brings the number of the countries having such accords with EU
up to eight.
</P>
<P>
Because of differencs, the final document could not be adopted
at the end of the conference, but the participants reviewed the
progress achieved during the European-Mediterranean cooperation
for the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The Malta conference, the second of this type, has also
reviewed the progress achieved in the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation
which was launched in the first Barcelona conference in November
1995, and find practical ways to push it ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona conference set up a goal to establish an EU-Med
free-trade zone by 2010 through forging partnership with Algeria,
Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria,
Tunisia, Turkey and Palestine.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Turkish Troops Leaves for Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The first convoy of Turkish
troops today left the Aegean city of Izmir for Albania to join a
multinational protection force to maintain security there, a
military statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by Turkey's General Staff said that a
153-strong Turkish force and six vehicles went to Tirana,
capital of Albania, by air to take part in the "Mission Alba"
organized by the United Nations in a bid to protect the security
of Tirana Airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the second batch of a 246-strong
force together with four military ships will leave Sunday for
Albania by sea and the last convoy of a 280-strong force will
fly from Izmir to Tirana on April 24.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military sources said that Turkey would be
responsible for Tirana, the Tirana Airport and the northern part
of Albania and the Turkish contingent is commanded by Marine
Colonel Suleyman Bozkurt with troops selected from
specially-trained marine and commandos of the Turkish navy.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News said today that Turkey also
plans to send cargo aircraft three times a month to Albania in
an effort to provide continuous logistic support for its
contingent there.
</P>
<P>
Turkey recently established a satellite communication
center near the Tirana Airport to further improve its electronic
capabilities in that country, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversations between Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and his Albanian counterpart Sali Berisha
Tuesday evening, Demirel stressed that Turkey would always extend
its friendly hand to Albania and would continue to provide
support for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has also decided to provide a
50-million-dollar aid to help Albania overcome its
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Steps Up Efforts to Solve Cyprus Problem (I) (by Huang Jianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. has stepped up efforts
to solve the long-standing Cyprus problem through an intensifed
mediation by a U.N. special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Han Sung Joo, the special envoy, left here today after his
four-day mission in Cyprus to foster the ongoing peace process on
the island.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he had separate meetings with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, but the U.N. official refrained from giving details on
the U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides, which will pave the way for direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During his outgoing visit, Han brought here a surprising news
that he will step down from his post at the end of his term in
office on April 30, because of his "other responsibilities" and
"difficulties" that impede his task.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed as U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Representative for Cyprus to replace former Canadian Prime
Minister Joe Clark in May last year.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources here noted that Han's resignation
will not affect the ongoing U.N.-led peace process in Cyprus,
which is gaining momentum after U.N. Chief Kofi Annan met with
Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash in Geneva last week.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Annan underlined to Denktash the need to
move forward on the Cyprus problem and to work toward an overall
settlement. The U.N. Chief looks forward that face-to-face
negotiations between President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash will
begin by mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Denktash called on President Clerides to join
him in direct talks, noting that the parameters for the
settlement of the Cyprus problem are on the table, known as the
Set of Ideas proposed by former U.N. Chief Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader expressed the hope that the
U.N. secretary general will find ways and means to bring both
sides to the negotiation table, which he hopes to take place in
the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Annan-Denktash meeting took place after the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
entered the fifth week, during which U.N. Resident Representative
Gustave Feissel had bi-weekly separate meetings with President
Clerides and Denktash in a bid to prepare the ground for
face-to-face negotiations, and to get the two sides to
unilaterally adopt good-will gestures.
</P>
<P>
Nothing concrete has been revealed since the talks began on
March 10, because the parties involved have committed themselves
to an agreement not to publish the content of the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, Feissel disclosed that some progress has been made in
the proximity talks on both the substance of the Cyprus problem
and the mutual good-will gestures aimed at fostering a positive
climate for direct negotiations, although the U.N. official
declined to go into details.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing U.N. envoy Han Sung Joo said after meetings with
President Clerides and Denktash Monday that there is now more
hope to get the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides around the
negotiating table than in the past.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash is
optimistic. He was quoted as saying that the direct meeting
planned for June can take place if there is progress on the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
On the part of the Greek Cypriot side, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides has said it is too early to determine
whether there is sufficient common ground between the views of
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to enable direct
negotiations for an overall settlement in Cyprus to begin.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the governments of Cyprus and Greece
together with the National Council, the top advisory body to
President Clerides on handling the Cyprus problem, will assess
the outcome of the proximity talks and decide whether the
conditions for direct talks have been met.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the U.N.-sponsored indirect military
dialogue between Cypriot armed force, the National Guard, and
Turkish forces on the island is still going on, according to the
U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which began last year, were aimed at reaching an
agreement on the package submitted by the U.N. in order to reduce
tension along the 180-kilometer buffer zone. The package includes
unmanning of the areas where the two sides are at close proximity
with each other, the prohibition of located weapons along the
cease-fire line and the code of conduct for the military along
the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unsolved for the past 23 years
since the island was divided after Turkish troops landed and
seized the northern third of the island in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state, have been held on
and off, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have not met since October 1994 when
the two men held two rounds of informal talks in Nicosia under
the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that if the U.N. proposed direct
negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides can be
held by the middle of this year, it will be a major step toward
an overall settlement to the protracted Cyprus question.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today called upon the Afghan parties to cease immediately all
hostile actions and to enter into sustained negotiations,
according to a presidential statement adopted by the council
today.
</P>
<P>
"The council strongly believes that a negotiated settlement is
the only solution to the long-standing conflict in this country,"
said the statement of Antonio Monteiro, Portuguese ambassador and
council president for April.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its full support for the United Nations efforts to
facilitate national reconciliation in Afghanistan, the Security
Council was convinced that the United Nations must continue to
play the central role in assisting the warring Afghan factions to
engage in a fully-fledged negotiating process on the basis of the
Security Council resolution 1076 and General Assembly resolution
51/195.
</P>
<P>
As many important provisions of the resolutions above remained
unimplemented, the council called upon all Afghan parties, in
particular the Taliban, to abide by these resolutions, to
cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission in
Afghanistan (UNSMA) and to participate in serious and honest
negotiations through the good offices of the UNSMA.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called upon all states to end
immediately the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties to
the conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the council expressed its deep concern at the
worsening of the humanitarian situation, and discrimination
against women and other violations of human rights and of
international humanitarian law in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Non-oil Exports Hit 93 million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria exported 93 million U.S.
Dollars of non-oil products in 1996, the Nigerian Association of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA)
said in its latest edition of NACCIMA News.
</P>
<P>
The publication said the figure covers all the exports that
were done with certificates of origin issued by the association,
including mainly rubber, furniture, cocoa, cashew nuts, cotton
and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria depends as much as 97 percent of its exports on crude
oil export, which earned it slightly more than 10 billion Dollars
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been trying to encourage the
exports of non-oil products in the last few years, but the
progress has been slow.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
admitted 6,900 new members in January 1997, said the PCF in a
communique published today.
</P>
<P>
The PCF claimed a total of 274,862 members at its 29th national
congress held in December in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The party daily ``l'Humanite'' today quoted Marie-Georges
Buffet, member of the national secretariat of the PCF, as saying
that the PCF is admitting an average of 300 new members each week.
</P>
<P>
Among the 96 federations (regional branches) of the PCF, those
of Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, both of them in the working
class suburbs of Paris, had more 20,000 members.
</P>
<P>
The party federations in Bouches-du-Rhone in the south, the
Nord and le Pas-de-Calais northern industrial regions, and
Hauts-de-Seine northwest of Paris have between 10,000 and 20,000

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Recommend Indicting Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In another dramatic revelation, Channel I crime reporter
Ayala Hasson, who first broke the news about the so-called
"Bar-On for Hebron" scandal that sparked the three-month police
investigation, said police investigators had recommended
indictments of breach of trust against Netanyahu, Justice
Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, Prime Minister's Office Director-General
Avigdor Liberman and religious Shas party leader Areyh
Deri.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the police only recommended
indictments against Deri for blackmailing, and Hanegbi and
Liberman for breach of trust. The indictment against Netanyahu
is expected to have dramatic implications on the current
government, because any government official charged with breach
of trust is likely forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
The police investigation team presented Tuesday the probe
findings and recommendations to State Attorney Edana Arbel, who
will decide whether to adopt them within the next few days after
consultations with current Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
According to Hasson's report, Shas leader Deri had pushed for
the appointment of former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On because
the latter promised him a plea-bargain in his three-year long
bribery and fraud trial. Shas is the third largest party in
Israel and has been an indispensable ruling partner either for
the Labor or Likud, the two leading parties.
</P>
<P>
Deri reportedly conditioned Shas' support of the Hebron
agreement on Bar-On's appointment. Liberman was said to have
played a middle-man between Deri and the government over
appointing Bar-On, who ironically resigned automatically two days
after the January 10 appointment under the pressure over his
politicial affiliation and insufficient qualifications.
</P>
<P>
If indictments are indeed filed, the Netanyahu government
will come under heavy pressure to resign or undergo a major
resuffle. But even no indictment was filed, the scandal has
already inflicted damage to the image of the Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Hasson said that even a failure to indict because of
infufficient evidence was tantamount to guilt of the government,
which could be forced to resign under the pressure of the public
opinion.

<HEADLINE> PM: Lebanon to Continue Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri vowed here today that his government will continue its
program of building and reconstructing the state despite the
"very very difficult" situation in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who returned home today from a trip to Russia, Canada
and France, discussed domestic issues and regional situation with
Lebanese president Elias Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in the Presidential Palace after the
meeting, Hariri said "there is no doubt that the peace process is
still in a very very difficult phase."
</P>
<P>
"The situation will remain as it is," the premier said, "we
the Lebanese have repeatedly said that we believe in the peace
but we do not bet on it."
</P>
<P>
"We will complete our program, the building of the state will
continue, our relations with the friendly countries will
continue, the plans of reconstruction and development will
continue," Hariri announced.
</P>
<P>
"We will handle the problem of south Lebanon within this
framework, " Hariri added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and the Russian, Canadian and French leaders
unanimously agreed that "the peace process is passing through a
serious crisis and Israel is responsible for it."
</P>
<P>
On a proposed "security pact" among the Middle East
countries, the prime minister admitted that he discussed this
issue with French President Jacques Chirac during their meeting
in Paris Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The security issue was raised in the Euro-Mediterranean
conference in Barcelona, Spain, in November 1995. Hariri said that
the Arab position was that it was "premature" to talk about an
accord on this problem "before a just and comprehensive peace was
reached with Israel."

<P>
The meeting, aimed at finding a political solution to war in

cable to king Fahd of Saudi Arabia to express his sympathy to the
victims of a fire that swept through the tent camps of Muslim
pilgrims near Mecca Tuesday, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
In the cable, the King also praised the Saudi Arabian
authority for its efforts to deal with the incident that
killed 217 people and wounded 1,300 others.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government Tuesday said that there were
no Jordanian casualties among the pilgrims who were camped north
of Mina when a gas cylinder explosion nearby caused a fire
that tore through the encampment.
</P>
<P>
A senior Jordanian official said that all Jordanians at the
camp were in excellent conditions and that no one was hurt in the
fire.
</P>
<P>
Some two million Muslims are participating in the pilgrimage
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Hajj pilgrimage attracts the world's largest number of
people at any one time, and security is always a priority in the
country. Tension in Saudi Arabia has been high following a major
bombing in 1995 that killed a number of U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia in 1994, 270 pilgrims died in a stampede. In
1990, 1,426 people were crushed to death in a tunnel leading to a
holy site in that country. In 1987, a rally by Iranian pilgrims
led to clashes with Saudi security forces there, in which 402
pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were Killed.

<HEADLINE> Survey: 3 Million Child Abuse Victims in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- More than three million
children were reported as victims of child abuse and neglect in
1996 in the United States and nearly a million more were confirmed
victims of maltreatment, according to a non-profit group.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse
released the results of a nationwide survey Wednesday. It revealed
that 1,046 children, or three children per day, died as a result
of abuse or neglect in the United States last year, the United
Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Committee research director Deborah Daro contends the survey
shows that child abuse is still a "grave" problem.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 82 percent of the fatalities were among
children under five years old. Some 42 percent were less than a
year old at the time of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
But the group saw evidence that in areas where intensive
prevention programs are in place, the child abuse rates dropped.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Rejects Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Hussein
Farah Aideed said here today he welcomes Arab efforts to mediate
an end to the Somali conflicts but rejects foreign interference,
the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, before wrapping up his week-long visit to Egypt
Thursday, reiterated the importance of Egypt's role in settling
the Somali problem and urged the Arab League (AL) and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to reinforce their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he cautioned against "some outside and inside
foreign intervention" in the six-year warring conflict in the
Horn of African country, referring partly to the mounting tension
on its border with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"I believes that the Somali problems should be resolved by the
Somalis themselves, if they are sincere in serving their
country," said the Somalia National Alliance leader.
</P>
<P>
"The conferences administered by foreign powers can never be
an alternative to a national one," he added, referring to some
foreign intervention in Somali internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Aideed said he is ready to have constructive talks with his
compatriotic counterparts, adding that there are 16 instead of 27
internationally recognized factions in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The interim government is working to mobilize the popular
leaderships in Somalia that contains of 18 provinces...I am ready
to negotiate with any major force that has influence in this
African state," he added.
</P>
<P>
Denying that he refused to take part in any reconciliation
conference, Aideed said, however, that he would not attend the
conferences that are of no significance.
</P>
<P>
In the latest of a string of Arab consultations with various
Somali factions, AL chief Esmat Abdu1-Meguid and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak Monday held talks with Aideed on
rebuilding Somalia and the reconciliation process initiated by
the transitional government since March.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, leader of the most powerful militia in the southern
half of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, arrived here Friday.

<HEADLINE> Peres Demands Netanyahu's Resignation over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor's
leader Shimon Peres demanded today Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu resign immediately following the revelation that police
recommended indicting Netanyahu for his involvement in a
political scandal.
</P>
<P>
In this evening's news program, the state-run Television
Channel I revealed the police investigators probing the "Bar-On
for Hebron" scandal were recommending indicting Netanyahu for
breach of trust and fraud in appointing the attorney-general in
January. This had dropped a political bombshell to the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report in an interview with Channel I,
Peres said if the report was true, then it amounted to be an
"earthquake" in the Jewish state. He demanded Netanyahu step
down immediately and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Peres announced that he no longer pushed for
the formation of a national unity government with the
Netanyahu-led Likud party. He also said that he would make severe
criticism of the Netanyahu government over its mismanagement in
the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
Peres' latest statements signaled a dramatic turnaround in
his attitude toward the government since he held secret talks only
last week with Netanyahu to discuss forming a unity government,
despite other senior Labor members' strong opposition. Following
the scandal probe, the Labor is expected to intensify its
campaign to bring down the Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Following the Channel I's revelation about the police
recommendations of indictment against Netanyahu, government
spokesman Shai Bazak denied the report. He said that
the final decision should be made by State Attorney Edana Arbel
and current Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein, who will make a
formal decision on the indictments within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
But Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani confirmed that
it was true that the police investigators had recommended
indicting Netanyahu for breach of trust and fraud. He said earlier
that the government should step down if any minister could be
charged for involvement in the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
According to Channel I reporter Ayala Hasson, who first
broke the news about the so-called "Bar-On for Hebron" scandal
that sparked the three-month police investigation, police
investigators were recommending indictments of breach of trust
against Netanyahu, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, Prime
Minister's Office Director-General Avigdor Liberman. Charges
against religious Shas party leader Areyh Deri would be
blackmailing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the police only recommended indictments
against Deri, Hanegbi and Liberman. The police investigation
team presented Tuesday the probe findings and recommendations to
State Attorney Arbel and Attorney-General Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
According to Hasson's report, Shas leader Deri had pushed for
the appointment of former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On because
the latter promised him a plea-bargain in his three-year long
bribery and fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
Deri reportedly conditioned Shas' support of the Hebron
agreement with the Palestinians on Bar-On's appointment. Liberman
was said to have acted as the middle-man between Deri and the
government over appointing Bar-On, who ironically resigned two
days after the January 10 appointment under the pressure over his
political affiliation and insufficient qualifications.
</P>
<P>
If any indictment is indeed filed against Netanyahu, the
10-month old Likud government will likely be forced to resign to
pave the way for new elections. Health Minister Yehoshua Matza
told Israel Radio that he thought that the only possibility will
be calling for new elections if charges against Netanyahu would
be filed.
</P>
<P>
Even if no indictment is filed, the scandal has already
inflicted damage to the image of the government, which is
expected to undergo a major reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Hasson said even a failure to indict because of insufficient
evidence was tantamount to guilt of the government, which could
be forced to resign under the pressure of the public
opinion.

<HEADLINE> France Denounces Zairian Rebels for Refusing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- France denounced this evening
Zairian rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila for refusing to
seriously hold talks with the Zairian government, and warned the
rebels that their conquest of power by arms would only lead the
country into "indefinable chaos."
</P>
<P>
The French denouncement came after a Zairian rebel spokesman
said in Goma today that the rebels would not agree to a cease-fire
because a cease-fire would benefit the Zairian government and let
it win time.
</P>
<P>
"All other ways (for a solution), and especially the conquest
of power by arms, will bring Zaire into an indefinable chaos,"
said the French Foreign Ministry in a communique.
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to the rebels, the communique said, "Those
who would persist in this way, or who would accept it, would take
a very heavy responsibility for Zaire and the whole region."
</P>
<P>
It said that France is deeply worried about the "dangerous and
unacceptable situation in Zaire," and denounces "the refusal of
any real negotiation for an orderly transition which will allow
this country (Zaire)... to go out of the present impasse and build
a future."
</P>
<P>
France has repeatedly called on the Zairian rebels and the
Zairian government to hold talks to prepare for a transitional
period in Zaire before organizing elections.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have recently scored a number of victories in
fighting against the government forces by conquering the southern
mineral rich province of Shaba and part of the south-central
regions, and are controlling half of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Kabila is now asking Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko to step
down first before a cease-fire can be arranged.

LUSAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Poor access to contraceptive
methods has been identified as a key obstacle to the family
planning and the improvement of women's health in the developing
countries especially in African states.
</P>
<P>
Population Action International (PAI) said here today although
the availability of contraception has rosen by nearly three-fold
in Africa since 1982, African couples have poorer access to
contraceptive methods than those in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by PAI shows that over 100 million women of
child-bearing age in the developing countries are believed to
have unmet need for family planning.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that up to a third of African women have an
unmet need for family planning.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Propose New Campaign Finance Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of Democrats in the
U.S. House of Representatives today proposed a campaign finance
reform bill aimed at overturning a Supreme Court decision
forbidding campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
The bill will establish general spending limits, ban so-called
soft money, and require the total disclosure of the source of
every dollar raised.
</P>
<P>
Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, said the
"chief obstacle to campaign reform" is a 1976 Supreme Court
decision, Buckley vs. Valeo, that forbid campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
Group members contended the 1976 decision, in rejecting overall
spending limits but allowing the regulation of contributions, has
left candidates in a desperate search for money.
</P>
<P>
They said the Supreme Court, given its 1996 decision in the
Colorado Republican Campaign Committee vs. the Federal Election
Commission, has indicated it would allow spending limits if given
a new test case.
</P>
<P>
One of the most prominent campaign finance reform bills,
sponsored by Sens. John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russ
Feingold, Democrat from Wisconsin, has the backing of President
Bill Clinton but found few supporters among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The McCain-Feingold bill also will ban "soft money."

<HEADLINE> Peres Suspends Push for Unity Government Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The hope for forming a
unity government in Israel was dashed today when opposition
Labor's leader Shimon Peres decided to suspend his efforts
following a police investigation into a corruption scandal of
the current government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking this afternoon upon his return from a tour of
South America, Peres said he would not continue his efforts
to join a unity government with the ruling Likud party.
</P>
<P>
The former premier made the decision amid reports that the
police investigation into the so-called "Bar-On for Hebron"
scandal had uncovered serious corruption surrounding the abortive
appointment of Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On as the
attorney general in January.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators presented all findings and recommendations
to the State Attorney's Office Tuesday after the three-month
probe, in which about 60 people were questioned, including
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi,
Prime Minister's Office Director-General Avigdor Liberman and the
religious Shas party leader Areyh Deri.
</P>
<P>
The "Bar-On for Hebron" scandal was exposed by state-run
Television Channel I crime reporter Ayala Hasson, who revealed
that Shas leader Deri had pushed for the appointment of
Bar-On because the latter promised him a plea bargain in his
three-year bribery and fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
Deri reportedly conditioned Shas' support of the Hebron
agreement on Bar-On's appointment. Liberman was said to have
played a middle-man between Deri and the government over
appointing Bar-On, who ironically resigned two days
after appointment under the pressure due to his political
affiliation and insufficient qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Although the police findings have yet been publicized, local
media exposed that police investigators had recommended the
State Attorney's Office charge Deri with blackmailing, and
Hanegbi and Liberman with breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
If the indictments are indeed filed, the Likud government will
come under heavy pressure from the opposition and public to
resign or undergo a major reshuffle. But even no indictment
was filed, the scandal has already inflicted damage to the
image of the Likud government.
</P>
<P>
In view of the findings of the corruption investigation,
Peres has finally changed his mind on pushing for a unity
government in order to rescue the derailed peace process which
he pioneered. Last week, Peres reportedly held secret
discussions with Netanyahu over the prospects of forming a
unity government in order to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Labor's new generation leaders strongly oppose the
idea of joining a unity government with the Likud, especially
following the police investigation into the Bar-On affair.
Instead, they favor strengthening its campaign to topple the
Likud government and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been flirting with the idea of unity
government for a long time without making an official
decision. Faced with the current crisis in the peace process
and the difficulty of proceeding forward due to the strong
opposition from ultra-rightist forces within the coalition,
Netanyahu is believed to be seriously considering the option
of forming a unity government with the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Netanyahu will meet with Shas' spiritual leader
Ovadia Yosef to discuss the issue of unity government. Shas, the
third largest party in Israel, has been an indispensable ruling
partner either for the Labor or Likud party.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Primary school teachers in
Angola's Luanda Province decided here today to continue their
strike launched one month ago until the government meets their
demands.
</P>
<P>
The trade union of teachers in the province, when making the
decision, said it is still willing to negotiate with Education
Minister Antonio Burity on how to solve the troubles the teachers
face.
</P>
<P>
The teachers demand the government pay their long-term unpaid
wages, set their lowest wage level at about 250 U.S. Dollars and
approve an agenda of teaching as a special profession.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Antonio criticized the teachers strike in his speech
to reporters, describing the strike as disobedience.
</P>
<P>
Since their wages have been behind in payment for a long time,
the teachers in the region often hold strikes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Weakens Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended mostly
higher but fell against the yen today after Japan's top currency
policy-maker said the yen is too weak and the senior U.S. trade
negotiator warned Japan to curb its growing surplus.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 125.75 yen, down from 126.09
yen Tuesday. The dollar cost 1.7283 marks, up from 1.7270. The
pound cost 1.6244 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6316 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that despite the dollar's retreat against the
yen, the basic forces pushing the dollar higher against the yen
remain in place -- higher interest rates in the U.S. and low
interest rates in Japan, which have attracted Japanese investment
flows into the United States.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also derived some strength from the fact that the
dollar and the pound in recent months reflect a correction from
earlier weakness and favorable economic conditions in the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday:
1.4715 Swiss francs, up from 1.4665; 5.8105 French francs, up from
5.8085; 1,701.00 Italian lire, up from 1,699.25; 1.3966 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.3965.

<HEADLINE> Nepal PM Calls for Consensus on Water Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand today called for consensus among Nepal's political parties
to work out a strategy for developing the country's vast water
resource.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national workshop on "Water Resources Strategy
Formulation" here, Chand said his government's commitment to water
resources development had been made public in its policy program
released recently.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue with the good work initiated in
the past, Chand said, referring to a Nepal-India treaty on the
development of a border river, which was ratified by Nepal's
parliament last September.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has formed a national steering committee
to formulate policies to properly utilize the country's abundant
water resources, the prime minister told the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The committee, with representatives from concerned ministries,
will complete its task of working out the country's strategy for
water resources development in two phases, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
It will finally come up with working policies for optimum water
resources development after formulating national objectives and
studying the projects launched in the past, they explained.

<HEADLINE> HK's Freedoms to Be Preserved: Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) is determined that Hong Kong's way
of life and the many freedoms that Hong Kong people now enjoy will
continue unchanged in the future, Tung Chee Hwa, HKSAR Chief
Executive, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the Prize Presentation Ceremony of the Hong Kong
Best Press Articles and Photographs of the Year Awards 1996, Tung
said that Hong Kong has enjoyed remarkable social stability, which
has been fundamental to the economic success of the territory over
the years.
</P>
<P>
"Stability is indeed the bedrock of prosperity. Having had
both (social stability and economic success) for a very long time,
it is easy to forget that, being a small and open economy, Hong
Kong is extremely vulnerable to external forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a community, we must ensure that there are sufficient
safeguards in our system to maintain law and order at all times,
and to react to unforeseen circumstances swiftly and effectively."
</P>
<P>
He said the HKSAR Office's proposals in the consultation
document on amendments to the Societies Ordinance and the Public
Order Ordinance were in compliance with the Basic Law and the
United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR).
</P>
<P>
He said the amendments to the two Ordinances, necessary to
avoid any legal vacuum arising on July 1, were not aimed at any
particular individuals, groups or organizations, adding that the
objective was to find a point of balance between individual rights
and social order.
</P>
<P>
On the amendments for the Societies Ordinance, he said, "In the
interest of six million Hong Kong people I think we cannot allow
foreign interference with Hong Kong's political development.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, nearly every Government in the world has some kind of
legislation or another to prohibit foreign interference in
domestic affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Based on this broad principle, proposals were devised to
prohibit political organizations in Hong Kong from establishing
ties with those in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Public Order Ordinance, Tung said that the
consideration was for every citizen to enjoy the highest degree of
rights and freedoms while maintaining basic public order.
</P>
<P>
"The key question here for the community to debate is: What is
more important to the community: social order or rights of the
individual?" Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in the interests of the community as a whole,
appropriate management of demonstrations is to find the right
point of balance between the rights of the individual and social
order," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that peaceful and lawful demonstrations can
continue. I see public demonstrations as a way for people to
express their views and now public demonstrations are a part of
Hong Kong's culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said many Western countries would not give up control over
public order and the majority of cities in North America,
including Washington, New York, Vancouver and Toronto, have permit
systems for demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that concerns had been expressed about the introduction
of the concept of "national security" without a comprehensive
explanation, Tung pointed out that the term existed in the Bill of
Rights Ordinance Sections 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
"This term, along with others in the same section, is exactly
the same as those contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the ICCPR.
Therefore this is not a brand new concept to Hong Kong," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Calls for Overall Rehabilitation in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini has stressed that emergency humanitarian aid to Albania must
be accompanied by an initiative for an overall rehabilitation of
the country's economic and financial system, papers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Italy plans to convene an international conference as soon as
possible on achieving stability in Albania, Dini told a joint
meeting of the Senate foreign affairs and defense committees on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
International financial institutions including the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and
the Albanian authorities will be invited to attend the conference,
said Dini.
</P>
<P>
A U.N.-authorized multinational protection force led by Italy,
started being deployed in Albania on April 14 to protect
aid supplies to the crisis-hit country.
</P>
<P>
Albania descended into chaos in early March when protests
triggered by the collapse of pyramid-investment schemes, in which
thousands of people lost their life savings, mushroomed across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent after armed rebels looted army
depots and took over several towns in the south.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 refugees fled the country in March and the
Albanian government has called for international aid and military
intervention to help the new government of national reconciliation
restore order in the country and prepare for general elections in
June.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Calls for Preventing Resort to Arms in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Carl Bildt, the High
Representative in charge of Dayton accords implementation,
recommends that three course of actions, namely attempt to use
force, secession and ethnic domination, should be blocked in order
to stablize the Bosnian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation came in a report that Bildt will send to UN
security council late this month, Colum Murphy, spokesman for
Bildt said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While the presence of Nato-led peace-keeping prevents any of
the ethnic groups from pursuing military means, it is the opinion
of the High Representative that the message should be sent that
international community will not tolerate any attempt to resort to
military force in the period after Nato troops pull out, Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that there was a "creeping secession" as
demonstrated by Bosnian Serbs and Croats in forging "parallel
relations" with neighboring countries, while the tendency of
ethnic domination was still shown by Muslims who had not
dismantled the old state structures as required by the Dayton
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Murphy quoted Bildt as saying that the continued political
influence wielded by persons indicted for war crimes in the
Republica Srpska "taints the personalities and institutions" of
the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
Because of his tolerance of Radovan Karadzic, the former Serb
leader indicted for war crimes by an international court in the
Hague, the international organizations should limit their contacts
with Momcilo Krajisnik "to the essential business related to his
function as a member of the presidency," Bildt said in his report.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also recommended that except for humanitarian aid or for
election purpose, international assistance be cut off to the Serb
municipalities of Bosanski Samac and Foca where war crime
indictees continue to hold public office or exercise de facto
influence.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report, Bildt "regrets to say that he sees no
fundamental change" in stopping the trend towards ethnic
separation, since any attempt of large-scale return of refugees
has met with "fierce resistance ranging from violent to
bureaucratic".
</P>
<P>
But the report stressed the importance of economic recovery as
conditions for return of refugees, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
"We can not expect refugees to return easily, if they see a
country in economic and social despair, so the two in our view are
very closely linked," he said.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Liu Shan-chung, the Taiwanese who
hijacked a Far Eastern Airlines plane from Taiwan to Xiamen on

</P>
<P>
The ARATS informed the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation
of this decision by letter this morning.

The letter said that the relevant department has finished
necessary investigations of hijacker Liu Shan-chung in the
hijacking incident on March 10. He will be repatriated according
to the "Quemoy Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Specific matter related to the repatriation will be handled by
the Red Cross organizations across the Taiwan Straits," it said.
</P>
<P>
The letter also asked the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation to
tell the relevant side in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qu Zhe, vice-president of the Red Cross Society of China, said
in his letter this morning to the Secretary-General of the Taiwan
Red Cross organization today that the Red Cross Society of the
Fujian Province will be responsible for liaison and witness of the
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The letter expressed the hope that the Taiwan Red Cross will
coordinate with the relevant departments to do this work in a
proper way.
</P>
<P>

Red Cross organizations across the Taiwan Straits have become
involved in witnessing and repatriating 70 criminal suspects and
offenders including the forthcoming repatriation of Liu.

Director-General Renato Ruggiero said today.
</P>
<P>
"China is the world's sixth largest exporter and seventh

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A compact disc company parented
by the State Development and Investment Corporation and Shenzhen
Xianke Group opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Xianke Compact Disc Co. Ltd., based on Shenzhen

the capability of producing eight million DVDs a year.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to finish developing DVD-R, a
high-density memory disc, in the near future, which would be a
breakthrough in accelerating China's CD industry.
</P>
<P>
Attached to the State Council, the State Development and
Investment Corporation is a wholly state-owned agency with a

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Trade Gain Moderately in February </HEADLINE>

<P>
OTTAWA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A modest increase in exports
helped boost Canada's trade surplus to 1.6 billion dollars in
February from 1.4 billion in January, the country's statistics
agency said today.
</P>
<P>
But the trade surplus remained below its average level for 1996
after a sharp fall last October, Statistics Canada said. The
agency did not say how much the average surplus was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports in February rose by 0.6 percent to 17 billion
U.S. dollars after a 2.8 percent rise in January. More machinery
and forestry products were sold abroad in the month while most
other products witnessed a decrease, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
In February, the country imported 15.4 billion dollars, almost
the same as in January.
</P>
<P>
"A drop in energy product purchases was all but offset by
continued strength in industrial goods and consumer imports," the
agency said.

<HEADLINE> China's Air Transport Expected to Have World's Highest Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's air transport is expected
to have the highest growth rate in the world, 10 percent annually,
over the next two decades, according to a recent report by Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
An Asia-Pacific market forecast by Airbus Industrie, one of the
world's leading aircraft manufacturers, shows that the number of
passengers in the Asia-Pacific region will have a year-on-year
growth of 6.4 percent on average from 1996-2016, while that for
the rest of the world market will be 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
By 2016, the total number of air passengers is expected to be
triple the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
The airline industry has been one of the fastest growing
sectors in China's economy since the country adopted its reform
and opening-up policies 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic averaged an annual increase of 16.3 percent from
1994 to 1996, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC). Last year, Chinese airlines carried 55.51 million
passengers, and had an overall transport volume of 8.05 billion
ton-km.
</P>
<P>
CAAC is looking for annual growth of 13 percent for the airline
industry by 2000, with 80 million passengers, and a transport
volume of 12 billion ton-km.
</P>
<P>
China's rapidly growing air transport market has created many
opportunities for the world's aircraft manufacturers. To have a
fleet of 1,000 planes by the year 2000, the country has brought in
about 30 foreign-made planes each year, and this year is expecting
38 planes.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Fire and Marine
Insurance Co. Ltd. opened an office in Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second office the company has opened in
China. Samsung opened its first office in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Jin-won You, chief representative of the Samsung Shanghai
office, said that the opening of the new office showed Samsung's
determination to explore the Chinese market. Samsung was confident
about its business in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd., which was
established in 1952 and joined the Samsung group in 1958, is the
largest property insurance company in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
The volume of business of Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance
Co. Ltd. reached three billion U.S. dollars last year. It has
become the number one insurance company in ROK by owning 23.5
percent of the whole market share.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. has a total asset
value of 3.73 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ROK enterprises usually invest in east China's Shandong
province and northeast China's three provinces due to geographical
and historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, ROK investments are flowing into all of east China
including Shanghai and south China. Provinces and cities
neighboring Shanghai all have big ROK investors. ROK financial
organizations are also attracted by the great market potential.
</P>
<P>
Currently four foreign insurance companies from the United
States, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland are authorized to do
business in China.

<HEADLINE> Irrigating Northwest China With Yarlung Water, Experts Propose (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
today suggested that China should divert water from southwest
China's Yarlung Zangbo River to irrigate arid northwest China 800
km away.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chuanyou, a well-known Chinese water resource expert, is
among the scientists who have advocated a plan to build a tunnel
for diverting water from the river to the northwestern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Yarlung Zangbo River, with a length of 2,057 km, is the river
with the biggest elevation in the world. It originates in
southwestern Tibet, travels eastwards through the Himalayas and
suddenly changes course southwards in southwestern Tibet, and then
flows out of China and eventually empties itself into the Bengal
Bay.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that the program is aimed at digging a
30-km-long tunnel between Doxong and Medog at the sudden turn of
the river to better use its varying drops, and constructing a
hydropower station that will double the gigantic water
control-cum-hydro power station currently being built at the Three
Gorges on the middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The station will also be used to divert 40 billion cu m of
water from the Yarlung Zangbo to irrigate the dry northwest China
and areas near the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Northwest consists of Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi provinces and
Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions, whose combined
area accounts for a half of China's total area, and is the
country's major reserve area for resources and agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a severe shortage of water, the region has long
remained backward in social and economic development, with its
gross domestic product (GDP) only accounting for seven percent of
the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Irrigating Northwest China With Yarlung Water, Experts Propose (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official with the State Planning Commission said that if
this program is implemented, the exploitation of resources in
northwest China and in the areas of the upper reaches of the
Yellow River will be greatly accelerated.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, high-efficiency oasis farming will help China
solve food shortages in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with trees being planted in more areas of the Loess
Plateau, a new page will be opened for China to realize a
strategic change in shifting its economic development focus from
eastern coastal areas to the resource-rich western areas,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has aroused wide attention in the scientific
community since it was raised three years ago. The Chinese Academy
of Sciences has organized several rounds of discussions among
experts; and the State Science and Technology Commission recently
decided to start feasibility research.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments have also vowed to provide research and
prospecting with primary financial support, while the business
community has also shown a strong interest in getting involved in
this project.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of different fields, including many overseas
scientists, have also shown a strong interest in the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yunkai, a researcher with the Water Control and
Hydroelectrical Power Research Institute of the Ministry of Water
Resources, said the proposed design is superior to the
western-route plan to divert water from southern areas of China to
northern areas, which is now widely acclaimed, judging from
factors such as the volume of water flow, and the combination of
hydroelectrical generation and water diversion into one.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chuanjun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
who is also an authority of geoeconomy in China, thought that the
plateau where the Yarlung Zangbo River is fed is a
sparsely-populated vast area and therefore, comparatively easier
to solve the resettlement work.
</P>
<P>
Wu also believed that the construction of a reservoir could
greatly improve the micro-climate of the river valley, and the
building of a large hydropower station will create favorable
conditions for the people of Tibet to make more money and become
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese academician also said discharging water into the
river course during the dry season and storing water during flood
time is also an important measure to combat drought that plagues
northern Asia and to fight against floods occurring at the lower
reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River -- Brahmaputra, Jamuna, and
the Ganges -- in India and Bangladesh before the river empties
into the Bengal Bay.
</P>
<P>
Geophysician Xu Zhonghuai said that it would cost a lot and
require the application of sophisticated technology to build such
a water diversion project on the "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
Xu, also a researcher with the State Bureau of Seismology,
suggested that departments conduct on-the-spot prospecting into
areas where the proposed water diversion tunnel might pass through
quickly, to materialize the design as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> HK Faces New Opportunity in Development: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to her
motherland will provide a new historical opportunity for its
economic development, said Ulanmulun, deputy director of Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar organized by the Hong Kong Industrial Districts
Industry and Commerce Associations Ltd., Ulanmulun said that apart
from the diligence and intelligence of the Hong Kong people, the
Chinese mainland is a positive factor for Hong Kong's success.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the 1980s, the reforms and opening up and
the rapid economic growth in the inland areas have boosted the
Hong Kong's prosperity and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong has served as a window for China and
introduced huge amounts of capital to the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, Hong Kong is also a major market
whereby the enterprises in the inland areas are making use of
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
About 90 China-funded enterprises or state-owned enterprises on
the mainland have listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which
has contributed to the enhancement of Hong Kong's status as a
financial center in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1995 the investment from the
China's inland areas to the non-manufacturing sectors in Hong Kong
reached 104.6 billion HK dollars, an increase of 13.2 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The inland areas have become the second largest investor in
Hong Kong, next only to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ulanmulun said that with Hong Kong's return to her motherland,
the economic exchanges between China's inland and Hong Kong will
be expanded and the economic development will have a rising
impact on Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong is no doubt benefiting from the economic
growth in the inland.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the implementation of the principle of "One
Country, Two Systems", Hong Kong will become more prosperous in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Senior Tibetan Official Meets US Ambassador to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
made great progess in eliminating illiteracy, and safeguarding
Tibetans' freedom of religious belief and other rights and
interests, said Danzim, a senior local leader.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with US Ambassador to China James Sasser here
today, Danzim, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said Tibet has
formulated provisions on learning, using, and developing the
Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
Danzim, also president of the Tibetan People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries, noted the provisions are in
line with the China's Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic
Minorities.
</P>
<P>
The laws stipulates that China fully guarantees the rights of
the ethnic minorities to inherit, use, and develop their own
languages.
</P>
<P>
Danzim said that under the guidance of the regional provisions,
primary and middle schools in Tibet give lessons in the Tibetan
language, and the official documents of the Regional Party
Committee and the government departments at all levels levels are
written in both the Tibetan and Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
Danzim said Tibetans account for 95 percent of the 2.38 million
people in Tibet. Half of Tibetans cannot read or write their own
language. In contrast to this, he added, the regional illiteracy
rate in 1959 was as high as 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Danzim noted, it proves impractical to teach only one
language in school. It is not in conformity with the reality of
Tibet, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion of a great number of school children's
parents, the regional government's decision to allow grade 1-3
boys and girls to be taught only in the Tibetan language will do
no good to their children's growth. Thus the regional government
has reversed its decision made in 1987. As a result, both Tibetan
and Chinese languages are being taught at school in the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has decided, after studying its present
situation, to reduce the illiteracy rate to 40 percent by the end
of this century, Danzim said.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said that since the time of Sun Yat San (1866-1925), the
US government has recognized that Tibet is an inseparable part of
China.
</P>
<P>
At Sasser's request to know the religious and human rights
conditions in Tibet, Danzim said that the ethnic culture of Tibet
enjoys special protection in the process of social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The Regional People's Congress, or legislature, has adopted
rules and regulations to protect the freedom of religious belief
in accordance with China's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and the West hold different views on
human rights due to their differences in ideology and values.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the most fundamental human rights should be
the rights to development and subsistence. We will consent and
actively push ahead everything that spurs economic growth,
improves the people's living standard, and helps the progress of
the Tibetan ethnic group," he said.
</P>
<P>
Danzim also briefed the guest about Tibet's achievements in
economic development with the assistance of the central government
and governments of other province-level areas in the country
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said that he will recommend American businesses and
enterprises to Tibet to explore cooperation possibilities.

<HEADLINE> Report: 118 Iranians Die of Iraqi Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 118 Iranian war
veterans wounded by Iraqi chemical attacks during the eight-year
Iranian-Iraqi war (1980-88) have died since 1991, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that thousands of Iranian war victims are
suffering from severe injuries sustained from the Iraqi chemical
warfare during the war.
</P>
<P>
The victims of Iraqi chemical attacks, who are on the second
day of their sit-in protest in front of the German Embassy, vowed
to continue their demonstrations until their demands for actions
against German officials and firms supplying chemical warfare
weapons to Iraq were met.
</P>
<P>
Iran accused 24 German companies of supplying chemical
weapons and technology to Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
The victims also condemned the ruling of the Berlin court on
April 10, which accused the Iranian top leaders of involvement in
the political assassination of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin
in 1992, and demanded an official German apology to Iran and to
Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran-Germany ties strained after the announcement of the
verdict of the Berlin court last Thursday which triggered off
widespread demonstration against Germany over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Sohrab-Pur, head of the Center for Victims of Chemical
Warfare, said that his center has so far obtained medical
records of 60,000 out of an estimated 100,000 chemically wounded
people.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, 1,500 of such people living in various
parts of the country need constant medication.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those behind such crimes have been
identified and that the center holds a list of German companies
that supplied Iraq with chemical agents for use against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that his center has already cooperated with German
medical centers for treatment of Iranian chemically wounded
combatants.

<HEADLINE> CCB Reforms Managerial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
has taken a further step towards commercialization by regulating
the power limits for presidents of its branches at the provincial
level, to reform its outdated managerial system.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qishan, president of CCB, granted authorization
certificates to 45 presidents of the bank's provincial branches
today, which give a detailed explanation about their power in
business operations and personnel managment.
</P>
<P>
"Financial risks are increasing for commercial banks now, and
only an effective managerial system can prevent such risks from
happening," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Law on Commercial Banks, the branch banks
have no status of being a legal person, and can only operate with
the authorization by its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The authorization system will change the management methods of
the CCB," Wang said, adding that one of the measures for the bank
is to meet the requirements as set by the Laws on Commercial Banks.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, presidents of branch banks can only use
the power within the authorization certificates, and the branch
banks are forbidden to do any illegal businesses.
</P>
<P>
CCB will also keep a close watch on the performance of each of
its branches every year on the basis of authorization, and the
certificates will remain valid for a year.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Regional Summit Eases Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALLAM, April 17 (Xinhua)-- The leaders of the Great
Lakes region have agreed to ease sanctions against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued in Arusha, Northern Tanzania,
yesterday at the end of a one-day summit on the Burundi crisis,
said that the sanctions have been lifted on food, agricultural
products, educational materials, medicine and constuction
materials.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the partial lifting of the embargo is
aimed at alleviating the suffering of the common people in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It said the move would help expedite and ensure an
uninterrupted flow of human assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the communique said that the summit has appealed to
African nations and other countries in the world to exert full
political, economic and diplomatic presure on all factions in
Burundi for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"Such presure should include an arms embargo, as well as the
denial of visas to those who are deemed to obstruct the peace
process," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the summit stressed that
protagonists should not be armed by any party.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit called on the government of Burundi
and all other parties to the conflict to urgently take steps
towards creating an enabling environment for megotiations and
national reconciliation to take place.
</P>
<P>
The summit urged the Burundi government to disband the
"regroupment" camps and let the people resume their normal
activities without any hindrance.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit declared its readiness to suspend all
sanctions with the exception of the arms embargo once there was
progress towards a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit expressed its gratitude to President
Benjamin Mkapa and Tanzania for hosting the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by presidents Daniel Arap Moi of
Kenya, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Rwandan Premier
Celestin Hwigyema.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Secretary-General, Salim A Salim, and the
international mediator on Burundi, former Tanazanian President
Julius Nyerere also attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
All heads of state left for their respective home yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Burundi leader Major Pierre Buyoya also attended the summit
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the leaders at the summit, President Mkapa said,
"Sanctions were imposed only as a tool for a specific purpose.
Sanctions were only intended to open the ears, eyes and minds of
all stakeholders in Burundi to avoid the path of mutual
annihilation."
</P>
<P>
Regional leaders imposed sanctions on landlocked Burundi on
July 31 last year, demanding Buyoya return the country to
constitutional rule and open unconditional talks with rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, Buyoya has said he is ready for
unconditional talks but has not begun them. Negotiations are
opposed by hardline members of the Tutsi-dominated army and
former military ruler Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. enditem

results.
</P>
<P>

meeting between leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated that he will soon pay a state visit to Russia
at the invitation of President Yeltsin, and described their summit
as the first summit between the two nations since they decided to
establish a strategic cooperative partnership moving toward the
21st century based on equality and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
"I will discuss mainly with President Yeltsin ways to promote
the strategic cooperative partnership between our two countries,
and confer on current international situation and international
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, they will sign an important political
document to expound in detail the two countries' common ideas and
propositions on the development of the world order.
</P>
<P>
Another important highlight of his visit will be that state
leaders of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan
will sign an agreement on disarmament along the boundary line,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the agreement will be of profound significance
to the good-neighborly relations between China and the four
countries as well as the peace and stability along the boundary
line, which extends more than 7,000 km.
</P>
<P>
"The coming summit will be of great practical significance, no

promotion of world multi-polarization or establishment of a
peaceful, stable, just and rational new world order," Jiang noted.

and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Both countries advocate the abandoning of "Cold War Thinking"
and the establishment of a new security concept that will have
universal significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
To realize good-neighborliness, equality and mutual trust,
mutually-beneficial cooperation and common development conforms to
the foundamental and long-term interests of the two countries and
their people, the president added.
</P>
<P>
It also constitutes a concrete move in promoting the new world
situation to comply with the developing trend and demand of the
world situation and international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, proceeding from their historic responsibility
to ensure world peace, development and the future of mankind,
dedicate themselves to maintaining friendly ties with all other
countries and cooperating equally, with an effort to contribute to
the reinforcement of the world's lasting peace and the common
progress of the mankind.

<HEADLINE> Phase Two of NARP Launched in Kenya  (By Wang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
launched the phase two of the National Agricultural Research
Program (NARP II) in a bid to foster food security, poverty
reduction and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Launching the NARP II at a two-day workshop here today, Wamatu
Njoroge, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Research,
Technical Training and Technology, said that the program is aimed
at increasing livestock and crop productivity.
</P>
<P>
During the NARP II, he noted, the program will put stress on
the development of technologies which take into account
indigenous knowledge and are oriented towards small holder
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official pointed out that agriculture still remains
the largest sector of Kenya's economy and small holder
agriculture is the dominant mode of production.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the five-year NARP II would greatly boost
agricultural production with the improved technology which is
geared towards enabling farmers to raise the yields of their
crops.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, the Director of Kenya
Agriculture Research Institute (KARI), Cyrus Nderitu, said that
KARI would stress its research emphasis on food crops such as
wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, root and tuber crops.
</P>
<P>
"KARI will focus on making improved varieties available and
develop superior, location-specific and cost-effective cultural
management practices," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Njoroge stressed the importance of
research, saying that research is the backbone of development in
any nation.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Kenyan government to increase investment in
research from the current level of 0.5 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) to two percent within next five years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he asked the KARI to enhance its internal
revenue generation to support its research operations in order to
avoid over-dependence on the government and donors.
</P>
<P>
Njoroge challenged KARI to ensure that in the next five years
it raises its internal revenue from the current five percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
NARP II will focus on development and transfer of technology
to increase production and incomes of Kenyan small holder farmers
while HARP I which was completed in 1996 was centered on KARI's
infrastructure and developing research planning and management
systems.
</P>
<P>
The NARP is being financed by the Kenyan government and
financial institutions of the U.S., Britain, the Netherlands,
the European Union and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's agriculture sector employs about 70 percent of its
labour force and contributes some 25 percent of the country's
GDP. Agriculture also contributes indirectly to about 30 percent
of the GDP through the manufacturing and service sectors, and
about two-thirds of industrial output is from agriculture-based
industries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Sino-Russian Ties (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On significance of bilateral cooperation in the fields of
science, education and culture, Jiang said, both Chinese and
Russian people have made great contributions to the civilization
of mankind by creating brilliant cultures with their diligence and
wisdom and, in recent years they have made great progress on the
bilateral cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation has created good conditions for the formation
of the strategic partnership between the two countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, President Jiang held that the two countries will
strengthen and expand the scientific, educational and cultural
cooperation in an effort to ensure their long-term friendship,
deepen the traditional friendship of the two peoples and their
understanding of each other's national conditions, and also enrich
the substantial contents of the strategic partnership of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the "China Threat" theory that have been spread by
certain people in the West, Jiang said that some people are not
pleased to see a strong China and have been making uproars for
imposing "containment" on China.
</P>
<P>
The true motive of those who spread such a theory is to sow
dissension among China and its neighbors in a vain attempt to
block its development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 1.2 billion, China is the largest
developing country in the world, Jiang said. Owing to its weak
economic foundation, it requires the arduous efforts of several
generations to turn itself into a middle-developed country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Since China is committed to advancing its economy and improving
the living standard of its people, he said, it needs a long-term,
stable international environment of peace, its good neighboring
environment in particular.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he added, China will unswervingly keep to the
independent foreign policy of peace by striving to pursue its
friendly cooperation with various countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China opposes hegemonism and power politics, and
will never seek hegemony and expansion since this is the country's
unshakable policy. And this policy will remain unchanged even when
China's economy is developed in the future.
</P>
<P>
China's stability and prosperity will pose no threat to any
country, and a developed China will contribute still more and
greater to peace and prosperity in the world, President Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> First Municipal Elections Law Drafted in Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- As the first Gulf state to
hold municipal elections, Qatar has drafted an election law to
develop "grassroot democracy" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The municipal elections are to be the first that have ever been
conducted in Qatar and unprecedented one in the political history
of the oil-rich Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by the Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalif al
Thani last year as a first step to enlist public support and
develop "grossroot democracy in the Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
"A draft law organizing municipalities and the elections is
ready and it will be submitted soon to the cabinet and advisory
council for discussion and approval," Gulf News, a daily newspaper
of the United Arab Emirates quoted today Qatari Minister of
Justice Najib bin Mohammed al-Nuaimi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a lecture on "Municipal Elections in Qatar" held
in the Qatari capital Doha Wednesday, the minister said all
Qatari citizens, including women, above 18 years will be allowed
to vote in the elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the drafted law, 21 seats of the 28-member
Central Municipal Council will be filled through the elections
while the other seven will be nominated.
</P>
<P>
"The Emir wanted all members to be elected. But after several
discussions and going by the experience of other states it was
proposed that one-fourth of the council members to be
nominated," the newspaper quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The tenture of the elected council will be for three years
and during the period the advantages and disadvantages in its
running of the country will be examined through elections, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minimum age for candidates contesting the elections has
been proposed at 25, according to the justice minister.
</P>
<P>
"A proposal is also being discussed to allow women to contest
the elections", al Nuaimi said.
</P>
<P>
Army and police personnel would not be allowed to participate
in the vote, the minister added. But he gave no reason for the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Qatar has been reportedly taking measures
that may bring about some changes to the country's political
life.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari cabinet dissolved the Ministry of Information in
June, 1996, to give the media in the country greater autonomy,
which was regarded as an unusual move in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Following the dissolution, the Qatari emir appointed his
half-brother Sheikh Abdullah Ben Khalifa al Thani the prime
minister in October last year. It is the first time in the
Qatari history for the emir to relinquish his premiership and
appoint someone else to replace him.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old emir assumed power of the country after
ousting his father Khalifa Bin Hamad al Thani in a bloodless
palace coup in June, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Backs Corridor Linking Europe, Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu has supported the idea of turning Romania into a
corridor linking East and West Europe with Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The president, said an official ROMPRES news agency report
today, discussed the proposal raised by Transport Minister Traian
Basescu in a meeting with his advisors late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Romania will propose to Central and West European countries to
open up an economic corridor for transport between former Soviet
republics and Europe, Constantinescu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The corridor, to start from Kazakhstan, go through Azerbaijan,
Georgia and the Black Sea, and end up at the Romanian port of
Constanta, is expected to boost economic exchanges between Europe
and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
With its opening, the ROMPRES report said, crude oil and cotton
from Central Asia could be shipped directly to West Europe.
</P>
<P>
As part of Romania's initiative, Basescu told reporters on
April 11, after a meeting in Georgia with his counterparts from
countries in the region, that there will be regular shipping
liners between Constanta and the Georgian port of Poti.

<HEADLINE> Grottos Near Dunhuang to Be Open in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Yulin Grottos, neighboring the
world-famous Dunhuang Grottos in northwest China's Gansu Province,
will be open to the public in July.
</P>
<P>
The grottos are located in the Yulin valley, 76 kilometers to
the south of Anxi County, which is about 100 km to the northeast
of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43 caves on cliffs along the valley contain 259
colored statues and some 4,200 square meters of wall paintings,
which represent Buddhism, farming, wine-making, iron forging, and
images of birds and plants, according to researchers of Yulin
Grottos.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the grottos, now under the state protection, dated
back to the Sui Dynasties (581-618), the Tang (618-907), the Song
(960-1279), the Western Xia (1038-1227), and the Yuan (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The shape of the caves and contents and artistic styles of the
wall paintings in Yulin showed that Yulin Grottos have a very
close link with the art of Dunhuang Grottos.
</P>
<P>
Research of Yulin Grottos will be an important part of Dunhuang
research, which is popular in domestic and overseas academic
circles at present.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Grottos, built from the 6th to the 14th century,
include some 2,000 colored statues and more than 40,000 sq.m. of
wall paintings. The Dunhuang Grottos are on the World Heritage
List.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly lower against the U.S. dollar today, closing at 77.26
U.S. cents, down from 77.57 cents previously.
</P>
<P>
Since March this year, the majority of analysts had thought
that Australia was at the end of the rate cut cycle and that the
next move in official interest rates would be up sometime between
late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
But a much weaker-than-expected employment growth shown in data
published last week had some re-float the idea that an easing in
1997 could be in the cards.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the local unit ended at 96.64, down from
97.80 against the Japanese yen and at 1.3290, down from 1.3398
against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Negotiation, or Separatism in Name of Negotiation? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A commentator's article released
by Xinhua today repudiated the Dalai Lama's remarks over recent
years which encourage separatism under the guise of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the article:
</P>
<P>
The exiled Dalai Lama has claimed repeatedly in recent years
that he wants to negotiate with the Chinese central government,
which is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama has proposed conducting "negotiations" with the
central government off and on for the past decade along with the
changes of the international climate. Especially in recent years,
he has widely spread his claims and made efforts to blame the
central government for not having conducted negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is a need to clarify facts and expose the
Dalai Lama's political trickery, which encourages divisiveness
under the guise of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In September of 1987 and June of 1988, the Dalai Lama proposed
a "Five-Point Plan" at a meeting of the Human Rights Sub-committee
of the US House of Representatives, and "New Proposals" at a press
conference at the European Parliament building in Strasbourg,
France.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, he claimed to hold negotiations with the
central government based on the "Five-Point Plan" and the "New
Proposals."
</P>
<P>
The central government pointed out that the "Five-Point Plan"
and the "New Proposals" in fact advocated "Independence of Tibet"
and the notion that "Tibet was an independent country in history."
</P>
<P>
The essence of the Dalai Lama's position was the denial of the
fact that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory and that the
Chinese government has full sovereignty over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the central government announced the
following principles:
</P>
<P>
First, it welcomes the Dalai Lama and his representatives to
negotiate with the central government at any time, but that the
government will not receive the delegation sent in the name of the
"Kasha Government", because the central government has never
recognized that "Government", which is in exile;
</P>
<P>
Second, because the Dalai Lama's "Five-Point Plan" and the "New
Proposals" do not renounce "Independence of Tibet," they can not
be regarded as a basis for negotiations;
</P>
<P>
Third, the central government wants to have a direct dialogue
with the Dalai Lama, and the talks could be held either in Beijing
or in Hong Kong, or at any Chinese embassy or consulate. If the
Dalai Lama finds any of these places inconvenient, he can choose
another venue, as long as foreigners are excluded from the
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Negotiation, or Separatism in Name of Negotiation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Central Government announced that the time and place
of negotiations would be chosen by the Dalai Lama, he and his
followers soon put a notice in a newspaper saying that they would
negotiate with the Central Government in Geneva in January of 1989.
</P>
<P>
But the Central Government did not receive any formal
notification until after the news was printed, and the connection
between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama was not cut then
and had been maintained ever since it was formed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
If the Dalai Lama was sincere about holding the talks, why
didn't he convey this information and make arrangements through
proper channels? His actions could not help causing people to
doubt him and to wonder whether he really wanted to participate in
the talks or just to use the call for negotiations as a publicity
stunt.
</P>
<P>
When the Tenth Panchen Lama passed away in early 1989, the
Buddhist Association of China invited the Dalai Lama to return to
China to attend funeral services, and its President Zhao Puchu
handed over in person a letter of invitation to the representative
of the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
The invitation dealt solely with religious affairs. But the
Dalai Lama, if he had truly been sincere about holding talks,
could have taken the opportunity to contact Central Government
representatives. But he refused the invitation.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1988 and again in March of 1989, riots broke out in
Lhasa, instigated by a small group of separatists. Evidences show
that the Dalai Lama's "government in exile" not only provided
financial support to the separatists, but also sent people to
plan, organize, and participate in the riots that aimed at
splitting the motherland.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A former Australian
heavyweight champion was found dead in his New Mexico home while
his death reason is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The body of Craig Petersen was discovered Tuesday and it has
been sent to the medical examiner in Albuquerque, United States.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of foul play.
</P>
<P>
Born in New Zealand, Petersen grew up in Brisbane,
Australia. He collected a professional record of 22-6 with one
draw. His last fight was on January 28 at Auburn Hills, United
States. He was stopped in the sixth round by unbeaten Chris Byrd.
</P>
<P>
The tough Australian once was thrown into the prison after a
barroom fight with an off-duty police officer in Australia. He
also had problems with alcohol.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a wave of anti-Chin sentiment abroad from the
late 1980s to the early 1990s, the Dalai Lama went hither and
thither to ask Western countries to apply pressure on the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
He also changed his attitude to the negotiation, saying that he
was not eager to negotiate with the central government because it
would "collapse" soon.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of China's domestic situation did not
follow his wishes and his prediction came to naught. Seeing
China's international status improving with its economic growth
and social stability, the Dalai Lama asked for renewed contacts
with the central government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese departments concerned received two visits paid by his
private representative in 1992 and in 1993, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Before the negotiations, the representative promised not to
make the negotiation contents public. Later, however, the
representative not only released the negotiation contents, but
also wantonly distorted the contents in an attempt to mislead the
public.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1993, the Dalai Lama unilaterally
announced his decision to discontinue all contacts with the
central government, closing the door to contacts and negotiations
by his own hands.
</P>
<P>
On the question of negotiations requested by Dalai, the Chinese
government has reiterated repeatedly that it may negotiate with
him and has welcomed him to end his exile and return to the
motherland at an early date to do things beneficial to the Tibetan
people, provided that he completely abandons his notion of
"Tibetan Independence" and recognizes that Tibet is an inseparable
part of China, and ceases to engage in his activities to split the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The central government's principled stand and basic attitude
have always been consistent and explicit, and the Dalai Lama is
clear about them.
</P>
<P>
He should be held entirely responsible for the suspension of
the negotiations and fruitlessness in the two-sided contacts over
the past ten-plus years, because he has not abandoned his stand to
seek "Tibetan Independence" and or stopped his political
activities to split the motherland.

Roberto de Ocampo today lauded the economic contribution of the
Filipino-Chinese community to the country's economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino Chinese comprise only about two percent of the
total Philippine population, but they have an economic clout that
far exceeds their numerical might, de Ocampo said at a meeting
with the Filipino-Chinese business community.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the Filipino-Chinese community has become an
indispensable and integral part of the Philippine economy," he
said. "It is inconceivable how the Philippine economy would fare
without the Filipino-Chinese community."
</P>
<P>
Citing an Ateneo de Manila University study, he revealed that
as of 1990, 354 or 35.4 percent of the top 1,000 corporations in
the country were owned by Filipino-Chinese.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said the economic ascendancy of the Filipino-Chinese
is best exemplified by the rise of the so-called taipans, the most
successful of the lot, who have made huge interests in a wide
variety of businesses.
</P>
<P>
The government has recognized these pioneering entrepreneurs as
vital cogs of the economy and assigned them new projects that
would help the country become a newly industrialized economy by
the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance secretary also emphasized that the exemplary role
of the Filipino-Chinese community is needed in the globalization
of economies in order to successfully compete.

<HEADLINE> Negotiation, Or Separatism in Name of Negotiation? (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, Dalai has continued to move from one place to
another, reviving his claim that he wants to hold negotiations
with the central government, and that he is only asking for
autonomy for Tibet and does not stick to seeking Tibet
independence.
</P>
<P>
However, he has continued to distort the history of Tibet on
various public occasions and has attempted to create public opinions
for "Tibetan independence" by taking every opportunity to spread
the idea that "Tibet has always been an independent country since
ancient times."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Tibet has been an integral part of Chinese
territory since ancient times and became one of China's
administrative regions in the mid-13th century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 700 years, the central government has effectively
exercised sovereignty over Tibet. The Dalai Lama's title and his
religious and political status in Tibet were granted by the
central government. The 14th Dalai Lama, Danzin Gyaco, was
enthroned in the 1940s with the approval by the then central
government.
</P>
<P>
While claiming to ask for negotiations with the central
government, Dalai has continued to engage in activities abroad to
split the motherland. The Dalai Lama and his followers have never
stopped their propaganda and instigation to split the motherland
in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and have been held responsible
for stirring up acts of violence and terrorism, such as riots and
explosions in Lhasa and other places, and have plotted the
so-called "peace marches" and "referendums" abroad.
</P>
<P>
In their attempt to internationalize the so-called "Tibet
issue," they have asked for international forces to become
involved in the "Tibetan issue." Moreover, the Dalai Lama went to
Taiwan in late March in an open attempt at collusion with "Taiwan
independence" forces within the island of Taiwan, and plotted to
set up an office there for his "government-in-exile." His visit
was warmly received by politicians of the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion overseas has pointed out that, on the surface,
the Dalai Lama alleged that his visit to Taiwan was purely for
religious purposes, but his intention of seeking "Tibetan
independence" and attempt to break away from the Chinese
government were quite clear. He was involved in a number of covert
activities in this respect, in sharp contrast to his words.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion overseas has also revealed that one of Dalai's
former "government officials" asked Taiwan authorities to
officially abolish the "Commission on Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs," and "jointly pursue the ideal of independence" with
him.

<HEADLINE> Slower Growth Predicted for Savings Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The growth in savings deposits
are expected to drop by 7.4 percentage points this year compared
to last year, according to an analytic report by the State
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The center also estimated the total savings at 4702 billion
yuan this year, an increase of 886.9 billion yuan, or 22.5 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase rate stood at 29.9 percent last year over
1995.
</P>
<P>
The two interests rate cuts last year and the low
inflation-beating subsidy rate resulted in a drastic drop in the
savings, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
To play the nasty trick in negotiations, the Dalai Lama claims
that he is only asking for "autonomy," in an attempt to mislead
the public.
</P>
<P>
The system of regional autonomy for ethnic minorities has in
fact been in place in the Tibet Autonomous Region for more than 30
years. Under this system, the Tibetan people enjoy various rights,
which they never enjoyed in old Tibet under the Dalai Lama's rule.
</P>
<P>
The "autonomy" the Dalai Lama asks for can only be the rule by
him and other former serf owners, who followed him into exile, and
be, in their words, "realizing autonomy that will move in the
direction of independence."
</P>
<P>
It is also absurd for the Dalai Lama to ask for practicing
"one country, two systems" in Tibet. Does this mean the Tibet
should restore the old feudal serfdom, which dominated old
Tibet with a combination of religion and politics, and which was
abolished during the democratic reform in 1959?
</P>
<P>
It is odder still that the Dalai Lama flaunts him in pursuit of
"democracy" and "freedom" and claims that "democracy" and
"freedom" should be restored in Tibet. How could there have been
democracy and freedom in old Tibet, where the Dalai Lama, the
chief representative of the three categories of manorial lords,
the former Tibet local government and the monasteries and
nobility, exercised savage and dark rule by feudal serf owners?
</P>
<P>
The fact that Dalai Lama, who sets himself up as a defender of
"democracy" and "freedom," constitutes a gross mock at democracy
and freedom.
</P>
<P>
Facts gathered from his speech and from his acts show that the
Dalai Lama is insincere in his desire to negotiate with China's
central government. He does not show the slightest sincerity for
negotiation. That he claims that he wants to negotate with the
central government is a mere pretext to deceive the public opinion
and gain sympathy by cheating, and a nasty trick to escalate his
activities to split the motherland.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, Aprll 17 (Xinhua)-- Tanzanian Minister for
lndustries and Trade Villiam Shija, accompanied by fellow
ministers from SADC member states, left here on Wednesday for a
week's visit to the United States at the invitation of
the US Department of Commerce.

<P>
According to local press reports today, the visit was in
response to a similar visit to SADC countries by the US Secretary
of Commerce in February last year.
</P>

signed SADC trade protocol.
</P>
<P>

implementation of the North American Free Trade Area which is
composed of Mexico, USA and Canada. The SADC trade protocol
also aims at establlshing a free trade area in the SADC
region," said a statement issued here on Wednesady.
</P>
<P>
The second objective is to explore opportunities for expanded
trade between the two sides and at the same time discuss
potential investment interests in SADC countries by US
stakeholders, the statement emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the visit would also offer the
SADC ministers an opportunity to get first hand information of
the US goverment orientation of its commercial policy on Africa.
</P>
<P>

business community from SADC member countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Water-saving Irrigation Essential to Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official urged
agro-colleges and technicians to work out various forms of
water-saving irrigation techniques and machines for farmers in the
northern part of China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese vice-premier Li Lanqing raised the request in a letter
to a meeting on popularizing water-saving irrigation techniques
held this week by the Ministry of Agriculture in Chifeng, in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture planned to apply water-saving
irrigation technology in 50 million mu (about 3.3 million
hectares) of land in north China during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000). Mechanized dry farming technology will also be used
in 160 million mu (about 10.7 million hectares) of land, an
increase of 100 percent compared with the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that to popularize water-saving irrigation and dry
farming technology in dry north China will help promote sustained
development of China's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The average water resource per person in 16 northern provinces
was only about 300 cubic meters, meaning half of the country's
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are short of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Almost two thirds of China's arable land are located in areas
with annual rainfall of less than 600 millimeters. Grain yields of
these areas are low and unstable due to the shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important measure to make full use of limited water
resource to develop China's agriculture," said Li, who is also
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).

<HEADLINE> Japan's Upper House Passes Okinawa Land Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Councillors, or
the upper house of parliament, today adopted a government-proposed
bill allowing continued compulsory use of land by the U.S.
military in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The revised bill on land lease, already approved by the more
powerful House of Representatives, or the lower house of
parliament, became a law after it cleared the upper house.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to allow the central government to continue to
occupy land within U.S. bases in the island prefecture even after
lease contracts expire on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed amid strong protest by some 200
demonstrators, including about 30 lawyers from Okinawa, Tokyo and
Osaka, who staged a sit-in outside the upper house building in
downtwon Tokyo, urging Juro Sito, president of the upper house, to
give careful consideration to the revised bill.
</P>
<P>
Members of the upper house's two large opposition groups,
Heiseikai and the Democratic Party of Japan (DJP), voted for the
bill, supporting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New
Party Sakigake, one of the LDP's two noncabinet allies.
</P>
<P>
Heiseikai is mainly composed of members of the largest
opposition party, the New Frontier Party (NFP).
</P>
<P>
However, members of the Social Democratic Party, the other
noncabinet ally of the LDP, and the Japanese Communist Party voted
against the bill while some 3,000 owners of the land now occupied
by 12 U.S. bases were opposed to renewing the lease.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the bill will further a gap between the central
government and Okinawa's local government.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is home to 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities
in Japan, as more than 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are stationed
there.

<HEADLINE> India to Use Fish to Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A kind of fish, which eats
mosquito larvae, has been used to control malaria in experiments
in India, V. P. Sharma, director of India's Malaria Research
Center (MRC), said.
</P>
<P>
The MRC, which functions under the Indian Council of Medical
Research, initially started a project on integrated control of
malaria in Gujarat in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Its success led to extension of the project, subsequently, to
more than 12 locations across the country, according to the Press
Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
Sharma said scientists from the center have been able to reduce
malaria incidence dramatically in areas where the project was
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Cases of malaria have dropped by 80 percent in 152 villages
(population 55,000) in Hassan District of Karnataka State within
one year of introducing the larvae-eating fish, Sharma said.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Invokes Memory of Qana Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid today urged Arab countries to unite behind
Lebanon's struggle against the Israeli occupation on the eve of
the first anniversary of an Israeli air raid in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"April 18 must be observed as an Arab Day of Solidarity with
the Lebanese people in its struggle to restore its lands," said
Meguid in a speech to mark the 1996 Qana carnage.
</P>
<P>
About 100 men, women and children were killed on April 18,
1996 when Israeli gunners shelled a U.N. camp in Qana, south
Lebanon where 400 villagers had sought shelter.
</P>
<P>
The incident is the most serious one between the two countries
since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Meguid urged the U.N. Security Council to force Israel to
implement its resolutions, especially those related to the
Arab-Israeli conflict and to the Palestinian cause, namely
resolutions 242, 338 and 425.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United States, the main Mideast peace
sponsor, the European Union, Russia, China and Japan to face up
to the Israeli measures which "aim at clamping a fait accompli by
military force in the occupied Arab lands" something which
threatens Arab security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Meguid today sent cables to Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Speaker of the Parliament Nabih
Berri, expressing the AL's full support for Lebanon in its
legitimate rights to restore all of its lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel, seeking an end to cross-border attacks on northern
Israel by the fundamentalist guerrilla of Hezbollah, wants a
peace agreement with Lebanon and Syria, which will give it
accords with all its immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon and Syria have put the return of all Lebanese
territory and the Golan Heights Israel has occupied as the
prerequisite of peace deal with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> China to Sponsor Water Resources Art Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Water
Resources, with its 1.6 million workers, will soon start its art
festival, believing that cultural development also helps harness
rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The festival, the second in three years, will include contests
of singing, dancing, calligraphy, drawing, drama, and literature.
</P>
<P>
Most of the contests will be held on the major construction
sites on the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Liaohe and Huaihe
rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project on the Yangtze, and the Wanjiazhai and
Xiaolangdi water conservation projects on the Yellow River will be
the key performing stages during the festival, which lasts from
late April to November.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Li Changfan, an official of the ministry
in a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the art festival will be held at a time when
several major historical events are to take place in the country,
which include the resumption of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong
and the convocation of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The events will make the harnessing of the rivers and lakes the
paramount task to the ministry, he said, and the ministry is
trying hard to ensure that "no big problems will crop up."
</P>
<P>
The official said that China expects more rainfall this year in
southern China, which straddles the Yangtze and the Huaihe rivers,
and that the ministry starts implementing flood control measures
earlier than last year.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, all major leaders of our ministry are in the
localities to inspect the implementation of such measures," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Cities to Ban Leaded Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Major Chinese cities will
introduce the use of unleaded auto gasoline by the year 2000 in an
effort to reduce air pollution caused by auto emission, according
to a report in today's "China Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
The cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen
will take the lead in fulfilling this goal in the next year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of the number of motor vehicles and wide use of
leaded gas have led to severe air pollution in Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of the lead content in the air over Beijing is
discharged by some 1.1 million autos in the city, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou-based "Yangcheng Evening News" recently said that
900,000 motor vehicles in this metropolis of south China used one
million tons of leaded gasoline annually.
</P>
<P>
Lead containing in auto emission exhaust is blamed as one of
the major "criminals" doing injury to urban residents' health.
</P>
<P>
Inhalation of Lead-rich emission can cause high level of lead
content in blood, which is very harmful to the human body,
particularly to pregnant women and newly-borns, said Yu Xiaoxuan,
deputy director of the Beijing Bureau of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has announced that about 300 gas stations in
Beijing's eight urban districts will have to sell lead-free
gasoline up to July 1. Unleaded gas will be used all across the
city by January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection authority in Guangzhou also
decided to take the same measure in October, said the report of
Yangcheng Evening News.

from hunger. There is hardly any food in the (rebels) bases and
we were just starving."
</P>
<P>
International relief non-governmental organisations have
rushed in food supplies to Magburaka, a dusty junction town by
road and air, to prevent what one official called ''a pending
human disaster''.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some rebels are surrendring to tribal chiefs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sierra Leone Red Cross, ''the surrender is
almost on a daily basis ''.
</P>
<P>
Twentyseven rebels surrendered on Tuesday in the villages of
Mayopoh, Mayombo and Macrugbe before they were taken to the Adams
hotel, a relief offcial, Sam Bockarie, said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are mainly coming from Kangari Hills, which
overlooks a strategic road linking the capital with the
diamond-rich fields of Kono in the east.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said those surrendering include not only
compatants but senior ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Protection of Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese State Council called
today for better protection of the country's cultural relics,
which are the invaluable heritage of a 5,000-year-old civilization.
</P>
<P>
It said that the number of crimes involving relics is growing,
that many museum pieces have been stolen, and that a number of
tombs have been illegally dug up, while smuggling of relics is
still running rampant.
</P>
<P>
"We must do a better job of balancing relics protection and
economic construction," it says, and that the country's policemen
need to crack down on relics crimes.
</P>
<P>
There should be better cooperation between the police, customs,
business, trade departments, and relics bureaus, it points out,
and the governments at all levels should play a major role in
protecting relics, with everybody in the community participating.
</P>
<P>
More laws should be drafted and governments at various levels
must observe the laws. The relation between excavations and
economic construction should be handled properly, and the
protection of historical sites should not add a burden to people
living nearby.
</P>
<P>
Construction projects can not proceed until they get approval
from relics departments, it says.
</P>
<P>
The country will allocate funds for protecting important relics
and historical sites which are at the verge of being damaged.
</P>
<P>
Profitable ventures must be avoided if they stand to damage
relics, and historical sites should be used as patriotic places,
it says.
</P>
<P>
The government should adopt measures to control the relics
market, including auctions, it says.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Peruvian Congress Leaders Hails Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Qiao Shi
said here today that he believes the current visit of the
president of the Peruvian Congress Victor Joyway Rojas will make
great contributions to developing the friendship between the
congresses of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between the two congresses leaders, Qiao said
he is pleased with the smooth parliamentary cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said despite of the long distance between China and Peru,
the two countries enjoy deep friendship. They should step up
exchanges and strengthen the friendly relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Joyway showed his admiration of China's growth, and said he
would bring back China's experience in developing the economy and
alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the reform and opening up program, Qiao
pointed out, China has achieved great development under the
guidance of the theory of "building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," which was initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said China has vast land and 1.2 billion people, and
therefore China's real modernization calls for the efforts of
several generations.
</P>
<P>
Joyway praised China's independent foreign policy of peace, and
congratulated on the approaching return of Hong Kong and Macao to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Peru sticks to the "one China" position, he stressed, and holds
that Taiwan is an unseparable part of the Chinese territory. He
said he hopes China will achieve national reunification at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
Joyway is here as guest of the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Euro-Med Cooperation Tides Over Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, MALTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The
European-Mediterranean cooperation partners have tided over a
political crisis threatening their ambitious cooperation scheme
during the just-concluded Malta conference.
</P>
<P>
After two-day harsh discussions, ministers from all the 27
Euro-Med cooperation members reached agreement to address the
thorny Middle East peace process in measured terms, leaving out
the criticism on hard-line policy contained in a draft final
document of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries had insisted that the final document should
include the faltering Middle East developments and Israel
objected.
</P>
<P>
The hot debate on the issue dominated the conference, which
the European Union (EU) had wanted to focus on the economic
dimension in Euro-Med cooperation, forcing a five-hour delay upon
the closing ceremony -- and without a final document.
</P>
<P>
Still, under the circumstance of an unfavorable Middle East
peace stalemate, the gathering of all the members together in
itself is great, many delegation heads said.
</P>
<P>
Another major achievement the EU boasts was the successful
bringing together of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy to a bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Levy meeting is the first direct political dialog
between the Palestinian National Authority and Israel since the
peace process came to the lowest ebb in its seven-year history a
month ago. Arab countries have suspended their normalization
process of relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
By brokering the meeting, observers here noted, the EU
added a point on its score board of advancing its "Focus-shift
Southwards" strategy aimed at counterbalancing United States'
influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Western analysts said a good opportunity has arrived for
Europe to seek a more active involvement in the Middle East
-- at a time when the United States gives bias to Israel
in mediation at the cost of losing Arab trust in it.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that Europe can play a complimentary role
to that of the United States (in Mideast mediation)," said a
grinning Hans Van Mierlo, foreign minister of EU rotary
president of the Netherlands, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the positive conclusion of the Malta
conference in itself is a contribution to the Middle East
process.
</P>
<P>
Many delegations, particularly from EU members, stressed common
interests in Euro-Med cooperation in attempt to boost the low
morale among some southern Mediterranean partners, who are
overwhelmed by fears of being robbed of benefits in cooperation.
Mierlo said the partners have to come together "for the sake
of the future of the two regions."
</P>
<P>
The delegates confirmed the progress achieved since their
first Barcelona conference in November 1995. Many called for
valuing the North-South type EU-Med cooperation and the
South-South type cooperation among Mediterranean countries themselves,
which are still fragile to various difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Maltese Prime Minister Alfred Sant said in his
closing speech that the Malta conference has demonstrated that
the Euro-Med Partnership is "an irreversible process" of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the Malta conference, the EU and Jordan initialed a
partnership-linked Association Agreement. This brings to eight the
number of countries which reached such accords with EU in
the Euro-Med cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The concept of Euro-Med partnership was initiated at the
Barcelona conference with an aim of establishing a free-trade
zone involving the two regions by the year 2010, a goal also
confirmed at the Malta conference.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that despite the political
achievement in Malta conference, the Euro-Med cooperation will be
shadowed by the Mideast Peace as long as it is there. The
existing huge political, economic and social disparities between
the EU countries and their Mediterranean neighbors are even more
a daily headache for them. Therefore, observers here said, the
road ahead for the EU-Med cooperation is rather long and
tough.
</P>
<P>
EU's 12 Mediterranean partners are Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey
and Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Record-breaking PATA Travel Mart Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- An international travel fair held
by the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) for the first time
in China is drawing a record number of participants who are
showing growing interest in Pacific Asia travel products and in
China as a destination.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures show that the 20th PATA Travel Mart,
officially opened today in China World Trade Center in Beijing
attracted 471 both holders and some 489 travel product buyers,
representing about 60 countries and regions, with a total of 1,650
delegates registered.
</P>
<P>
The figure surpassed the previous record set last year in
Pattaya, Thailand, which featured 452 exhibitors and 1,448
participants.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of this year's Mart comes from the broad-base
support from throughout the region, and shows the growing interest
in Pacific Asia travel products and the industry's interest in
China as a destination", commented Milton Cooke, PATA Director of
Marketing.
</P>
<P>
The China Host Committee has done an outstanding job in
incorporating the PATA event into the "Visit China 97"
celebration, Mr. Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
While it is the first PATA Mart to be held in China, it will
also be the final year the event changes venue each year, opting
for a permanent location at the Suntec Exhibition Center in
Singapore in 1998, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
"The consecutive record-setting Marts serve as a strong
build-up to the move to Singapore, which will allow us to
eventually double the existing size", Mr. Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
The China National Tourism Administration became an official
member of PATA, an influential non-government organization based
in San Francisco, in 1993, followed by 35 Chinese travel agencies,
hotels, and airlines.

<HEADLINE> 500 Ugandan Men Receive Vasectomy Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 Ugandan men have
received vasectomy operations, an expert said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Henry Kakande of the Mulago hospital estimated that some 200
men go into hospital for the operation every year, ''the Monitor''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kakande has carried out the operation for people without
propoganda.
</P>
<P>
Vasectomy as a family planning measure was introduced into Uganda
in the late 1980s. It involves cutting and blocking
the spermaducts so as to prevent men's seeds from being part of
the semen on ejaculation.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the men who have had the operations are
educated people, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Vasectomy is an almost free service in government hospitals.
Five government hospitals in Uganda provide such services, the
report said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Australia Wins Record Uranium Contract With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia's mining major WMC
Ltd. today clinched a record uranium contract in a 10-year deal to
supply Tokyo Electric Power Co. with 907 tons per year from 1999.
</P>
<P>
The contract was won on the strength of uranium production at
its massive Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine, which currently
produces 1,500 tons of uranium a year, but the output will rise to
more than 4,600 tons a year by 1999 when the expansion at the mine
is completed.
</P>
<P>
WMC Managing Director Hugh Morgan said in a statement that this
is the largest single contract ever for the Olympic Dam mine.
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists in Australia today hit out at the
federal government for approving the record uranium supply
contract with Tokyo after the cover-up of Japan's worst nuclear
accident last month.
</P>
<P>
West Australian Green Senator Dee Margetts said they were
surprised that radioactive leaks at an experimental converter
reactor in Japan went unreported and the country's worst nuclear
accident last month was covered up.

<HEADLINE> Arab Human Rights Group Blasts Israel's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (April) -- The Arab Organization of Human
Rights (AOHR) has renewed its warning that Israel's
"expansionist" policy and violation of human rights would
strangle the Mideast peace process and escalate instability.
</P>
<P>
The organization billed the construction of the Har Homa
Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem as a vital step that Israel
has taken to Judaize the holy city and create a fait accompli by
changing its geographical and demographical features.
</P>
<P>
"The end of the scheme is to turn the eastern and western
sectors of Jerusalem into a permanent capital of the Jewish
state," it noted in a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report described the Israeli decision to build the 6,500
Jewish homes on the edge of East Jerusalem as an "extremely
dangerous move" that preempts the Palestinian-Israeli final talks
to resolve such sensitive problems as Jerusalem and Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
"It will extinguish the Palestinian confidence in Israel's
true will for peace negotiations and cast doubt over the need to
continue talks on a final peace between the two sides," it warned.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed the Israeli practice might explode the
already-tense Mideast situation, aggravating violence and
renewing the 1980s' uprisings on the Palestinian occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
The AOHR denounced the Israeli settlement buildings on the
Palestinian land and the Judaization practices of Jerusalem,
saying that they not only violate the international law and U.N.
resolutions but also contradict Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace has plunged into its deepest crisis since
Israel started last month the Jewish housing construction, thus
stalling the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and sparking almost
daily clashes on the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Palestine want East Jerusalem, which Israel has captured and
later annexed, as its future capital. But Israel has insist that
the holy city be its "permanent and undivided capital."

</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Nigeria, Philipe Peltier, reportedly made

between it and Cameroun over the oil-rich peninsula, which both
countries claim as its own territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A cotton crisis is looming over
Mozambique as the local cotton processing companies refused to
purchase cotton at the minimum prices set by the government,
local paper "Noticias" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Henriques, an official of Lomaco Cotton Company, said
the government policy on cotton will bring about serious
consequences to cotton production as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It will not only suffocate cotton processing enterprises, but
will also discourage cotton farmers, many of whom might stop
growing cotton, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Henriques warned that if the lowest price of cotton set by the
government, 3,900 Meticais (about 0.35 U.S. Dollar) per kilogram
of raw cotton, is maintained this year, some cotton processing
plants will be forced to close down.
</P>
<P>
He said as the prices set by the government are much higher
than in the international market, Lomaco and other cotton
companies have decided to refused to buy cotton at the minimum
prices.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Mozambique Cotton Association and
cotton companies have made their proposals on cotton prices,
which have not been accepted by the government.

changes that have taken place in Lhasa since the liberation of the
region in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Losang told Sasser that Lhasa houses some 400,000 residents, 87
percent of which are of Tibetan nationality, and the others are
Han or any of several other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
At present, the urban construction coverage of the city has
reached 51 square kilometers, 17 times the size of 1959, he said,
and the Potala Palace, added to the World Heritage List by the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
is located in the city proper.
</P>
<P>
With more than 500 schools, colleges and universities, the city
has over 70,000 students, and 92.1 percent of the school-age
children are receiving education, according to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
On Lhasa's transportation and telecommunications, Losang Jamcan
said that the conditions in the sectors have witnessed
considerable progress, with both domestic and international direct
air flights connecting the city with Beijing, Chengdu, Kathmandu
and other big cities, and direct calls and facsimiles able to be
sent anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The mayor vowed to further consolidate the city's economic base
of agriculture and husbandry, and to reinforce transportation,
energy and infrastructure construction, with the goal of creating
a better living environment for its residents.
</P>
<P>
Losang noted that since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in
1951, Lhasa has undergone tremendous change, and at present the
city enjoys political stability, economic progress, unity among
nationalities, and its residents can live comfortably.
</P>
<P>
Residents here support the reform and opening up policy and
will build Lhasa into an advanced city with complete urban
facilities and a sound investment environment in a bid to lead the
whole region toward economic prosperity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tension Grows with 44 Dead in Nigerian Ethnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Tension heightened again in
Nigeria's southern oil city of Warri on Wednesday following
reports of the killing of 44 Ijaw people in the continuing
clashes between ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaw group alleged that 42 persons were killed when a town
in Delta State was torched by unknown people last Saturday, while
two others were murdered in the troubled area.
</P>
<P>
According to the group, about 80 attackers alighted from a
fast boat belonging to an oil company and another high-powered
boat on the Ikpokpo Jetty, armed with guns, cutlasses, bottles
and gallons of petrol with which they set the community ablaze.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws also alleged that the Itsekiri people of their rival
community had hatched a plan to wear police and army uniforms to
attack the Ijaw people in both Warri and the riverine areas.
</P>
<P>
They accused the oil company of supporting the Itsekiri people
in the attacks, claiming further that helicopters belonging to
the company hovered over Ijaw locations before the attack.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to the state and federal governments to prevail
on the Itsekiri people to desist from further provoking them.
</P>
<P>
The communal clash started about four weeks ago with the Ijaws
protesting against the movement of the headquarters of the
newly-elected local government council from where they live to
another area inhabited by Itsekiri people.
</P>
<P>
They held hostage more than 170 oil workers and traders,
forcing the closure of nine crude oil flow stations belonging to
international oil giants Shell and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
Some shops and civilian property were burnt down during
ensuing riot there.
</P>
<P>
Both the state and federal governments have been involved in
the settlement of the issue while soldiers from the navy and and
police were sent to restore security.
</P>
<P>
The measures eased the tension about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
So far no reports are available on what has been done to
settle the renewed communal clash, though Delta State
Administrator David Dungs has called on traditional rulers in the
state to assist in recovering all arms being held illegally by
citizens.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming summit between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
to be held in Moscow later this month will not only benefit the
people of both countries, but will be of world importance.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to China Igor A. Rogachev told Xinhua here
today that during Jiang's visit to Russia, the two sides are
expected to sign a political declaration signifying the evaluation
of the two countries toward the international situation and

Russia, together with China, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and
Tadzhikistan, will sign an agreement in Moscow on the reduction of

<P>
HANOI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hughes Electronics Corporation of
the United States is looking forward to selling satellites and
telecommunications systems to Vietnam on a long-term basis, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hughes hoped to help with Vietnam's plan for operating its own
telecommunications satellites by the turn of the century, Ted
Westerman, a vice president of the world's largest supplier of
small satellites, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a satellite, including fees for its installation,
launch and operation, should largely depend on Vietnam's needs but
would likely cost the same as the satellite bought by Indonesia
for about 100 million U.S. dollars, Westerman said.
</P>
<P>
Hughes has been working closely over the past three years with
its Vietnamese partners to help the country's infrastructure
development, he said, adding that the relationship has been very
"successfully" and is "still continuing."
</P>

"We are here for a long-term business involvement in Vietnam,"

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Clean drinking water is now
available to more than 48.5 million farmers in central China's
Hunan Province, or over 90 percent of the province's rural
population, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, the lack of sources of sanitary drinking
water posed a big problem in the province's rural areas. Many
farmers drank surface water directly from rivers, lakes and pools,
and in some southern and western mountainous areas people suffered
greatly from severe water shortages.
</P>
<P>
By 1985, some 60 percent of the farmers were still drinking
unclean water, according to statistics. As a result, the rate of
intestinal infectious disease and parasitosis remained alarmingly
high, with that of the dysentery coming to 2.2 per thousand and
that of the hepatitis 0.5 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
In a village in the province's southwestern part, 136 of the
148 families suffer from infectious hepatitis, sources say.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem and protect people's health, the province
earmarked one million yuan for a rural drinking water clean-up
project in 1985. Over the past decade, a total of 440 million yuan
from the government and enterprises has been spent in the work.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures also reveal that local farmers have
contributed some 700 million yuan to the project.

<HEADLINE> Gardeners Use Herbal Medicine to Treat Decaying Pine Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- From ancient times through the
present, traditional herbal medicine has been the cure of choice
in China for sick humans. Now, prescriptions are being given to
withering pine trees in the country's capital city.
</P>
<P>
Gardeners in an ancient temple in suburban Beijing have
successfully saved the lives of five pines, which each are more
than 1,300 years old, by using a mixture of herbal medicine,
according to a report in today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The leaves of the trees in western Beijing's Jietai Temple
turned yellow in recent years, due to decay caused by their
inability to absorb nutrition through their thin bark. The trees
suffered from "malnutrition," the report quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
To treat the trees, the gardeners hollowed out the dead wood
and stuffed the tree trunks with a preparation of 46 kinds of
herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
Ren Wenshu, head of the management office of the temple, told
the newspaper that the temple has applied for the patent right for
the prescription.
</P>
<P>
The gardeners also replaced most of the trees' bark with
manmade bark in order to prevent rainwater from seeping into the
tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
Ren said they will re-treat the insides of the trees every two
to three years.
</P>
<P>
Jietai Temple, built in the year 622, is one of Beijing's
famous tourist attractions because of its ancient unusual-shaped
pines.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has attacked the United
States administration for its alleged hostility, the Zambia Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
When meeting here on Wednesday with Arlene Render, U.S.
Ambassador to Zambia and Gerard Gallucci, visiting senior
official of the Sate Department, Zambian Minister Without
Portfolio Michael Sata said if the Zambian government was not
tactful, there could have been an uprising in his country
instigated by the United States through what he called
"undeclared sanctions".
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister accused the U.S. of being biased against
Zambia, saying that "you have treated us with utmost political
hostility for the past few years through your undeclared
sanctions which have led to reduced levels of aid to Zambia."
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. officials called on Sata to exchange views on
Zambia's current political situation and seek ways to improve
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials told Sata that the U.S. will not relent on
its demands for good governance.
</P>
<P>
Gallucci expressed his dissatisfaction at Zambia's
constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
Zambia held the general elections in November last year under
the changed constitution, which factually barred former president
Kenneth Kaunda from running for the presidency because his
parents are immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Farmers Change During Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- When Wu Cuidi, a villager in the
suburb of Shanghai, China's largest economic center, moved to
town, she tossed out all her old furniture and farm tools.
</P>
<P>
"Although they have been with me for decades, I have to do this
because the city lifestyle is different from that in the village,"
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of Shanghai's economy, the urbanization
of the city's neighboring rural areas has also grown more
quickly. Statistics show that some 1.8 million farmers have moved
to town, and 35 percent of the city's rural people now live in
more-populated areas. The figure takes the lead in the country.
</P>
<P>
To help the new city dwellers adapt to the urban environment,
all towns in the region have launched a campaign to promote
healthier and cleaner lifestyles, and have discouraged such habits
as littering and spitting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the new city dwellers have replaced their
old-fashioned farm tools and furniture with computers, pianos and
books. A number of residential areas have opened classes in
painting, music, and how-to courses for collecting antiques or
books.

<HEADLINE> Defects Found in S. Korean High-Speed Rail Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 percent of the work
done on the 61-kilometer-long section of the Seoul-Pusan
high-speed rail system was found to be defective and in need of
reconstructions or repairs, according to a recent audit.
</P>
<P>
The defects, which range from poor concrete work to more
seriously structural problems, were discovered in an inspection on
the construction work conducted by Wiss, Janney, Elstner
Association (WJE) of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Korea High Speed Rail Construction Authority (KHRC) paid
2.7 million U.S. dollars for WJE's audit to check the construction
quality of the section, inside and outside, top to bottom, for six
months beginning from August 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
The audit showed that, out of 1,012 inspections on various
bridges, spans, tunnels, culverts, earthworks, foundations and
other elements of the project, 3.8 percent or 39 were found to be
so defective as to require reconstruction, and 17.5 percent or 177
were needed to be repaired. Among these, five of the total 37
bridges were judged to have structural problems endangering safety.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. auditors said only 297 works, or 29.4 percent of the
total examined, were in "health," and another 148 inspections were
going to be done.
</P>
<P>
The substandard construction followed the collapse of a bridge
over the Han River, which claimed the lives of 32 people in 1994,
and another of a upscale department store in Seoul, which killed
more than 450 people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The KIIRC said it would soon order the construction companies
involved to reconstruct or repair the rail though it would result
in cost overruns and delays in construction.
</P>
<P>
The 412-kilometer high-speed rail project, which was launched
by the KHRC in 1992, had been estimated to cost 12 billion dollars
and to be completed in 2002 as the world's fifth high-speed rail.
</P>
<P>
A KHRC official, who asked for anonymity, said the revised cost
would range between 20 billion to 22 billion dollars and the
completion would be delayed by three or four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The China 1997 International
Metal and Metallurgy Exposition, the largest of its kind in Asia,
is to be held May 8-12 here at the China International Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed to be the third largest of its kind
worldwide, following two similar shows, one held in Duesseldorf in
Germany, and another in Birmingham in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is expected to draw more than 700 enterprises
from 26 countries and regions, including the US, Japan, Britain,
Germany, France, and Italy, with floor space for exhibits
exceeding 25,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Items on display will include up-to-date equipment and
technology used for metallurgical production and heat treatment,
and casting and forging products. More than 200
technology-exchange activities will be staged during the show.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China To Support Itself in Grain Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China will add another
four million tons of grain to its granary by the end of the
century, to ensure grain self-sufficiency and provide more for the
state.
</P>
<P>
The area produced a record grain output of 32 million tons last
year, six million tons more than the previous year. But it still
faces grain shortages.
</P>
<P>
The area includes the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi
provinces. It has a population of 80 million and has to import
nearly 400,000 tons of grain annually.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China gives top priority to grain production and has
invested 10 billion yuan into building irrigation works over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
To combat droughts, the area initiated rainwater storage wells,
500,000 of which have contributed greatly to grain growth.
Agro-sciences are also proving successful: Gansu Province applied
plastic sheeting technique to about 183,000 ha of grain last year
and recorded a per-hectare yield of 6,900 kg.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is trying to win state approval and support for a
water and soil development project, which will cost 10 billion
yuan to reclaim nearly 670,000 ha of wasteland, to gain an
additional five billion cubic meters of water resources and five
million more tons of grain.

<HEADLINE> Retired Chinese Teacher Launches Tree Planting Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A 71-year-old man in east China's
Fujian Province has spent the past 10 years covering a barren hill
with trees and is determined to reclaim more than six ha of barren
hillsides during his remaining years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qinmao, a retired teacher, began his green campaign in
1987 when he retired and returned to his hometown of Longxiang
Village.
</P>
<P>
He knew the village's history too well to bear the bleak
sight. The forest resources there had been destroyed for one
reason or another, but the old man made up his mind to turn the
hillsides green.
</P>
<P>
Day and night, he set about cutting weeds and working on the
wasteland, eating rations in the field and drinking col water.
The sun burned his skin and he took shelter from the rain in his
work shed.
</P>
<P>
But, ten years of hard work and over 50,000 yuan in investment
paid off. An 8.6 hectare fruit garden is taking shape on the
hills, and his "green capital" is 120,000 yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
He has planted fir and fruit trees and has begun to breed
poultry and livestock with the help of experts. He earned more
than 20,000 yuan last year, in addition to his pension.
</P>
<P>
The ex-teacher is ready to share his experiences with neighbors
and resume his teaching, but this time about how to plant trees
and raise animals. He is even providing nursery stocks for the
needy and can help them have a better life.

TAIYUAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- By the end of last year, 600,000
young people and adults in north China's Shanxi Province were
illiterate, representing only two percent of the province's total
population, according to the lastest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has worked energetically to wipe out illiteracy since
the establishment of the People's Republic of China in
1949. Figures show that about 600,000 young people and adults
overcame illiteracy during the 1977-1987 period, and the
illiteracy rate dropped to 15.97 percent during the ten years.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, issued a
decree in 1988 to form a legal framework for the country's
anti-illiteracy campaign.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990, Shanxi reviewed the illiteracy situation among
young people and adults, and updated its records. Meanwhile, it
gave priority to the poor areas and to young people and adults,
and increased supervision over the work.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 98 percent of the towns and 60 percent of
the villages throughout the province have opened night schools for
adults, and some one million people have received tecknical

TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus

<HEADLINE> Ross Continues Shuttle Mission in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- United States special Middle
East coordinator Dennis Ross, who arrived here Wednesday, is
scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu again
today in an effort to restart peace negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Ross, who met Netanyahu Wednesday before traveling
to Gaza for talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat, will also meet Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reportedly trying to hammer out a formula which will
get the two sides back to the negotiating table and end the
crisis which erupted with Israel's decision to start construction
of settlement in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
After a half-hour meeting with Netanyahu Wednesday, Ross said
that a way has to be found to put the peace process back on track
and to ensure that violence is not going to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
"We also have to find a way to move the process forward
in a way which ensures that the hopes of each side can
be realized and that we have a credible negotiating process,"
said Ross.
</P>
<P>
The two did not discuss the proposal to advance the final
status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, or the second
pullback of the Israeli army from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made it clear to Ross that only the cessation
of terrorism would lead to the resumption of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat and Levy agreed Wednesday to revive peace
talks, at a meeting staged by the European Union (EU) at the
EU-Mediterranean conference in Malta, and both of them declared a
renewed readiness to seek peace.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the EU hailed their meeting as a crowning
achievement after years of aiming to achieve a more significant
role for Europe in the U.S.-led peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman, Marwan Kanafani, said the Palestinian
leader and Levy promised to "go back to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, Kanafani denied reports that Arafat agreed to renew
security coordination, saying "We have no direct coordination
except through the American side since Mr. Netanyahu ended
political coordination."

<P>
TAIYUAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A young artist in north China's
Shanxi Province has hailed the return of Hong Kong to China with a
pair of scissors.
</P>
<P>
Li Binjie, 32, spent more than a year cutting 100 dragons out
of a 56-m scroll of paper and cloth. He explained that the numeral
56 signifies the 56 ethnic groups in China welcoming the return of
Hong Kong; 100 stands for the return of Hong Kong after 100 years
of separation from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped that the paper-cut, known to be the largest of its
kind in the world, will be included in the Guinness Book of World
Records and put on display in Hong Kong on July 1 when China
resumes the sovereignty over the territory.
</P>
<P>
Li is now a cadre of the Tungsten Filament Factory in Xinzhou
Prefecture. Born in the countryside in northern Shanxi, where
paper-cutting is a popular folk art, he has been engaged in making
paper-cuts for a dozen years. He is now a member of the China
Research Society of Paper-cuts.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Ends Talks With Mandela, Returning Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader
Laurent Kabila left Cape Town for home early this morning while
South African President Nelson Mandela said he was "satisfied"
with their closed-door talks held Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe told a press conference
that the talks had explored possible new initiatives to end the
civil war between Kabila's rebel force and troops of Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting, which was expected to continue late into
the night, only lasted for 45 minutes. Kabila's representatives
still remained in the city, together with United Nations
special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the talks did not expect Mandela to take
part in any further talks, which might go ahead later today. But
they said the face-to-face peace talks between Kabila and Mobutu
could soon be effected.
</P>
<P>
In Kinshasa, Zairean Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba
said Mobutu and his arch-rival could meet directly once their
envoys had consulted in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Things are getting clearer. Plans are afoot for a meeting
between the head of state and the rebel leader. This meeting is
imminent," Kin-Kiey said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been hoping to bring Mobutu and Kabila together in
South Africa as part of his efforts to make peace in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived in Cape Town from Zaire's second city of
Lubumbashi which had been seized by rebels last week after only
token resistance from Mobutu's troops. The rebels so far have
controlled about half of the mine-rich central African country.
</P>
<P>
Despite his willingness to hold peace talks with Mobutu's
government, Kabila dampened hopes for stopping rebel attacks of
capital Kinshasa, home to five million people.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no ceasefire until Mobutu relinquishes power,"
he told a mass rally in Lubumbashi, responding a ceasefire call
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

consumption with some left over for export though the harvest
will be below the 2.6 million tons produced last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistical Office, the reduction in
the expected tonnage has largely been due to the heavy and

TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in March plunged by 26.8 percent from a year earlier to 818.34

in February for the first time in 27 months, the Finance Ministry

Of Japan's global trade in March, exports increased by 10.5

imports totaled 3,722.43 billion yen (29.8 billion dollars), up
24.4 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus last month with the United States
expanded 11.2 percent from a year earlier to 379.83 billion yen
(three billion dollars), the sixth consecutive monthly rise, amid
strong exports of automobile and office equipment, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surpluses with the European Union (EU) and Asia
declined, due partly to the growing imports of liquefied natural
gas and telecommunication equipment, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the EU fell by 39.2 percent to 131.29 billion
yen (1.1 billion dollars) and that with Asian countries went down
by 17.9 percent to 634.51 billion yen (5.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, some economists predicted that Japan's trade surplus
will turn upward in April as its industry will boost exports to
compensate for the decline of domestic consumption, which has been
brought about by the consumption tax hike from April 1.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1996, which ended on March 31, Japan's merchandise
trade surplus fell 29.6 percent to 6,421.25 billion yen (51
billion dollars), the fourth consecutive yearly decline.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Rules Out Deliberate Starting of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The authorities of Saudi
Arabia ruled out any deliberate starting of the fire disaster
that claimed the lives of more than 300 people and injured more
than 2,000 others near the holy city of Mecca Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Saudi Arabia today, the kingdom
announced late Wednesday that initial investigations indicated
that the fire was an accident, which had no political
implications, official Saudi media reports quoted an official
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fire in Mena was sparked by a gas canister used for
cooking, and strong winds made the fire sweep quickly across the
pilgrims camp of 70,000 tents. It took more than three hours to
put it out.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were reportedly Indians, besides
Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. An official announcement of the
nationalities of the victims is yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
The death toll Wednesday reached 343 as more bodies were
found from the debris where thick smell of smoke was still
pervasive in the air, and some seriously-wounded victims
succumbed to injuries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 217 people were confirmed dead and
more than 2,000 others injured in the fire.
</P>
<P>
The identification of victims is being hampered by the
charred state of many bodies, the Saudi authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The process of identifying the victims would begin in earnest
Friday after the end of the pilgrimage, as the Saudi authorities
were preoccupied with ensuring the smooth-running of the Haj
which reached its climax Wednesday as the two million pilgrims
came to Mount Arafat to mark the peak of the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The Haj authorities had intensified their efforts to ensure a
smooth movement of the pilgrims from Mena to Arafat Wednesday
following the fire.
</P>
<P>
The injured pilgrims who had been rushed to 12 nearby
hospitals and specialized medical centers after the fire were
receiving treatment with scores still being in critical
condition, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Industry to Grow By 11 Percent: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said on Wednesday that it expected the Indian industry to
grow by a robust 11.7 percent in the financial years of 1997-98
(April-March) and 1998-99, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Industry will continue to be an engine of economic growth in
India, ADB said in its annual report on India.
</P>
<P>
The services sector, which accounts for more than 40 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is expected to grow by around
6.5 percent during this period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
ADB said that since agriculture is an important contributor to
GDP growth, monsoons will continue to play an important role.
</P>
<P>
The bank suggested that GDP growth would be sustained at 7.0
percent in the next two years if the monsoon rains were favorable.
</P>
<P>
But the bank said inadequate infrastructure is an area of
concern.
</P>
<P>
"Expansion in the power generation industry slowed considerably
in 1996-97, and this may hold back future industrial growth as it
did in the past, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank pointed out that the private sector must be encouraged
to take long-term stakes in infrastructure development.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows not to Resign Despite Police Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Defying mounting pressure on
him to resign over his alleged involvement in a political
scandal, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has vowed to stay
on to fight for survival.
</P>
<P>
Following the revelation by state television Channel I
Wednesday evening that police investigators probing the so-called
"Bar-On for Hebron" scandal had recommended indicting Netanyahu
and three other key government figures, Netanyahu held urgent
consultations with his lawyer Yaakov Weinroth and senior aides
to discuss the implications.
</P>
<P>
The police reportedly recommended State Attorney Edada Arbel
and current Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein to charge
Netanyahu, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi and Director-General of
the Prime Minsiter's Office Avigdor Liberman with breach of
trust and fraud for their roles in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Police also recommended indicting Shas party leader Aryeh
Deri for blackmailing in pushing for the appointment of former
Jerusalem lawyer Roni Baron as the attorney-general in January.
</P>
<P>
Channel I reporter Ayala Hasson, who first broke the news
on the Bar-On scandal later January, said Deri conditioned
Shas' support of the Hebron deal on Bar-On's appointment,
because Bar-On promised to grant him a favorable plea bargin
in his bribery trial. Bar-On resigned two days after his
January 10 appointment only due to the public criticism of
his political affiliation and inadequate qualification for the
powerful position.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Channel I's latest report, Netanyahu's
spokesman Shai Bazak said the prime minister believed he would
have no problem with the affair and would "emerge spotless."
The Prime Minister's Office also accused the police's move of
being politically-motivated and intended to bring down the
government.
</P>
<P>
The reports about the police charges against Netanyahu
dropped a political bombshell in Israel, because this is the
first time in its history that a prime minister has been
charged by the police. Netanyahu was questioned late February
under caution by the police for his role in the Bar-On
appointment, and reportedly did not cooperate with his
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Many have begun to doubt the credibility of Netanyahu to
continue leading the government, while the main opposition Labor
party wasted no time in calling for his immediate resignation
to pave the way for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Shimon Peres, who had been pushing for the
formation of a unity government with the Likud before the
reports about the police findings, said Wednesday that he no
longer continued his efforts and called for Netanyahu's
immediate resignation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party rally in Tel Aviv Wednesday, leading
contender for the Labor leadership Ehud Barak demanded Netanyahu
and "ministers with a conscience" resign immediately. He dubbed
the Netanyahu government as "corrupt", saying it should be
"brought down, the sooner the better."
</P>
<P>
Another Labor leadership candidate Yossi Beilin urged the
Labor to launch "an unequivocal public campaign against the
prime minister, with the aim of bringing him down."
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid demanded, even before the
revelation of police charges against Netanyahu, Netanyahu and
Hanegbi resign now in order to pave the way for new
elections.
</P>
<P>
Even some ministers within the Likud-led coalition have also
made it clear that it would be the end of the government
if the state prosecution decided to endorse the police
recommendations to charge Netanyahu and the three others.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that even if the attorney-general and
state attorney decided not to indict Netanyahu because of
insufficient evidence, serious damage has already been inflicted
on his government and the opposition can rely on the public
opinion to intensify its campaign to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
However, all will become clear about the fate of the
Netanyahu government within the next two or three days, during
which the State Attorney's Office is expected to announce its
decision on the police recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Can Realize 8 Percent Growth: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia can realize
economic growth of more than 8 percent for the next five to 10
years if Total Factor Productivity (TFP) contributed at least 30
percent to the targeted overall productivity growth of six
percent, according to the 1996 Productivity Report released by the
National Productivity Center today.
</P>
<P>
The report said in order to achieve the contribution level, the
TFP must grow at a minimum of two percent a year.
</P>
<P>
For the 1987-96 period, the average growth in the TFP was 1.7
percent with Capital Intensity growing at 5.9 percent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the main source of Capital Intensity growth was
capital which contributed 65 percent to the overall productivity
growth of 4.7 percent, while TFP contributed 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the manufacturing sector continued to
be the major contributor (48 percent) to the overall productivity
growth. The other main contributor was the Aggregate Services
comprising Commerce/Trade (15.2 percent), Finance (13.2 percent)
and Transport (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
The combined contribution by the Manufacturing and Aggregate
Services sectors to overall growth was 89.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said manufacturing maintained its position as one of
the leading sectors of the economy, with productivity growth of
5.8 percent, employment growth of 6.6 percent and output growth of
12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that to enhance TFP, there is a need to shift
economic growth from input-driven towards productivity-driven, as
emphasized in the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) and the Second
Industrial Master Plan (1996-2005).

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Main Opposition May Agitate for CEC's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) may launch fresh anti-government agitation
after the holly Eid Day of April 18, which is likely to
concentrate on its demand for the resignation of Chief Election
Commissioner (CEC) Abu Hena.
</P>
<P>
According to highly-placed BNP sources, the opposition party is
likely to hold a demonstration before the CEC's office to press
for Hena's resignation for his alleged partisan role during
elections.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, who on last June lost the general election under CEC
Hena, on February last boycotted the by-elections to three
parliamentary seats alleging that fair elections could not be held
under the "partisan" CEC.
</P>
<P>
However, the by-election in Manikganj-3 constituency, of which
the seat fell vacant due to the death of a BNP member of
Parliament, is to be held. The BNP leaders are "unwilling to let
the confirmed seat go unchallenged," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to contest the Manikganj by-poll but the
partisan CEC must go," BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan recently
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Mannan said he hoped the CEC would resign for the sake of fair
elections. "Otherwise, we will compel the CEC to resign through
massive agitation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian-Language Movie About Genghis Khan To Be Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese film makers hope a new
Mongolian-language movie about Genghis Khan will attract both
domestic and western audiences.
</P>
<P>
The movie, Ke E Lun and Genghis Khan, scheduled to premiere
domestically in May, is China's first film using the Mongolian
language. It will be subtitled with Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
Genghis Khan (1162-1227) was one of the most famous conquerors
in China's history. He consolidated nomadic tribes into a unified
Mongolia and then extended his empire from China to Europe's
Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
The movie illustrated how Ke E Lun, Genghis Khan's mother,
nurtured her son and assisted him to unify the Mongolian tribes.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the film will be very competitive in the overseas
market because it's produced by Genghis Khan's descendants in the
land where he had founded an empire, thus it has a special
resonance," said Cheng Jianlin, director of the Inner Mongolia
Film Studio, the movie producer.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said most of the movie's production unit members,
including co-directors and leading actor and actress, are
Mongolian.
</P>
<P>
The ten-million-yuan production will also be shown to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region this year, Cheng said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved the third annual loan for Guyana under
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The loan, equivalent to about 24 million U.S. dollars, is
provided in support of the Guyana government's economic program in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The loan is available in two biannual installments, the first
of which will be available on April 30.
</P>
<P>
In the major macroeconomic objectives of the 1997 economic
program, the Guyana government will increase the gross domestic
product (GDP) by seven percent, lower the annual inflation rate to
four percent by the end of the year and limit the deterioration of
the current account deficit to about 12 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Guyana joined the IMF in September, 1966. Its quota is about 92
million dollars equivalent, and its outstanding use of IMF
financing currently totals about 151 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
member countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. The loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year
and are repayable over 10 years, with a five-and-half- year grace
period.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Needs New Economic Strategies: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia should emphasize
productivity-driven growth initiatives to keep its growth
sustainable in the long term, according to the 1996 Productivity
Report (PR) released here today by the government National
Productivity Center.
</P>
<P>
The report said that as Malaysia's growth, which is mainly
input-driven, may not be sustainable in the long run, it is
necessary to put stress on productivity-driven growth initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"Improvements in the TFP will lead to increased productivity
and enable the economy to generate a larger output from the same
available resources. Hence, shifting to a higher growth path," it
said.
</P>
<P>
It has outlined three major strategies to enhance Malaysia's
Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to transform the country's growth
strategy from input-driven to productivity-driven.
</P>
<P>
The first is to upgrade local expertise in the field of
productivity and quality (P&AMP;Q). This will involve intensifying P&AMP;Q
training programs and management systems development to upgrade
knowledge and skills of employees and improve management systems.
</P>
<P>
Another strategy would be improving input for policy
formulation and planning to enhance P&AMP;Q. This calls for the
development of databases on productivity indicators at the
sectoral, national and international levels for industries.
</P>
<P>
Besides, this strategy also identifies the need to conduct
research on current issues in P&AMP;Q to ensure that updated data and
information are made available to industries.
</P>
<P>
The third strategy, for promoting greater awareness and
practices of P&AMP;Q systems of management and work culture, stresses
the importance of promotional activities in the area of P&AMP;Q
management.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in order to effectively implement the
plans to enhance TFP growth, information on productivity and
quality must be widely disseminated to everyone concerned.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, it said, a three-year National Productivity
Enhancement campaign should be undertaken to hasten the shift to
more value-added activities through capital- and
technology-intensive production processes and to enhance global
competitiveness through technology development and market
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The report called for a more significant role for the private
sector in technology acquisition and transfer as well as
commercialization in the field of research and development to
ensure sustained and competitive industrial technology
development.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Most domestic and international
carriers operating in India have agreed to install airborne
collision avoidance system (ACAS) in their aircraft as per the
schedule recommended by the Indian Civil Aviation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hindustan Times today, Director General of
Civil Aviation H.S. Khola confirmed on Wednesday that the civil
aviation authorities of neighboring countries have also approved
the move.
</P>
<P>
Installation of ACAS by all aircraft would improve air safety
and the move is a right step in view of the increasing traffic and
congestion of air corridors, Khola said at a press conference held
here.
</P>
<P>
Two aircraft, including one Boeing 747 from the Saudi Airlines,
collided mid-air over India's Haryana state on November 12 last
year, killing about 350 people.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing and
services sectors were the prime contributors to Malaysia's growth
in productivity, with contributions exceeding 80 percent each year
over the 1993-96 period, according to a government report released
today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, these two sectors accounted for about 89 percent of
the productivity growth of the economy, said the 1996 Productivity
Report issued by the government National Productivity Center.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia's productivity growth for the 1990-94 period
moved faster than that of the seven major countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Malaysia's productivity growth stood at 6.6 percent
against the average 5.5 percent during the period of 1993-95, it
said.
</P>
<P>
To improve future productivity growth, the report suggested
four actions -- stimulating demand, developing human resources,
allocating scarce resources efficiently across sectors and
encouraging technical change.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Alternative Study Invited in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The deadline for
companies to hand in studies on a possible new trans-ocean
passage as an alternative to the Panama Canal alternative to
the Colombian government is passed today.
</P>
<P>
In September, the government will put up for tender an
environmental impact study of the passage in the Tapon del Darien
region on the northwestern border to Panama.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the construction of the passage is one
of its priorities and the environmental study will determine
whether or not the link will be a canal or railway.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists oppose the building of a canal, which would join the
Atrato and Truando rivers in the province of Choco, saying it
would jeopardize the biodiversity of Tapon del Darien, a swampy
jungle region.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Carlos Hernan Lopez said the canal
would cost 2.33 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica "is very interested
in the Chinese market" for its banana exports, Jorge Sauma,
general manager of the National Banana Corporation (Corbana) told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
He said Corbana had discussed the issue with Yang Wensheng,
Assistant to the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, during his visit here recently.
</P>
<P>
The most important banana markets for Costa Rican are the
United States and Europe, together taking 92 percent of its total
exports.
</P>
<P>
But Costa Rican banana growers are interested in expanding
their markets to eastern Europe, Arab and China.
</P>
<P>
Sauma believed that his country could export about 130,000
boxes of bananas every week to China at a price of about six U.S.
dollars per unit.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is the world's second biggest banana producer, only
next to Ecuador. At present, some 50,000 hectares are planted and
nearly 50,000 jobs created directly by banana production.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) is planning a five-year aid program for Sri Lanka,
according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said UNDP officials are in close dialogue with the
government on the aid program.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has given the overall objective of contributing to a
process of sustainable human development aimed at reducing and
eventually eradicating absolute poverty in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for poverty in Sri Lanka is the lack of
employment and other opportunities to earn a living. In addition,
the ongoing ethnic conflict is causing displacement of people and
economic and social hardships for people of all ethnic groups, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, they stated, the UNDP will focus its support in
the next five years on programs aimed at stimulating further
growth and job creation at the provincial and district levels in
close cooperation with the private sector and community-based
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Other UNDP efforts will be concentrated on the rehabilitation
of the conflict-affected areas, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Grant Export License for Hydropower Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is ready
to grant permission to a hydropower project to be developed by a
foreign company for exporting its electricity to neighboring
India, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the export license for the West Seti project in
far-west Nepal between the authorities and Australia's Snowy
Mountain Engineering Corp. have come to the final stage, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Nepali Water Resources Ministry said the
export permission will be soon granted so that the Australian
company could start formal negotiations with prospective power
buyers in India at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The 750-megawatt West Seti project, at an estimated cost of
over 1 billion U.S. dollars, is Nepal's first hydropower project
entirely promoted for electricity export.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Snowy Mountain had held extensive discussions with
electricity authorities of northern Indian states, some of which
have expressed their intentions to buy power from the project,
company sources said.
</P>
<P>
An Indian research institute estimated last year that India's
northern region will face a power shortage of at least 21,000
megawatts in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials said the construction of the project, located
near Nepal's border with India, would begin soon after the
Australian developer finalizes power deals with Indian buyers.
</P>
<P>
The project, also the country's first totally promoted by
foreign investors, is closely watched as a testing ground by other
prospective foreign investors of Nepal's abundant water resources,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has adopted a policy to boost the
country's economic growth through encouraging foreign investment
in the hydropower sector.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar's Communications Sector Experiences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has made greater strides
in developing its communications sector, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The number of telephones in Myanmar reached 168,399 in the
1995-96 fiscal year, up from 73,545 at the beginning of the 1990s
when it was difficult to make trunk calls in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar began introducing the auto-telephone system in 1958 and
there were only four auto-exchange stations then in Yangon,
capital of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures indicate that 78 auto-exchange
stations (AES) and 410 conventional exchange stations (CES) in 14
states and divisions have been set up by the end of February this
year, up from the 33 AES and 210 CES in 1988.
</P>
<P>
During the last four-year plan period from 1992-93 to 1995-96,
some 7,000 auto-exchange lines were installed in Myanmar's three
cities -- Bago, Taunggyi and Dawei. The number of towns, which
have auto telephones, increased to 53 by the end of fiscal 1995-96
from 29 in fiscal 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 2,000 cellular phones were installed during
the plan period in Yangon and 1,000 more is being installed in
Mandalay, the second largest city of the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's telecommunications services are run by the government
as the sole agent.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of foreign companies have been involved in
the installation of communications systems in Myanmar on contracts
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
These foreign firms, mainly from Australia, Israel, Germany,
Japan, Singapore and the United States, are going to set up a
20,000 auto-radio telephone system and install over 4,000 cellular
phones throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has introduced a micro-wave link system to ensure
smooth and direct trunk calls with major towns of the border
regions.
</P>
<P>
The digital micro-wave link connecting Mandalay with the other
five cities -- Pyin Oo Lwin, Lashio, Loikaw, Shwebo and Pakokku --
has been successfully launched one after another since September
last year.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the micro-wave link system signified that
Myanmar's communications sector has entered into a new stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
And the rapid development of the country's communications
sector will in turn facilitate the country's economic development
and help induce foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Predicted to Grow at 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy will grow at
7 percent a year in the 1996-2000 period, an economic expert said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth is possible because all the elements for it
are present in Indonesia, Prof. Anwar Nasution said here Wednesday
when launching of an annual report issued by the United Nations'
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Entitled Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific
1997, the report said that Indonesia has experienced very rapid
change in the structure of its production, with a decline in the
share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP) from 31
percent to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the percentage of the labor force in agriculture
remains as high as 55 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As between industry and services, the share of services is
higher, although it has experienced a rapid rate of industrial
growth since 1980.
</P>
<P>
It held that this imbalance between the sectoral share of
output and employment is a source of continuing concern, as it
reflects a rise in the disparity between the income levels of the
urban industrial sector and the rural agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The report also mentioned that Indonesia's economic growth has
been supported by high rates of domestic investment and savings.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investment rose to around 40 percent of GDP in 1995,
from 30 percent in 1990. Thus, investment has been financed
largely by domestic saving, which reached 36 percent of GDP or
more in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has experienced a stable average inflation rate of
about 8.5 percent since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Indonesia's foreign trade, the report mentioned that
the rate of growth of exports has accelerated sharply between
1985-1989 and 1990-1995 from 0.9 percent to 12.7 percent per year.

<HEADLINE> Argentina: Unhappy With U.S. Action on Argentine Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentina is unhappy with
the action taken by the United States which removed 130 Argentine
products from the preferential tariff system, Julio Caceres,
Argentine Economy Minister's coordinating secretary, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In the belief that Argentina has not taken adequate and
efficient measures to protect intellectual property rights, the
U.S. government announced Tuesday it would remove Argentine
products from the preferential tariff treatment.
</P>
<P>
This will bring to Argentina a loss of 260 million U.S. dollars
in exports, Caceres estimated.
</P>
<P>
Argentina would take the case to international organizations,
including the World Trade Organization, he said, adding that it
has already been brought to the legislative bodies to decide
whether to ban U.S. companies from bidding for contracts here.
</P>
<P>
However, on Tuesday, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella
issued a statement, saying despite the fact that the U.S. measures
constitute a blow to Argentina, it will not be modify its present
patent law.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian President Calls for Non-nuclear Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexandr
Lukashenko today reiterated his objection to the eastwards
expansion of the North Atlatic Treaty Organization (NATO), and called for
the building of a non-nuclear zone in eastern and central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on economic development in Minsk,
Lukashenko said that instead of bringing stability in Europe,
NATO's expansion would only prove detrimental to stability.
</P>
<P>
Belarus had experienced some of the worst warfare this century,
and that was the reason why it was against the expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has been actively seeking to invite some former
Warsaw Pact bloc countries to join the organization. Among the
front-runners are Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of building a non-nuclear zone in eastern and
central Europe, which was initiated by himself, Lukashenko said
this was not a vacant political slogan, but a call from the
"hearts of the Belarussian people."
</P>
<P>
So far, China and Russia have backed the non-nuclear proposal,
while most Western countries remained indifferent.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) insisted today that the United States eliminate its
import duties before negotiating tariff reductions that will lead
to a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
This stand was put forth by Jose Alfredo Graza Lima, the

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A daily average of three million
US dollars of overseas investment is flowing into the Free Trade
Zone in Tianjin Port this year, as internationally recognized
practices have been adopted in conducting free trade businesses.
</P>
<P>
The zone, established in 1992, has been provided with
facilities for storage of goods, processing, trade, and port
service, similar to most free trade zones worldwide, said San
Xiangjun, director of the Administrative Committee of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Ten foreign automobile companies set up storage and sales
centers in the zone, and sell their products not only in China but
to southeastern Asian countries, Mongolia, and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-US joint-venture built in the zone two storehouses, one
3,000 sq me and the other 6,000 sq m, in addition to a 90,000-sq-m
open-air yard for goods and containers.

processes high-quality home-made cashmere and exports the products
to Japan, Italy, and the United States. The company is leading the
zone in per-capita profits and hard currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the enterprises in the zone are engaged in
foreign trade, making it an international distribution center. As
a result, more than 50 trade companies make an average of 10
million yuan in annual sales and 20 companies each earn 100
million US dollars every year.

TIRANA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) backs the intention of the Albanian
government to hold parliamentary elections due by the end of June,

</P>
<P>
The statement was made today by Franc Vranicki, the visiting

</P>
<P>
Vranicki made the remarks during talks with Albanian Prime
Minister Bashkim Fino, one day after the Italian-led multinational

the two sides mainly discussed the preparatory work for the polls,
cooperation between the multinational force and the Albanian
authorities, and promotion of political dialogue with various
parties in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"The fruitful talks will be conducive to working out a
strategic plan for stabilizing the Albanian situation and the
multinational force's operation in the country," it added.

MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled exit of the
Philippines from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) supervision
this year will mean more business for the country, local newspaper
the Philippine Journal said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' planned exit from the IMF will give the
country a clean bill of health and raise its credit rating to an
investment grade, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo was quoted
as telling a meeting of businessmen Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant implications of this event will be
the ability of the government as well Filipino-owned business
enterprises to gain access to the financial markets that offer
cheap and low-interest loans, de Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said the scheduled exit will take effect by the end
of this June despite the delays in the passage of the proposed
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package which remains pending in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' economic development has been under the IMF's
supervision for about 35 years. With its economy growing with
unprecedented rates in recent years, the Philippines has sought to
get free from the IMF.

SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The water quality of Shanghai's
Huangpu River is to see remarkable improvement with the completion
of China's largest wastewater treatment plant, said officials here.
</P>
<P>
The plant, specially designed to treat sewage discharged by
ships, is located in the Waigaoqiao District.
</P>

Funding for the project, amounting to some 200 million yuan,
came mainly from donations, and loans from the Global Environment

With the rapid development of Shanghai's economy over the past
few years, the Huangpu River has seen an increase in ship travel,
and the large amount of waste produced by ships carrying oil and
chemicals has greatly threatened the river quality.
</P>
<P>
The new plant, south of Yangtze River, covers an area of 50,000
sq.m., with a coastal line extending 300 meter. The dock is able
to provide berth for 30,000-dwt oil tanks and to handle 400,000
tons of sewage from ships and 100,000 tons of chemical waste every
year.

on August 9, 1996 on paying the 249 former so-called comfort women
as compensation for their sexual slavery during the Japanese
army's occupation of Indonesia between 1942 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Social Affairs Inten Suweno said the
Indonesian government would use the compensation money to build
retirement homes for elderly people, instead of giving it to the
women.
</P>
<P>
However, the former "comfort women", who opposed the
government's decision, said they battled for four years to win
compensation from the Japanese government, without any help from
the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
They are preparing a lawsuit against Suweno for not paying them
the money, local press reported.

<HEADLINE> Philippines-Australia Trade Seen to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the Philippines and
Australia is projected to grow sharply after Australia agreed to
relax quarantine restrictions on fresh fruits and tunas from the
Philippines, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Australia has informed Manila that safety concerns that
prevented the Philippines from exporting fruits and tunas to
Australia had already been resolved, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade Undersecretary Jose Juliano was quoted as
saying Wednesday that trade between the two countries is expected
to grow two-folds to around to 4 billion U.S. dollars this year
should fresh fruits, tuna and other exports pass Sydney's
quarantine tests.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service has agreed to work
with the Philippines' Food Development Center to control the
quality of Philippine exports to Australia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries reached about 2 billion dollars
last year, with Australia's exports to the Philippines accounting
for two-thirds of the total trade.

<HEADLINE> Singaporean Women Reach Final in Commonwealth Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore obtained its first-ever
final berth in the Commonwealth Championships in Glasgow on
Wednesday when its women rubbers overcame Canada 4-0 for a
showdown with England the following day.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's number one Jing Jun-hong won both a singles and a
doubles. The Beijing-born Jing is also a favourite for the women's
singles later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Jing was given a good contest by the improving Nova Scotian
Petra Cada, who hit forcefully from both wings and stayed well in
contention all through before going down 25-23, 24-22.
</P>
<P>
But the pen-grip player was quicker and more experienced at
handling the big points and later she also proved to be the
crucial factor in the doubles which concluded the match.
</P>
<P>
Jing paired with Tan Paey Fern to beat Cada and Lyne
Desjardins. It took some sharp hits and smashes from Jing to do
this, ensuring the Singaporeans to drop only two more points after
having built a 11-4 lead in the final game.
</P>
<P>
England won through to the final by beating Australia 4-1, with
three successes (two singles and a doubles) from the Germany-based
former European silver medallist Lisa Lomas.

<HEADLINE> World Economy to Achieve Higher Growth in 1997: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The world economy in 1996
continued on the path of "moderate expansion" that began in 1993
with a growth rate of 2.7 percent, and is expected to achieve
higher and broad-based growth this year, the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) said.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook 1997 and 1998" released here
today, the ADB said that the world economic growth in 1996 is
estimated at 2.7 percent, which is essentially unchanged from
1995.
</P>
<P>
"This performance was combined with stable monetary indicators,
including low inflation and steady interest rates in the leading
financial markets," the Manila-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
The overall GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of 2.3
percent achieved by the industrial countries in 1996 was less than
expected at the beginning of the year, largely because of slow
growth in three of Europe's largest economies -- Germany, France
and Italy -- in contrast to livelier performances of the United
States, Britain and Canada, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese economy had a more robust performance in 1996
after a long period of slow growth, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that inflation in the industrial economies was slightly
lower in 1996 at 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although many developing and transitional economies performed
better than forecast, the bank said, several developing countries
continued to perform poorly, either because of their earlier
failure to institute structural reforms, or because of the time
lags before the beneficial effects of the reform packages are
felt.
</P>
<P>
"Overall growth in developing countries was helped by generally
stable commodity prices, a favorable external environment, and
more open trading systems," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the Asian and Pacific region continued to be
the fastest growing region in the world in 1996, though the
average GDP growth declined from 8.2 percent in 1995 to 7.4
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth of the region is expected to stabilize at
around the 1996 level, or 7.3 percent for 1997 and 7.2 for 1998,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In Africa and Latin America, economic performance improved on
average as earlier reform measures began to bear fruit, and in the
Middle East, economic growth was supported by a strong worldwide
market for petroleum, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of world trade, the bank said that after two
years of robust growth, expansion decelerated in the latter part
of 1995 and early 1996, although estimated growth in 1996 of
around 7 percent is close to the trend established since the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
"The deceleration reflects a cyclical downswing in import
demand in the United States and Europe," it said. "As a result,
trade growth slowed in East Asia and Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
Referring to capital flows, the bank said that private capital
flow to developing economies resumed their rising trend in 1996,
after a check in growth following the Mexican financial crisis of
late 1994 and early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although developing and transitional economies still receive
only around 10 percent of the funds raised in the international
capital markets, these flows have been growing rapidly, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
In the five years to 1995, it said, flows of foreign direct
investment to developing countries rose threefold to almost 100
billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of the world economic growth, the bank said
that output in industrial countries over the next two years is
projected to grow quite smoothly and at low levels of inflation,
allowing for a stable international environment within which
developing economies can continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
"Growth is likely to continue in the United States; Japan
should continue its recovery; the European Union has the potential
to achieve higher non-inflationary growth," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Revival should spread to most European transitional economies,
and developing countries have reasonable prospects for growth," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it is expected that the world economy will
achieve higher, broad-based growth across regions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
World trade growth is expected to rebound in 1997, in response
to an acceleration in world output growth, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economy to Continue Steady Growth: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in developing Asia
slowed down from 8.2 percent in 1995 to 7.4 percent last year, and
is expected to stabilize at around this level in the next two
years, or 7.3 percent for 1997 and 7.2 percent for 1998, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slower growth in most Asian economies last year,
the region recorded another year of healthy economic performance
and continued to outperform other developing regions, said ADB in
its Asian Development Outlook 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ADB outlook is an annual publication which forecasts
short-term economic trends in the region. The report was released
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Last year's decline was due to the sharp drop in export growth
and may be temporary in nature," it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, most Asian economies experienced a sharp slowdown in
export growth, and growth of total merchandise exports of the 13
biggest developing ADB members declined to 4.8 percent in 1996
from 22.1 percent in 1995, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the export slowdown to the slump of the
electronics sector, tight fiscal and monetary policies adopted by
a number of economies to avoid overheating, and the U.S. dollar
appreciation against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted some economists' apprehensions about Asia's
ability to sustain its high performance when its competitiveness
in the international markets may be waning.
</P>
<P>
But it said that "as economies catch up, then an indigenous
capacity to innovate becomes more important."
</P>
<P>
The critical issue facing a number of Asian economies is
whether they can create the capacity for technical innovation as
it becomes necessary, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of weak global demand in electronics, particularly
semiconductors and computer peripherals, the bank said, the GDP
(gross domestic product) growth rate of newly industrializing
economies (NIES) -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and China's
Taipei -- fell to 6.3 percent in 1996 from 7.5 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The GDP growth rate in the NIES in 1997 and 1998 will continue
to be subdued. Export growth should revive in the short term. In
the longer term, growth may accelerate as the efforts of these
economies to restructure and move into higher technology
production bear fruits," it said.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, GDP growth rate declined to 7.4 percent in
1996 from 8.2 percent in 1995, the bank said, adding that growth
rates in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were all affected by the
export slowdown and constrained by supply-side limitations and
inflation-cooling monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Southeast Asian economies are expected to
strengthen their performance in 1997 and 1998, as improvements in
the global trading environment should help those which experienced
weak export growth in 1996, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic situation in China, the bank said that China
achieved a successful "soft landing" in 1996 after four years of
double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP growth rate of 9.7 percent in 1996 remains among
the highest in the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is expected to grow rapidly over the next two
years with real GDP increasing by 9 percent in 1997 and 8 percent
in 1998, given the government's cautious approach to avoid
overheating," it said.
</P>
<P>
On South Asia's economic development and prospects, the bank
said that structural reforms continued and, though incomplete,
began to show encouraging results.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate for the subregion was 6.5 percent in 1996,
continuing a buoyant performance over that of the pre-reformed
period, it said.
</P>
<P>
India attracted a record level of foreign investment, with
inputs of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars in different equity
instruments, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that supported by industrial growth of 8.7
percent, India's real GDP growth was 6.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"South Asia is expected to improve its growth performance in
1997, with further acceleration in 1998," it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy to Grow Rapidly in Next 2 Years: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is expected to
grow rapidly over the next two years with real GDP (gross domestic
product) increasing by 9 percent in 1997 and by 8 percent in 1998,
the Asian Development Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook 1997 and 1998," which was
released here today, the ADB said: "After four years of
double-digit growth, the Chinese economy achieved a successful
soft landing in 1996 through a judicious combination of
administrative measures and macro-economic policies."
</P>
<P>
Stabilization of the domestic economy was accompanied by
further improvement in the external accounts, and inflation fell
sharply without disrupting growth, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP (gross domestic product) growth of 9.7 percent in
1996 was "among the highest in the world," even though this was a
slight deceleration from the 10.2 percent expansion in 1995,
reflecting continuing tight fiscal and monetary policies, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that sustained growth of the economy resulted in
a continued rise of per capita income of the Chinese people, with
that of urban residents increasing by 3.4 percent and rural
residents by 8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural production grew by 5.1 percent in 1996
compared with 4.5 percent in 1995, largely because of the grain
harvest which reached a record 480 million tons, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Industrial production grew by 12.3 percent in 1996 compared
with 13.6 percent growth in the previous year," it added.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of economic growth over the next two years, the
bank said that given the high savings rate in China, the country's
growth rate should be sustainable without excessive inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is expected to continue to grow rapidly over the
next two years with real GDP increasing by 9 percent in 1997 and
by 8 percent in 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that China's agriculture is expected to achieve
an annual average growth of 4.5 percent over the next two years,
and industrial production is anticipated to grow at 9-11 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the next two years, it said, the country's services sector
is anticipated to grow by an average of 8 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Benefit From New WTO Rules: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said today that the World Trade Organization's new rules for
global trade present both opportunities and challenges for Asian
developing economies.
</P>
<P>
"Asia, where rapid growth and development has been closely
linked to export growth, has a large stake in ensuring that the
world trading system remains open and non-discriminatory," said
ADB in its "Asian Development Outlook 1997 and 1998," which was
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the extension of the trading rules to cover
new areas as textiles and clothing, intellectual property and
agriculture means that some Asian economies may have to adjust
policies, create and strengthen institutions and change laws.
</P>
<P>
"The most significant measures for Asia is the World Trade
Organization's inclusion of textiles and clothes in the main body
of multilateral rules," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, such trade had been governed by bilateral quota
restrictions. Under the Multifibre Arrangement in force for over
two decades, quotas known as "voluntary export restraints" raised
prices artificially in consuming countries and penalized more
efficient exporters by restricting market access.
</P>
<P>
The new rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) state that
all such quotas are to be removed between 1995 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
Asian developing economies account for over 40 percent of
global trade in textiles and 55 percent in clothing, according to
ADB. More importantly, textiles and clothing are the single most
important export for most of Asian developing economies, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-headquartered bank said that the dismantling of
quotas will most benefit Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it said, countries and regions that could
lose out include those which were protected by the quota system.
</P>
<P>
"One potential major beneficiary is the People's Republic of
China, although it is not yet a WTO member," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that another area with great impact on Asia is
that of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
"This is a controversial issue. Developing countries -- net
users of intellectual property -- oppose WTO coverage of this area
while developed countries -- predominant owners of intellectual
property -- support their inclusion under WTO rules," it said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO agreement has extended copy right protection to
computer software and databases as well as films and sound
recordings. As a result, a number of Asian countries will need to
change their laws to meet these new obligations, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, liberalization measures will also have an
impact on Asian developing economies, it added.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, the Asia-Pacific region, which has achieved the
most rapid trade growth of all regions in the past 30 years, will
benefit from the new rules," the bank said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Predicts Robust Growth for Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The economic situation in the
Philippines improved considerably in 1996 and will improve further
in the next two years as ongoing reforms bear fruit, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said today in a report.
</P>
<P>
In "the Asian Development Outlook 1997 and 1998" which was
released here today, ADB said that robust growth and a comfortable
balance of payments characterized the Philippine economy for the
third consecutive year in 1996, with gross national product (GNP)
growing by 6.9 percent and gross domestic product (GDP) by 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said that the country's inflation, which
breached double-digit levels in September 1995, was brought under
control by the last quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The economy now possesses the potential to grow at rates
similar to those of its Southeast Asian neighbors," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
But, it said, realizing this potential would require further
efforts to upgrade the country's infrastructure and continued
macro-economic stability, involving further fiscal consolidation
and cautious monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"Increased attention to the promotion of the country's
international competitiveness in general, and labor-intensive
manufacturing in particular, is also required," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that the 40 percent surge in the Philippines'
trade deficit to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars was caused by a
slowdown in export growth and a strong growth in imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit is still at manageable levels, and the
balance of payments did not come under pressure, as it partly
offset by remittances from overseas Filipino workers and long-term
capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the Philippines' growth was led by the
agriculture and services sectors, which expanded by 3.1 percent
and 6 percent respectively last year.
</P>
<P>
On prospects for the economy in the next two years, the bank
said that the country's GDP is expected to grow at an annual rate
of 6 percent to 6.5 percent, and GNP is expected to increase by 7
percent.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Jalabert of France broke
away from compatriot Luc Leblanc in the last kilometer to win the
Fleche Wallonne cycle race for the second time in three years in
Huy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert, of Spanish Once team, dashed through the steep hill
course by finishing about 18 seconds ahead of former world
champion Leblanc.
</P>
<P>
His Swiss teammate Alex Zuelle edged out six other riders to
take the third place.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (27-28)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will there be any new regulations concerning
marriages between Hong Kong people and people in the mainland
after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law protects freedom of marriage of Hong Kong
residents. In accordance with the principle of "one country, two
systems," after 1997, if a mainland person is married to a Hong
Kong resident, related matters will be handled in accordance with
relevant laws of Hong Kong; and if a Hong Kong resident is married
to a mainlander, related matters will be handled in accordance
with relevant laws of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Question: What kind of passports will Hong Kong residents hold
after 1997? What identity cards will be issued to other lawful
residents?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Article 154 of the Basic Law, the central
government will authorize the government of the Hong Kong SAR to
issue, in accordance with law, passports of the Hong Kong SAR of
the People's Republic of China to all Chinese citizens who hold
permanent identity cards of the region, and travel documents of
the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China to all other
persons lawfully residing in the region.
</P>
<P>
Such passports and documents will be valid for travels around
the world and bear language stating the holder's right to return
to the Hong Kong SAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the Republic of Korea (ROK) and
the United States said today that they have achieved "encouraging
progress" in their meeting today on the proposed four-party peace
talk.
</P>
<P>
The three delegations said they will continue to meet Friday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting took place in U.N. Plaza Hotel across the
street of the United Nations. It was the second meeting in two
months on the proposed four-party peace talk.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean press officer with access to the meeting said
the DPRK and ROK officials shook hands at the beginning of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Song Yong Shik, ROK deputy foreign minister for political
affairs, said, "We are in the middle of the warm spring and the
meeting will be a very cozy one."
</P>
<P>
Head of the DPRK delegation Kim Gye Gwan, vice minister of
foreign affairs, said, "We hope we will come out with good
result."
</P>
<P>
Noticing that there were 21 correspondents, he said, "That
maybe symbolizes that we are moving towards the 21th century."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean press officer said they are expecting an
answer from the DPRK regarding a U.S.-South Korea proposal on
four-party negotiations on a new security arrangement to replace
that of the 1953 armistice which ended fighting in the Korea
Peninsula. The four parties are the DPRK, the ROK, the United
States and China.
</P>
<P>
Leading the U.S. delegation is Charles Kartman, acting U.S.
assistant secretary of state of East Asia and Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. and South Korean representatives briefed the
North Koreans in New York about the peace talks. The DPRK said
they needed more time to study it and asked for another round of
discussions.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Hails Inauguration of New Angolan Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today hailed the inauguration on 11 April 1997 of the Government
of Unity and National Reconciliation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged the parties to complete without
delay the remaining aspects of the peace process, including the
incorporation of UNITA soldiers into the Angolan Forces and the
normalization of state administration throughout the national
territory.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council decided at the
same time to extend the mandate of the 6,000-member U.N.
peacekeeping force until June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to proceed with the transition towards an
observer mission for the period ending June 30, 1997. The new
mission will focus on peace consolidation, confidence building and
national reconciliation, with a view to creating an environment
conducive to long-term stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is another important milestone in the Angolan peace
process," said Chinese Deputy Representative to the United Nations
Wang Xuexian, referring to the inauguration of the new government.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate and welcome the political sincerity and
positive attitude the parties concerned have demonstrated on
peace in Angola in conformity with the popular will," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang hoped the two parties will continue to
accomplish other tasks in the peace process in the spirit of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With regard to international assistance, Ambassador Wang said
that at this final critical juncture of the peace process, it is
still necessary for the international community, including the
United Nations, to give further support.
</P>
<P>
"The international community, including the United Nations,
should assist Angola in every possible way with its rapid
rehabilitation and development," he said. "This is also the
fundamental guarantee for lasting peace in Angola."
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government and people are ready to make
their contributions to this end.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Continues Search for Missing Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. air and ground crews
today continued their search for a missing Air Force jet that
disappeared more than two weeks ago with a pilot and four bombs,
said reports.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said three Civil Air Patrol planes
and three Army National Guard aircraft were used along with ground
crews searching two areas three to four miles east of the rugged
New York Mountain range where the A-10 Thunderbolt plane is
believed to have gone down.
</P>
<P>
More than 330 search flights across the Rockies southwest of
Vail have turned up no sign of the nine million U.S. dollar
Thunderbolt or Capt. Craig Button, who veered away from an Arizona
training formation on April 2.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon official, said
the search will continue indefinitely as long as there's some hope
that "we'll find something," "as long as technology allows us to
search in any kind of a coordinated way."
</P>
<P>
Ground searches of the New York Mountain turned up no new clues
Tuesday, according to AP.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Ignores US Call to Condemn Iraq for Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today ignored a U.S. call to condemn Iraq for a recent flight to
Saudi Arabia by issuing a very mild statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was read out by council President Antonio
Monteiro of Portugal, only said Iraq proceeded with this
particular flight "without specific consultation" with the
council's Iraqi sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
"Such consultation would have allowed the committee to consider
the matter and to determine whether the flight required committee
approval under relevant resolution," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
American U.N. envoy Bill Richardson told reporters on April 9
that the flight earlier that day, which took 104 pilgrims from
Baghdad to Jeddah, was "an outright violation of sanctions" and
that he was seeking a strong council statement to that effect.
</P>
<P>
But, it was reported, other council members, including Russia,
France and China, did not believe during the consultation that
Iraq had violated sanctions in force since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In drawing to the attention of member states their obligations
under relevant resolutions regarding Iraq, the council underlined
its respect for the obligation of Muslims to perform the Hajj
pilgrimage.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The House International
Relations Committee today called for the immediate resignation of
Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, saying his days as leader of
Zaire are "numbered."
</P>
<P>
The committee passed a resolution by voice vote, which said the
former U.S. ally had not made what the United States demanded "a
genuine transition to multiparty democracy and continues to cling
to power."
</P>
<P>
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, the committee chairman, said, "President
Mobutu's days as leader of Zaire are numbered."
</P>
<P>
The White House has already indicated that Mobutu must leave as
his rule has become a "creature of history."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department called on the Rwandan
government to allow a massive airlift and overland evacuation of
100,000 refugees to begin Friday from Zaire back to their homeland
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to await the decision of the government of Rwanda
to allow women and children, at least, to be evacuated from the
refugee camps so that their lives may be saved," spokesman
Nicholas Burns said at a briefing today.

<P>
Top on the agenda will be the ratification of the CWC, which is
to take effect as of April 29. Clinton strongly urges the
lawmakers to approve it before the date while Republicans opposing
the treaty led by Senator Jesse Helms say it needs amendment.
</P>
<P>
Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relation Committee,
declined to attend the informal dinner session in the Blair
House which is an official government guest residence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger told reporters
today that ratification was still "very much up in the air at this
point.... There is some strenuous opposition from some groups."
</P>
<P>
Burger also said, "It's a very important opportunity for both
the president and the congressional leadership to build a kind of
bipartisan consensus around America's leadership in the world."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, "Our goal, largely
stated, is bipartisanship in foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The Blair House session comes at a time when the Clinton
administration and the Republican-controlled Congress differ on
issues ranging from the CWC and trade to payments to the U.N.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank: Mark Not Affected by Planned Launch of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank Bundesbank
today dismissed fears that the Deutsche mark might be affected by
the planned launch of the European single currency, the euro,
saying the mark was still the world's number-two reserve currency
after the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The fears that investors might sell the mark for such other
currencies as the dollar, the Swiss franc or pound sterling had
not been confirmed, said the central bank in its report for April.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and June 1996, mark denominated investments from
abroad almost doubled from 771 billion marks (453 billion dollars)
to 1.439 trillion marks (847 billion dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that by the end of 1996, of the world's currency
reserves that totaled about 1.45 trillion dollars, the mark
accounted for 14.5 percent, next to the US currency, with 62.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
This pointed to high confidence in the German currency,
Bundesbank said, adding that even economic problems in Germany did
not affect the confidence.
</P>
<P>
It meanwhile stressed the need for the future euro to enjoy the
same esteem as the mark from the very beginning so as to ensure a
smooth transition, which it said meant that there should be an
"uncompromising adherence" to the euro membership criteria set in
the European Union Maastricht Treaty.

<HEADLINE> US Says Russia Sells No Missiles to Iran as Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it did not believe that Russia has sold missiles to Iran as
reported by a U.S. newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not believe that Russia has transferred
the missiles talked about in the Washington Times story, to Iran,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a regular news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
A report by Bill Gertz in the Washington Times today said that
Russia is selling advance air-defense systems to Iran, including
the latest version of a hand-held anti-aircraft missile.
</P>
<P>
Such transactions would violate a pledge Russian President
Boris Yeltsin made during the 1994 summit with U.S. President
Bill Clinton to block all new conventional arms sales to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe there has been a sale. And we do not believe
there has been a transfer of any kind of those weapons, the
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons that Bill Gertz talked about
in his story this morning," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conclusion was made "based on our
conversations with the Russian government at the very highest
level" and "all the intelligence information available" to the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Russia and Iran are discussing the sale, Burns said,
"I cannot confirm that."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: EU-Med Conference Ends in Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The deadlock in the Middle East peace
process has shrouded the second European-Mediterranean conference
in tense atmosphere, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival here from Valletta, Malta, where the conference
was held, Moussa said the two-day conference failed to agree on a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
"It witnessed some differences on the wording of some of the
final document's articles," he said, adding that among the
controversial articles was one on the developments of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The participants haggled over the exact text on peace in the
Middle East and how to achieve it with Arab delegates insisting on
a denunciation of Israel. But the Europeans preferred a weaker
language, a stance of looking forward rather than condemning
wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
"The tense atmosphere of the Middle East was gripping the
conference and contacts conducted on the edge of the gathering to
ease the peace crisis have been salient," he said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy met today in
Valletta, in the first direct official meeting between the two
sides since the peace process plunged to the worst crisis in its
seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa said the gathering was not seeking a solution
to the Palestinian cause but rather dwelt on ways of cultivating a
Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in different domains.
</P>
<P>
He called the Valletta conference was a continuation of the
1995 Barcelona plan to promote partnership forged between 15 EU
countries and their 12 south Mediterranean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who leads the Egyptian delegation to the conference,
said he will submit a detailed report to President Hosni Mubarak
on the outcome of the conference and the obstacles that impeded
the issuance of the conference's final document.
</P>
<P>
He will also brief Mubarak on the contacts he conducted on the
sidelines of the conference with Arafat and the foreign ministers
of Arab and European countries who participated in the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona conference set up a goal to establish an EU-Med
free-trade zone by 2010 through forging partnership with Algeria,
Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria,
Tunisia, Turkey and Palestine.
