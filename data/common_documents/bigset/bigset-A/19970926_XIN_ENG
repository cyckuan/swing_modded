<HEADLINE> S. Leone Official Barred from IMF Annual Meeting: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- West African diplomats in
Freetown said today that the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has barred Joe Amara Bangali, Sierra Leone's Secretary of State
for Finance, from attending its current joint annual meeting in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One diplomat told Xinhua that a letter was sent to Bangali who
was appointed by the military regime in Sierra Leone in June by
the IMF secretariat, stating that "only persons representing
governments that have international recognition and support are
eligible to attend the (Hong Kong) meeting."
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised over this ugly development," Bangali told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"When the (military) government came to power, and I took
office as Secretary of State for Finance, I informed the IMF
secretariat about my appointment, and that of Christian Kargbo,
governor of the Central Bank, and Simon Carew, Financial
Secretary, so they cannot say they were not aware."
</P>
<P>
According to Bangali, the IMF secretariat informed him about
the Hong Kong meeting and extended an invitation for him to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fund's judgement should not be influenced by the
nature of the political regime of a country nor should it
interfere in the domestic or foreign politics of member states,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been looking forward to participating in the meeting
and deriving all the benefits due from such participation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The military government of Major Johnny Paul Koroma said after
the May 25 coup that it will continue "strict budgetary
expenditure and the structural adjustment program (SAP)" which
the IMF has instituted under the ousted civilian government but
the IMF has suspended all programm since last June.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Disposal Squad Rushes to Pak Explosion Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A bomb disposal squad from
the Pakistan Army has rushed to a tribal region, where about 30
people died Wednesday in an explosion, to clear all the remaining
explosives there, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 people were reportedly killed and dozens injured in
an explosion in an arms shop Wednesday evening in Bajaur, around
80 kilometers northwest of Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North
West Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
However, the cause of the explosion was not immediately known
and investigations were in progress, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb disposal squad has gone there at the request of Bajaur
 to help clear the area around the shop, where a large quantity of
unexploded ammunition lies littered, to avoid any more damage to
human life and property, they said.
</P>
<P>
Being a semi-autonomous tribal region, Bajaur, inhabited mainly
by Pashtoons, enjoys a special status in Pakistan and is ruled
according to local traditions enforced by tribal chiefs.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Create Scholarship Fund for Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has revealed that his government will set up a massive
scholarship fund for needy and high-achieving students.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship fund is expected to receive at least one
billion dollars (720 million USD) in seed money from the federal
government, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which will begin operating in 2000, will be designed
to provide thousands of university or college scholarships to
low-and moderate-income Canadians.
</P>
<P>
An endowment of this size would result in a 50-million to 70
million-dollar pool of cash on which to draw each year, a fund
that Chretien said would stand as his government's most
significant project to mark the millennium.
</P>
<P>
"On a very personal level, I hope (the fund) will be able to
do, in a different era, for many, many thousands of young
Canadians what my parents were able to do for me and my brothers
and sisters," Chretien said while making the announcement in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be "another dividend" of the elimination of the
federal deficit, and details will be made public later this year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative was denounced by Brad Lavigne, national
chairman of the Canadian Federation of Students.
</P>
<P>
Even with the availability of a few thousand scholarships, it
will only help "a small percentage of students with access to
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The solution is a national system of grants, not a merit-based
scholarship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the move was welcomed by William Leggett, president of
Queen's University.
</P>
<P>
The announcement "is a very welcome move" because it represents
an attack on student debt loads, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's an important initiative. I hope that this leadership will
be followed by the provinces," Leggett added.

<HEADLINE> UK World Trade Gap Narrows to 450m Pounds in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's world trade deficit
for July narrowed down to 450 million pounds (725 million US
dollars), compared with a deficit of 950 million pounds (1.5
billion US dollars) in June, according to official figures
released today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that exports rose
by 4.2 percent in July while imports were 0.7 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
The figures were lower than City economists' prediction of a
deficit of around 500 million pounds (805 million US dollars), and
the ONS said that much of the improvement was due to a one-off
sale of a 400 million pounds (644 million US dollars) oil platform
to Norway.
</P>
<P>
Another reason was that there was little sign that sterling's
appreciation was hurting exports so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ONS also announced today that Britain's August
trade deficit with countries outside the European Union (EU)
swelled to 359 million pounds (578 million US dollars), compared
with a revised figure for July of just 62 million pounds (99.8
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of exports to non-EU countries fell 7.7 percent, while
imports dropped 3.4 percent, said the ONS.

OTTAWA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The overall government
spending on culture fell for the sixth straight year in Canada in
1995/96, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's federal, provincial and municipal governments

<P>
Adjusted for inflation, the spending was down 1.3 percent from
the previous year, and 6.5 percent down from the peak in 1989/90,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's cultural spending is primarily financed through
government appropriations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Obstructing Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today accused the United
State for obstructing the completion of the first six-month stage
of the oil-for-food deal starting last December.
</P>
<P>
Some of these contracts which provide humanitarian goods to
sanctions-hit Iraq still have not been approved by the
U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee due to U.S. hindrance,
said Iraqi Minister of Culture and Information Hamam Abdul-Khalek
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food and medicine badly needed
for the Iraqi people who are suffering the sanctions imposed
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, which has been extended for another six months,
each contract must be approved unanimously by all the sanction
committee members. The U.S. has alleged that Iraq could use some
of the imports for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Citing one example of U.S. troublemaking, Khalek said a
contract for the purchase of 100 first-aid vehicles is still being
suspended.
</P>
<P>
He called Washington to put an end to such practices and not to
repeat them during the second stage of the oil-for-food deal.

UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of
the United Nations Kofi Annan today urged U.N. member states to do
all in their power to increase official development assistance to
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of the U.N. Security Council
on Africa here, Annan said "the best way of ensuring peace and
security in Africa is to promote sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
"Releasing funds for development and supporting Africa are
important aims of my reform proposals," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said external financing will continue to be of vital
importance for Africa besides the latter's mobilization of
internal resources.
</P>
<P>
He said a successful strategy should combine poverty
eradication with growth in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"To alleviate poverty in the short run and eradicate absolute
poverty, development assistance should be directed to poor rural
areas," he went on.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more action to relieve African countries of
their heavy debt service burden.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. will continue to work closely with the
Organization for African Unity and other regional organizations in
African peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
International community should promise a mature relationship
with Africa, offering the prospects of targeted assistance and
support "based on common goals and shared analysis," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Orders for Durable Goods Surge in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods increased strongly in August resulting from a
record surge in demand for electrical equipment, U.S. Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last more than
three years -- rose by 2.7 percent to a record seasonally adjusted
186.6 billion dollars last month, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the gain came from a 28.4 percent jump in electronic
and other electrical equipment, the largest increase on record
since the government began keeping track in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Excluding electronic orders, durable goods orders declined by
1.7 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment, the only other category to
show substantial strength, gained by 5.2 percent as a large
increase for aircraft offset declines in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production,
decreased by 1.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 181.3 billion
dollars, the first drop in three months.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the big gain in orders and the decrease in
shipments, the backlog of unfilled orders rose 1.1 percent to a
seasonally adjusted 501.1 billion dollars, the third gain in four
months.
</P>
<P>
A rising backlog can signal production bottlenecks ahead but
some analysts said that the backlog increase was the result of a
temporary decline in shipments caused by the United Parcel Service
strike.

UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan pushed his reform package at the
meeting of the foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement here

</P>
<P>
"A reformed United Nations will be a more relevant United
Nations in the eyes of the world," he told the ministers, adding
that it will restore the General Assembly to its proper role as
the democratic, universal expression of global demands.
</P>
<P>
He called the General Assembly which is holding its 52nd
session the "Reform Assembly", to show his will for reform.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the member states to consider the reforms in an
integrated manner and as a package. He said that his reform
package should be dealt with and decided upon "as early as
possible."
</P>
<P>
He said that a reformed United Nations will tackle more
effectively the ills no one nation can defeat on its own: the
degradation of the environment; the trade in arms and illegal
drugs and transnational crime; and the plague of disease and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
He added that a reformed United Nations will also bring back
into those countries which "have sometimes distanced themselves
from our collective efforts," to create a United Nations that is
truly united in pursuing these vital endeavors.

<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The 22-member Arab League today
condemned the renewed Turkish military incursion into Iraqi
territory early this week, calling for immediate withdrawal of
troops.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the Arab League Secretariat
denounced that the Turkish military action was carried out under
the false pretext of handling an internal problem inside the
territory of another country.
</P>
<P>
Such an action constitutes a flagrant violation of the
sovereignty and the territorial integrity of an AL member state,
and of international laws and the U.N. Charter, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined the organization's resolve to
safeguard Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, adding the
AL is following with the utmost concern the on-going Turkish
military operation.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said that the objective
of the Turkish troop incursion into north Iraq is not to occupy
it, but to "clean" the region from the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK) bases.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey
since 1984. About 20,000 people have been killed ever since. The
PKK has bases in northern Iraq as Baghdad lost control of the
region after the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Discusses Oil Imports With Saudi Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today discussed trade, especially oil imports,
with Saudi Arabian Second Deputy Prime Minister Prince Sultan Bin
Abdul Aziz in Cape Town, the South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a 20-minute meeting, Mandela said
there would be further talks on bilateral trade later today and
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, both men were tight-lipped on whether they touched
upon the widely reported 7-billion-Rand (1.5-billion-U.S. dollar)
arms deal between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he did not wish to disclose details at this
stage.
</P>
<P>
"We of course are great friends with Saudi Arabia and I can't
predict what will be discussed in the next few days," Mandela
said in response to a question about the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the deal will involve the sale
of South Africa's G-6 self-propelled artillery systems and
anti-aircraft guns to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
As a counter-trade arrangement, South Africa was offering to
buy oil from Saudi Arabia, reports said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa now imports more than two-thirds of its fuel from
Iran and wants to reduce its reliance on that country, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince, who is also defense minister, will also meet
with South African Defense Minister Joe Modise and Mineral and
Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna.
</P>
<P>
The prince arrived at midnight Wednesday in Cape Town after
technical problems of his plane delayed his scheduled arrival at
about 1 pm (1100 GMT).
</P>
<P>
A state banquet in honor of him on Wednesday night had to be
cancelled and Mandela held a private luncheon today instead.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is South Africa's largest trade partner in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South African exports to Saudi Arabia were 364
million Rand (about 78 million dollars) and imports from the Gulf
state were 943 million Rand (about 200 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has visited Saudi Arabia for at least three
times, will go to Riyadh again in November, according to SAPA.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Slightly Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
inflation rate has dropped by 0.4 percent in August owing to
lower food prices, Central Statistical Service (CSS) figures
released today showed.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index dropped to 8.7 percent in August from
the disappointing 9.1 percent in July, South African Press
Association quoted CSS as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the monthly food consumer price index was
attributed to lower prices of meat, fats and oils and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase for all items excluding food was 0.3
percent, largely due to higher prices for alcoholic and
non-alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, cigars and tobacco, and fuel
and power.
</P>
<P>
Kimberley, a city 450 km southwest of Johannesburg, saw the
highest inflation rate of 10.5 percent, while the lowest rate of
6.9 percent was reported for the Free State goldfields.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Calls for Peaceful Solution to African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier
and Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen today called on the
parties concerned in African Countries to settle conflicts and
disputes through consultation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that owing to historical reasons and
various complex internal and external factors, the situation in
Africa remained fluid. Particularly, since the beginning of this
year, local turmoil and conflicts had occurred form time to time.
</P>
<P>
Qian said with abundant natural resources and great potential
for economic development, Africa was an integral part of world
economy. There could be no world peace without stability in
Africa. Nor could there be prosperity in the world without the
development of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China heartily rejoiced over the positive changes in
Africa and appealed to the parties concerned in those African
countries caught in civil strifes to set store by the fundamental
interests of their countries and people, and settle the conflicts
and disputes through peaceful consultation so as to turn hostility
into friendship and restore peace and tranquillity to these
countries at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
China hoped that all ethnic groups and tribes in Africa would
strengthen their solidarity and work together for peace and
development in their respective countries, and China had supported
African countries on making their own choice of the political
system and the road to development in light of their respective
national conditions and opposed any external interference in the
internal affairs of African countries, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China maintained that the international community, the United
Nations included, should pay attention to the African issues,
seriously consider the reasonable propositions and demands of
African Countries, including OAU, the Arab League and other
regional organizations, support and co-ordinate with African
countries in their efforts to safeguard regional peace and
security, and fully respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of African countries while handing their problems, Qian
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Continue Tough Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of talks
between the Russian Federation and the breakaway Chechen republic
on a comprehensive treaty began on Thursday, facing an uphill
struggle, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Secretary of Russia's Security Council Ivan
Rybkin, the parties of the negotiations insist on their positions.
Grozny is seeking an inter-state treaty, while Moscow -- a
power-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin said that Moscow has prepared its proposals on the
treaty to be signed by Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, and the parties would also discuss the
agreements on joint defense and economic space.
</P>
<P>
Moscow proceeds from the standpoint that the Chechen republic
will be given maximum independence, maximum authority and maximum
freedom within the framework of the Russian Federation, Rybkin
said.
</P>
<P>
The key problem is about special status of Chechnya, he
emphasized and said that he had handed over a draft
Russian-Chechen power sharing treaty to Chechen negotiators at a
meeting of the joint Russian-Chechen commission in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, spokesman for the Chechen president Kazbek Khadzhiyev
said today that the preparation of an inter-state treaty with the
establishment of diplomatic relations as well as joint agreements
on defense and economic space is a clear position of the Chechen
delegation at the Moscow talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "there can be no talk about power-sharing
between the federal center and Grozny at the negotiations."
"Russia and Chechnya are separate states," Khadzhiyev said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 47 percent of
Russians hope that Chechnya would remain Russian territory, but
only 13 percent believe Russia must bring troops to the breakaway
republic and use force if relatons become totally hostile,
Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A poll taken recently by the Public Opinion Foundation among
1,500 urban and rural dwellers suggests only some 41 percent of
Russians believe the best way to settle the Chechen problem is to
allow Chechnya to secede from the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed 31 percent of Russians continue to see the
North Caucasus republic as part of the federation, while 35
percent have begun to see it as an independent republic, the
Russian news service said.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Production Better Than Estimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) - World wheat production is put 2
million tons higher at 588 million tons, mainly resulting from an
increase in the figure for China, International Grains Council
(IGC) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of minor revisions for various countries
bring down the total for world trade by 1 million tons to 93
million tons, IGC said in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
Forecast exports are higher for Canada, but reduced for the EC
and the United States. The figure for world consumption is 2
million tons higher at 584 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Feed use is projected to rise to 98 million tons mainly because
of larger availabilities in Central/Eastern Europe, Russia and
other CIS countries, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
As far as coarse grains are concerned, higher estimated for the
EC, the Ukraine and Australia offset a reduction for the United
States, to raise the figure for world production by 2 million tons
to 877 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Despite updates for several importers in Far East Asia the
total for world trade remains at 92 million tons, IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Exports from China are forecast 0.5 million tons higher at 3.1
million tons, prompting a corresponding decrease in those from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Following minor adjustments to estimates for several countries,
IGC said, world coarse grains consumption is now put 3 million
higher at 895 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Protocol on Beira Corridor on the Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique
and Malawi are due to sign a memorandum of understanding before
the end of this year to pave way for the future development of
the Beira Corridor, a Zimbabwean minister said today.
</P>
<P>
The current Beira Corridor is a railway and road network
running between the Zimbabwean eastern border town of Mutare to
the Mozambican port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a symposium on the Beira Corridor
development in Mutare, Zimbabwean Transport and Energy Minister
Enos Chilowore said, following several meetings of the joint
technical unit, a draft memorandum of understanding was produced
and was currently being studied by the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
The joint technical unit comprising representatives of the
four southern African countries recommended that the draft
memorandum be considered at the committee of ministers meeting to
be held in Beira next month, Chilowore said.
</P>
<P>
"It is envisaged that the signing ceremony will take place in
Beira by the end of this year," the minister told 100 delegates
from business and government circles.
</P>
<P>
The corridor was envisaged to assist in the promotion of trade
and investment both in the southern African region and
internationally, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister lamented low levels of joint venture businesses
among southern African countries, saying this situation was as a
result of existing tariff and non-tariff barriers, fluctuating
border charges and rigid visa regimes which inhibited meaningful
trade and economic linkages in the region.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Accuses Israel of Attempting to Murder its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Hamas Amman
office said today that the office head, Khalid Mashiel, faced an
assassination attempt by Israel, but this was denied by Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Nazal, official of the militant Palestinian movement
stationed in the Jordanian capital of Amman, said in a statement
faxed to Xinhua that two Canadians tried to kill Mashiel with an
electrical device this morning in front of his office.
</P>
<P>
the statement said the incident happened when Mashiel left his
car for the office, adding that his two security guards fought
back the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas statement said one of the guards was injured and
later hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
It said that the incident was an assassination attempt
against Mashiel and that the Israeli security departments were
behind it.
</P>
<P>
But the statement said Hamas was not frightened by such
attempts and it would continue to fight its enemies.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government, however, dismissed the incident as
merely a quarrel between the driver of Mashiel and two Canadian
tourists, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe told the press that Mashiel was not on the scene of the
incident at the time of the quarrel, during which Mashiel's driver
and the two Canadian tourists were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Mutawe said that Jordanian police detained those involved in
the quarrel, searched the tourists' car, but found no arms.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened amid increased Arab-Israeli tension here
triggered by an ambush against Israeli diplomats Monday outside
the Israeli embassy in Amman, during which two Israeli security
guards were wounded, and the attackers are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is one of
the two Arab countries that have diplomatic relations with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks out Between Somali Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting reportedly
broke out in Somalia between the militiamen of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) in and
around the important town of Baidoa on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the region said the fighting began at about noon
local time yesterday in the village of Qurunjis, 8 km south of
Baidoa, where the RRA maintain a strong militia base.
</P>
<P>
There are contradicting reports over the casualty figures
caused by this latest fierce fighting around the town of Baidoa,
245 km south of Mogadishu, the capital. Sources from the RRA
said at least 21 people were killed during the fighting which
continued until last night. The RRA admitted that their forces
have lost four fighters and seven others suffered gun shot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the fighting broke out when the forces of the RRA
launched an attack on the Airport of Baidoa, destroying one of
Aidid's armed personnel carriers in the field. Mohamed Ali Aden
Qalinle, RRA spokesman here in Mogadishu, has claimed the upper
hand in the fighting. He said his forces were provoked by Hussein
Aidid's men at their base in Qurunjis, 8 km south of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Other sources close to the militia commanders of Hussein
Aidid, put the number of fatalities to 9. However, there's no
independent confirmation regarding the opposing claims. The VHF
radios of Baidoa still remain out of the air since Wednesday
afternoon when the fighting had intensified.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word yet from Hussein Aidid's side over
the fighting. However, travellers from Ballidogle Airport, 90 km
south of Mogadishu, said they have seen large militia regrouping
at the airport which they thought would be a reinforcement plan
to Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
This new round of fighting is taking place at a time when
there is a large peace delegation touring the two regions of
the Rahanwein communities, Bay and Bakol. Radio South Mogadishu
supporting Hussein Aidid said last night that there has been
peaceful demonstrations in the region of Bakol in support for
the reconciliation among the Rahanwein people in the area led
by Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein, a former parliament
spokesmen and a prestigious elder of the Rahanwein.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen introduced China's
new opening policies to his German counterpart during a breakfast
meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Qian was invited to the breakfast by Klans Kinkel, German Vice
Federal Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Both the host and guest
expressed their pleasure for the approaching 25th anniversary of
the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their satisfaction for the positive growth
of the bilateral relations, saying that China and Germany have
good prospect for furthering their relations and enhancing their
cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Kinkel on the 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party, Qian said the Congress had worked out a blueprint
for China's development well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
China will push out new measures and take up different means to
exercise the public ownership, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to open its market and increase
exchanges with foreign countries in economic, trade and
technology. The country's service sector will also open to the
outside gradually and steadily, said the Chinese vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that China's new reforms and opening to the outside
world will add fresh strength to the cooperation between Germany
and China in such fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that Germany supports China's efforts to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) at an earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on other international and regional

<HEADLINE> Euro Ruling Puts in Doubt 40 Years of Courts Martial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of British Service
personnel tried by courts martial since the 1950s could have their
convictions quashed after the system of British military law was
ruled unlawful by the European Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The Strasbourg-based European Court ruled Wednesday that Paul
Coyne, an ex--corporal in the RAF, was unlawfully found guilty by
court martial in 1994 of forging a senior officer's signature to
obtain a large sum of money while serving in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Millions of pounds in damages may have to be paid by the
British Ministry of Defense (MoD) after the European Court found
court martial not to be "fair, independent or impartial,"
according to a report in today's Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The Euro ruling applies to the courts martial procedures since
they were drawn up by the Army Act 1955 and raises the possibility
of a challenge to every decision up to April 1 this year when the
system was modernized.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers campaigning for an overhaul of British military law
welcomed the ruling as a significant victory but government
sources said that the reforms meant court martial had been made
fully lawful.
</P>
<P>
An MoD spokesman was quoted as saying: "On April 1, 1997,
Parliament brought into force reforms to the court-martial system
as part of the Armed Forces Act 1996."
</P>
<P>
"In the Government's view, the new arrangements are more than
adequate to ensure both the actual and apparent independence of
court martial as a tribunal and will enable the court-martial
system to continue to meet the Armed Forces requirement to
administer justice firmly but fairly," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: China Attaches Importance to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- As a permanent member
of the Security Council, China had all along attached importance
to Africa, Qian Qichen, Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister of
Foreign Affairs, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Africa held by
the United Nations Security Council, Qian said China had supported
African countries in their just struggle for the maintenance of
national independence, state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and in their efforts for economic rejuvenation and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
China had stood for the settlement of differences and conflicts
within Africa through peaceful consultation, and China believed
that African countries were fully capable of resolving their
internal conflicts and disputes, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the past years had seen visits to
Africa by the Chinese President, Premier and Vice-Premiers of the
State Council, and ministers, including Minister of foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said China and African countries had made considerable
progress in their friendly relations and cooperation, and in the
years to come, China would continue to unswervingly support the
just propositions and reasonable demands of African countries,
strengthen its friendly relations and cooperation with them and
make its contribution to peace, stability and development in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Qian called for an early establishment of a just and equitable
new international political and economic order so as to create a
good external environment for the stability and sustained
development in Africa and to ensure a lasting peace and
development there.

<HEADLINE> PNA Condemns Israeli Decision to Build More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today strongly condemned the
Israeli government's plan of building more housing units in
Efrat, south of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The settlement expansion decided by the Israeli government may
lead to violence, Faisal Husseini, PNA Minister of Jerusalem
Affairs, was quoted as saying today by Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qureia, Speaker of the Palestinian Council, said in Gaza
today that "Netanyahu's declaration to build 300 new housing
units in Efrat is taking one more step to the killing of the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday night
that his government will continue to bolster the Jewish
settlements in the West bank and plans to build an additional 300
housing units for Jewish settlers in Efrat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government today defended its settlement expansion
decision by saying that this plan was not made by the Netanyahu
government, but by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Salah Ta'amri, a Palestinian Council member elected from
Bethlehem, angrily told the Israeli Radio this evening that the
Netanyahu government is telling the lie. It is the Netanyahu
government that made the decision to build more housing units in
the West Bank, not the previous one, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also
criticized this plan, saying that she does not regard it as
consistent to the kind of climate for negotiations that she
wanted to create.

charge of buying stolen computers during unrest last year.
</P>
<P>
The police, which has been in high gear to crack down upon
armed robbery in the country, stormed the offices of Philip
Wesseh late Wednesday and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
Philip Wesseh was released several hours later in the night as
"the police have no clear evidence to prosecute him on charges of
criminal malevolence," said a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
The police took Philip Wesseh away "because he has some criminal
charges to answer", said police chief Joe Tate, quoted by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Wesseh was accused of buying looted computers for his
newspaper in April last year when the most horrible factional
fighting in Liberia's seven-year-old civil war broke out in the
capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The police suspected him to be involved in armed robbery, the
BBC said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Wesseh denied the
allegation, saying his newspaper had bought some computers in the
United States, while others had been donated by a U.S.
humanitarian, Rev. Philip Saunders.
</P>
<P>
The inquirer was among many news organizations that were
torched by both rebels and police during the factional fighting,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Wesseh without a warrant has led to some
criticism on the part of the police, but Tate reportedly said: "I
like criticism" because it could help improve his job.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Irish delegation
pledged Ireland's continued support for Zambia, especially in the
civil service restructuring and social sector.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which is in Lusaka to attend the second annual
consultative meeting of the Zambia-Ireland bilateral cooperation,
reafirmed Ireland's commitment to supporting the country's
traditional sectors in water sanitation, primary education,
upgrading of unplanned settlements and improving primary health
care institutions.
</P>
<P>
A positive characteristic of the Irish aid has been the
involvement of local communities in the projects in its effort to
build local capacity and the capacity of the ownerships of the
programs, acting Zambian Finance Minister Peter Machungwa said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The programs have a common factor as they all assist the low
income groups to improve their life quality, Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa assured the delegation that the Zambian government
is committed to the restructuring of the civil service through
the public sector reform program.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also expressed Ireland's willingness to assist
Zambia in strengthening institutions related to human rights and
good governance.

<HEADLINE> New School Year Endangered in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A major rift among Sierra
Leone's teachers emerged today to threaten the beginning of the
new school year next month as staff disagreed over whether they
want to work under a military government.
</P>
<P>
The military administration, which came to to power in May
after ousting the legitimate government through a coup, has
announced that primary school classes will resume on October 6
and secondary education on October 19.
</P>
<P>
But the National Executive Committee of the 18,000-strong
Sierra Leone Teachers' Union (SLTU) issued a response calling on
members to "ignore both dates and continue their stay-home
defiance".
</P>
<P>
All schools and universities have been closed since the May 25
coup, affecting almost 150,000 pupils and students, according to
a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The SLTU executive committee said last week that staff should
only go back to work if the military returns power to the
civilian government and if all outstanding salaries and
allowances of teachers are paid in full.
</P>
<P>
However, a committee of concerned teachers has rejected the
stance,issuing a statement saying that the "majority of
teachers are ready to serve the nation in conjunction with any
government of the day."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ministerial-level
Meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations on Africa
ended here today with a Presidential statement on Africa which
called for concerted international effort to promote peace and
security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the security council reiterated its
commitment to Africa in keeping with the purposes and principles
of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Council also reiterated the principles of political
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all
member states.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council noted that African states had made
significant strides towards democratization, Economic reform, and
respect for and protection of human rights in order to achieve
political stability, peace and sustainable economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
The Council remained gravely concerned by the number and
intensity of armed conflicts on the continent, which threatened
the regional peace, caused massive human dislocation and
suffering, perpetuated instability and diverted resources from
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed the responsibility of all
member states to settle their international disputes by peaceful
means and its own primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the important contributions of the
Organization of African Unity as well as those of subregional
arrangements, in preventing and resolving conflicts in Africa,
and looked forward to a stronger partnership between the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity as well as
subregional arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council fully supported the engagement of the
United Nations in Africa through its diplomatic, humanitarian,
economic development and other activities.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the importance of the commitment of the United
Nations through the United Nations High Commissioner For
Refugees and other humanitarian organizations to assist the
efforts of African states to address the humanitarian and
refugee crisis in accordance with international humanitarian
law.

<HEADLINE> European Shares down on Weak Wall Street, Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mainly lower Thursday, undermined by a weaker dollar, Wall
Street's opening losses and strong US economic data which made it
possible for US to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index in London ended down 0.23 percent or
11.7 points at 5,065.5, but above the day's worst levels.
</P>
<P>
Volume was swollen by a Shell dividend options related deal,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The market showed little reaction to Britain's global and
non-European-Union trade figures, which saw smaller than forecast
deficits.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index on the Frankfurt market which ends before Wall
Street opens, ended more than one percent or 46 points higher at
4,148.58, supported by a stable dollar and strong car stocks,
although dealers said trading was thin.
</P>
<P>
However, in later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended
46.02 points down at 4,104.93, depressed by a weaker Dow, a
further fall by the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed 18.39 points lower at 3,005.38
on profit-taking and a fresh downturn on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
But losses were checked by relief that the French government's
1998 budget draft law contained nothing unexpected.

<HEADLINE> Israel Defends Settlement Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel today defended its
decision to build 300 housing units in the Efrat settlement in
southwestern Jerusalem, arguing it was resulted from the "natural
growth" of population.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Fogel, director of the Government Press Office, told
reporters that the housing plan was definitely within the boundary
of the existing settlement and did not constitute the construction
of a new one.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Wednesday
night that Israel would build 300 more housing units in Efrat and
areas around it.
</P>
<P>
Fogel, who is also the Israeli government spokesman, said the
plan was originally approved by the previous Labor government,
which later decided to freeze settlement activities to push
forward peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment on whether the settlement decision
implied a refusal to the request by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for a "time-out" of unilateral actions by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During her first Mideast trip early this month, Albright called
on both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to
refrain from taking unilateral steps that are detrimental to
reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Efrat settlement project has sparked strong reactions from
the U.S. and the PNA who warn against repercussions on peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin has quoted Albright
as saying that the new housing plan would not contribute to the
calming of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA President Yasser Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi
today described the plan as a "land mine" on the road towards
peace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition politicians also rose to attack the new
housing project, saying it could ruin the chances for peace.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid blasted Netanyahu for quelling any
new hopes for peace whenever they emerge.
</P>
<P>
High-level talks are expected to be held in New York between
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Arafat's deputy in the PNA
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) on exploring ways to reactivate the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peacemaking has been deadlocked since March
when Israel started building Har Homa settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem, that the Palestinians want as the capital of a future
state.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Army Should be Country Builder: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's military forces
should be a peace maker and country builder at the same time,
noted Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Maputo Heroes' Square marking the 33rd
anniversary of the founding of the Mozambican People's Liberation
Army, Joaquim Chissano, the Mozambican president and Commander In
Chief of the army, said that "liberation does not merely mean the
raising of the national flag, what it means more is the struggle
to build the country."
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the facts that some southern African
countries were purchasing weapons, Chissano said that there were
no enemy in the region, so the military forces should not be
developed in this consideration.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulations letter to the army Wednesday, Chissano
said that at the time dominated by peace, military forces should
never be regarded as a war machine, but should be seen as an
impetus for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He called for a united and disciplined army with virtue of
respecting human beings.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that during his recent tours to the central
Mozambican province of Sofala and the southern province of
Inhambane, he saw people enjoying stability and economic
development. The big efforts made by the Mozambican people to
build their country in the past 33 years since independence are
worthwhile, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mateus Ngonhamo, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Mozambican Defense
Forces, said Wednesday that apart from safeguarding the nation's
sovereignty and interests, the army should have a close
relationship with the people in their effort to develop the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, 1964, Mozambican people fired the first shot
in their struggle for national independence from the colonial
rule in Chai district of Cabo Delgado Province.
</P>
<P>
The day was named as Mozambican People's Liberation Force Day
in 1975 when Mozambique won its independence.

<HEADLINE> Germany Lifts Virus Alarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- German health authorities today
corrected their earlier suspicion that the death of a Ghanaian man
last weekend in a German hospital could be traced back to an
infection of the Lassa virus.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Ghanaian died on Saturday in the western German
city of Mainz after admitting himself to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
He had been suspected of dying of the deadly Lassa fever which
regularly hits regions of West Africa and could claim the lives of
up to 40 percent of those infected. The Lassa virus is
transmissible through rat urine or human body fluids including
sweat.
</P>
<P>
But the Health Ministry of the western German state of
Rhineland-Palatinate said today that two blood tests at a Hamburg
institute had confirmed that the man had not died of the Lassa
fever, or any other highly infectious disease like Ebola.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ministry also stopped the the medical
supervision on about 120 people who had come into contact with the
Ghanaian.
</P>
<P>
The actual reason for the man's death will be announced after
the autopsy results come out on Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Astronaut to Russia's Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) today announced that
American astronaut David Wolf will blast off for the Russian space
station Mir on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wolf, 41, will spend the rest of this year aboard Mir because
the mission poses no "unnecessary peril," NASA administrator
Daniel Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
Wolf was scheduled to blast off with the rest of the crew of
space shuttle Atlantis at 10:34 p.m. EDT for a rendezvous with the
troubled Russian space station.
</P>
<P>
The problems on Mir include a collision with another
spacecraft, a fire and repeated computer failures, Goldin said at
a press conference at the headquarters of NASA here.
</P>
<P>
Goldin said his decision to go ahead with the joint
U.S.-Russian program was informed by independent reviews of the
station's safety.
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded shuttle-Mir (program) has a thorough review
process that ensures continued American participation on board Mir
and does not put human life in unnecessary peril," Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision should be based and is based on scientific and
technical assessment of the mission's safety and the agency's
ability to gain additional experience and knowledge that cannot be
gained elsewhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Goldin said that besides reviewing three separate reports on
Mir's fitness, he talked to Wolf.
</P>
<P>
Citing that 20-minute conversation, Goldin said Wolf felt the
risk of the shuttle's ascent was greater than the risk aboard Mir,
but that this was an acceptable risk.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't wish to inflict this pain on any human being,"
Goldin said of the decision-making process. "I don't sleep nights
and there's only one thing on my mind, for weeks now: the safety
of our American astronauts."
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. congressmen and scientists oppose Wolf's space trip
arguing that it is not safe as so many problems have appeared in
the Mir.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Bans Media Coverage on Fatal Bus Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman from Egypt's
Interior Ministry explained today that the reason behind the ban
on reporting the deadly bus attack in downtown Cairo is to
facilitate investigations into the crime that killed 10 people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the explanation in a telephone conversation
with Volkhard Windfuhr, Chairman of the Cairo Foreign Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
"This restriction aims at speeding up and facilitating the
ongoing investigations," Windfuhr said in a letter faxed to Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
The ban issued Wednesday at the request of the Interior
Ministry applies to "all Egyptian and foreign media and
journalists based in or visiting Egypt," Windfuhr said. It
requests reporters "to refrain from covering and publishing any
items related in any form to the military court's investigations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The September 18 attack killed nine German tourists and an
Egyptian driver.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, concerned over the impact of the recent attack on its
tourist industry, has repeatedly described the attack as an
isolated act instead of an organized crime targeting tourists. It
also warned against any "overstatement" by the media coverage.
</P>
<P>
The military prosecution taking over the case from the state
security Monday night has begun probings with the two suspects,
Saber Mohamed Farahat and his brother Mahmoud Farahat.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak last weekend ordered the transfer of
the case to military prosecutors, who handle most of the cases
involving Muslim militants who have been fighting a five-year
violent war against the secular government.
</P>
<P>
The case is expected to be referred next month to a military
judiciary court, where cases can usually have a speedy trial.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Parliament Discussing Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan parliament started
debate today on constitutional reforms bill under which some laws
charged as "oppressive" will be repealed and the power of the
president reduced before the impending general elections.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Attorney-General Amos Wako, when presenting the bill to
the 200-seat parliament, said the bill is based on the reform
package drafted two weeks ago by lawmakers from both the ruling
Kenya Africa National Union ( KANU ) and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The bill will repeal the law allowing detention without trial,
allow political parties to hold party meetings without licenses
and opposition parliamentary members to visit their constituents
without permits.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) was compelled over
the new law to air variant views and to allocate free air time to
registered political parties during elections, said Wako.
</P>
<P>
The law banning certain publications considered unpalatable in
the country will also be amended, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill demands that the government either registers all
political parties or formally declines to do so within 120 days.
And the political party which is denied to registration has right
to launch an appeal to the high court.
</P>
<P>
A committee in charge of drafting further reforms package on
constitution after the election and within the next two years
will be established under the bill.
</P>
<P>
Although the bill contains no big changes, it would provide a
more stable and level play field for the elections in which
74-year-old President Daniel arap Moi, the country's president
since 1978, is widely believed to win, KANU lawmaker Gerald
Ndwiga told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It will take the 200-seat parliament, where KANU enjoys a
majority, about three weeks to get the bill reach the third
reading and finally decide whether to translate it into law,
Ndwiga added.
</P>
<P>
Political atmosphere has considerably eased in the country
since the KANU and the opposition formed an inter-parties
parliamentary group and reached consensus on minimum
constitutional reforms earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Pressures on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
called on the international community to extend backings to the
Palestinian people and pressurize Israel into ending its
violations of the signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
In a statement marking the anniversary of the Palestinian
Intifada (uprising), AL appealed to the United States, Russia, the
European Union, China, Japan and other peace-loving forces to
support the Palestinians' struggle for self determination and
establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians held demonstrations and general strikes on
September 25, 1996 to protest Israel's opening of a tunnel in East
Jerusalem with the pretext of exploiting for tourism.
</P>
<P>
AL said what Israel had done in Jerusalem violated the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements which stipulated that the status of
the city be discussed during the final phase of negotiations
between both sides.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the final phase of negotiations has become a
question with the peace process remaining deadlocked since last
March when Israel started the controversial Har Homa settlement
project in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The AL's statement held Israel fully responsible for the grave
consequences of the practices for threatening the Arab nature,
Islamic and Christian characteristics of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> German Bank Sees Better Chance for Euro's Punctual Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Researchers of Germany's largest
commercial bank, the Deutsche Bank, today said that they are
expecting a 80 percent chance for the punctual start of the
planned single European currency, the Euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank researchers also believed that the Euro could
come in 1999 with a large participation, including Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland,
Finland, Spain, Portugal as well as Italy.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Italy, however, would still depend on its
implementation of the 1998 budget plan and its social reform
plans, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the researchers, the Euro's outlook have been
improved particularly by the strengthening political support from
Germany as well as France's 1998 budget plan.
</P>
<P>
After a heated Euro debate during the summer, most of German
politicians now apparently moved to support a punctual start of
the Euro, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 1998 budget plan also boosted France's chances
to cut its budget deficit next year to less than 3 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) as required by the Euro standards,
the German researchers added. They also predicted that France
might also be able to move close to the 3-percent target this
year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Works to Tap Farming Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has given priority to
investment in the agricultural sector in a bid to tap its vast
farming potential.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya Ng'andu, Director-General of Zambia's authoritative
investment center disclosed in Lusaka Wednesday that the center
has drafted policies to encourage investment flows into the
undeveloped sector, an English newspaper The Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
according to Ng'andu, investors are allowed to import all
agricultural implements free of duty, which is a fairly
attractive incentive.
</P>
<P>
Scondly,the agricultural income flow is taxed at a lower level
of 15 percent and the machinery can be depreciated within two
years. This means that a farmer can write off the full value of
equipment within two years, charging 50 percent in the second
year.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, investors in agriculture are also entitled to
developmental allowances.
</P>
<P>
Through implementation of these new policies, the Zambian
government hopes the country, which highly relies on copper
exports, can become the " breadbasket" of Southern Africa due to
its existing vast potential.
</P>
<P>
The government also expects Zambia to become an ideal
investment location and the agricultural sector to become a
growing point in the single-product economy.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is a landlocked country with a population of about 9
million and a territory of 752600 square kilometers. Apart from
its mineral deposits, its main resource is cultivatable land.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 9 million hectares of cultivatable land, only
1.44 million hectares has been exploited up to now.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's tropical climate, modified by altitude, is
comparatively moderate. This makes it possible to grow any
tropical or sub-tropical crops, vegetables and horticultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Zambia also has plenty of water resources, covering 45 percent
of water resources in Southern Africa. Abundant water in rivers,
lakes, and underground water readily available and reasonable
rainfall, allows the country for continuous irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia is one country where anything grows. If you finger in
the ground and water it, it will probably grow," said Ng'andu,
when joking about the country's farming potential.

Through implementation of these new policies, the Zambian
government hopes the country, which highly relies on copper
exports, can become the " breadbasket" of Southern Africa due to
its existing vast potential.
</P>
<P>
The government also expects Zambia to become an ideal
investment location and the agricultural sector to become a
growing point in the single-product economy.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is a landlocked country with a population of about 9
million and a territory of 752600 square kilometers. Apart from
its mineral deposits, its main resource is cultivatable land.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 9 million hectares of cultivatable land, only
1.44 million hectares has been exploited up to now.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's tropical climate, modified by altitude, is
comparatively moderate. This makes it possible to grow any
tropical or sub-tropical crops, vegetables and horticultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Zambia also has plenty of water resources, covering 45 percent
of water resources in Southern Africa. Abundant water in rivers,
lakes, and underground water readily available and reasonable
rainfall, allows the country for continuous irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia is one country where anything grows. If you finger in
the ground and water it, it will probably grow," said Ng'andu,
when joking about the country's farming potential.

<HEADLINE> Qian: China Willing to Enhance Ties with GCC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to
further enhance its cooperation with the nations of the Gulf
Cooperation Council for the Arab States (GCC) in all the fields,
said Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen here
today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks during his meeting with foreign ministers
and representatives from the six GCC member states -- Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates --
at the headquarters of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
They are here attending the 52nd session of the U.N. General
Assembly which opened on September 16. Senior officials from China
and the GCC countries hold regular meetings and dialogues each
year at the U.N. sessions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two sides said that such dialogues show
that both sides are willing to enhance their mutual trust and
cooperation and they should make full play of such mechanism to
push forward their long-term, stable and comprehensive partnership
of cooperation in view of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the cooperation between China and the GCC in
trade and economy has developed well in recent years. The two
sides have the potentiality in further cooperation in all the
fields including economy, energy, science and technology, finance,
information as well as management.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent successful convention of the National
Congress of the Communist Party of China and Hong Kong's return to
the motherland have increased the opportunities for China to
expand its economic and trade relations with other nations. He
hoped that the government and enterprises in China and the GCC
nations could make greater efforts for the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
GCC ministers agreed with Qian and expressed their strong will
to further their economic and trade cooperation with China. They
said they will work together with China to seek new opportunities
for cooperation in economy, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
On the Gulf situation, Qian stressed that China, as one of the
members of the U.N. Security Council, has always attached
importance to safeguarding peace and stability in the Gulf region.
It is willing to increase its dialogues and cooperation with the
Gulf countries in this area.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers expressed welcome and thanks to China for the
stance.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Qian noted that China is
deeply concerned with the troubled peace process in the region,
and hopes for an early restart of the process.
</P>
<P>
He said China holds that the U.N. resolutions on the Middle
East should be fully observed; the principle of "land for peace"
should be adhered to; all the parties should continue to implement
every agreement that has already been reached; and all the forms
of terrorism should be opposed.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the common goal for the people of
every nation in the world, the Chinese vice-premier said. China is
willing to work together with the international community for a
lasting peace and stability in the Middle East, stated Qian.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the GCC's efforts toward this goal.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers said that the Gulf countries value and
appreciate China's constructive role in the international affairs,
expecting China to continue its positive role in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed other international and regional
issues during their meeting.

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today approved a defense bill, killing the
purchase of more B-2 bombers and give President Bill Clinton a way
to extend the Bosnia troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
The 247.5 billion U.S. dollar bill, passed by a vote of 356-65,
requires the approval of the full Senate before going to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Heading off a veto battle, House and Senate negotiators who
crafted the bill gave way on Bosnia and the B-2, two of the most
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
The bill still contains language cutting off funding for the
Bosnia troop deployment by next June 30 and allowing the president
to spend money expanding the B-2 bomber fleet.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton can decide to spend the B-2 money repairing
and modernizing the existing fleet of 21 B-2s as he undoubtedly
would firmly oppose buying any more of the 2 billion U.S. dollar
stealth bombers.
</P>
<P>
On Bosnia, Clinton could remove the funding cutoff merely by
coming to Capitol Hill by next May 15 and explaining why and how
the Bosnia mission must be extended.
</P>
<P>
The final version of the bill represents a major concession by
the House. Earlier this year, the House voted to impose a strict
funding cutoff that would prohibit Clinton from spending money on
the troop deployment beyond June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the B-2 bomber, the House wanted to spend 331 million U.S.
dollars as a down payment on nine more B-2 bombers, with a total
price in the coming years of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Senators agreed with the administration in opposing more B-2s.
On Bosnia, the final version of the bill reflects the Senate view
that while a longer deployment to Bosnia may prove necessary,
Clinton must come to Congress and clearly explain his reasons
before the deployment can be extended.
</P>
<P>
The bill would add 3.6 billion U.S. dollars to Clinton's
request for defense spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,
representing a 5.1 billion U.S. dollar increase over this year's
defense spending level.

<HEADLINE> Albright Renews Call for Freeze on Jewish Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's latest decision to build a new Jewish settlement in
the West Bank was "unhelpful" for peace and renewed her call for a
freeze on any such provocative move.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced Wednesday that there will be 300 more
Jewish homes in construction in Efrat in the West Bank. The
announcement came less than two weeks after Albright urged Israel
to take a "time out" from expanding settlement during her trip to
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a U.N. press conference, Albright said, "We have
made it quite clear that this particular building is not at all
helpful as we try to get the peace process going again."
</P>
<P>
"I am calling across the board again for a time out on actions
that make it more difficult to have successful negotiations,"
Albright added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said it was very important to have a good environment
for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, but
Netanyahu's latest actions "make it more complicated to have us
act in a role that we would like to, to bring the parties together
in order to have successful negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been blocked since March
when Netanyahu broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem, seen by Palestinians as the capital of a future state.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Reversing Resegregation Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today appealed to Americans to reverse a trend toward
resegregation when speaking at a ceremony to marked the 40th
anniversary of the day when nine black students integrated a
Little Rock high school in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"Far too many communities are all-white, all-black, all-Latino,
all-Asian. Indeed too many Americans of all races have actually
begun to give up on the idea of integration, and the search for
common ground," news reports quoted Clinton as telling a crowd
gathered outside the front steps of Central High School.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, 1957, a group of students now known as "the
Little Rock Nine" desegregated the school under the presence of
Army troops enforcing a court order.
</P>
<P>
The black students were taunted and spat on by angry whites
when they attended school.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a podium in front of the doorway that the nine
students entered, Clinton said that 40 years ago today, the Little
Rock Nine "climbed these steps, passed through this door and moved
our nation, and for that we must all thank them."
</P>
<P>
"What happened here changed the course of our country forever,"
he said. "For surely it was here at Central High that we took
another giant step closer to the idea of America."
</P>
<P>
But there was much work left to be done, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Today children of every race walk through the same door, but
then they walk through different halls, not only in this school
but across America, they sit in different classrooms, they eat at
different tables, they even sit in different parts of the
bleachers at the football game," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a trend toward rolling back affirmative action programs
granting preferences to minorities in education "is slamming shut
the doors of higher education on a new generation."
</P>
<P>
"Segregation is no longer the law, but too often separation is
still the rule," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said "there is still discrimination in America," and "it is
wrong, and we have to keep working on it, not just with our voices
but with our laws, and we have to engage each other in it."
</P>
<P>
After he spoke, the now middle-aged Little Rock Nine walked up
the steps to the sound of applause, and walked into the school
with Clinton holding open the door in a symbolic gesture.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Up to Four-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned
homes in the U.S. rose by 3.3 percent in August to the highest
level in nearly four years, according to a report from the U.S.
National Association of Realtors made public today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that existing homes sold at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 4.32 million in the month, the highest
since December 1993,
</P>
<P>
The increase followed a revised 4.18 million unit rate in July
and many economists had expected a slight drop in home sales in
August.
</P>
<P>
The report had been scheduled for release Friday. But it was
reported in a newsletter and confirmed by the Realtors today.
</P>
<P>
By region, sales rose 6.5 percent in the West, 4.4 percent in
the South, 3.3 percent in the Midwest. But they fell 4.8 percent
in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, sales of the existing homes for the first eight
months of this year totaled 4.16 million, up 1.8 percent from the
same period of last year. Total sales in 1996 were the best in 18
years.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Defends Its Probe in Gulf War Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense
Department today said that it opposes the removal of its role in
the Gulf War illnesses probe, defending its way in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The Pentagon is fully capable of conducting its own
investigation," Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters,
acknowledging that early Pentagon investigations were not handled
well.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen praised Defense Department staffers for "an
extraordinary effort" in the past year. "I think Dr. Rostker has
done a superb job," he said. Bernard Rostker is the Pentagon's top
official dealing with the subject.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion to hand over the investigation to a committee
outside the Pentagon is contained in a draft of a report that a
White House advisory committee is scheduled to give to President
Clinton by October 31.
</P>
<P>
The committee reportedly said the Pentagon's credibility
continues to erode and another agency or outside body could better
handle investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon called the White House draft
disappointing considering the volume of work and research the
Pentagon has done in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon "will continue to be as open as we can on this,"
he said. "We do not oppose oversight.... We do oppose taking it
away from the Pentagon and giving to a medical school or some
other agency," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Rostker said, "It's a very unfair rap to say, `You were bad in
'94, and therefore you can't be trusted again.'... I've been at
this for a year, and I just do not buy the story about
credibility."
</P>
<P>
He said he has conducted 13 in-depth investigations into
specific events where potential exposure might have occurred and
has met around the country with veterans and their organizations,
members of Congress and the news media.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Gulf War veterans suffer from a syndrome varying
from joint aches to an eyesight loss.

<HEADLINE> US FTC Launches Antitrust Investigation on Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission is investigating whether Intel Corp. violated the
antitrust law by trying to monopolize the market for computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
The FTC notified the company about the investigation Wednesday
and it was the second time in less than five years that the U.S.
government probes the largest chip-makers in the world, The Wall
Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, makes the
microprocessors that are the brains of 85 percent of all personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
Intel said its lawyers were reviewing subpoenas and would
cooperate with the FTC.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. FTC said it wanted to determine if Intel had acted "to
monopolize, attempt to monopolize or otherwise restrict price or
non-price competition in the development or sale of microprocessor
or other computer components or related intellectual property."
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the FTC conducted a similar investigation, then
declared that no additional action was called for and that the
probe was closed. Intel said it expects the new investigation will
end the same way.
</P>
<P>
The FTC probe follows Intel's planned 420 million-dollar
purchase of Chips &AMP; Technologies Inc., a maker of graphics chips.
Some graphics-chips companies have expressed concern about Intel's
entry into the market.
</P>
<P>
In its latest acquisition, Intel said this week it would buy
Dayna Communications, a small Salt Lake City-based maker of
hardware that helps link together computers in networks.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Criticize Textbook For Use In Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Experts here today strongly
criticized a textbook compiled by Taiwan authorities because of
its distortion of history and attempting to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The textbook, titled "Understanding Taiwan", was published in
February and was used on a trial basis for grade-one middle school
students in Taiwan in September. It has three volumes, dealing
with history, society, and geography.
</P>
<P>
Members of China's National Review Committee of Textbooks for
Primary and Middle Schools pointed out that the new textbook
distorted history, deliberately cut links between Taiwan and the
mainland, and prettified Japan's colonial rule in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this was to instill a notion of separating
Taiwan from the mainland and Taiwan as an "independent political
entity" in the minds of young people, in an attempt to seek
"Taiwan independence", critics said.
</P>
<P>
Since ancient times, they pointed out, Taiwan has been an
inseparable part of China and the ethnic groups in Taiwan have
been members of the Chinese nation as a big family. People across
the Straits have been as closely linked as flesh and blood,
sharing the same Chinese culture. The people in the mainland and
the Taiwan compatriots have joined hands and made brilliant
contributions to the development and construction of Taiwan, the
critic said.
</P>
<P>
However, the textbook disregards history and says not a single
word about the Chinese nation and Chinese civilization, but vainly
attempts to replace them with so-called "Taiwanese" and "Taiwan
Spirit".

<HEADLINE> Bonn Considers Use of Spy Service to Monitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- German government today
confirmed that it was considering authorization for the country's
foreign intelligence service to monitor Scientologists abroad.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman made the confirmation after the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported such a move could lead to
international complications with Washington.
</P>
<P>
"In the Unites States... senior intelligence service officials
belong to Scientology," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Final decision has yet to be made on the issue. The idea was
criticized today by the opposition Greens Party during a
parliamentary debate on sects, which it said could intensify the
conflict with Washington over Scientology's treatment.
</P>
<P>
Scientology has been put under surveillance by domestic
security service in Germany after interior ministers from the
country's 16 federal states decided earlier this year that the
organization posed a possible threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
This move groups Scientologists with the country's neo-Nazi and
extreme leftist parties.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato has accused Germany of restricting
freedom of religion with regard to Scientology. In response,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said last Monday the claims
were "intolerable" to a free country as Germany and that
Scientology was a business and not a religion.
</P>
<P>
He also described Scientology as a "quasi-totalitarian"
organization.
</P>
<P>
Following Kinkel's statement, the United Nations announced that
it would look into the Scientology issue in Germany and present a
report to the UN Human Rights Commission in the next spring.
</P>
<P>
German politicians stressed the treatment to Scientology came
as a result of the country's historic experiences.
</P>
<P>
Roland Kohn, a deputy for the Free Democratic Party, a
coalition partner in the Bonn government, said, "In Germany we
have a concept of defensive democracy: no freedom for the enemies
of freedom regardless of whether they appear in the guise of
religion or not."

<HEADLINE> Canada's Industrial Product Price Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's industrial product
price index rose 0.7 percent in August following two months of
decline, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the increase was due to the rise in the value of
the U.S. dollar, the federal statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The August increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the
Canadian dollar raised the value in Canadian dollars of all export
prices quoted in the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
This increased the month-to-month change in industrial prices
from 0.4 percent to 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In August, the most significant industrial price change in
Canada was the overall price level for gasoline and fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
Other price changes of note were those for exported motor
vehicles, some non-ferrous metals, and pulp and paper products.
</P>
<P>
The 12-month change in Canada's industrial prices remained at
0.9 percent for a third consecutive month in August, the agency
said.

KIEV, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian mobile telephone
operators have complained about a government plan to impose a tax
on cellular network, saying that would raise call prices by more

</P>

The Ukrainian parliament gave an approval on September 17 to a

minute of network traffic. The rates for domestic calls now range
from 0.5 to 25 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Mobile Communications (UMC) said that about 40
percent of its potential clients would be lost after the tax is
imposed. UMC offers mobile telephone services based on the NMT-450
and GSM-900 standards.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time our government is trying to impose an
excise tax on a service rather than a commodity," said Valeriy
Posnikov, spokesman for Golden Telecom, which operates a GSM-1800
cellular telephone network in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Both firms warned that the tax would cost rather than earn
money for the government due to a shrinking market.
</P>
<P>
Posnikov estimated a treasury loss of 8.3 million dollars in
value-added and corporate income taxes as mobile calls would
decrease following introduction of the tax.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S.-based Motorola Company cancelled a
plan to invest 500 million dollars in its own cellular phone
network in Ukraine for fear of the government's constant rule
changes.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Begins Debating Campaign Finance Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
began debating a long-stalled proposal to change the way campaigns
are financed.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Democrat legislators have been
pressuring the Republican-led Congress to debate the issue, while
Senator Mitch McConnell, head of the National Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, has vowed to kill the reform
proposal.
</P>
<P>
That bipartisan bill, written by Republican Senator John McCain
and Democratic Senator Russell Feingold, would ban so-called
"soft" donations that are largely unregulated and can be used only
for generic party activities.
</P>
<P>
The alleged misuse of "soft" money last year by both parties is
one of the central aspects of current controversy.
</P>
<P>
Democrats had expected to wait weeks for the proposal to be
brought up after securing Republicans' consent Tuesday to consider
it. However, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott pushed it quickly
to the floor in a clear attempt to blunt criticism that
Republicans were obstructing the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Experts Criticise Taiwan Textbook (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The textbook also debases normal exchanges across the Taiwan
Straits, putting on a par the migration of the people from the
mainland to develop Taiwan and the invasion of Taiwan by the
Netherlands, Spain and Japan, calling the latter "international
competition", the critics pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In talking about the Japanese invasion of Taiwan and its
colonial rule, the book not only plays down the hardships of the
compatriots across the Straits in their fight for Taiwan's return
to the motherland, but also sings praise of Japan's cruel rule and
plundering, and prettifies the period of Japanese colonial rule by
calling it a time of promoting Taiwan's modernization.
</P>
<P>
Critics pointed out that, under the pretext of introducing
local culture to students, the textbook actually attempts to
spread the idea of splitting the motherland, and will only harm
younger generations.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to split the motherland by using the textbook
compiled by a small number of people in Taiwan have met with
strong opposition from the people of Taiwan. Some Taiwanese with
greater insight have written articles criticising the splittist
plots and calling for a revision of the book.
</P>
<P>
Critics here called on Taiwan authorities to respect history,
conform to the will of the Chinese people, and make a thorough
revision of the book.
</P>
<P>
They also expect Taiwan counterparts in education to edit
textbooks to follow the principle of seeking truth from facts,
being responsible for the young and for the future of the Chinese
nation and safeguard the unification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Gains at 3.3 Percent Rate in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased
at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the second quarter of this
year, according to a revised report released today by the U.S.
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the sum of
all goods and services produced within U.S. borders -- was down
from a torrid 4.9 percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the deceleration mainly resulted from the
sharp drop of consumer spending, which accounts for about
two-thirds of the U.S. economy. The spending slowed from a 5.3
percent growth rate in the first quarter to just 0.9 percent in
the second.
</P>
<P>
But businesses kept the economy advancing at a healthy rate by
building their inventories and investing in new equipment at the
fastest rate in 14 years. Businesses investment on capital
equipment soared at a 23 percent annual rate, the highest since
the fourth quarter of 1983.
</P>
<P>
The real change in business inventories added a 0.8 percent
percentage point to the second-quarter change in real GDP after
adding 1.8 percentage points to the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services increased by 18.4 percent in the
second quarter, comparing with an increase of 9.9 percent in the
first. Imports increased by 20.5 percent, comparing with a gain of
17.9 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The overall 3.3 percent growth rate represents a revision from
the 3.6 percent estimate announced a month ago. Smaller export
growth than shown last month is the primary source of the
revision.
</P>
<P>
The various changes put the U.S. economy's output in the second
quarter at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 7.16
trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that inflation has been well behaved and
analysts now believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will hold
rates steady when its policy-makers meet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A measure of inflation tied to the GDP rose at a mere 1.8
percent annual rate in the second quarter, the smallest in five
years and down from 2.4 percent in the first.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright rebuked
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for promising to build
300 new homes on the West Bank. She has repeatedly called for a
"time out" unilaterally provocative actions like new construction
in disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
-- The House and Senate passed a spending bill that would open
an avenue for President Clinton to extend the stay of American
troops in Bosnia, where a crucial voting is scheduled for autumn.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Speaker Newt Gingrich ruled out any chance that the House
would pass the major bipartisan proposal for overhauling campaign
finance that has been advanced in the senate. The Senate majority
leader Trent Lott suddenly decided to bring up campaign fiance
legislation for floor debate Friday, weeks earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration will seek new powers that would
allow federal inspectors to block imports of fresh fruits and
vegetables that don't meet U.S. food safety standards. The
proposal, to be announced next week, is one element of a four-part
administration program aimed at improving the safety of both
foreign and domestic produce.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Tobacco firms would pay penalties based on how popular their
brands were among underage smokers under a proposal by Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. The company-by-company
proposal was as specific as Shalala got during testimony before
the Senate labor panel about President Clinton's plan for
toughening the proposed national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton commemorated a crucial early civil-rights victory by
holding open the door of central High School in Little Rock, Ark.,
for nine African-Americans who braved a gantlet of treats and
racial taunts to integrate the school 40 years ago. The president
said that while segregation has been outlawed, "too often it is
still the rule."

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Muslim Congress
(WMC) will soon despatch a delegation to Afghanistan to buttress
the efforts of the United Nations to bring peace to the
war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the delegation will be decided within 10
days and "we have some impartial names in mind" who can help
handle the delicate Afghan situation, said WMC Secretary General
Zafar ul Haq at a press conference here today after the conclusion
of a three-day WMC conference.
</P>
<P>
Zafar said the WMC had contacted the Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia, who now control two thirds of the Afghan territory, and
their rival northern alliance, and "found there was a scope to
continue peace efforts."
</P>
<P>
The conference attended by delegates from 33 countries focused
on the specific problems of the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The scholars and experts to the conference also debated on
issues including terrorism, drug trafficking, refugees and
juvenile delinquency.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Fail to Reach Aviation Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States
failed to reach an aviation agreement at a renewed round of talks
ended here today, but agreed to hold the next round in Washington
in the week starting October 20, Japanese officials said here.
</P>
<P>
During the current talks beginning Monday, the U.S. negotiators
sought a transitional agreement to break the impasse while
shelving their long-held demand for complete liberalization of
route selections, frequencies and flights between and through the
two countries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Complete liberalization means giving U.S. and Japanese
airliners freedom to decide on flight routes, capacity and
frequencies as long as certain criteria like safety and slot
limitations are met.
</P>
<P>
Japan opposes the concept, which it says would enable the more
competitive U.S. airliners to dominate the potentially lucrative
Asia-Pacific market.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, U.S. negotiators also urged Tokyo to allow 91
new weekly flights, but Japan insisted on permitting only 70,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides failed to eliminate differences on
how to calculate the number of passengers and other flight
standards in a third-country, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, referring to the next round of talks, Japanese vice
transport minister Hiromichi Toya who led the Japanese team, said
he is not certain whether any agreement could be reached.

Central Committee and Central Military Commission without fail,
and safeguard the supreme authority the Party's third-generation

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that he and US President Clinton will jointly set the
guidelines for Sino-US relations for the 21st century based on the
principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is to meet with Clinton in the US in October. During a
meeting with US Treasury Secretary Robert Robin, Jiang said that
he expects to discuss a wide range of issues including Sino-US
relations and the international situation to push bilateral
relations into a new stage of healthy and steady development.
</P>
<P>
This is in the fundamental interest of the two countries'
people, he said, and beneficial to world peace, stability and
development. Present Sino-US relations are good, with high level
exchanges increasing, economic and trade ties developing steadily,
and co-operation and exchanges in other sectors expanding, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-US relations are now facing a good opportunity of
further improvement and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin is here as the head of a US delegation for the 10th
conference of the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee. The committee
was formed by Deng Xiaoping and former US President Jimmy Carter
in 1979, and has met for ten conferences, playing an active role
in mutual understanding and stimulating economic and trade
co-operation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has just
concluded its 15th National Congress, which elected the new
leaders of the Central Committee, and made strategic arrangements
for China's trans-century development.
</P>
<P>
China's reforms and opening up have entered a new historical
stage, Jiang said, expressing confidence that the Chinese people
will advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Rubin conveyed President Clinton's best regards to President
Jiang and congratulated the CPC on the successful conclusion of
the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the Party Congress will have a far-reaching
impact on China's reform, opening up and modernization drive in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Clinton is expecting President Jiang's
state visit to the US and the US side has a good reason to believe
that the visit will serve as a milestone for mature, solid and
stable Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
US and China have carried out mutually-beneficial co-operation
and exchanges in the economy, trade, and finance and will see new
progress in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin asked Rubin to convey his best regards to
President Clinton. enditem

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- World Muslim Congress (WMC)
called here today for a permanent seat in the U.N. Security
Council for the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Being about one fourth of humanity which has a global presence
and reach, the Muslim world "should strive unitedly for a
collective permanent seat in the Security Council of the United
Nations Organization," the WMC said in a declaration after the
conclusion of a three-day international conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference, "Muslim Ummah in the Next Century," deliberated
upon the various problems faced the Muslims all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"For too long has the Muslim Ummah been put on the defensive,
with international sanctions operating against some of its active
members," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"It is, about time that the Ummah asserted itself by reversing
the game and turning the tables on its adversaries," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Ummah, the declaration said, "needs to highlight and fight
for its just Islamic causes, collectively, by applying sanctions
against its aggressors and enemies."
</P>
<P>
"No unilateral dealings with the enemies should be permitted,
unless justice is assured," it added.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also called for the institution of an Islamic
Human Rights Commission as "some aggressive circles" in the west
mis-use the issue to interfere in the affairs of Muslim states.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Desertification Under Way in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Crowning 10 years of
relentless efforts to fight desertification, Algeria has made
achievements in checking the rampant disaster across the country.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries said today
progress has been made in checking the spread of desertification
in about 84 percent of the total area of the country.
</P>
<P>
A so-called "Green Dam Project" has been implemented for
afforestation of a 1,200-kilometer tract extending from the
western end of the country eastwards.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian People's Army played an outstanding role in the
anti-desertification campaign. It undertook the afforestation of
some 108,000 hectares of pastoral desert lands and sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has also been trying to raise
the awareness of the people and change their outlook toward nature
in an intensified campaign to bring desertification under control.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has 7.5 million hectares of arable land, a merely 3
percent of the country's total area. On the other hand, the
pastoral lands which are immediately threatened with
desertification amount to 8.7 million hectares, taking into
account that 40,000 hectares of agricultural land are annually
lost to sand invasions.
</P>
<P>
Algerian experts blamed torrents, wind and scarcity of water
for the worsening of environment, which led to drop in
agricultural production, shrinking of natural wealth and food, and
decline of fertility of the soil.
</P>
<P>
They call upon local Algerian authorities to earmark more funds
for projects to safeguard forests, expand afforestation and
protect them against fire. Meanwhile, they advise expediting
classification of forest trees to suit the particular
characteristics of the soil.
</P>
<P>
But the threat is still there. In order to effectively control
desertification, the Algerian government will have to undertake
tremendous and long-term actions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today urged the nation's leaders to redouble their efforts
during the last nine months of his term to attain the remaining
tasks on the government's economic, social and anti-poverty
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the appeal to cabinet members, legislators,
representatives of the business community and leaders of other
sectors at the closing of a one-day national consultative
conference on socio-economic development at the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
"We must redouble our efforts to aggressively pursue the
government's remaining components of the economic, social and
anti-poverty agenda just as we strive to prepare our country and
people more competitively for the coming century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said his administration had worked hard during the past
five years and the Filipino people are only beginning to taste the
benefits of the government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the remaining months of his term, apart from
consolidating the gains the government has achieved, "We must work
together to insure that they are not eroded, but instead, nurtured
to bear more fruits", he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier at the opening ceremony of the conference,
Ramos called anew for greater unity, solidarity and team work
between the government and the citizenry to "weather the storm" in
the economy caused by recent speculative attacks on the peso and
other Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Ramos reminded the conference participants that it was "unity,
solidarity and teamwork" that had made the country economically
progressive and politically stable for the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Qatar to Host Doha Summit As Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doha, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Qatar will host the fourth
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) summit as scheduled on
November 16-18 despite a possible boycott by some Arab countries,
informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Doha remained firm on convening the
conference as scheduled," said a diplomat here who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
"Though some of Arab countries will boycott the summit, other
Arab states are expected to send delegates to Doha, but at a
lower level," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
have announced their boycott of the summit due to Israeli
participation, Many Arab states would most likely send businessmen
instead of governmental delegations to Doha.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent decision by the Arab League kept the
possibility even much bigger and left Qatar determined to host the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the Arab League during an Arab foreign
ministers' meeting held last week in Cairo, granted Arab
countries rights of making free choices, instead of a concerted
boycott.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar was satisfied with the decision. Its worries about a
joint boycott have gone away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the conference are underway and the Qatari
Ministry of Information has received nearly 600 applications from
journalists in and outside the country to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
The controversial summit to include Arab states, Israel and
their partners in the industrialized world was launched in
1994. Its last session took place in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon and the PNA voiced boycott of the summit in
protest against the deadlock in the Middle East peace
process. They had boycotted all the previous three.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia also favored a
boycott, saying they would not appear at the conference unless
major achievements are made in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Most of other Arab states adopt a wait-and-see stance towards
the summit. Qatar officials said they have not received any
refusal from these countries.

CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Asaias
Afworki will start a two-day visit here tomorrow to hold talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak with a view to enhancing bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the fourth since 1993, Afworki is to hold
consultations with Mubarak on bilateral, regional and
international questions and coordinate stances on a number of
issues, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>

The Afworki-Mubarak talks will specifically cover the
Yemen-Eritrean dispute over the Hanish Islands, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sea island of Greater Hanish, which the Eritreans now
controls, is one of three islands claimed by Yemen and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The two sides pledged to refrain from any action or military
operation until the ruling by an arbitration court is made under
the Yemen-Eritrea Arbitration Agreement signed in Paris in October
last year.
</P>
<P>
As for bilateral ties, the two sides will endeavor to overcome
"some obstacles," the MENA said without elaborating. It said
Eritrea is interested in making use of Egypt's experience in
implementing its economic reforms.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Bahamian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that China treasures its relations with the Bahamas and
is ready to cooperate with the Bahamian side in promoting the
steady development of bilateral friendly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended a warm welcome to visiting Bahamian Prime
Minister Hubert Ingraham, and asked that he convey best wishes to
Bahamian Governor-General Orville Turnquest.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President noted that Ingraham's visit to China
shortly after the establishment of Sino-Bahamian diplomatic
relations is a true indication that the Bahamian government and
prime minister attach great importance to the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the current China tour will enhance mutual
understanding and friendship and will lay a solid foundation for
furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China and the Bahamas, both of which are developing nations,
share similar historical experiences and both are faced with the
tasks of national economic development, improving the living
standards of their people and safeguarding world peace, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, according to Jiang, Ingraham resolutely
decided that the Bahamas would "sever diplomatic ties" with
Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China. Jiang expressed his sincere appreciation for
the Bahamian decision.
</P>
<P>
"China has consistently held that all countries, big or small,
strong or weak and regarless of geographical locations, should be
equal members of the international community," said Jiang. "We
believe that bilateral relations based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence will enjoy smooth development."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Bahamas gained independence 20-odd years ago
and has since made unremitting efforts to safeguard its national
independence and sovereignty, revitalize its national economy and
improve the living standards of its people. He also noted the
achievements the nation has scored in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Bahamas has pursued a policy of
nonalignment, tried to promote friendly cooperative ties with
other countries, positively promoted the integration process in
Latin America and the Caribbean, and is playing an increasingly
important role in regional issues.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope your country will continue to record new
achievements in various fields," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Ingraham noted his pleasure in visiting China and meeting Jiang
so soon after the two nations forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to gain a better understanding of China and to
further enhance friendly bilateral relations and cooperation
through this historical visit," said Ingraham.
</P>
<P>
Ingraham briefed Jiang on cultural and education undertakings
in his country, and expressed the hope that the two nations will
increase exchanges, especially exchanges between high-ranking
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefed Ingraham on the convocation of the 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), with the latter
congratulating the Chinese president on the successful congress
and his reelection as General-Secretary of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu Xijie, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and vice-minister of Communications, and Bahamian
Foreign Minister Janet Bostwick also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ingraham is the first Bahamian prime minister to visit China
since the two nations established diplomatic relations in May this
year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Acts to Mitigate Impact of El Nino Phenomenon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has stepped up
measures to mitigate the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon
on agriculture, Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national consultative conference on
socio-economic development presided by President Fidel Ramos,
Escudero said the measures being taken by the government include
cloud-seeding, fast-tracking of irrigation projects and
construction of small water-impounding facilities and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, multisectoral task forces have already been
organized at the regional, provincial and municipal levels
nationwide to help implement government strategies to minimize the
impact of the expected dry spell, he said.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a recurrent global climate abnormality that can
cause prolonged dry season and drought or excessive rainfall in
short periods.
</P>
<P>
Escudero said the government has also launched an information
drive on El Nino, water conservation and other measures to lessen
the harsh impact of the abnormal weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
The government is giving priority to El Nino-related projects
that could be completed in 18 months such as the repair of
irrigation dams and canals and the installation of additional
shallow tube wells.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish a
nationwide health education network covering all urban areas and
80 percent of rural areas by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The network will be composed of health education institutes at
different levels and medicare agencies, as well as departments in
charge of publicity, radio and television broadcasting, education,
culture, family planning and the welfare of women.
</P>
<P>
Educational work will focus on food hygiene, maternal and
infant health care, student health, anti-smoking and the
prevention of infectious and chronic diseases, according to an
on-going national conference on health education.
</P>
<P>
Conferees are discussing a long-term program for the next 12
years, and will urge all provinces and prefectures, and 90 percent
of counties to establish health education institutes by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The conferees suggested that 70 percent of township hospitals
should employ health education specialists, and noted that the
network should be expanded to all counties and 95 percent of
townships in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The National Patriotic Public Health Campaign Committee and the
Ministry of Health, sponsors of the education drive, will
introduce a series of quotas to evaluate educational work in
different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The quotas will be used to measure knowledge levels and

<P>
"Health education will be the focus of our efforts to deal with
major public health problems in future," according to Minister of
Health Chen Minzhang. He added that similar measures adopted in
other countries have proved highly effective.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that various chronic diseases, such as
cardiovascular and cerebral diseases, malignant tumors and
diabetes, are emerging as the major health threats to Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Chen warned that China will face serious health problems
resulting from environmental pollution and industrialization by

<HEADLINE> 700 Million Pieces of Coins to Be Delivered to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The local government
confirmed today that it had placed an order for more than 700
million pieces of coins to be delivered to Hong Kong in the coming
months to meet the coin demand.
</P>
<P>
The order brings the total new coins expected to be placed into
circulation in a year to a record 1.1 billion pieces, said a
spokesman for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the new order will be in small
denominations of 10 cents, 20 cents and 50 cents as these are in
greater demand than coins of larger denominations.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that by early next year when all 1.1 billion
pieces are injected into circulation, the current coin shortage
situation will be alleviated substantially," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this quantity of order is unprecedented as
the normal order volume per year is about 300 to 400 million
pieces in the past.
</P>
<P>
The history of coins in Hong Kong exceeds 100 years and the
number of coins outstanding is about four billion pieces. Of
these, it is estimated that about one billion pieces are either
held by collectors or lost during the past decade, leaving three
billion pieces in active circulation now.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States, EU Closer to Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doha, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab states and their main
trade partner, the European Union (EU), have made headway in a
much-awaited planned free trade zone to boost trade relations.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper report today, the two sides
have ironed out most of their differences at two rounds of
negotiations this year and agreed to hold three more rounds on
1998, before an agreement can be initialed.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari weekly Gulf Times quoted unidentified Gulf officials
as saying progress was achieved after the six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) nations edged closer to setting up a customs union,
a prerequisite set by the EU for their free trade pact.
</P>
<P>
"At their talks in Riyadh on June 12, the GCC and the EU
delegates discussed the draft free trade agreement and the EU
agreed on most modifications sought by the GCC," the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said the two partners had removed more
than 80 percent of the hurdles blocking a free trade agreement,
under discussions by the two sides for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Such issues as more EU investment in the Gulf, the environment
and customs tariffs will be settled at the coming talks, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has repeatedly told GCC countries they must unify their
widely varied tariffs before it signs the free trade pact, which
the GCC has sought in a bid to boost exports to the EU and attract
industrial technology.
</P>
<P>
However, GCC states, which control nearly 45 percent of the
world's recoverable oil reserves, argue such a pact is justified
because they do not impose tariffs on most EU products and want
reciprocal treatment.
</P>
<P>
But the EU has voiced fears that removal of duties on Gulf
petrochemical and other exports altogether could result in
dumping European markets with cheap products and threaten the
EU's independent petrochemical industry.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed in 1994 on a gradual removal of the
tariffs but the EU said more negotiations were needed before a
pact is finalized. The absence of a free trade agreement has
combind with lower oil prices and a sharp rise in EU exports to
the Gulf to upset the trade balance between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
From a large surplus in favor of the GCC in the early 1980s,
the balance sharply tilted in favor of the EU, which had a surplus
in the trade of goods and services of around 10.9 billion in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Predicts Boost of S. Africa's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today that the contribution of tourism to the
country's economy could be doubled.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism's contribution to our economy could be doubled at
least from its present 4.5 percent and it has the potential to
create hundreds of thousands of jobs," the president said when
launching a new blue train in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"Government, the private sector and our communities are
working together to realize this potential," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, together with international celebrities from all over
the world and government officials, embarked on a luxury
Pretoria-Cape Town journey on board the new train to boost
tourism and at the same time raise money for his children's fund.
</P>
<P>
"The blue train is a part of the plan to boost sustainable
tourism in South Africa. It has great potential to become one of
the flagships of this growing industry," he said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
It shows that South Africa is ready to meet the exacting
standards of quality and service required in the highly
competitive market of luxury rail travel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The renovated train is said to be the most luxurious in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The train, which was refurbished at a cost of 70 million Rand
(14.9 million U. S. Dollars), is 380 meters long, has 18
carriages.
</P>
<P>
Besides comforts like audio and video, each compartment has
its own bathroom, with either a bath or shower, a telephone,
television and individually controlled air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
The new train will also benefit the tourism sector in Zimbabwe
as it also goes to the Victoria Falls and Hwange in that country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fine example of how linking the strengths of
neighboring countries brings mutual benefits. It is a real
contribution to the development of southern African tourism,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is an important part of South Africa's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said earlier this week that
tourism could generate 40 billion Rand (8.5 billion dollars)
annually and create 2 million jobs if its contribution to the GDP
were raised to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"No other industry has such potential," Jordan told a
conference of the Airlines Association of Southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Cabinet Approves Budget for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
today approved a budget bill for 1998 totalling 75.56 trillion won
(about 84 US billion dollars), up 5.8 percent compared to that of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, per capita tax will increase from 1.95
million won (about 2,133 US dollars) in 1997 to 2.17 million won
(about 2,374 dollars) next year and the tax revenue will account
for 21.4 percent of the national income, rising from the 21.2
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The bill, to be submitted to the National Assembly for approval
by October 2, includes the general account budget of 70.36
trillion won (about 77 billion dollars) and the special account
budget of 5.2 trillion won (about 5.7 billion dollars), increasing
4.1 percent and 36.1 percent respectively compared with the 1997
budget.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998 budget, defense expenditures will grow 6.2

rate since 1984.
</P>
<P>

percent to 11.2 trillion won (about 12.3 billion dollars),

issuing municipal or provincial bonds for investment in local
education and the 10-percent education tax increase.

<HEADLINE> Another Australian Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government was in crisis today with Prime Minister John Howard
announcing he had sacked two of his senior staff and accepted the
resignation of a third minister over mistaken travel claims in
less than a week's time.
</P>
<P>
Howard announced that federal Science Minister Peter McGauran
resigned today after admitting to mistaken travel claims.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also told a news conference that he had
sacked two of his staff members, senior political adviser Grahame
Morris and office manager Fiona McKenna. Howard blamed the two
staff members for what he called their failure to inform him of
the mistaken travel claims.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press said the loss of Morris, who
masterminded Howard's 1996 election victory, is certain to prove
the greatest blow to Howard in a personal and political sense.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters if it was difficult to sack his closest
adviser, the prime minister said: "it's been a very difficult day
... it's a very sad day."
</P>
<P>
McGauran came under fire after admitting to parliament
yesterday he wrongfully claimed about 1,008 US dollars in travel
allowances from 1996.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Administrative Services Minister David Jull and
Transport Minister John Sharp also resigned after it was revealed
that Sharp had secretly repaid almost 9,000 Australian dollars
(6,480 US dollars) in travel claims.
</P>
<P>
Howard described this week as a difficult and painful one.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament last night that one of Jull's staff claimed
to have told Morris and McKenna about the repayment in May.
</P>
<P>
But today the prime minister stood by his claims that he knew
nothing about the secretly paid-back travel claims until the last
few days.
</P>
<P>
"Neither of them (Morris nor McKenna) had any discussions with
me about these matters until the last few days," Howard told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no one was alleging that he was involved in
any cover-up.
</P>
<P>
Federal Opposition leader Kim Beazley today called for a
judicial inquiry into what he called the cover-up of Sharp's
repayment of 6,480 US dollars in travel entitlements.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader called on Howard to stand aside during
the inquiry and "it is not sufficient any longer to simply rely on
the prime minister's word in this regard, a judicial inquiry is
necessary."

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Reject Compulsory Savings Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 90 percent of the New
Zealanders have said no to the compulsory savings scheme proposed
by the New Zealand First party to replace superannuation.
</P>
<P>
Provisional results coming out tonight show that of the 1.72
million votes counted, 92.4 percent oppose the scheme while only
7.6 percent favor it.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.84 votes have been received in the referendum on
the compulsory savings scheme starting on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed scheme, New Zealanders earning over 5,000 NZ
dollars (3,200 US dollars) a year will have to put aside 3 percent
of their income for retirement. The savings target is 120,000
dollars, but the government will top it up for those who cannot
reach the target.
</P>
<P>
With the savings, people will buy an annuity which is expected
to be at the same size as today's pension.
</P>
<P>
A no vote has been expected as opposition to the scheme came
from most of the social sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks with Bahamian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that the establishment of Sino-Bahamian diplomatic
relations has laid a political basis for the two countries to
advance bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks while meeting with visiting Prime Minister
Hubert A. Ingraham of the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Ingraham's current China tour, the first from a
Bahamian prime minister since the country won independence, would
increase mutual understanding and promote Sino-Bahamian
cooperation in every field.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Sino-Bahamian diplomatic relations in May
marked a new phase of the bilateral relationship, Li noted, adding
that China appreciates the decision made by Ingraham to forge
diplomatic relations with China, which showed the prime minister's
far-sightedness.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the trade between China and the Bahamas
has already started and large-scale investment from
enterprises in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
its inland areas has been put into the Bahamas. China is ready to
explore the fields and means of economic collaboration with the
Bahamas according to the international practise, he added.
</P>
<P>
The relations between China and the Caribbean countries have
witnessed new development in recent years, Li told Ingraham. China
has set up diplomatic ties with the Bahamas and Saint Lucia,
established trade representative offices in Haiti
and the Dominican Republic and joined the Caribbean Development
Bank, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that it is China's consistent policy to
expand its friendly and cooperative relations with Latin American
and Caribbean nations, which would serve the common interests
of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Ingraham said he is pleased to visit China soon after the
Bahamas and China forged diplomatic ties, which he described as a
major event in bilateral links. The Bahamian people support their
government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China
and they are looking forward to greater development of the ties
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China, as a big country, has always respected
other countries' sovereignty and independence, especially those of
the small countries like the Bahamas. The Bahamian government and
people appreciate the fact that China never interferes in other
countries' internal affairs, Ingraham told Li.
</P>
<P>
The Bahamas highly praises the six proposals put forward by
Premier Li Peng in his speech at the annual meeting of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Ingraham
said. These proposals protect the interests of the developing
countries and have outlined the principles that should be observed
in setting up rational international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that his country would stick to
the "one China" policy and would not have any kind of official
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the two sides signed an agreement on
economic and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Li Peng presided over a welcome ceremony in
honor of the Bahamian prime minister, who arrived here yesterday
afternoon for a week-long official visit to China at Li's
invitation.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac laid a wreath Thursday at the memorial plaque here,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The memorial plaque features the names of 42 French volunteers,
who created the Normandy-Neman Air Regiment in the Soviet
Union. During World War II, the unit flew a total of 5,240 combat

<HEADLINE> Irrigation Changes China's Farming Methods (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Irrigation has brought great
changes to north China's Loess Plateau, the most arid area in the
country, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The large number of cisterns dotting the region's once barren
land store valuable rainwater used for greenhouses filled with
mushrooms and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Localities in this vast arid area, especially Gansu province,
and the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions which
receive limited annual rainfall of between 350-500 mm, have
introduced measures to construct cisterns and use efficient
water-saving technology to store rainwater needed to irrigate
crops during dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
Related irrigation techniques have effectively increased
cultivated land by nearly 40,000 ha. In addition, Gansu plans to
reclaim another 166,000 ha of wastelands and turn them into
irrigated high-yield fields by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation has greatly altered the traditional cropping system
in north China, according to agronomists, who noted that the new
farming method can serve as a worldwide model for properly using
rainwater in arid areas.
</P>
<P>
However, storing rainwater for irrigation is still in its early
stage, and the vast renewable resource is far from being fully
utilized. The annual rainfall in parts of central and eastern
Gansu and southern Ningxia equal annual runoff entering the Yellow
River, China's second longest river following the Yangtze.

<TEXT>
<P>
Experimental projects in central Gansu show that irrigating
formerly barren farmland will produce yields of some 1,500 kg of
wheat per ha. in normal years, The figure will double with the use
of plastic sheeting alone, and will top 4,000 kg. by combining the
use of both methods.
</P>
<P>
Rainwater irrigation has brought rapid economic development to
the arid area where serious water shortages long bottlenecked
local agriculture and forced people to lead a hard life.
</P>
<P>
The central government introduced a program to build large
water conservancy projects in the area in the 1950s, with water
diversion projects transforming formerly parched land into
irrigated fields.
</P>
<P>
Water tankers introduced to combat drought were ineffective in
rugged arid mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation offers great prospects for agriculture on over two
million sq.km. of arid land in north China, said one American
agronomist, adding "I've climbed the Great Wall twice, and feel
that this project is virtually on the same scale."

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels to Boycott Talks With Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) today warned it will boycott the peace
talks with the Philippine government set for next month if
agreements signed between the two sides are not complied with.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, gave
no specific reason in a statement for the decision but hinted that
the talks are useless if the government is not implementing the
agreements signed on September 3 and 12.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently assessing the compliance of the
government with the agreements on troops repositioning and
administrative guidelines for a general truce signed by members of
the government-MILF subcommittee on the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar believes the government is not complying with the
agreement especially on its pledge to bring back safely evacuees
in Pikit, the southern province of Cotabato, to their respective
villages.
</P>
<P>
Several evacuees were quoted by him as saying that despite the
agreement on the repositioning of troops, some of them who
returned home found government troopers, especially policemen,
still remain in the positions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Major General Raul Urgello, chief of the Army's
Sixth Infantry Division, denied Jaafar's allegation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a local radio station, Urgello said that the
government has complied with the spirit of the agreement regarding
troops repositioning.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said the MILF's decision not to resume the
talks could break the hairline boundary between relative peace and
war here in the future.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government Muslim force
operating in the southern Philippines, with an estimated 25,000
armed members.

<HEADLINE> PNA Shuts Down 17 Hamas Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has shut down 17 Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) institutions in the self-rule areas to exhibit its
determination to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that 16 Hamas-run charities in the
Gaza Strip were closed by Palestinian police, including a
kindergarten, a sport club and a girl school. And a
Hamas-affiliated Television Station was sealed off in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA security forces continued their round up of
Hamas activists. About 200 Hamas and Islamic Jihad members have
been detained in the Palestinian-controlled territories over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
PNA's crackdown on Hamas institutions and its activists came
after Israeli security officials presented evidence that
identified four out of five suicide bombers in Jerusalem attacks
as Palestinians from the West Bank, not from abroad as PNA has
insisted.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's General Security Service, the four who
blew themselves up in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market on July 30
and the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall on September 4, killing 20
Israelis and wounding hundreds, were all residents of Azira
Shamalya, a Palestinian village near Nablus under Israeli security
control.
</P>
<P>
The fifth bomber has not been identified, but is believed to be
Mahmoud Abu Hanude from the same village, the alleged recruiter
and ringleader of the suicide squads.
</P>
<P>
As PNA security forces continued their arrests, Israeli troops
were kept at a high state of alert for fear of more terror
attacks. Israeli security officials claimed that the risk of
further attacks remained as long as PNA left the Hamas
infrastructure intact.
</P>
<P>
However, PNA President Yasser Arafat told reporters that he was
making a 100 percent effort to crack down on terrorists. He denied
responsibility for the suicide bombings, noting that the bombers
came from Area B, where Israel continues to have security
control.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build Its First Science Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
approved the construction of a science park so as to create an
enabling environment to nurture and promote the application of
technological innovations, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The facility, the first in the country, is drafted jointly by
the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology
(ICIPE) and the Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) with a
number of Kenya's leading science institutions, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The park, called ICIPE Technopark, will cover 7.2 hectares in
Nairobi and be constructed in four phases over 10 years starting
January 1998. The whole cost is estimated to reach 500,000 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
It will offer a number of business development services aimed
at supporting new and established enterprises especially those
using bio-technology for the processing, manufacture and
marketing of products such as pesticides, vaccines and insect
traps.
</P>
<P>
The services include quality assurance and improvement in the
production process with due consideration to environmental issues
such as the reduction in waste generation and maximizing the use
of energy.
</P>
<P>
Other services include promotional activities and product
awareness campaigns, entrepreneurial workshops and seminars,
market feasibility studies and consumer surveys.
</P>
<P>
The park will also provide biotechnology laboratory analytical
services and facilities for technology exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
ICIPE plans to commercialize its research findings through the
high-tech park after more than a quarter century of research on
human health, agriculture and livestock development in Africa,
said ICIPE Director-general Hans Herrens.
</P>
<P>
EPZA Chief Executive Silas Ita said he expects a fruitful and
dynamic partnership between his authority, the government, ICIPE,
the universities and the business community in promoting local
technology in this east African country.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Offered Higher Allowances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
announced a major increase in teachers' allowances ranging from
15 to 100 percent in a bid to avert the strike set for October 1,
the "Daily Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted Kenyan Education Minister Joseph
Kamotho as saying on Thursday that the allowances' increase was
in addition to salary increment ranging between 10 and 28
percent, which was announced early this month.
</P>
<P>
The new allowances will cost the Kenyan government an
additional 1.2 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 20 million U.S.
Dollars) a month on top of 2.3 billion Shillings (about 38
million Dollars) paid to teachers monthly.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to teachers throughout the country to
accept the new allowances, saying that under the present economic
circumstances, it was the best the ministry can offer to
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangements, the lowest paid teacher who gets a
basic salary of 1,880 Shillings (about 30 Dollars) a month will
get a house allowance of 841 Shillings monthly while the highest
paid teacher with a minimum basic salary of 21,000 Shillings will
get a house allowance of 6,000 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho noted that six out of the 11 members of the Teachers
Service Recommendation Committee had accepted the new salaries
and allowances given by the government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) issued
a seven-day strike notice, saying that teachers of the country
would down their tools on October 1 if their demands were not met
by September 30.
</P>
<P>
KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongu said on the same day
that the strike would go on if the recommendation of the Teachers
Service Review Commission (TSRC) will not have been implemented
in full at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The TSRC recommended a salary increase ranging between 150 and
200 percent for the teachers, but the government agreed to give
the teachers an increment ranging between 10 and 28 percent.

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met here today with a delegation
from the Venezuelan Christian Socialist Party led by its vice
president Jose Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that although China is in the Eastern Hemisphere and
Venezuela in the Western Hemisphere, their peoples enjoy a
time-honored friendship.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral relations have developed steadily since
the forging of diplomatic relations in 1974, and that China thanks
Venezuela for its support on the issues of Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed the Venezuelan visitors on the 15th CPC
National Congress, saying that the most conspicuous achievement of
the congress is the establishment of Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
guiding ideology of the CPC, and the formulation of the platform
of action for China's trans-century development under the guidance
of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and 1.2 billion Chinese people will steadfastly
continue to march along the path of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics set forth by Deng Xiaoping, he said.

He noted that his party is ready to further reinforce its
relations with the CPC so as to enhance mutual understanding and
promote friendly relations between the two countries and their
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Dai Bingguo, head of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee, attended the meeting. Yesterday, Dai held
working talks with the delegation members,

<HEADLINE> African Fruit Dealers Urged to Form Alliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- African exporters of processed
fruit and vegetables are being encouraged to form strategic alliances
with European buyers to penetrate the otherwise over-supplied and
sometimes fickle European market.
</P>
<P>
The African fruit and vegetable processors were also advised to
identify niche markets and concentrate on labor-intensive products
where they enjoy a comparative advantage, according to a report
from Nyanga in east Zimbabwe today.
</P>
<P>
African exporters and European importers of fruit and
vegetables agreed at the end of a four-day meeting there Thursday
there is need for local exporters to develop expertise within the
local and regional markets before venturing into Europe.
</P>
<P>
The meeting organized by the Brussels-based Center for the
Development of Industry (CDI), an EU-ACP body, and the Zimbabwe
Investment Center sought to find ways of increasing the volume of
eastern and southern African horticultural produce entering the
European market.
</P>
<P>
however, after presentations by consultants and face-to-face
talks among entrepreneurs from both continents, it emerged that
there would be little chance for a dramatic increase in African
exports of fruit and vegetables to the European Union (EU)
countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said, ''the EU market is generally well-supplied in
all products capable of being produced from this region", except
those "out of season fresh produce.''
</P>
<P>
''The best way is to establish a long-term relationship with
the buyer and plan development together -- with requirement
known, quality assured, continuity guaranteed and prices
attractive,'' the participants agreed.
</P>
<P>
The CDI said progress in negotiations should be informed
timely to the exporters and importers so that they would be in a
better position to assist should the need arise.

Chinese and foreign dignitaries gathered here today to bid
farewell to Jing Puchun, wife of the late Liao Chengzhi, former
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Jing died in Beijing on September 20 at the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin; Premier Li Peng; Vice-Premier
Zhu Rongji; Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee; and Vice-President Rong Yiren sent wreaths to the
funeral ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, General Liu Huaqing, NPC Standing Committee

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Has Enough Money to Pay Ex-fighters: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's budget will not be
affected by the government decision to pay an unbudgeted 3.5
billion Zimbabwe Dollars gratuity to ex-freedom fighters as there
are other alternative sources of raising revenue.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by acting Finance Minister Emmerson
Mnangagwa during a debate on the Finance Ministry's budget in
parliament on Thursday, referring to the sum of about 309.7
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has "more than adequate funds" to pay
the gratuities for about 70,000 ex-fighters.
</P>
<P>
"This budget presented in July will be carried and maintained
as structured as at the time of delivery," he said, adding that
"we have sufficient means and resources outside the budget to
meet the requirements of the ex-combatants."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government has the unallocated reserve
of 5.7 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (more than 500 million U.S.
Dollars), which is a contingent facility to cushion the country
against unforeseen developments like droughts.
</P>
<P>
He said the unallocated reserve is only to be used in the
event of urgent and critical shortages in the budget. Parliament
should have authority to disburse the unallocated reserve.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came hard on the heels of a World Bank decision to
withhold more than 700 million Zimbabwe Dollars (less than 70
million U.S. Dollars) to finance Zimbabwe's economic reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
According to economists, 3.5 billion Zimbabwe Dollars
represents over five percent of the government's total annual
expenditure and would raise the anticipated deficit for the
period to December 31 next year of 8.9 percent of GDP to over 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe's post-budget commitment to pay each
ex-fighter a 50,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (about 4,425 US Dollars)
lump sum gratuity by December followed a series of nationwide
demonstrations by ex-freedom fighters who accused the government
of relegating them to poverty.
</P>
<P>
Besides access to free health and education, the ex-combatants
will also be entitled to a monthly pension of 2,000 Zimbabwe
Dollars (less than 200 U.S. Dollars).

SHENYANG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Guo Tingbiao, deputy governor
of northeast China's Liaoning Province, said recently that the
province will adopt measures to increase cooperation with the Hong
Kong financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Guo told participants in a recent seminar on the province's

Liaoning to join hands with Hong Kong to upgrade the economy.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of China's key industrial bases, is home to

</P>
<P>
"Concrete steps will be taken to increase the number of
cooperation projects jointly funded by investors from the two
sides," said Guo, adding that Liaoning welcomes more Hong Kong
banks and insurance companies to open branches and offices his
province.
</P>
<P>
Guo noted that more local state-owned enterprises will
issue H shares on the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
The province will also encourage Hong Kong securities
companies and stock traders to participate in local economic
undertakings, and will improve ties between the Shenyang Stock
Exchange and the Hong Kong Federation of Stock Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Guo said Liaoning will provide more business opportunities to
Hong Kong investors in the coming years. He noted that the special
administrative region will in turn benefit from the province's
rapid economic development.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Iran to Normalize Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain and Iran have
agreed to normalize their diplomatic relations, 15 months after
they lowered their diplomatic representation to charge
d'affaires level, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that Tehran and Manama
have agreed to expand their bilateral ties through a fresh
approach and "are to introduce their respective ambassadors to
Manama and Tehran shortly."
</P>
<P>
The report said that the agreement was reached between Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi his Bahrain counterpart Sheikh
Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa in New York Thursday when they had
talks on the sidelines of the current annual session of the
U.N. General Assembly there.
</P>
<P>
The Bahrain foreign minister called the exchange of ambassadors
as an important action in strengthening bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic crisis between Manama and Tehran began in June
1996 after Bahrain accused Iran of being involved in a plot
to overthrow the Bahraini government by supporting pro-Tehran
Islamic groups. 29 Bahrainis had confessed to planning to topple
the ruling family and establish an Iranian-style government in the
gulf country.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain had first quietly withdrew its ambassador from Tehran
and then Iran had to recall its ambassador from Manama.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Al-Khalifa in the meeting with
Kharrazi expressed willingness of his country in establishing
friendly relations and realizing further cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said in the meeting that
promoting ties with neighboring countries as well as contributing
to further establishment of regional security are high on the
list of Iran's foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that cooperation among regional countries in
political, economic and cultural affairs could help bring about
a climate of trust and good neighboring feelings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi also had a talk with UAE Foreign Minister
Rashid Abdollahof in New York on Thursday and the two sides
explored ways and means of creating an atmosphere of
understanding and consolidating bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not mention their territorial dispute
over the three islands in the Persian Gulf, which are
controlled by Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official On Study of Party Congress Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese united front
work official stressed here today that the Chinese people need to
study and implement the guidelines of the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and advance the United Front
work into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum on studying the guidelines of the Party
Congress organized by his department, Wang Zhaoguo, Head of the
United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, said
that "the congress has worked out a comprehensive strategy for
China's cross-century reform and opening up and socialist
modernization, and it will have a far-reaching impact on the
United Front work."
</P>
<P>
He called on the officials with the department to do a good job
in following four areas:
</P>
<P>
-- To make it the main goal, at present and during a certain
period in the future, to study, publicize and implement the
guidelines of the 15th National Party congress documents so that
the majority of Party members and officials can best understand
and grasp them and fulfill the tasks put forward by the congress;
</P>
<P>
-- To step up the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory, arm Party
officials and the members of the United Front with Deng's theory,
enhance their political theoretical level and raise the United
Front work to a new level;
</P>
<P>
-- To carry out earnestly the tasks of United Front work set
out by the congress, reinforce the Party's efforts in
all aspects and rally closely around the Party Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core;
</P>
<P>
-- To support and help non-Party members and United Front
members in their efforts to study the essence of the Party
congress and create good conditions for their studies.
</P>
<P>
Since September 19, the department has presented the main ideas
of the Party congress documents to representatives from
non-Communist parties, people with no party affiliations,
intellectual circles in the capital, religious groups and ethnic
minorities.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Maintain Upward Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Strong demand for superfine
wool helped keep prices higher this week, the Australian Council
of Wool Exporters said in its market review today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator rose 12 cents to close at 722
Australian cents (519 US cents) a clean kg while the western
market indicator gained nine cents to close at 600 Australian
cents (432 US cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The council said 63,076 bales were offered at sales in
Newcastle, Melbourne and Fremantle this week with a pass-in rate
of 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The main focus of competition was on the superfine offering
and other finer wool in the 20 micron and finer categories, as is
reflected by price movements for the various micron categories,"
the review said.
</P>
<P>
"Strong Italian and Japanese demand for the superfine offering
in Newcastle and Melbourne led the market," it said.
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of China, competition for the week as a
whole was quite widespread, although reports continue to indicate
that, while pipeline demand remains strong, trade in tops and yarn
remains quiet and does not reflect recent movements in greasy wool
prices."
</P>
<P>
About 73,200 bales are rostered for sale in Sydney and
Melbourne next week, the council said.

XINING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- World Food Program (WFP)
officials have wrapped up a two-day visit to Haidong Prefecture in
northwest China's Qinghai Province, where 300,000 poor people have
got rid of poverty because of WFP-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
As one of the poorest areas in China, Qinghai still has 676,000
impoverished people, accounting for 22 percent of its rural
population. It has completed two comprehensive agricultural
projects with funding offered by the WFP since 1985. A contract on
the third project was signed recently.
</P>
<P>
The previous two projects covered a wide range of fields
including water conservancy, village road construction,
afforestation and agro-technique training. The third is geared to
women and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day tour, WFP officials made house-to-house
stops in Huangzhong, Ping'an and Hualong counties and asked about
the changes which have taken place in the lives of the local
people.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guang, vice governor of Qinghai, said these projects have
produced praiseworthy results and become a model of comprehensive
agricultural development in Qinghai.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Live Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy in Uganda
has risen to 50.4 now from 47 years in 1990, reported local daily
"The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-chancellor of Makerere University John Ssebuwufu was
quoted as saying that the rise was due to advances in technology.
</P>
<P>
He said, Ugandans with access to safe drinking water between
1990 and 1996 accounted for 62 percent of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is attributed to higher access to health
services of about 51 percent in 1997 and to adult literacy rates
about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, a report released by the United Nations Population
Fund last year said that life expectancy at birth for average
Ugandan had dropped from 45.7 years for males and 50.5 for
females in 1991 to 42.2 and 44.3 years in 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to precarious standards of
living in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Pays Special Attention to Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Every morning, Feng Xiren, a
71-year-old man in Shanghai, exercises in a park near his home.
</P>
<P>
"I'm leading a colorful life now that more and more special
places for entertainment for the elderly have been set up in
Shanghai," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
After exercises, he goes to the community library to read
newspapers, or sipping tea while chatting with his friends at the
local tea house. In the evening he practises calligraphy at a
nearby university for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the leading aging city in China, reports that 16.7
percent of its population is over age 60, compared to 10.2 percent
in 1979. Every three families in Shanghai has a senior citizen,
and about a quarter of all families in the city consist of elderly
people only.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Shanghai Statistics Bureau show that out of
all families with senior citizens, about 14.4 percent are made up
of a couple over age 60, and about 10 percent consist of a single
senior.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the elderly in Shanghai live with their
children and more than 20 percent of all families have three or
more generations living together.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say the family support for the elderly is
weakening and more and more elderly now live apart from their
children.
</P>
<P>
The graying of the population in Shanghai calls for urgent
changes in all social aspects that affect the elderly, such as the
social-medical insurance system, nursing services and housing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Shanghai has paid great attention
to the elderly's material and cultural life. Statistics show 17
social welfare houses and 333 nursing homes have been set up in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Every day advertisements on welfare for the elderly are shown
on prime time TV, and a number of medical service stations have
been set up for the convenience of elderly people.
</P>
<P>
The service trade in Shanghai provides free, priority or
home delivery services for all senior citizens over age 70. And
elderly people without family receive regular visits and gifts at
holidays from various local enterprises or government organs.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Increases Exchanges with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan is the largest trade
partner and second largest investing country in Liaoning Province,
a major industrial base in northeast China, according to the
Liaoning Provincial Institute of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has witnessed constantly expanding exchanges and
cooperation with Japan since China opened to the outside world in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders from Liaoning have visited Japan on numerous
occassions, and the province has hosted visits by a number of
high-ranking Japanese leaders, including Yasuhiro Nakasone, Noboru
Takeshita and Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between cities from the two sides have developed
rapidly, with the establishment of 17 sister city relationships.
</P>
<P>
Friendly exchanges between the two sides have greatly promoted
cooperation in the science and technology, economic and trade
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the four billion US dollar trade volume
between the two sides accounted for 36 percent of Liaoning's total
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Japan had invested over four billion US dollars in 2,423
enterprises in Liaoning by the end of June this year, with
Liaoning ranking as one of the nation's leading provinces in terms
Japanese investments.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has used Japanese loans of 410 million US dollars
since 1986 to construct 56 projects. Japan-loaned Guanyinge
Reservoir, in the central Liaoning city of Benxi, played an
important role in flood control in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese Medical Education Center at Shenyang-based
Chinese University of Medicine was established with a Japanese
grant of one billion Yen (8.3 million US dollars). The center is
currently the only medical education project of cooperation
between the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Entebbe Zoo has
been undergoing transformation from a zoo to a semi-natural park,
reported local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Yafes Otim-Omara, the state Minister for Tourism, Wildlife and
Antiquities, was quoted as saying that the zoo called the Uganda
Wildlife Education Center will be developed into both a focal
point for eco-tourism and a natural education resource in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Omara made the remarks on Thursday at an open day organized by
the center to commemorate the World Tourism Day which falls on
September 27.
</P>
<P>
He said the center is to become a nature-based tourism
attraction where wildlife could be seen in its natural
environment far different from a zoo.
</P>
<P>
The center attracted over 100,000 visitors last year and will
increase tremendously this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Omara said the government places a high priority on the
successful development of the center which is expected to play a
pivotal role in respect of both tourism development and
environmental education.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Benefits from WB-Funded Water Supply Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A sip of running water from
the new tap in her house made 63-year-old Wang Erren cry.
</P>
<P>
Her tears came as she remembered her life 30 years before, as a
new bride in her small village in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, when villagers commonly contracted various
serious illnesses from drinking well water contaminated with
arsenic.
</P>
<P>
But now, more than 1,000 villages in nine disease-prone
counties have launched clean water projects, built sanitary
toilets and are promoting health education using World Bank
funding.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has granted a 10 million US dollar loan to
support the water and environmental health projects, which will
cost a total of 210 million yuan (25.3 million US dollars). The
work began in 1992, and will end next year.
</P>
<P>
About 220,000 rural families, or 930,000 people in the region
have benefited from the clean water projects, said Guo Yigang, an
official with the region's Health Department.
</P>
<P>
"Many farmers call it `the project which drives the God of
Disease away'," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Guo cautioned that the project has a long way to go, as
more than 4.3 million people in the region still drink well water
which has high levels of fluorine and arsenic.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Funding for Liaoning Gains Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The use of overseas
investment in northeast China's Liaoning Province hit a record
high in the first half of the year despite the slower
rise in China's overall level.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1997, Liaoning's actual use of overseas
funding amounted to 1.2 billion US dollars, a year-on-year
increase of 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that apart from the increase in
investment, Liaoning is witnessing a more diversified use of
overseas funding.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the successful listing of B-shares of the Dalian
Wafangdian Bearing Co., Ltd. and the Benxi Iron and Steel Group
raised 172 million US dollars. The leasing contract of three
airplanes between the China Northern Airlines and Russian partners
brought in 175 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have full confidence in the returns of their
investment, which is reflected in the injection of 230 million
US dollars in funds in Dalian alone, a port city in Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Funding was also brought in to the agricultural sector from
overseas. In the first half of the year, 20 agricultural or
agriculture-related projects were approved by the provincial
government, with total contractual overseas funding of 46.3
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that infrastructure projects, in spite of the
need of large amounts of financing, a lengthy construction period
and slow return of investment, have become a focus for overseas
investors. The 350 million US dollars of contractual investment in
this area accounted for 17 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Economists here are confident in the prospects of Liaoning's
use of overseas funds, and consider that the improving performance
of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises will help draw
more attention from overseas entrepreneurs.

The five waterways will be linked with the Shijiazhuang-Tianjin
Irrigation Canal to form a city moat, over which 22 bridges are to
be built. And green belts of 1.5 million sq m of trees and grass
will be planted along both sides of the moat.

<HEADLINE> Bohai Rim Leads North China in Containers Transportation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of China's
biggest center for collection and distribution of international
container cargo broke ground in Tianjin Port early this month.
</P>
<P>
The 300,000-sq-m center, which is jointly financed by Tianjin,
the New World Group, the Anderson Group of Hong Kong with an
investment of 30 million US dollars, will be able to dispatch
newly-arrived containers to interior areas and other northeastern
areas of China.
</P>
<P>
As a result of China's rapid economic growth, Bohai Rim has
become a major container collection and distribution of in north
China, with a combined annual handling capacity of two million TEU.
</P>
<P>
Peng Tianyu, an expert on coastal planning, predicts that by
early next century, China's interior area will be blessed with a
container shipping network consisting of Tianjin, Dalian and
Qingdao ports in the north, Shanghai, Ningbo ports in the middle
and Yantian Port in the south.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Rim will become the biggest center for shipping of
containers in north China, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Rim, located on the western bank of the Pacific Ocean,
near Russia to the north and the Korean Peninsula and Japan to the
east, is integral to the increasingly active northeastern Asian
economic area and one of the starting points for the Eurasian

<HEADLINE> Bohai Rim Leads North China in Containers Transportation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bohai Rim is composed of Liaoning, Hebei and Shandong
provinces, as well as Beijing and Tianjin municipalities. The
region contributes a quarter of both China's gross economic volume
and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the container network is not only the product
of north China's foreign trade development and opening-up to the
outside world, but also indicates that Bohai Rim has become the
third-largest economic powerhouse in China after the southern and
eastern areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports from major ports of entry in the Bohai Rim show that
about ten ports have been building or expanding berths, aiming to
develop container transport into a priority for port construction in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Port, the largest foreign trade outlet in north China,
has the biggest container berth in the country and has handled the
fifth-generation container ships since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao, China's third largest port for container shipping, is
building three new container berths in addition to its current
three container docks. Dalian Port, with the newly-built deepwater
berth of Dayao Bay, will have the best development potential of
any sea outlet in the Bohai Rim.

The Ministry of Railways and the Tianjin Bonded Area have
jointly constructed two special railway lines which can quickly
send just-arrived container goods to northern, central,
northwestern and southwestern areas of China, starting the
country's first thoroughfare for the unified transportation of the
marine routes and railway lines and providing customers in major
Chinese cities with door-to-door service.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tao, Manager of Huatie Longtai Company which oversees the
business said that Mongolia has used Tianjin Port as their sea
route, and most of the cargo sent to Mongolia from the United
States, the Republic of Korea and Japan, is dispatched from
Tianjin Port. The unified shipping-railway-line network from
Tianjin Port handled 8,000 TEU of containers for Mongolia last
year.
</P>
<P>
To better balance the development of China's eastern and
western areas, 11 provinces and autonomous regions along the
Yellow River recently financed a company to import 50 large
container trucks specially for handling import and export
businesses for these areas. In Hebei Province alone, more than 20
companies are engaged in container transport.

<HEADLINE> Infant Mortality Declines in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Infant mortality in Bangladesh
is declining, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the child death rate per
thousand live births has come down to 110 from 262 in l960, The
New Nation said.
</P>
<P>
This progress should not generate too much of satisfaction, the
newspaper warned, quoted experts as saying "to reduce the gap by
the year 2000, the under-five mortality rate should be reduced by
8.2 percent annually."
</P>
<P>
Six percent of the world's under-five child deaths occur in
Bangladesh, the newspaper stated. Nearly 870,000 children die
every year and 2,400 a day and 100 every hour.
</P>
<P>
The main diseases causing the death of under-five children are
diarrhoetic diseases, pneumonia and malnutrition, the newspaper
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Besides most of the infants are born at home, and what is more
alarming is that more than 90 percent of the births are delivered
by untrained midwives and elderly women, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that nearly 65 percent of the deaths
could be prevented by relatively simple, inexpensive, effective
and low-cost methods, and the intervention cost to save a child is
only 350 taka (about 7.8 U.S. dollars), the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> Trading Partners Question India's Export Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- India's major trading
partners, the European Union (EU) and the United States, have
questioned India's various schemes offered to Indian exporters, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU has already challenged the incentives under the
anti-subsidy agreement of General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs
(GATT) and the U.S. has also raised the issue informally.
</P>
<P>
India's export incentives include the duty entitlement passbook
scheme (DEPB), duty drawback, special import licenses and
exemption of export profits.
</P>
<P>
India's major trading partners alleged that the export
incentives provided by the Indian government are inconsistent with
World Trade Organization (WTO) norms and are hidden subsidies.
These schemes allow "excessive" credit than the incidence of duty.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to come out with some measures and
explanations to the major trading partners, the same source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United State's
Southern Command in Panama today moved from here to Miami,
Florida, ending its 34-year residence in this Central American
country.
</P>
<P>
General Charles William, who was appointed the commander of the
military headquarters Wednesday morning, announced the movement
plan at a brief departure ceremony during which time the American
flag was lowered.
</P>
<P>
More than 770 military and nonmilitary people, the last batch
of the headquarters' personnel, will depart for Miami today.
</P>
<P>
The command, whose headquarters is based in the Quarry Heights
neighborhood, oversees military operations in Central and South
America. Recently, it has also been asked to participate in
anti-drug operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty between the two
governments, the U.S. is scheduled to end its military presence in
Panama by December 31, 1999, and turn the canal and all its
military bases over to the administration of the Panamanian
government.
</P>
<P>
According to the movement's timetable, the U.S. will withdraw
its command in September and reduce the number of soldiers
stationed there to 5,650 by the end of 1997. Since 1994, there
have been approximately 10,500 troops stationed in the area.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters, occupying an area of 31 hectares, comprises
209 buildings and is valued at a cost of 9.2 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Needs Concrete Action by Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Search of the way
toward solving conflicts and appeal for more development
assistance dominated today's U.N. Security Council Ministerial
meeting on Africa.
</P>
<P>
Council members from Africa and other developing countries
called on their developed partners to take concrete action in
providing development assistance.
</P>
<P>
African delegates maintain that the responsibility of resolving
the conflicts should mainly rest on African countries, with the
Organization for African Unity (OAU) playing a major role.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said
that the cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU should
be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The meeting requested that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
submit his recommendations by February 1998 on the resolution of
conflicts and reconstruction afterwards in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the initiatives by the United States, Britain and
France for their increasing participation in Africa's
peace-keeping, African delegates emphasized that international
participation should be based on the principles of the U.N.
Charter.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who is also OAU Chairman,
said: "Africans wanted their partners to become committed to a new
partnership based on sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the primary
responsibility to maintain peace and security is that of the
international community represented by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong Ha called for a stop of
arms flow to the conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of its kind, recognized the fact that
Africa is still plagued by poverty despite progress made in recent
years. Africa's debts are increasing while external investment
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
Africa, forecast to be the only continent with growing poverty
in the next ten years, is far behind the rest of the world in
terms of development.
</P>
<P>
"Our need for new initiatives towards Africa is far less than
our need for the creation of mechanisms to implement and
coordinate the existing initiatives," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the delegates from countries outside Africa showed
their interest in attaching more importance to the continent.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told the meeting that
his country has proposed at the European Union a Europe-Africa
summit to establish the first political dialogue between the two
continents and place Africa at the top of Europe's international
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said her government
was preparing a new policy for Africa to increase "substantially"
its aid budget in the next 3 years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that she
will tour Africa before the end of the year "to make real
America's commitment to stand."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Obuchi Keizo called for international
cooperation to hold the second Tokyo International Conference of
African Development in autumn 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that major developed nations are not ready to
make real contributions.

PANAMA CITY, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian police
seized 500 kilograms of cocaine on the sea to the north
of Panama Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said today that anti-drug policemen sighted two
suspected speedboats during a routine patrol on the sea off an
island in the Colon province.
</P>
<P>
The policemen stopped the speedboats and exchanged fire with
three suspected drug traffickers who abandoned their boats later
and escaped.
</P>
<P>
On one of the speedboats, the policemen found 500 packages of
cocaine, which weighes one kilogram each.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that this lot of cocaine was related with what
they got in the last seizure because all of them were packed with
the "White Dolphin" trademark.
</P>
<P>
Police said that cocaine is sold at 5,000 U.S. dollars per
kilogram on the Panamanian market while on the international
market the price doubles.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian police have seized a total of 6,000 kilograms of

David Wolf will blast off for the Russian space station Mir on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wolf, 41, will spend the rest of this year aboard Mir because
the mission poses no "unnecessary peril," NASA administrator
Daniel Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
Wolf was scheduled to blast off with the rest of the crew of
space shuttle Atlantis at 10:34 p.m. EDT for a rendezvous with the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shuttle Blasts off for Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. space shuttle
Atlantis blasted off for the Russian Mir space station late today
with American astronaut David Wolf.
</P>
<P>
Administrator Daniel Goldin of the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) today approved Wolf's four-month
mission despite pressure on him to back out before of the safety
problems on Mir.
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Atlantis illuminated the sky as its booster rockets
fired at 10:34 p.m., right on time, and put the ship on a course
up the East Coast and straight for a Saturday rendezvous with Mir.
</P>
<P>
The space station was passing over Germany, on its 66,278th
orbit, when the countdown clocks hit zero.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference earlier today, Goldin said his
decision was not based on emotion or politics, but rather
science. He relied on two concurring, last-minute safety reviews
conducted by outside experts.
</P>
<P>
The problems on Mir include a collision with another
spacecraft, a fire and repeated computer failures, Goldin said at
the headquarters of NASA.
</P>
<P>
Goldin said his decision to go ahead with the joint
U.S.-Russian program was informed by independent reviews of the
station's safety.
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded shuttle-Mir (program) has a thorough review
process that ensures continued American participation aboard Mir
and does not put human life in unnecessary peril," Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision should be based and is based on scientific and
technical assessment of the mission's safety and the agency's
ability to gain additional experience and knowledge that cannot be
gained elsewhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Goldin said that besides reviewing three separate reports on
Mir's fitness, he talked to Wolf.
</P>
<P>
Citing that 20-minute conversation, Goldin said Wolf felt the
risk of the shuttle's ascent was greater than the risk aboard Mir,
but that this was an acceptable risk.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't wish to inflict this pain on any human being,"
Goldin said of the decision-making process. "I don't sleep nights
and there's only one thing on my mind, for weeks now: the safety
of our American astronauts."
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. congressmen and scientists oppose Wolf's space trip
arguing that it is not safe as so many problems have appeared in
Mir.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Sector Expands Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical sector's
foreign trade volume is expected to hit 40 billion US dollars in
2000, with exports to account for half the total, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The industry's average annual growth was 20 percent in
1991-1996 and its total volume of export, 46.1 billion US
dollars. The total trade transactions, including imports and
exports, reached 110.4 billion US dollars in the same period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,800 foreign chemical enterprises, including 20
international chemical giants, have set up in China, bringing in
investments worth 5.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
And the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) has set the goal of
soliciting foreign investment worth 12 billion US dollars by the
year 2000, doubling the current figure.
</P>
<P>
Also, MCI has signed all-round co-operation contracts with 13
global chemical companies, including Dupont of the United States,
Hoechst and Bayer of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 300 chemical enterprises have gained the right to
engage in foreign trade on their own. About 80 firms have the
ability to earn foreign exchange exceeding ten million US dollars
a year, a dramatic rise from the 30 firms eligible in 1991. And
27 chemical producers each reported sales above 120 million US
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry is striving to enhance its
competitiveness by forming 55 conglomerates.

<HEADLINE> WWF Says Haze an International Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The widespread fires plaguing
Indonesia and the choking smoke blanketing neighboring countries
have turned into an "international catastrophe," the head of the
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the forest fires "is so big that they not only
affect Indonesia, but other countries like Malaysia and
Singapore," WWF Head Shed Babar Ali said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, in addition to Malaysia and
Singapore, the fires have blanketed Brunei, the Philippines and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Ali, who arrived here on Wednesday for a five-day visit, made
the remarks after meeting with Indonesian Forestry Minister
Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Ali's remarks coincided with Thursday's presidential statement
that the forest fires and the smoke, better known as the "haze,"
are a national disaster.
</P>
<P>
Ali called on the Indonesian government to totally ban the
slash-and-burn method for clearing land and plantation areas in a
bid to prevent further forest fires.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto recently issued a national ban on
slash-and-burn land clearing methods. Following this, official
warnings have been issued to 176 companies who have allegedly
continued such practices.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Azwar Anas said
Thursday that more than 80,000 hectares of forest areas had been
destroyed by fires since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Minister for Environment Sarwono Kusumaamadja
said that at least 300,000 hectares of forest had been burned.
</P>
<P>
However, sources with access to satellite photos said Thursday
that between 600,000 and 800,000 hectares of forest and plantation
had been hit by fires.
</P>
<P>
The haze has put 20 million people in danger of respiratory
problems in the country as well as in neighboring countries. It
has left at least two people dead from respiratory infections in
Indonesia, officials here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The election procedure of the
first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region will soon begin, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council is expected to pass the
Legislative Council Ordinance this Saturday, which will lay down
rules for the election.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen said at a
luncheon yesterday that an independent Electoral Affairs
Commission will be established, which will present plans on
geographical constituency demarcation, voter registration and
election procedures to the chief executive before the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that the government will begin to register voters at
the end of this year and the beginning of next year. It is
estimated that about two million families will be involved as the
government is determined to encourage all eligible permanent
residents to vote.
</P>
<P>
An 800-strong election committee, which will produce 10 members
of the 60-member Legislative Council, will be set up at the end
of April. The formal election will begin at the end to May.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, 20 legislators will come out of the
direct voting and the other 30 from functional constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"This election will be open, fair, honest and acceptable to the
public," Suen said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the election will not be a setback to democracy
as some people hold.
</P>
<P>
To clarify major controversies, Suen said that the proportional
representation mechanism was designed to include small political
parties in the process. Under the traditional "one person one
vote" method used in direct elections, smaller parties are often
squeezed out of the process.
</P>
<P>
Proportional representation can allow the different opinions of
voters to be reflected in the distribution of the legislative
seats.

JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of drought-related
deaths in Indonesia's Irian Jaya province rose to 271 Thursday as
haze continued to hinder relief operations to the
disaster-stricken area, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Social Services Inten Soeweno said last night that
253 people had died in the Jayawijaya Regency, 11 in the Merauke
Regency and seven from the Puncak Jaya Regency.

<P>
A total of 73 people were being treated by doctors in Merauke,

</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were caused by cholera and other
drought-induce diseases and food shortage in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought, which began three months ago, has also
triggered forest fires in the province. The fires have razed
130,135 hectares of forest, a local forestry service official said
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bourse to Relax Trading Limits in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) will begin to enforce new rules in December this
year to allow share prices on the market to float within a wider
range, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the price rise for a share on a single
trading day will be allowed up to 30 percent of the share price,
while the price fall will be allowed by 27 percent on a single
trading day.
</P>
<P>
The Thai bourse currently only allows a share price to rise or
fall within the limit of 10 percent on a trading day.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the trading on the bourse will be
suspended for a period of time if the SET index falls too far.
</P>
<P>
The trading on the bourse will be suspended for 30 minutes if
the whole index drops 50 points on a trading day and the trading
will be suspended for one hour if the index drops 100 points.
</P>
<P>
The trading will be stopped for the rest of the session once it
falls more than 200 points on a single trading day.
</P>
<P>
The new rules are planned as an increasing number of local
listed firms suffer big losses due to the floatation of the baht
and face the threat to be delisted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Thai bourse will begin to enforce new rules of
credit balance and short-selling on January 2 next year, which
will show the green light for short-selling.
</P>
<P>
The Thai bourse currently bans short-selling by borrowing

<HEADLINE> Hungarian PM Says International Court's Ruling Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister
Horn Gyula said today that a ruling by the International Court of
Justice on the Hungarian-Slovak dispute over the construction of a
hydropower station on the Danube River was fair, and Hungary
should abide by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Horn made the remarks this evening on a TV news program.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1950, Hungary and the then Czechoslovakia proposed
the two countries jointly build a hydropower stations on the
Danube, their boundary river.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, they signed an accord to cooperate on the construction
of two hydropower stations on the Danube, but the construction did
not begin until the early 1980's due to a shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, thousands of Hungarians staged demonstrations. They
demanded the cancellation of the accord on the grounds of
protecting the environment. Consequently, the Hungarian government
withdrew from the construction in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia however modified the original design scheme in
1991 and proceeded with the construction. In 1992, Hungary
unilaterally declared the abrogation of the accord they had signed
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia eventually disintegrated into two nations in
January 1993: the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The
Slovak Republic continued with the construction of the hydropower
station, and now the station has begun generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
However, the hydropower station reportedly inflicted many
harmful effects upon Hungary's environment. So Hungary demanded
compensation from the Slovak Republic, but its demands were turned
down.
</P>
<P>
In April 1993, Hungary submitted the dispute to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
The court, after four years of investigation, ruled today that
Hungary's acts in unilaterally abrogating their accord was
illegal, and so was the Slovak Republic's in modifying the
original design.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were instructed to compensate each other for
losses due to their respective faults.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government discussed the court's ruling today and
announced that it would elaborate its stand on the ruling to the
Congress on September 29.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai former prime minister
Banharn Silpa-archa has won a court case in which he was accused
of taking bribes from a Swedish shipbuilder, according to a
Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, 1995, the Siam Post newspaper carried a
front-page report saying Banharn had taken bribes from Kockums, a
Swedish shipbuilder.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Banharn took the money before the July 2,
1995 general election. Kockums was said to be offering financial
support for Banharn's Chart Thai Party in the election to boost
its own chances of winning a contract to sell two medium-sized

<HEADLINE> Export Value of Peru's Aquatic Products Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The export value of Peru's
aquatic products industry during the first eight months of this
year increased 37 percent to 1.03 billion U.S. dollars, Fishing
Minister Ludwig Meier Cornejo said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister also predicted 1.3 billion dollars in exports for
the entire year, which would entail an increase of more than 22
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the January-August export figure of 1.03 billion dollars,
the traditional products, which include fish meal and fish oil,
produced 909 million dollars, while non-traditional products
amounted to 121 million dollars, Meier said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that non-traditional products, referring to
those for direct human consumption, will continue to increase in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed a recovery in the fishing products industry for
direct human consumption, especially an increase in the production
of canned and frozen fish products, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that his ministry would adopt all necessary
measures to help promote the production and export of
non-traditional products.
</P>
<P>
Peru is one of the major aquatic product suppliers in the
world. The country's production of fishing products reached 9.6
million tons in 1996, up 8.9 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Meat Congress Claimed Most Effective In History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The 11th World Meat Congress
concluded yesterday in Beijing, with H Christian Oberst, president
of the International Meat Secretariat, claiming it the most
successful meeting it has ever had, said today's "China Daily."
</P>
<P>
The concluding session Thursday highlighted such vital issues
as sustainable meat production and ensuring meat safety while
seeking better consumer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed these are vital questions for the next
century, both for people's quality of life and for saving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the whole world to get realistic about meat,"
Dennis T Avery, a delegate from the United States, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"The trend toward increased meat consumption is now too well
established to treat casually and it is too big a threat to the
world's wildlands -- unless we start moving now to satisfy the
rising global meat demand in a responsible and global way."
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, the delegates said, the world must do more
high-yield agricultural research, increase per-hectare output
instead of plowing down wildlands for low-yield crops and
livestock, and must remove the farm trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
The pattern of meat consumption is changing dramatically
worldwide and as many countries around the world experience growth
in their disposable incomes, their demand for meat grows, and so
does their concern about food safety, the delegates said.
</P>
<P>
They called for greater attention to be paid to food safety
regulations and standards worldwide as a front-line defence
against unsafe foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
"For consumers, safety is before the price, taste and the
appearances of products," said Marion Guillou, director general of
food with the French Ministry of Agriculture, forests and
Fishing. "It is a legitimate demand, and it is up to the public
powers to make necessary arrangements in the matter."

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Inflation to Be Less Than That of U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is expected to
see an inflation rate as low as, if not lower than, that of the
United States this year, the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund predicts that the price index
of consumer goods in the United States could be 2.4 percent, or
1.2 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil reported in August a 0.75 percent drop in the price
index of consumer goods, and the Statistics Institute specialists
foresee the same trend for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
After the "hyper-inflation" of up to 5,135.5 percent in June of
1994, and the 66.2 percent in April 1990, Brazil's inflation fell
sharply to 14.78 percent in 1995 and 9.34 percent in 1996,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, the country's inflation dropped further
to 4.65 percent, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- UEFA president Lennart
Johansson said on Thursday he was in favour of a world club
championship.
</P>
<P>
Although many delegates at UEFA's presidents and general
secretaries conference refused to commit themselves to the idea,
Johansson said: "When it was discussed at FIFA, I supported it, so
for me there was never a question about if it would happen, only
when.
</P>
<P>
"You will have one champion from each of the six
Confederations, plus the champions of the host country and
possibly the reigning champions, it depends," said Johansson
later.
</P>
<P>
But not every delegate was in support.
</P>
<P>
Various proposals have been put forward for the compeitition,
which would effectively replace the annual match played in Tokyo
between the European and South American champions.
</P>
<P>
That match, which has been known as the Toyota Cup since it was
relaunched with a sponsorship deal by Toyota in 1980, is
contrcated to continue in its current format until 2002.
</P>
<P>
No decision was taken by the conference although member
federations were asked to report their views back to UEFA's
executive committee within the next month.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee are then likely to decide how to
proceed at their next meeting in Geneva on December 5.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Fight "El Nino" Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government will
allocate more than 150 million U.S. dollars to help ease
consequences caused by the "El Nino" phenomenon across the
country, Minister to the Presidency Daniel Hokama said today.
</P>
<P>
In Peru alone, there will be an estimated 1.5 million victims
of the "El Nino" phenomenon, which produces rains, floods, and
drought, Hokama said.
</P>
<P>
He added that rains and possible floods caused by river
outflows in northern Peru would affect at least 1 million people,
while in the drought-hit zone of the Andean area, the victims
would total half a million.
</P>
<P>
The 150 million dollars allocated by the Peruvian government to
help the victims would mainly be used to re-establish and maintain
drainage systems, power transmission lines, as well as health
centers and school buildings, the presidency minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government also planned to relocate 10,500 families,
warehouse 25,000 tons of foodstuffs and clean some 2,000
kilometers of river beds and agricultural drainage canals to
prevent floods, he added.
</P>
<P>
The "El Nino" usually originates in the Pacific coast of Peru
and Ecuador, but causes disturbances in the world's climate. This
year's "El Nino" effects started from the very beginning of the
year, but experts said it would increase in December and continue
until the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1982-1983 "El Nino" left losses worth of 8 billion dollars
in Peru.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sets New Rules to Protect Banks From Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
has redefined past-due or non-performing loans to protect banks
from loan defaults, local newspaper Business World reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, loans payable in both monthly
or quarterly installments are to be considered past due "whenever
these are in arrears for more than three months or one quarter (of
a year)", the report said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, these loans were considered past due when
installments were delayed for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
Banks were also given one year to implement the changes in the
determination of non-performing loans, it said.
</P>
<P>
While local banks have relatively low non-performing loans,
averaging about 1.5 percent compared with Thailand's 7.7 percent,
the deterioration of credit quality and the increasing number of
companies seeking debt restructuring have raised some concern.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also required banks to set up a general
loan-loss provision equivalent to 2 percent of total loan
portfolio in addition to the allowance for probable losses on
individually identified uncollectible accounts such as
sub-standard, doubtful and bad debts.
</P>
<P>
Banks operating for more than five years were given one year to
make the necessary changes in their loan-loss provisions, it said.
</P>
<P>
Those operating for less than five years were required to have
a loan-loss reserve of 1 percent of their total loan portfolio
within one year and the balance of 1 percent set up on the second
and third year in equal amounts.
</P>
<P>
Central bank deputy governor Alberto Reyes said the measures
were aimed at making the required loan ratios of banks at par with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Philippines Bankers Association's chief economist Johnny Noe
Ravalo said the twin measures represented a "very good signal".

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at the No.1 Hospital
of Harbin Medical University have used acupuncture and blood
therapy to treat a five-year-old boy who had been in coma for 26
days.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is the first Chinese hospital to use the method to
treat a child in such a condition, which was the result of the
removal of part of the cerebral cortex.
</P>
<P>
The boy, Ning Jitan, from Heihe in Heilongjiang province, was
struck with viral encephalitis earlier this year and had
convulsions and a high fever, and lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
When he was admitted to this hospital in the capital of
Heilongjiang, a pediatrician, Dr. Lin Shujing, decided to use
acupuncture and oxygen to treat the boy, and used a form of blood
treatment as an additional therapy.
</P>
<P>
The child's fever went away seven days later, and he was able
to sit up with help on the 21st day, and fully recovered within
two months. Tests showed that the boy's IQ was not affected by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have used the method to treat a dozen children in
similar condition, with most of them recovering full physical and
mental health afterwards.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
province plans to hold inspections to better discipline the
accounting field in the coming 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The province first launched the public accounting business in
1981. It now has 118 accounting agencies and 110 auditing
agencies, with more than 4,000 certified public accountants (CPAs)
and auditors.
</P>
<P>
Problems exit in the rapid developing business, however, and
some agencies have been found to be providing companies with false
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection will look into whether those agencies are
operating in accordance with laws and regulations, and will see
how the provincial CPAs are doing in their business," said a
provincial official.
</P>
<P>
And, those which have repeatedly been the target of public
complaint will be the primary focus of the inspections, he added.
</P>
<P>
The province will also conduct tax reviews of accounting
agencies doing overseas businesses, as well as of overseas
accounting companies' offices in Fujian.

CANBERRA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- John Howard suffered his worst day as prime minister
yesterday when he was forced to defend claims his office knew of
travel rorts and that he had misled parliament. Now the scandal
also threatened the career of a third minister who was hanging on
last night after admitting he too made false travel claims.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The Howard government was in crisis last night after
damaging revelations that directly implicated the prime minister's
office in the travel rorts cover-up, adding to the scandal
engulfing the government was the likelihood that a third minister
will be forced to resign over wrongly claiming for travel
allowances.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's spy network is resisting a plan before Prime
Minister John Howard to bring the country's intelligence agencies
under parliamentary scrutiny for the first time. Howard has for
months failed to do anything about a submission aimed at shaking
up the domestic and overseas spy agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- A 9 billion U.S. dollars takeover yesterday of investment
banking and broking firm Salomon Inc. by Travelers Group Inc. has
created one of the world's biggest financial services powerhouses.
The enlarged group will have a market capitalization of more than
55 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Ostrich Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to make ostrich meat
and other products available to ordinary people by increasing the
number of the big bird to some one million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shanling, deputy director of the Planning Department of the
China Ostrich Development Association, said the goal is not so
unreasonable because there are 80,000 of the birds now, which is
10,000 times the number in 1993 when China started raising
ostriches by using eight birds bought from the United States.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, ostriches will cost from 1,500 to 2,000 yuan (187 to
250 US dollars) each, said Guo, and ostrich products won't be seen
as luxury items that are beyond reach of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
The ostrich promoter is here for an exhibition of ostrich
products, from artwork like egg painting to things like boots,
handbags, wallets, and belts.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, more than 20 provinces and cities in China
now have ostrich farms, but most of the ostriches are for
breeding, although some have been exported to Asian countries like
South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed processing techniques for ostrich-related
products, but we lack the birds to build up an industry," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
Since South Africa has dominated the European and American
markets with its ostrich products, China will target East-Asia and
North Europe as potential ostrich products importers.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high cost and complex breeding technology, China
at present is not encouraging individuals to start ostrich farms,
Guo said.

WELLINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Two additional electoral
districts will be created in New Zealand in the next general
election, Statistics NZ said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the two, one will be a Maori electoral district, increasing
the electorates for Maori from five to six.
</P>
<P>
On the North Island, a new general electoral district will be
added, bringing the total number on the island to 45.
</P>
<P>
But on the South Island, the number of general electoral
districts will remain at 16.
</P>
<P>
The total seats in the Parliament will be unchanged, staying at
120. The listed seats will be reduced to 53 from 55 to cope with
the change.
</P>
<P>
The extra general electorate is almost certain in Auckland,
where population increases have been the greatest.
</P>
<P>
Government statistician Len Cook said a disproportionate number
of immigrants had settled on the North Island, and particularly in
Auckland, from 1990 to 1996, adding to pressure on electorates.

<HEADLINE> Qian Meets Panamanian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The principle of
keeping only non-official contacts with Taiwan, which most of the
members of the United Nations adhere to, is also applicable to
Panama, said Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
here today.
</P>
<P>
China's reunification is the inevitable trend of times and it
is widely accepted by the international community, said Qian when
he met with Panamanian Foreign Minister Ricardo Alberto Arias at
the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Most of the U.N. member states handle the Taiwan question in
accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations,
that is, keeping only non-official contacts with Taiwan, Qian
noted, adding that this principle is also applicable to Panama in
carrying out its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said that China has been always supportive to Panama
in its efforts to resume its exercise of sovereignty over the
Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that after its return to Panama, the
canal will continue to effectively serve the navigation for the
world.
</P>
<P>
Arias, while expressing thanks to China for its consistent
support for his country on the question, hoped that China will
participate in the development and construction of the canal in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Panamanian people and the Chinese people
have friendly relations for a long time. The oversea Chinese have
made great contributions to the construction of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian foreign minister stressed that Panama will
continue developing relations with China, enhancing bilateral
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian also briefed Arias on China's two major events this year:
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the
resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. "These two
events would have a far reaching influence in the future of our
country," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund just had an
annual conference in Hong Kong, which drew economists and
financial experts from different countries. The fact itself
indicated that foreign countries have seen the prosperity of China
and Hong Kong as well, according to the Chinese vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, he said, it is in accordance with
the interests of both China and Panama to create conditions to
develop their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Arias said his country follows the 15th National Congress of
the Chinese Communist Party in China and Hong Kong's return to the
motherland with great enthusiasm. The convention of the World Bank
conference in Hong Kong showed that the international community is
full of confidence in the future of China and Hong Kong, he said.

of supporting African countries in his talk with Bizima Karaha,
foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

and prolonged exchanges between China and the Democratic Republic
of Congo can be traced back to the years when the African country

<P>
China likes to see the positive changes taken place in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and supports its stability and
development, according to the Chinese vice-premier.
</P>

He said the internal affairs of different countries should be
handled independently by the countries themselves. The external
world can offer help, but should not meddle about, he added.

He said China's consistent policy is to extend sympathy and
support, but no interference in the internal affairs of African
countries. He said he wishes that the Democratic Republic of Congo
will rebuild the country at an earlier date.

Bizima said that the Chinese people have been providing great
help ever since the independence of his country. He reviewed
