<HEADLINE> London Tea Auction Set to Close in June 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The 163-year-old London tea
auction will permanently close in June 1988 because of dramatic
declining trading volume.
</P>
<P>
Robin Harrison, a member of the London Tea Brokers'
Association, was quoted by the Reuters as saying today: "It is
very sad. It is something of a very special ending but the writing
had been on the wall."
</P>
<P>
"It was not commercially viable and the volumes were too low.
We now must look forward," said Harrison, adding London tea
brokers will have to find new ways to sell tea to their clients.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, Lloyd &AMP; Ewart and Wilson, Smithett and Co. are the
only two brokers which are still engaged in the London weekly tea
auction.
</P>
<P>
The Tea Broker's Association said in a release last month that
the auctions will be held on a fortnightly basis after the end of
January until the last sale on June 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The first tea auction in London, organized by The East India
Company in 1679, became a weekly event in 1834. Nearly 50 percent
of Britain's tea imports originate from Kenya and Britain is the
world's biggest tea importer.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some of the world's major tea exporters
including Kenya, India and Sri Lanka, have opened their own tea
auctions, taking away the final straw of the London tea auction.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Calls for Muslims' Solidarity, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
Tuesday urged the Islamic world to close ranks and rally against
Israel's "aggression of Arab homelands."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) here, Al-Assad
expressed the hope that the OIC meeting be the starting point for
solidarity and unity of all Arabs and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Arab delegations, Al-Assad described
Israel's occupation of Arab lands as the "most serious" common
danger and challenge facing the Muslim world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Arabs, who are bearing the brunt of "Zionist
aggressions," are actually fending off the Zionist dangers that
might jeopardize all Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad blasted Israeli occupation as "hostile designs against
Arab land, people and civilization." "The deeper we look into the
series of events and developments which have taken place in the
20th century, the clearer appears the volume of those hostile
designs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked foreign powers for support Israel, saying they
"sow seeds of dissension in Arab and Muslim lands."
</P>
<P>
"Any dissension in our ranks is a source of strength for
Israel and an opening for infiltration into Arab and Muslim
countries," warned the president.
</P>
<P>
He praised Iran for its support of the Arab nation and
its struggle against Zionist greed for the land, wealth and
resources of Arabs and Muslims, and for its dedication to
"raising high the banner of Islam."
</P>
<P>
The president arrived here Monday for the eighth Islamic
summit. Syria, which sided with Iran in its eight-year war
against Iraq, has kept good relations with the Islamic
republic.

<HEADLINE> Russia's "Big Four" Hold Talks on 1998 Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has begun talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
speakers of both chambers of the parliament on the 1998 draft
budget, the Interfax reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We still have some questions to sort out. At this stage we
have to continue working on the budget," the president said at the
start of the talks, dubbed the meeting of the "big four."
</P>
<P>
The president said the draft budget should be further revised
so that it could win support from the State Duma (lower house of
parliament) at its second reading there.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said at the talks that the government's most
urgent task is to ensure the passing of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the State Duma approved the first reading of the
government's 1998 draft budget after Yeltsin made a surprise visit
to the chamber to appeal for deputies' support.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Tuesday's
meeting also discussed the topics to be addressed at the
round-table talks scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the December 11 talks would focus on land
reform.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa to End Health Cuts to Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal government has
promised that it will guarantee at least 12.5 billion dollars (8.8
billion USD) a year in transfer to the provinces for health care,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, a fiscal dividend from the successful fight
against deficit, ends a final round of cuts to health and social
programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is the single most important, tangible result of the
cleanup of the nation's balance sheet," said Finance Minister Paul
Martin.
</P>
<P>
It also means the ruling Liberal Party has made good on an
election promise that they would guarantee the 12.5 billion
dollars starting in the 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally projected a drop in the Canada
Health and Social Transfer (CHST) system to 11.8 billion dollars
in 1998-99 and 11.1 billion dollars in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The increase marks a turnaround from a steady erosion of the
government's health spending over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
However, the 12.5 billion dollar in CHST transfers for this
year is still more than 7 billion dollars lower than the CHST
level in 1993-94, the reports noted.
</P>
<P>
Canada's provinces have been complaining about the deep cuts,
which they say hurt the health care systems and put more burden
onto the provinces.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pay Gap Exists Between EU Women, Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A significant pay gap exists
between women and men in European Union (EU) member states, said
survey results released here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, by the EU's statistical office Eurostat, covers pay
in four countries -- Sweden, France, Spain and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Its data show that women's hourly earnings as a percentage of
those of men differ from 84 percent in Sweden to 73 percent in
France and Spain, and to just over 64 percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Compared with male managers, women managers are worse off. In
Britain, they get two-thirds the pay of their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"There is a noticeable trend ... in all four countries, that
the elder the age group of women is considered, the further they
fall short of the average male earnings," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Although women with a university degree may earn more money
than women with lower qualifications, they actually earn a smaller
percentage of the equivalent male earnings, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, women and men in lower-paid non-manual jobs, such as
clerks and shop assistants, are close to equal pay.

The vehicles are sent here as part of an agreement reached in
1994 on China's long-term interest-free loan to Cambodia.

China's Ambassador to Cambodia Yan Ting'ai also spoke at the
ceremony, saying he hoped the vehicles will play an active role in
Cambodia's economic recovery and development.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Expressed Confidence Over Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, in a state of the nation address today, expressed his
confidence that the country would pull out of the current
economic setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at parliament, Mugabe said Zimbabwe is expected to
register a low economic growth rate of 3.7 percent this year as
compared to 8.1 percent recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
The government is, however, committed to containing the level of
deficit to no more than five percent of the gross domestic
product by the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the Zimbabwe Program for Economic and Social
Transformation (ZIMPREST), the second five-year economic reform
which started this year, is meant to achieve macro economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
''During the life of ZIMPREST, inflation is expected to
decline to single digit levels, savings to reach at least seven
percent in real terms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The president called for conlective responsibility so as to
turn around the negative economic environment the country was
currently going through.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that drive to privatize and dispose of parastatals
would be intensified in the country.
</P>
<P>
To effect future privatization drive, Mugabe said, the
government intended to establish a privatization unit which would
undeertake the function of appraising valuating and negotiating
the sale of identified parastatals.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the government ministries will before the
end of this year publish mission statements as part of the civil
service reform program, and the presidential office will monitor
the implementation of cabinet decisions and coordinate government
policies.

<HEADLINE> China's Zhan Breaks 70kg World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Zhan
Xugang Tuesday lifted 195.5kg in the men's 70kg class
clean-and-jerk event at the World Weightlifting Championships to
set a new world record.
</P>
<P>
Zhan broke his own world record by half a kilogram set in the
1996 Atlanta Olympics. However, He failed to win the gold because
it was set outside official competition, and did not count towards
the official totals.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old registered 195kg, the same as Vanev Zlatan of
Bulgaria, who finished ninth at the Atlanta Olympics. But Zlatan
is 0.25kg lighter than Zhan, so he swept all three events in the
category, with a total of 355kg and the snatch of 160kg and
clean-and-jerk 195kg.
</P>
<P>
Zhan, was forced to settle for a trio of silver medals
(157.5kg, 195kg and 352.5kg), but his world record was the third
set by Chinese lifters since the start of the championships.
</P>
<P>
Hometown favourite Suta Khassaraporn, world record holder in
the women's 59kg clean-andjerk, won the gold medal in that event
but was disappointed with her lift of 117.5 -- far below her 125kg
record set in October at the Southeast Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
It was the first gold medal that Thailand has ever savoured at
the current tournament which started Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Khassaraporn also snatched 92.5 for a total of 210 to take the
silvers. Indonesian Potmawati took the two golds, with 97.5kg and
212.5kg respectively.
</P>
<P>
China, who has dominated last two day's women competition, did
not send its lifters to contest in the category.
</P>
<P>
A total of 210 men and 151 women are competing in the world
championships to be concluded Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Three New NATO Invitees Unprepared to Join </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic are profoundly unprepared to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), according to the latest
edition of the Defense News.
</P>
<P>
The weekly magazine quoted NATO's classified documents as
saying that the three countries which the alliance decided to
accept as new members are years away from having militaries that
are minimally functional.
</P>
<P>
The information are contradictory to the recent public
statements by the alliance and European and American government
officials.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers, when meeting early this month, agreed
that the 16 allies need to transfer only 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars over 10 years to NATO's budget.
</P>
<P>
When addressing a general assembly in Paris of the Western
European Union on December 4, NATO's Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the cost estimate was based on a "very solid military
analysis."
</P>
<P>
The invitees' military infrastructure is "in a better condition
than we had expected and the emphasis is on training and
interoperability, not high-tech equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense News reported that the scope and depth of the
problems identified in the documents cast doubts into the ability
of the three to upgrade their military sufficiently or quickly
enough to attain interoperability with NATO in the near term.
</P>
<P>
"The deficiencies also demand a frank examination in NATO
parliaments whether the alliance can fund the real cost of
integrating the three into its structures with the limited money
to be set aside for this undertaking," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO's documents listed deficiencies of the three countries
in army, navy and air force "page after page," according to the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's assessments reveal that vast swaths of the three
countries, military infrastructures, ranging from Poland's Navy
and ports to the Czech Republic's Air Force, are obsolete,
unsecured for communications and generally incompatible with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Poland, NATO said in its documents that the
country's Navy is "well below NATO standards" and none of its
ships is "capable for command and control of joint or combined
operations."
</P>
<P>
In its 32-page assessment of Hungary, the alliance noted that
interoperability between the Air Force's command and control
systems and those of NATO is "very difficult or impossible in the
near term."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Workers Protest Taxes Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of the
Zimbabwean workers today staged a nationwide demonstration,
protesting the Finance Bill which seeks to increase sales
tax and tariffs on electricity and fuel.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Zimbabwean government hiked tax on goods and
services by 2.5 percent to 17.5 percent, electricity tariff from
five to 10 percent, and fuel prices also increased.
</P>
<P>
In Harare, the country's capital, business came to a
standstill as workers stayed away from work and took to
streets for the demonstration organized by the Zimbabwe Congress
of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
</P>
<P>
There was even heavier police presence outside government
buildings and other public buildings such as banks.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, youths from the high density suburbs who
joined in the march, turned violent as they taunted the travelling
public and motorists, throwing stones at riot police who reacted
by firing teargas.
</P>
<P>
Workers in nearly all of the country's major cities also held
the similar demonstrations, causing closure of the entire
commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU announced it would be convening a special general
council meeting to deliberate the nationwide mass protests.

<HEADLINE> World's Longest Undersea Fiber Cable Put into Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The world's longest undersea
fiber-optic cable system, the first of a new generation of
high-capacity undersea cables, was put into service today.
</P>
<P>
Known as Fiberoptic Link Around the Globe (FLAG), the system is
organized and designed by Bermuda-based FLAG Limited and Bell
Atlantic Corporation with its headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The cable is the logest man-made structure ever built,
stretching 28,000 kilometers and linking Europe and Asia by way of
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
With landing points in Japan, Korea, China (Shanghai and Hong
Kong), Malaysia, Thailand, India, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt,
Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, FLAG offers approximately 75
percent of the world's population access to a broadband
superhighway intended to meet the soaring demand for international
communications services, acting chairman of FLAG Limited Daniel
Petri told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The system can transmit more than 10 gigabits of digital
information per second -- the equivalent of 600,000 simultaneous
conversations -- over two fiber pairs and offer secure and reliable
transmission to regions previously dependent on satellites, Petri
said.
</P>
<P>
FLAG construction was built in 27 months at a cost of 1.5
billion U.S. dollars. The system goes into service with 66
international carriers as customers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government has
promised that it would deal firmly with those protesting British
farmers in an effort to protect beef imports from other European
Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>

Simon said in the letter that the British government "takes the
threat of disruption to trade extremely seriously."
</P>

"We strongly condemn the action of those demonstrators who have
disrupted traffic. We condemn the actions of those demonstrators
who have disrupted traffic," he said.

behavior intended to persuade drivers to discontinue their
journeys".

ports.

<HEADLINE> FSA, PIA to Combine Pensions Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) - The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) and Personal Investment Authority (PIA) Boards have agreed
to create a single integrated division responsible for the
regulatory work arising from the mis-selling of personal pensions
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is announced here today that the division will include the
PIA Pensions Unit; the PIA pensions review monitoring department.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a new financial regulator was announced by
Chancellor Golden Brown on 20 May; and the Financial Services
Authority was formally launched by him on 28 October.
</P>
<P>
Creation of the FSA will occur in two stages. Once the Bank of
England Bill comes into force, the FSA will acquire responsibility
for banking supervision.
</P>
<P>
At that point, staff employed by the Investment Management
Regulatory Organization, the PIA and the SFA will also transfer to
the FSA.
</P>
<P>
The new division has set target deadlines for reviewing firms
to complete all the cases in the pensions review by 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 615,000 cases currently under review. At
31 October 1997, 90,000 investors had accepted offers of redress
worth a total of 503 million pounds (804.8 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Production Down in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's agricultural sector
growth rate fell by two percent this year compared to 21.4
percent in 1996, due to the excessive rains in 1996/97, President
Robert Mugabe said today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting at parliament the 10th state of the nation address
since independence in 1980, Mugabe said tobacco output which is
the country's biggest foreign currency earner had declined this
year.
</P>
<P>
Production of flue-cured tobacco fell by 7.5 percent from
175,350 tonnes in 1996 while burley tobacco fell by 19 percent
from 4,631 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Due to the uncertainty of the intensity, duration and coverage
of this year's rainy season, the government has taken steps to
mitigate the effects of a possible food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the manufacturing sector is estimated to register a
growth performance of 8.5 percent compared to four percent
registered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects a consolidation of the growth momentum which
commenced in 1996. In order to further spur this growth every
effort is being made to source concessionary loans from external
sources for lending to the business community," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector has on the other hand been adversely
affected by low international prices, rising costs of production
of nickel, copper and gold among the most affected.

<P>
MOGADISHU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were confirmed
dead and four others were wounded when armed clashes erupted
between rival militiamen supporting faction leader, Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, in North Mogadishu late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the fighting began when armed men
manning a checkpoint at a road junction in North Mogadishu have
shot and killed the driver of a public transport minibus where
also several others were wounded. The eyewitnesses also said two
more others were also killed in two different junctions in just
few moments.
</P>
<P>
Angry militiamen trying to take revenge
have attacked a garage in Karan district where the heaviest
clashes occurred following the excessive use of rocket propelled
grenades, recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns as well as
assault rifles, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, most of the dead were noncombatant
civilians that include two engineers, none of whom belonged to
the clansmen who were engaged in the fighting today.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is related to an earlier clashes
between the same two groups in Deganley village, 25 km north of
the capital, late last month. Reports said 15 people were killed
in the previous incident when the two groups argued over the
ownership of a farmland in the area.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has so far subsided as the darkness overshadowed
the area. However, angry militiamen remain in defensive position.
</P>
<P>
This incident is unfortunately taking place at a time when
all the Somali factions are meeting in Cairo for a possible
solution to Somalia's long-standing political crises.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Pessimistic on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders attending the
Eighth Islamic summit starting here today were pessimistic about
the Middle East peace process in view of Israel's hardline stance.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hope for the peace process because of the Israeli
hardline policies and Israel's refusal to implement the peace
agreements with Arab countries," Secretary-General of the Arab
League Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid said in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meguid accused the Israeli Likud government of bringing the
peace talks between Arab countries and the Jewish state into a
deadlock, making the Arab world losing hope of the future of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat told Xinhua at the summit hall that the peace
process can not be resumed unless international communities make
efforts to save the process and put more pressure on the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process became one of the hot topics at
the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Despite sharp differences over relations between Islamic
countries and Israel, almost all the participating OIC members are
against the Israeli stubborn attitude and aggressive nature
regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the PNA and Israel were stalled earlier this
year because of the intransigent policies of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu towards the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the inaugural session of the OIC summit
this afternoon, Arafat said that the peace cannot be realized
unless the occupied holy city of Jerusalem returns to its
legitimate owners as the capital of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is the city of peace and tolerance, it is the key to
a just, lasting and comprehensive peace, the peace of braves
which we all are looking for," the Palestinian leader said.
</P>
<P>
He called for solidarity and unity among the Islamic countries
in confronting Israel's arrogance and its practice to ignore the
right of the Palestinian people to freedom, independence and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the OIC summit will be an
opportunity for the Islamic countries to overcome their
differences and close their ranks in their fighting against the
Israeli aggression.

PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- French women control less their
consumption of alcohol during pregnancy than those of other
European countries such as Britain and Spain, Agence France-Presse
(AFP) quoted some doctors specialized in alcohol problems as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of alcohol by mothers during their pregnancy can
seriously affect the growth of body and intelligence of their
babies.
</P>
<P>
In France, 27 percent of pregnant women are exposed to the risk
of harming their children because of consumption of alcohol, as
compared with 5 percent in Britain and the Netherlands, and 3
percent in Spain, according to the doctors.
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol contained in drink passes very quickly into blood,
During the period of pregnancy, it goes across the placenta and
acts directly on the foetus," said the doctors.
</P>
<P>
The alcoholism syndrome of foetus cannot be observed but in
those born of mothers who drink an excessive amount of alcohol, or
more than six cups of alcohol a day, said the doctors.
</P>
<P>
France is among the countries of high per capita consumption of
alcohol, with 11.5 liters in average by each inhabitant in one
year.
</P>
<P>
Among 3.3 million French nationals who have a problem linked
with alcoholism are 600,000 women, according to the French
Committee for Education and Health, a national health information
organ.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Postpones Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen postponed his six-day trip to the Middle East,
stated to begin this weekend, because of continuing tension over
weapons inspections in Iraq, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Iraq remains unsettled at a time when we
are maintaining a significant force in the Gulf area and demands
continued monitoring," the Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
After Iraq allowed U.N. weapons inspectors back to Baghdad on
Nov. 20, the United States raised new demands to inspect
so-called presidential area in Iraq but was refused by the Iraqi
government on the ground it was a way of encroaching sovereignty
and dignity. And Washington still is keeping its mighty forces,
including two aircraft carriers, in the Gulf ready to give a
military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The other issue that Cohen chose to stay in Washington was
for preparation for decisions on any new NATO-led military force
in Bosnia next June and on whether U.S. troops might join such a
force.
</P>
<P>
"Since political guidance must be prepared by Dec. 18 for
military authorities to develop those options, Secretary Cohen
has decided to remain in Washington," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such postponement of an overseas trip by
Cohen in a month over the Iraq situation.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 10, he put off a major 12-day trip to China and five
other Asian countries, scheduled to begin two days later.

component of MONUA will be Gradually downsized.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the peace process in Angola
continues to be slow, with intermittent surges of UNITA
cooperation and long periods of stagnation following one another.
</P>
<P>
Annan said since his last report to the Security Council on
October 17, there has been no significant progress in the
implementation of the remaining tasks. He blamed both the Angolan
Government and UNITA, but in particular UNITA, for this
unsatisfactory state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief noted several key provisions of the Lusaka
Protocol have not been completed, in particular the
demilitarization of the troops of UNITA, and the extension of
State Administration throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General urged UNITA to complete without further
delay the crucial tasks of demilitarization and extension of the
State of Administration throughout Angola.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Iran Relations Improving: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the relations between Egypt and Iran, which
were severed 18 years ago, are now improving.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Egyptian TV program, Moussa, who is
currently leading Egypt's delegation to the Islamic summit in
Iranian capital Tehran, said "Egyptian-Iranian ties are improving,
while the differences between the two countries should be
eliminated or be dealt with."
</P>
<P>
Moussa is the first Egyptian foreign minister to visit Iran
after Tehran and Cairo broke off their diplomatic ties after Egypt
signed the David Camp Accord with Israel in 1979. But relations
have been warmed up in recent years, particularly in economic and
scientific cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described Iran as a significant country in the region,
adding the country has historical ties with the Arab countries in
general and Egypt in particular.
</P>
<P>
He called on former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani Monday
on the sidelines of the summit, the biggest event Iran has hosted
since the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
In November, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab-African
Affairs Seyyed Mohammad Sadr said that Iran is all set to resume
diplomatic ties with Egypt, but on condition that their views
concur on Israeli regime and the talks on the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati visited
Cairo last May to invite Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
attend the Islamic summit.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Mubarak has expressed the hope that
Cairo and Tehran will develop military cooperation to confront
regional threat like the Israeli-Turkish military cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Albright Will not Meet Savimbi During her Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States Embassy in
Angola revealed today that during her visit in Angola, the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will not meet with Jonas
Savimbi, chairman of Angola's former rebel movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Albright has invited Savimbi for a meeting in Luanda, capital
of Angola, on issues concerning the peace process. However, no
reply of certainty has been received so far, an official of the
U.S. Embassy said here.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Angolan congressmen told the local press that
Albright's forthcoming visit will inject fresh blood into the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Pinto de Andrade, congressman of the ruling National
Liberation Movement of Angola, said Albright's visit on December
12 will impel the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to speed up its implementation of the peace accord
signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Even she could not meet with Savimbi, he said, the importance
of her visit will not be affected, for UNITA's representatives in
Luanda could convey to Savimbi the stand of the United States
government.
</P>
<P>
Landu Victor, congressman of the People's Democratic Party,
believed that the visit by Albright, a key figure in the U.S. who
is familiar with the Angolan peace process, will prove to be very
important to the development in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Victor said he hoped that "it is most important Albright will
meet with Savimbi during her visit in Angola."
</P>
<P>
Albright's seven-nation tour in Africa starting Monday
includes Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Report: 22 Million Refugees Facing Tougher Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (xinhua) -- The 1997-1998 State of
the World's Refugees report, which was issued today here by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says that
life has never been tougher for the 22 million refugees under
UNHCR' responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The report says in many parts of the world, people who have
taken refuge in another country are being harassed, attacked and
even forced to return home. In some regions, refugees are being
pushed form one country to another, fleeing fighting or attacks.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR charges that rich nations are united in their
determination not to accept them. Governments are slamming the
door in the faces of people seeking asylum. They fear the
refugees, and see them as political, social and economic threats.
</P>
<P>
Assistant United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Soren
Jessen-petersen stressed that all countries must protect refugees.
" the right to asylum must be preserved. Asylum is the best way to
safeguard human security and dignity and therefore remains
absolutely essential for humanitarian action."
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent displacement, the report recommends
measures to eradicate poverty, strengthen peace and bring to
justice those people who are responsible for forcing millions form
their homes.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No to External Pressure on Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu declared today that his government will not
subject to any external pressure on the issue of carrying out
further troop redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the southern resort city of
Eilat, Netanyahu said no external pressure will influence Israeli
government on the process of making decisions on further troop
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on media reports that the United States is
exerting pressure on Israel to carry out the delayed second phase
of the three-stage troop pullbacks in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to hold another meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Belgium's capital Brussels next
Wednesday to discuss ways of advancing the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, especially the second redeployment. During their
two meetings in Paris last week, Albright demanded Israel make a
more credible decision on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that once Israel carries out the second
pullback, any additional handover of the West Bank should take
place within the framework of the final-status talks with the
Palestinians. He also dismissed the media reports about his
intention to hand over 6-8 percent of the West Bank in the second
pullback as "incorrect."
</P>
<P>
By making the statement, Netanyahu was apparently trying to
show to Israeli public that he will not subject to any U.S. and
other external pressure.
</P>
<P>
Israeli state television Channel I reported today that the
Israeli government is unlikely to come out with a concrete plan on
the second redeployment before the Netanyahu-Albright meeting next
week.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial committee charged with formulating the second
pullback and Israeli position on the permanent talks have held
three sessions already, but failed to reach an agreement so far
due to inner rift on the Israeli security interests in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israel Radio reported that
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross has telephoned Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy to urge Israeli government to make a
timely decision on the further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The report added that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Near East Affairs Martin Indyk, who retired not long ago as the
U.S. Ambassador to Israel, will visit Israel, Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon next week to advance the stalled Israeli-Arab peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is reportedly increasingly impatient with
Netanyahu for his handling of the peace process, especially the
delay in carrying out the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under signed agreements, Israel should have completed the
first two stages of the three-phase further redeployments in the
West Bank by early September, but it has delayed the pullbacks
due to dispute over the scope and terror bombings in Jerusalem in
July and September.
</P>
<P>
Itamar Rabinovitch, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S.,
told Israel Radio that he expects Albright to increase pressure
on Israel if she does not get what she wants on the further
redeployment during next week's meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He added that, however, because the current U.S. government is
a very friendly one toward Israel compared to the previous ones,
Washington will only apply pressure in a subtle and indirect
way.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Declines in Kenya Despite Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The anticipated heavy spending
for the December 29 general elections in Kenya is unlikely to
spark inflationary pressure, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
indicated that the month-on-month inflation rate for November
fell to 8.2 percent from 8.7 in October.
</P>
<P>
All political parties in this east African country are
expected to spend a lot of money during the campaign period, but
CBK officials said these would not lead to a growth in the volume
of money in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Election observers said last week that the amount of money
spent on elections would be in billions of Shillings with the
ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) estimated to spend
over 5 billion Shillings (about 80 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists, however, pointed out that the money being spent by
political parties for campaigning would be part of the money
already in circulation, hence the total money supply would not
change.
</P>
<P>
"All that will happen is that the money which is in individual
bank accounts will be shifted to particular political parties..."
according to a leading economist.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the reason why inflation rose to unprecedented
levels in 1993, immediately after last general elections in 1992,
is because there was capital flight and heavy injection of new
money into the economy from the printing press.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, CBK sources confirmed that the money market was
at this time round expected to benefit from foreign exchange
coming in to support political parties in the country during the
campaigning period.
</P>
<P>
The increased foreign exchange inflows have boosted the local
currency which was recently under pressure but has seen the
reversal of the depreciation trend, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Shilling dropped to 70 Shillings to the U.S. Dollar
in August when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility funds to the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, the exchange rate is stabilized at some 63
Shillings to the Dollar due to the increased foreign exchange
inflows.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the enactment of the CBK Act this year has
given the monetary authority more control over monetary
management of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the Act, the CBK governor is able to enforce measures to
stabilize the economy without fear of a backlash from external
forces.
</P>
<P>
According to Amos Wako, attorney-general, the Act gives the
CBK "more independence in controlling money supply which is the
main source of inflationary pressure".
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Act provides that government borrowing
from the CBK is restricted to five percent of the ordinary
revenue in the government's audited accounts.
</P>
<P>
This limit seals a loophole which in the past gave the
government access to funds held at the CBK.
</P>
<P>
Observers said fears of an upsurge in inflation in the
countdown to the coming general elections are giving way to
optimism because of strict money supply control and the sealing
of loopholes by the CBK.

said a pipeline will be built via Georgian and Armenian territory
carrying up to nine billion cubic meters of gas annually. another
project under consideration envisages constructing a pipeline
across the bottom of the Black Sea, Serov said.
</P>
<P>
As for military and technological ties, Serov said an accord
had been reached on leasing land and on Russia's responsibility
for the attendant environmental consequences.
</P>
<P>
A solution was found to the recent conflict in Daryal Canyon
after complicated negotiations. Serov said "commissions charged
with border and delimitation issues will start work immediately.
During this time, Georgian and Russian border guards will jointly
control the section."
</P>
<P>
Gerogian leadership is satisfied by the latest talks with the
Russian side and will continue its efforts towards attaining
strategic partnership with Russia, the Georgian minister said.

JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Supreme Court
today issued permission to Israeli army to seal and demolish homes
of five terrorists in Palestinian-controlled area.

MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Albania have "good
prospects in the development of economic, political and cultural
relations", Russian Premier Yevgeny Primakov said today after
negotiations with his visiting Albanian counterpart Paskal Milo.
</P>
<P>

<P>
LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia today urged
industrialized nations to assist developing ones in the latter's
efforts to alleviate poverty and address global climate changes.
</P>
<P>
William Harrington, Zambian Minister of Youth, Sports and
Child Development, made the appeal at the third conference of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate held in Tokyo,
Japan, according to the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current climate changes are posing a threat
to people globally, hence the need for concerted efforts from all
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia considers the issue of climate change seriously as
demonstrated by the development and implementation of various
policies such as the national conservation strategy, national
environmental action plan, forest, energy, and agriculture
policies and the water master plan, said Harrington, who was
transferred to his new post from the ministry of environment and
natural resources in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle one week ago.
</P>
<P>
The former environment minister noted that for the developing
countries to achieve their goals, industrialized countries should
provide technological support accompanied by research and
development, capacity building and strengthening of institutions.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to involve people in climate change
debate and decision making through public awareness program.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 participants from governments, non-government
organizations and business community are attending the 10-day

<HEADLINE> Canada's Anti-tobacco Law Won't Ease, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Health Minister Allan
Rock has vowed that the government will not further weaken
anti-tobacco legislation in face of "blackmail" from cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
The government will only, as promised, amend the law to exempt
auto races from tough new sponsorship rules, he was quoted as
saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
The minister was reacting to an announcement by Imperial
Tobacco that it will withdraw financial support by October from
cultural and sports events in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We shall act when we are ready and we shall not influence, nor
shall we be intimidated by these pressure tactics from the tobacco
companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under legislation to take effect next October, tobacco
advertizing for cultural and sports events is restricted to the
bottom 10 percent of an ad.
</P>
<P>
It also ban ads from broadcast outlets, billboards, street
kiosks, bus panels and store displays. Print ads are allowed only
in adult publications.
</P>
<P>
However, the exemptions would allow tobacco logos or
brand-names on cars and drivers' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Health groups criticized the government for the exemptions,
saying it has already caved in as result of tobacco industry
pressures. The exemptions for car races will just make matters
worse, they said, while urging the government to stand up for
Canada's youths.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the United States
have hammered out a plan for joint military exercises next year,
Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The plan was formally completed during separate meetings
between King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan today and Monday and
a visiting U.S. military delegation, headed by General Anthony
Zinni, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Central Command.
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan will be guarded as military secrets,
Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Both meetings focused on bilateral military and economic
cooperation, especially in activating U.S. military assistance to
the Jordanian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Zinni arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit ahead of the
delivery of 16 U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters, which are worth 200
million U.S. dollars. The fighters are expected in Jordan on
December 17.
</P>
<P>
The jet fighters will come as part of a 300 million dollars
military aid that the U.S. government promised to Jordan after the
kingdom signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Last December,
Jordan received 100 million dollars worth of military equipment
as the first part of the aid.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and U.S. armed forces conducted annual military
exercises in recent years. This year's joint military drill was
held in May and June.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Party Talks Start in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's long-awaited
inter-party talks, which aim at solving the country's political
differences, started today with the participation of 29 political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was held in the capital elected Micheal
Sata, Minister Without Portfolio, and Mainza Chona,
representative from the main opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), as co-chairman for the talks.
</P>
<P>
A five-member committee was also appointed to keep record and
consolidate deliberation of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both the ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (MMD) and the opposition parties showed seriousness and
the meeting carried on in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Sata was quoted by Zambia News Agency as saying that the
inter-party talks will be "successful".
</P>
<P>
Well begun is half done. However, it is still early to say
that the inter-party dialogue which resulted from substantial
external and internal pressures, will succeed in removing the
political differences since the ruling MMD cannot easily make a
concession in terms of electoral matters.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been plagued with political disputes between the
ruling party and the Opposition since the general elections held
last year, which disciplined the presidential hopeful Kenneth
Kaunda, former president and UNIP leader by prohibiting foreign
nationals and those with foreign parentage from contesting the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties led by UNIP thereafter called for new
elections and revision of the constitution's provisions on
candidate qualifications and electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Under Zambia's new constitution which came into force just
before the country's second democratic elections held in 1996,
the president's tenure of office is limited to five year terms
twice.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 27 years and has
foreign parentage--both of his parents are Malawian nationals,
could not run for the elections.

five to six days," said Colonel Ggodwin Ugbo, acting director of
defense information.
</P>
<P>
The military authorities are planning a reception for the
first 1,200 soldiers according to the tradition of the military,
the defense spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The phased pullout program was announced by ECOMOG force
commander Major-General Victor Malu earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were first sent to Liberia in August 1990 to
help stop the conflict started in December 1989 by former warlord
Charles Taylor, who became president of the country after winning
the election in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has some 6,000 troops in ECOMOG, currently estimated
at 11,000-strong from 10 of the 16 countries that make up the
economic community of west African states (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
According to a peace agreement signed in Abuja last year, all
ECOMOG soldiers will leave Liberia before the end of February
next year.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord also asks ECOMOG to help restructure and
train Liberia's post-war army.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor said last month that his government intended to do
the job by itself, warning that the government would expel anyone
in the high command of ECOMOG that attempted to challenge or
share the constitutional power of the president.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent move to solve the problem, Taylor paid a
two-day visit to Nigeria last week. But the result of the visit
has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
As to whether ECOMOG will be involved in the restructuring and
training of the Liberian army, Ugbo said, it is up to the ECOWAS
authority to decide.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm to Produce Artificial Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- An Ottawa-based company will
begin manufacturing its innovative artificial heart next month,
said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The device nicknamed Heartsaver is an implant developed by
scientists at the Ottawa Heart Institute, which is cooperating
with World Heart Corp.
</P>
<P>
It is superior to other ventricular assist devices (VAD)
because of its smallness and technical breakthroughs that allow it
to be powered and monitored by a device through the skin.
</P>
<P>
Patients using the device, which is expected to cost 50,000
Canadian dollars (35,000 US dollars), can live a normal life, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Animal trials of the device are slated to run through 1998, and
human use of the world's first fully implantable artificial heart
is expected in the following year.

<HEADLINE> EU Worried at Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
expressed its worry over the political conflicts and violence
resurfacing in Africa, the Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted EU president for the Africa group and Luxemburg
Foreign Minister Fernand Kartheise as saying here Monday that
such occurrences are contributing to donor fatigue and loss of
confidence in the democratization process in many African
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the EU-SADC (the Southern African
Development Community) joint committee of senior officials, he
said the results of the successful development cooperation with
donors in some countries have been completely destroyed by the
outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion and media find it increasingly hard to
understand that we devote our taxpayers' money to help countries
whose leaders are not capable of preserving peace or solving
their political problems without resorting to force," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said while EU remains confident with the democratic
principles taking root in Africa, the union is concerned with
armed conflicts, especially trans-border military activities that
have taken place without the mandate of competent international
bodies.
</P>
<P>
Kartheise said military solutions, from experience, do not
offer any solution to the root causes to conflicts among and
within nations.
</P>
<P>
He urged SADC organs on political, defense and security to
seriously address issues of conflict prevention and resolution
and management of crises.
</P>
<P>
Your success in promoting peace, stability, human rights and
democracy in Southern Africa will also be instrumental in
promoting the positive image of Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed hope that despite the problems Africa
still remains a continent of hope with enormous human and
economic resources.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief: World Disappointed With Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said here Tuesday that the world is disappointed with the
deadlock of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He termed the Mideast peace situation as a common concern of
the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the eighth OIC summit, Annan
said the international community "cannot but view with deep dismay
the continuing stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He said it is essential that the terms of the Oslo peace
accords are respected to move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived here Monday to attend the Islamic
summit and pay his first visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates that the OIC has a critical role to play in
world peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
"Through you, the world understands the desires and demands of
over one-fifth of the world's population, from all continents," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He advocated partnership between the OIC and the U.N. in
peacemaking efforts in areas like Afghanistan, Somalia and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. enjoys the support of the OIC, together
with the Organization of African Unity and the Arab League, from
the early stages of crisis in Somalia, where he said the common
aim is a broad-based political solution.
</P>
<P>
On recent final peace accords for Tajikistan, he said that the
responsibility for various parties concerned is to establish and
consolidate stability to move toward a durable peace.
</P>
<P>
He said Afghanistan has proved elusive, despite painstaking
and persistent efforts by the OIC and the U.N., and a lasting
peace seems a distant prospect because "Afghan leaders refuse to
rise above their narrow factional interests."
</P>
<P>
He blamed external support for the continuing civil war,
growing human sufferings and worsening situations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world cannot forget the horrifying atrocities
inflicted upon the people of Bosnia, the Muslims in particular.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of the international community to ensure that
those responsible for such genocidal policies are brought to
justice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he sees the OIC and the U.N. as "natural partners
in meeting the challenges of the new era and promoting peace and
prosperity throughout the world."

<P>
LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union (EU)
official said today that Zambia is on the right track in
support should be expected, Zambia News Agency ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted for the visiting EU officials at
Panodzi Hotel here, Jose'da Silva Domingos, EU director for
eastern and southern Africa, hailed the Zambian government for
boldly implementing the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) which
is bearing "positive" results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the SAP is being successfully implemented
despite what he termed as "small accidents" in the process, which
should not be allowed to become "too big" as to derail the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
While donors are willing to support developing countries, said
Domingos, good governance, respect for human rights and democracy
should not be overlooked because they are the basis for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The EU official also urged the Zambian government to revamp
the tourism sector and continue with the privatization program in
order to boost the economy.

JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 22
African states today signed a declaration in South Africa
committing them to an integrated approach, including
international partnerships, to managing urban water resources.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was drawn up at a three-day conference on
water supply and sanitation in Somerset West, a city about 50

<P>
Delegates were told that providing adequate water for human,

The document noted that there was a growing gap between
available resources and the rapidly rising costs of providing
services.
</P>
<P>
The signatories agreed to promote partnerships between
countries and between all actors within countries to harness
resources.
</P>
<P>
They would promote innovative funding mechanism and make
affordable credit available to enable "the poorest of the poor"

<P>
They would attempt to mobilize international financial
resources on equitable and affordable terms. The delegates also

development.

<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A new opposition bloc called
National Democracy Bloc (NDB) was established today in Lebanon
with the aim of reviving the country's political life and pushing
anti-sectarianism movement forward.
</P>
<P>
The bloc, comprising of three current and former parliament
members and other celebrities, was announced established by MP
Bayier Dakash at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Dakash stressed that the NDB is not a party, but a bloc aimed
at uniting all political and social powers.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon is undergoing a very dangerous and
critical stage. "Democracy and freedom have become symbolic. The
gap between the authority and the people is widening," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dakash pointed out that the deteriorating economy has resulted
in an increased number of poor people, a high unemployment rate
and the rampancy of government officials' bribe and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to join the non-sectarian bloc to
revive Lebanese political life and serve the people.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Iraqi Execution of 4 Jordanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government today
issued an official statement to condemn the execution of four
Jordanians in Iraq Monday on charge of smuggling car spare parts,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The execution took place despite Jordanian efforts at the
highest level to enlist information about the nature of the charge
against the four young men, the radio quoted the statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the execution as an "unjust" decision
to the four Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Even if the charges proved to be true, the statement said, the
four Jordanians could only be punished with fines or prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government released the statement after its
cabinet decided to dispatch a medical team to Baghdad upon the
request of Iraq's health minister for humanitarian purposes,
according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Iraqi relations suffered a setback after the 1990-91
Gulf Crisis. However, in recent years, the relations have been
picking up as Iraq provides the kingdom with more oil and keeps
increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are now discussing the increase of the Iraqi oil
supply for the kingdom in 1998.

<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Tuesday, with London and Frankfurt all in the negative
grounds while Paris finishing firmer.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index closed lower for the first time in
four sessions, down 10.3 points at 5,177.1, as a report of weak
consumer spending hit retail stocks and Wall Street drifted lower.
</P>
<P>
The index had risen 217 points in the past three sessions.
</P>
<P>
But bid speculation kept the banking sector buoyant, with
Barclays up 4.2 percent on talk of a banking mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended at lower level on
profit-taking and consolidation after Monday's gains.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that a lack of domestic corporate news gave the
market little upward impetus as the DAX-30 index fell by 38.45
points at 4,184.91 by the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
However, the CAC-40 index in Paris closed 26.93 points higher
at 2,959.40.
</P>
<P>
A rally in banking shares in the wake of the Swiss UBS-SBC deal
boosted the market.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Inspection Dispute Must Be Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said today that there should be ways to settle the
dispute between Iraq and the United States over weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
"It can't go on indefinitely without being resolved," Cohen
said at a joint news conference with South Korean Defense Minister
Kim Dong-jin.
</P>
<P>
Cohen postponed his six-day trip to the Middle East, scheduled
to begin Saturday, because of what the Pentagon said was the
continuing tension in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A crisis over U.N. weapons inspections has been temporarily
defused since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein allowed U.N. weapons
inspectors, including several Americans, back to Baghdad to resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
But the United States still keeps a major air and naval force
in the Gulf region, claiming that the dispute remains as Baghdad
has refused the U.S. demand to search weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq's presidential areas, which the Iraqi government said are
off limits to inspections on the ground of sovereignty and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
Cohen acknowledged the tensions in the Gulf "has been eased,"
but he said, "They could intensify in the future in the event that
we don't see a resolution on that."
</P>
<P>
Cohen explained his decision to delay his Middle East trip was
made because of two issues that should be dealt with in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the continuing tension in the Gulf region, on which
Cohen has to be on alert as a defense secretary, he has to discuss
with President Bill Clinton and prepare for decisions on any new
NATO-led military force in Bosnia next June and on whether U.S.
troops might join such a force.
</P>
<P>
The postponement of the Middle East trip was "a decision on my
part in view of the fact that we have two major issues to deal
with in the coming weeks," he said. "I decided it would be prudent
for me to be in Washington next week when the president is here."
</P>
<P>
But he said he was "not being held hostage."

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Court Attempts to Outlaw Islamic Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Constitutional Court is
attempting to outlaw the pro-Islamic Welfare Party for its alleged
anti-secular nature, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rapporteur Yusuf Ozturk has prepared a report proposing the
Islamic party be disbanded according to either article 68 of the
Constitution or the the Law of Political Party, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The report accuses the party of supporting Islamic
fundamentalists whose activities are aimed at undermining Turkey's
secular system.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the court Yekta Gungor Ozden has distributed the
report to the 11 judges of the court for final discussion.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's procedural law, the judges should meet
Wednesday, and the discussion could last seven to 10 days, which
might be extended when requested.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Welfare Party, headed by Turkey's former prime
minister Necmettin Erbakan, has long been attacked for its
sympathy and support for Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Last May, Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas filed with the
Constitutional Court a case demanding the closure of the party on
the grounds of its anti-secular activities.
</P>
<P>
Under Turkey's law of Political Party, Erbakan and senior
officials will be banned from political activities for at least
five years if their party is outlawed.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Kills Four in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A regional commuter plane
crashed in central Canada Tuesday, killing four people and
injuring 13 others, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three of the dead were killed in the crash, while a boy died
hours later in a Winnipeg hospital.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed about 100 meters off the end of the runway at
about 3:30 p.m. local time while trying to land in "icy, misty"
weather.
</P>
<P>
There were two pilots and 15 passengers on board when the accident
happened.
</P>
<P>
Three of the survivors, two middle-aged men and a five-year old
boy, were critically injured.
</P>
<P>
The military sent a Hercules aircraft from Winnipeg, capital of
Manitoba province, to the crash site, a small Indian community called
Little Rapid Rapids, which is about 300 kilometers northeast of
Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
But it couldn't land because the airstrip there was too small.
</P>
<P>
About five hours later, a small plane owned by the same
commuter company, managed to take off with the three seriously
injured aboard.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was too late for the small boy, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The plane that crashed was an EMB 110, a twin-engine turb-prop
regional commuter with a capacity of 19 people. It was built in 1982
by Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The same kind of plane has crashed in Nigeria, Guatemala and
England.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The first ever large-scale
China Commodities Fair opened here today to further promote the
economic and trade cooperation between China and India.
</P>
<P>
The five-day fair was part of substantial follow-up actions
taken by the Chinese side to strengthen bilateral trade relations
after President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to India last year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugurating ceremony here today, Li Guohua,
vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation of the People's Republic of China, said that there
exists strong complementarity in Sino-Indian economic and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
Further development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation
is not only in the common interests of two peoples but also
conducive to the stability and development in the region, she
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 leading Chinese enterprises from across the
country took part in the fair, the first of its kind that the
Chinese government has ever held in India over the decades.
</P>
<P>
With an exhibition area of over 2,000 square meters and over
100 standard booths, the fair will be a showcase of Chinese
products in such categories of machinery, hardware, minerals and
metals, medicines, textiles, and arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
India is the leading trade partner of China in South Asia. In
1996, the bilateral trade volume between the two countries
amounted to a record high of 1.407 billion U.S. dollars, which was
20.9 percent higher than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> German Court Demands FDP to Return Election Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A court in Cologne ordered on
Wednesday a junior partner in the ruling coalition to return some
10.5 million marks (5.8 million U.S. dollars) in election funds.
</P>
<P>
The Free Democratic Party (FDP) was not entitled to get the
funds for this year from the state coffers, said a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
However, parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth said the FDP
could receive the funds for 1996 despite its failure to file
necessary applications before the deadline of September 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
As decided by the court, Suessmuth, of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), could either ask the FDP to
return the money or deduct the sum from future payments to it.
</P>
<P>
Paying back the money is believed to plunge the FDP into a
financial predicament, which has only 6 million marks (2.86
million dollars) now on its book.

<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- France expressed its regret on
Wednesday over the Serbian delegation's walkout from an
international conference on Bosnia in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs left in protest against mentioning the Kosovo issue
in the final text of the conference, regarding it as Western
interference in their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Talking about the problem of Kosovo is not pointed against the
Serbs but aimed in the contrary at helping the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia go out of its isolation," French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not about representing any side but is about providing
help to the dialogue for finding a stable and long-term solution
(to the problem of Kosovo)," she added.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine wrote to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at
the end of November, asking for a "special status" for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The demand was categorically rejected by Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Small &AMP; Medium-Sized Firms in HK Encouraged to Seek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here today that the government would strive to create a
business-friendly environment for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), which account for 98 percent of the total
industrial and commercial firms in the city.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar titled "Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
Day", Anson Chan, Secretary for Administration, said: "To promote
the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, the most
important macroeconomic element is to create free and
level-playing environment with minimum government intervention."
</P>
<P>
She stressed: "Business decisions should be made by
entrepreneurs themselves."
</P>
<P>
According to Chan, a clear and simple taxation system with low
tax rate, a level-playing field for local and overseas business,
an open, fair and just judicial system, and a clean, efficient
contingent of civil servants are what the government will do for
SMEs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will also provide a support for
SMEs in marketing, financing, technology application, and human
resources management.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has 280,000 SMEs, dominating over the manufacturing
and services sectors. These enterprises employ 60 percent of the
working population in the city.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar provided a forum for entrepreneurs and
officials to share their views on the opportunities, difficulties
and challenges faced with the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong shows that 90 percent of its members have
invested in the inland areas of China. About 43 percent said that
they would increase their investment in inland provinces in the
next three years.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Suspends Operation of Five More Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
decided Wednesday to suspend the operation of five more merchant
banks, so as to help stabilize the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Finance and Economy Lim Cahng-yuel unveiled the
stepped up measure at a press conference, thus bringing the number
of merchant banks under temporary lock-up to a total 14.
</P>
<P>
The five banks are Taehab, Choong'ang, Hanwha, Shinhan and Nara.
</P>
<P>
The stringent measure, effective from December 11 through
January 31, 1998, is Seoul's fresh move, after closing down nine
others on December 2, to ease jitters in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Under a directive by the ministry, the ailing banks have to
submit their self-rescue programs by the end of the year. If they
fail to put their management in order by March 1998, their
business license will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's financial crisis was caused by the failure of a
group of corporates and the bad loans of financial institutions.
The loans, estimated at over 30 billion U.S. dollars, has sent the
Korean currency won plunging to new low against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Seoul appealed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on
November 21 to help the world's 11th largest economy out.
</P>
<P>
After a week of bargaining with the IMF, South Korea, with a
staggering debt of 110 billion dollars, accepted 57 billion dollar
loans with strict terms from the financial institution.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Beefs up Sanctions on S. Leone Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The west African
peacekeeping force ECOMOG has stepped up its monitoring and
enforcement mechanism of the sanction and embargo imposed in July
by west African leaders against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The west African leaders want constitutional rule to be
restored in Sierra Leone after the military overthrew the
civilian government on May 25.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOMOG officials based in Freetown, two fishing
vessels owned by a Ghanaian businesswoman operating in Sierra
Leone were seized on Monday by naval personnel of the Nigerian
ECOMOG warships on patrol on Sierra Leone waters.
</P>
<P>
"The vessels were escorted to the ECOMOG headquarters in
Monrovia," the officials said, without indicating what cargo the
vessels were carrying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Guinean ECOMOG Naval Contingent foiled an
attempt by four Sierra Leonean petrol dealers to smuggle 2,400
five-gallon containers of fuel by sea to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources in Jui, 13 miles east of Freetown said the
four men, "braved the terrific waves of the Atlantic Ocean early
Monday to smuggle the petrol on board a vessel equipped with two
outboard motor engines."
</P>
<P>
The arrested men were later released but the consignment of
petrol was seized.
</P>
<P>
In another development, as sanction and embargo intensified,
the state-run Sierra Leone News Agency reported today that the
prices of essential commodities have risen sharply in the last 72
hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- National striker Hao Haidong
scored four goals as Dalian Wanda, who has secured its third
league champion in four years, trounced Guangdong Hongyuan 5-2 in
a match of the 19th round of Chinese Division A league here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hao, who returned just from China's heartbreaking defeat in
World Cup qualifying campaign, scored his four goals at the 18th,
38th, 61st, 89th minutes.
</P>
<P>
But it's another national Li Ming who opened the account for
Wanda only eight minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
Hongyuan's two goals were scored at the 41st and 88th minutes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The win was meaningless for Wanda, who had collected enough
points last Wednesday to ensure its champion, but the loss was a
fatal blow to Hongyuan, who stood at the bottom of the 12-team
league standings and was on the brink of relegation.
</P>
<P>
The match was delayed by conflicted schedules between the
league and Asian Cup Winner's Cup last week.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian King Urges People to Face Hardship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Supreme Head of
State Tuanku Ja'afar tonight urged Malaysians to be prepared to
face hardship caused by currency manipulation without hoping for
help from anyone but from themselves.
</P>
<P>
Opening the International Al-Quran Reading Competition 1997
here tonight, the king said that the country's economy affected by
the currency manipulation was a test for the people.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Muslims in this country have the will power to face
the economic problem with determination," he said.
</P>
<P>
The king said the people should make sacrifices to ensure the
success of measures taken by the government to improve the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The austerity drive, increasing productivity, the use of more
locally-made products, reducing imports and increasing exports
were among the strategies introduced by the government which
should get the support from the people to help draw the country
out of its economic woes, the king said.
</P>
<P>
Reminding Muslims of their responsibilities to defend the
sanctity and integrity of Muslims worldwide, Tuanku Ja'afar said
"We do not want Muslims in the world to be the target of insults
and hatred."
</P>
<P>
He said that Muslims should learn from the tragic events which
happened and are still happening to Muslims and should endeavor to
rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
Muslims in Malaysia should learn from the incidents involving
Muslims elsewhere and should not be beguiled by a life of comfort
and prosperity, he said, adding that they should also be prepared
to face all eventualities and through determination they could
avoid hardship and sufferings.

KUNMING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials repatriated
the 17th and final group of 49 refugees from the People's
Democratic Republic of Laos today in Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Today's repatriation effort marked the end of the repatriation
of Laotian refugees in the country, according to a Chinese
official with the State Council's Indo-China Refugee Reception and
Settlement Office.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,293 Laotian refugees have been repatriated in line
with a bilateral agreement signed in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China accepted a large number of Laotian
refugees under the auspices of the United Nations High Mission for
Refugees. The refugees mainly resided in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
"All refugees have expressed a desire for repatriation,"
according to Zhang Shaoyun, the local Yunnan official in charge of
the repatriation program.
</P>
<P>
An official from Laos said his government will strive to create
favorable living and working conditions for returning
refugees. Reports indicate that previous repatriated Laotians are

<HEADLINE> Disapproval Rate for Hashimoto Cabinet Rises to 52.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Public disapproval rate for
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet has increased
to 52.1 percent from the previous high of 49.0 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time, said the Kyodo News while releasing its
survey findings Wednesday, the disapproval for the cabinet topped
the 50 percent mark since Hashimoto took office in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increased public discontent was attributed to the economic
slump and uncertainty about the financial systems following the
collapses of a series of Japanese financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll, conducted through interviews during the last
weekend, covered 3,000 voters randomly selected nationwide, of
whom 2,023 responded. An error margin of 3 percent was expected.
</P>
<P>
On reasons of disapproval, 26.5 percent of pollees cited
disappointment with the government's economic policy, followed by
Hashimoto's perceived lack of leadership at 24.2 percent and
discontent about his administrative refrom drive at 12.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet's support rate is at the all-time low of
42.0 percent, down 1.6 percentage points from the previous poll in
October and below the previous low of 43.4 percent in March last
year.

adjourn their summit this morning.
</P>
<P>
A total blackout descended on the summit center after Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif delivered a speech at the beginning of
today's closing session.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who chaired the meeting,
had to call a "temporary recess." The power failures lasted about
seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, a leak on the roof of the newly-built 30-meter-high
summit hall further suspended the meeting until 3 o'clock this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA said in a dispatch that the
power problems "presented an opportunity for the Muslim leaders,
prime ministers and crown princes to enjoy the magnificent sight
of the snowfall."
</P>
<P>
Delegates gathered in front of the glass windows of the hall to
watch the swirling fall of the feathery snowflakes. "The nature's
blessing is particularly interesting for the African leaders
present in the summit," IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Summit spokesman and Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Zarif explained at a news briefing that the suspension of
the meeting was to prevent the recurrence of the "small problem"
inside the hall.
</P>
<P>
The summit hall, which can hold 1,500 people in its main
conference room, took six months to complete for the ongoing
Islamic summit.
</P>
<P>
The snowfall stopped, and sunshine enlivened soon after noon.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Medical specialists
confirmed that the H5N1 virus, which has caused two fatalities in
Hong Kong by triggering influenza A, was originated in birds.
</P>
<P>
A special working group is continuing to track down the H5N1
virus, recently found only in poultry, to find out how it is
transmitted to humans, the Department of Health said here today.
</P>
<P>
The virus have infected four people in Hong Kong, and led to
the death of two. Dr. K H Mak, a consultant of the Department of
Health said here today at a press briefing: "In fact, in the four
cases of H5N1, only one had history of exposure to poultry. The
other three did not have known history of contact with poultry
during the incubation period of influenza."
</P>
<P>
He advised people to take personal hygienic measures such as
washing hands with soap after handling poultry, but denied that
eating poultry could pose a risk.
</P>
<P>
Dr.Mak warned the public of initial signs of H5N1 influenza A,
such as fever, cough, sore throat and running nose. He added that
the best protection is to maintain body immunity by having a
balanced diet, adequate rest and exercise, and good
ventilation.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Dissemination of Science in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce a
1998 program to disseminate scientific information to promote
economic development and improve morale in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint circular issued by the Propaganda
Department of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, some
5,000 libraries will be established early next year, with at least
one facility in every county.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicates that the lack of scientific
information in the countryside has limited both increases in grain
output and development of a commercialized rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The circular calls on Youth League members, entrepreneurs and
young scientists to donate science books and video tapes to the
libraries, and for the establishment of clubs catering to readers.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 volunteer teams will be organized to provide
services and teach farmers how to properly use science and
technology, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The libraries will offer science classes to over 10 million
young farmers, with additional classes to be offered by Party
schools, night schools and vocational high schools.
</P>
<P>
Related work is considered to be an important aspect of efforts
to implement policies of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China regarding improving the cultural,
scientific and sanitary conditions in rural areas, and
consolidating grass roots Youth League organizations.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Nations to Tap Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Islamic leaders are trying to
substantiate their religious identity with economic solidarity
among members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC).
</P>
<P>
According to OIC Secretary General Azzeddine Laraki today,
OIC General Secretariat is preparing a four-year program aimed
at strengthening economic and commercial cooperation, which it
hopes will eventually lead to the formation of an Islamic common
market.
</P>
<P>
The 55 OIC member nations are at different economic
development levels, thus necessitating cooperation, trade and
exchange of information among them.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said the program will assess available capabilities,
determine implementation institutions and work out details based
on the principle of complementarity, mutual economic and
commercial interests and the spirit of Islamic independence.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the richer and more capable countries will
assist poor ones, while cooperation in science, technology,
culture and communication will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The OIC member states will also adjust their tariffs to
facilitate trade and cooperation toward concentrated and
concerted economic unity.
</P>
<P>
However, Lakari admitted that cultural differences of those
countries are posing a major obstacle to the realization of such
a goal and they should be carefully scrutinized and finally
resolved.
</P>
<P>
As to the financial problems of the OIC, he said a
comprehensive reform program has been drawn to collect more
funds, rationalize expenditures and streamline the administrative
system to cut deficit. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The OIC has a small annual budget of about 10 million
U.S. dollars, far from being enough to carry out its missions in
the "best possible manner," and it is now ridden with a debt of
nearly 15 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Atmosphere Improved for Iran-Arab Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that the atmosphere has improved for
better relations between Iran and Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Replying questions from Xinhua on the sidelines of the ongoing
Islamic summit, Moussa said he has discussed with Iranian
officials about the general atmosphere for relations between Iran
and Egypt, and Arab states in general.
</P>
<P>
"What we have seen in general has been improved and will have
influence on the relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Egypt
and other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are still working to further improve our relations"
which should be "as good as we aspire," he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Arab states cooled down after
Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. However, Tehran has launched a
series of initiatives to reach out for the Arab world in a bid to
break isolation enforced by Western countries led by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
After Mohammad Khatami won the presidential elections in May,
Iran repeatedly announced its readiness to develop friendly
relations with Arab neighbors, particularly the Gulf states and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) which opened here Tuesday would be fully
tapped by Iran to remove obstacles in the way for rapprochement
with Arab states.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Economy Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A healthy performance by the
tourism and services sectors in Cyprus has help the country's
economy maintain a steady pace of recovery since May this year,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou was quoted as
saying that the Cyprus economy is now expected to end the year
with a 2.5 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
"The revival of the economy which started in May this year is
steadily continuing with its main driving force being tourism,
offshore and other services sectors," the minister told local
press Tuesday after a meeting with senior officials devoted to
reviewing the island's economy.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said the GDP grew at only one percent in the
first six months of the year, but it picked up pace in the second
half to register an impressive 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of tourists rose 8 percent year-on-year
for the May-October period of this year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the GDP registered a modest growth of 1.9 percent as a
result of a severe drought and tension on the Green Line, which
undermined investors' confidence and hit tourism. Tourism, one of
the island's main sources of income, accounts for nearly 20
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The previous year, 1995, witnessed GDP growth of 6 percent
with an all-time record of 2.2 million tourists visiting the
island.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou gave a good prospect for 1998, saying that the
growth rate is expected to reach 4.5 percent and an improvement
is foreseen for other macro-economic indicators of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou's prediction was agreed by Governor of the
Central Bank, Afxentis Afxentiou, who said during the second
half of this year there has been a significant improvement in
the economy which is set to continue in 1998 if there are no
adverse developments.
</P>
<P>
With regard to other indicators, Christodoulou said
unemployment was forecast to reach 3.3 percent and inflation 3.5
percent in 1997 in comparison with 3.1 percent and 3 percent in
1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
He listed what he called "temporary" factors for the rise in
inflation, together with a lingering drought which had an impact
on prices of farm products.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Cyprus pound against the U.S. dollar
and higher oil prices on world markets last year and in early
1997 contributed to a hike in electricity costs.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the island's foreign exchange
reserves are set to grow to 2.8 billion Cyprus pounds (about 5.6
billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, enough for 14 months of imports.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Newspaper: OIC Summit Shows Failure of US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab and Islamic countries'
consensus on attending the Tehran summit intensively and at the
highest level indicates the failure of the U.S. policy in the
Middle East region, Iraqi newspaper Al-Jomhouriya said today.
</P>
<P>
The way these countries address the summit of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC) voices an American-Israeli sense
of failure and isolation as a result of the current Arab-Islamic
awakening, the official paper added.
</P>
<P>
The most significant U.S. reaction to the convention of the
Tehran summit is a statement by an American State Department
official asking the summit to avoid inciting against Israel and
attacking the Turkish-Israeli alliance, it noted..
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai's visit to Turkey which came one day before the Tehran
summit was intended to be another message of threat to the summit.
</P>
<P>
It called for setting up a comprehensive Islamic-Arab front to
stand against the U.S. evils.
</P>
<P>
The eighth OIC summit opened Tuesday in Iran's capital of
Tehran, with the participation of about 30 presidents,
vice-presidents, emirs and crown princes from 54 of OIC's 55
member states. The seat of Afghanistan is left vacant because the
OIC was divided as to who should represent the country.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit commits itself to promoting "dignity,
dialogue and participation" in the Islamic world and is expected
to address a wide range of issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province exported products valued at some 10.1 billion US dollars
during the first 11 months of this year, thereby exceeding the
annual target by some 280 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the province has recorded exports of 10
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang also led east China's provinces and municipalities in
export growth rate in the period .
</P>
<P>
The rise in exports resulted from local efforts to encourage the
development of foreign trade companies, enterprises with exporting
rights and foreign-funded businesses.

The province now has 641 foreign trade companies and 461
enterprises with exporting rights.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Rate Up in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate
based on consumer prices was 1.65 percent month-on-month due to an
increase in food costs, Trade and Industry Minister Tungky
Ariwibowo said today.
</P>
<P>
The November figure brought the January-November inflation to
9.01 percent year-on-year, Tungky Ariwibowo said after meeting
President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of the higher inflation in November was the rise
in the food price index, which reached 3.66 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the food price index contributed up to 78.8 percent
of the total inflation rate, he added.
</P>
<P>
To control prices, the government will supply the market with
adequate stocks of staple foods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's inflation rate last year was 6.46 percent, the
lowest in recent years. However, this year's inflation rate may
rise to a two-digit figure as a result of the current monetary
crisis and a long dry season which has caused crop production to
drop by more than 3 percent compared with last year, official
sources said.

<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The debate on 35-hour work week draft law presented by the
Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry has entered a
crucial phase: the employers are on a war call, the trade unions are
divided while employees are prudent over whether the law will hurt
employment. In the Loire-Atlantique region in western France, the
local employers' association staged an insurrection against the
draft law at a gathering in Nante on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senegalese capital of Dakar has been saved from an
expansion of AIDS over the past several years, due to its control
of the prostitution trade in the city by obliging the use of
condom by porstitutes, while the rate of local population attained
by AIDS virus in Abidjan has reached 10 percent over the past five
years, the highest in West Africa, because of its failure to
control the prostitution trade there, said experts at the
International Conference on AIDS in Africa being held in Abidjan
this week.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel was the prior target of the Iranian leaders and several
heads of state of the Muslim world on the first day of the eighth
summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference which began Tuesday
in Teheran. Iranian President Mohammad Khatami accused Israel of
being a "warlike, terrorist and racist" state, while Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad accused Israel of the being "the source of
all plots against the Arab or Islamic countries."
</P>
<P>
-- The European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday that France
"missed its obligations" to ensure the free circulation of goods
suring the manifestations by French farmers in 1993 and 1994.
Spanish transporters and farmers who were the mainly victims of the
violence by French farmers, had sued France at the court.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced a 250 million U.S. dollars loan to Pakistan in support
of the country's banking sector reform.
</P>
<P>
The loan will provide balance of payment assistance to the
government of Pakistan, which has already completed the first
phase of reforms aimed at stemming the flow of bad loans and
curtailing loss-making by banks, said a press release issued by
the World Bank office here today.
</P>
<P>
The Single Currency Loan (SCL) will be repayable in 20 years
including a 5-year grace period, and will be at the World Bank's
standard variable U.S. Dollar SCL interest rate, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government and the central bank began the reforms
early this year in an attempt to eliminate political interference
that had left the predominantly state-owned banking sector on the
verge of a crisis, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In the next phase of the program, emphasis will be placed on
assuring that the Nationalized Commercial Banks and Development
Finance Institutions are sold to private investors, it said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Attend Informal ASEAN Summit in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has decided to attend the informal ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) summit to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on
December 15-16, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The president will leave on the morning of December 15 and
return to Jakarta on December 16," Minister/State Secretary
Moerdiono said after meeting with the president at the latter's
residence in Jalan Cendana, Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Soeharto, who is now taking a full 10-day
rest under the advice of medical experts, will also attend a
meeting between the ASEAN and China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto started to rest on December 6 after a 12-day overseas
visit to Namibia, South Africa, Canada and Saudi Arabia. On
Tuesday, rumors said the president was ill, prompting the
Indonesian rupiah to drop sharply by 11 percent in a single day to
4,600 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, Moerdiono denied the rumors on Tuesday night, saying
that the president was in good health.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the president will invite ASEAN leaders to
discuss the monetary crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the nine ASEAN member countries, Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, will also witness their foreign ministers to sign an
agreement on the setting up of the ASEAN Foundation and on
cooperation in services.
</P>
<P>
Following the informal ASEAN summit, the ASEAN leaders will
hold talks with United Nations Secretary General Koffi Annan, who
is expected to be in Malaysia at the invitation of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN leaders on December 16 will also meet with their
Chinese, South Korean and Japanese counterparts for bilateral
talks, an official of the ASEAN Secretariat said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said although they have no special agenda for
these bilateral meetings, the leaders will discuss how to face the
21st century in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and how to respond
to international problems.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leaders Quit Bosnia Conference in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY) and the Bosnian Serb republic walked out of an
international meeting on Bosnia here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The boycott, in protest against what they alleged as Western
intervention in the Kosovo issue, took place shortly before the
annual conference, the third of the kind, was due to end.
</P>
<P>
Leaving the event were FRY Foreign Ministry Director Dragomir
Vucicevic, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic and the Serb
member of Bosnia's collective presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
What prompted them to quit was the inclusion of Western demands
in the meeting's communique that Belgrade negotiate with ethnic
Albanians in its Kosovo region to defuse ethnic tensions there.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel called on the
FRY to start talks on the Kosovo issue, and vowed to do everything
possible to "extinguish the source of fire" there.
</P>
<P>
His remarks immediately invoked criticism from FRY
representatives, who threatened to boycott the meeting if the
Kosovo issue would be put on agenda.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade termed the Western demands as interference in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference was to review, by officials from 50
countries and 21 international organizations, the implementation
of the November 1995 Dayton peace accord for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Among its results was an approval from Bosnian leaders of a
common passport and citizenship for Bosnia, a long-sought decision
which has yet to be approved by the Bosnian parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, they still refused to approve the introduction of a
common currency and common car license plate.
</P>
<P>
Western nations made their intention clear to use the Bonn
meeting as a venue for exerting increased pressure on the Bosnian
leadership for better compliance with the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
"The signal ... must be: Those who want reconciliation will
receive our help. Those who do not implement Dayton accord, who
seek to obstruct the recovery effort, will bear the consequences,"
Kinkel said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) hosted
a reception this evening, marking the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor Song Jian, visiting Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer, and 100 Chinese and foreign dignitaries
attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan proposed a toast and noted the
rising momentum and excellent development of 25 years of friendly
cooperative ties between the two countries in the political,
economic, trade, cultural, educational and scientific spheres.
</P>
<P>
Reciprocal high-level exchanges of visits have increased,
and friendship and contacts between the two peoples have been
strengthened in recent years, according to Qi.
</P>
<P>
Qi noted that the joint efforts of the governments and peoples
of China and Australia have forged a cooperative relationship
geared to the 21st century, with relations developing in a
sustained, stable and healthy manner.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC, China's major institution promoting
people-to-people friendship, will extend the greatest possible
effort to ensure fulfillment of related goals, said Qi.
</P>
<P>
Downer told guests attending the reception: "Today, Australia
and China can boast a mature relationship that is gaining new
momentum at all levels -- one that reflects the deep and expanding
involvement we both have in the life and work of the Asia
Pacific Region."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the relationship with China is "one of our
most important international relationships", which "will continue
to be based on the key principles of shared interests and mutual
respect".
</P>
<P>
Downer went on to say: "This 25th anniversary is a major
milestone", and "what we have achieved over the past 25 years --
and what lies in prospects for the next 25 (years) -- is cause for
considerable optimism."
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government will remain committed to building
and strengthening our relationship with China, and making its
undeniable potential a reality in the years ahead," said
Downer.
</P>
<P>
Song and Downer held joint discussions on issues of common
concern prior to the reception.
</P>
<P>
China and Australia established diplomatic ties on December 21,
1972, with bilateral relations having since entered a new period
of development.
</P>
<P>
China is Australia's fifth largest trade partner and export
market, as well as the major market for Australian wool. The 1996
trade volume between the two nations exceeded 5.1
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one sister cities in the two nations have forged
friendly relations, with friendship organizations serving as
important conduits for promoting overall relations.

and October added up to 5,912,776, down 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although tourists from Taiwan, Portugal and France increased,
those from Macao's main sources of tourists, including Japan, Hong
Kong, China's inland areas and the Republic of Korea, all dropped
remarkably.
</P>
<P>
The number of travelers from Japan plummeted 38.1 percent from
the same period last year, and those from Australia, 19 percent,
those from Hong Kong, 16.9 percent and those from China's inland
areas, 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline of tourists was also seen at the Hong Kong-Macao
port terminal, which has remained quiet most of the time since
April. It recorded a nearly 20 percent drop in arrivals from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tourists coming from Hong Kong used to account for some 70
percent of all tourist arrivals, which reached 8.15 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
Macao tourism officials blamed "exaggerated reports" on Macao
security problems, the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and less
 tourist arrivals to Hong Kong for the decline. They vowed to
attract more tourists next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng expressed
appreciation over the Australian government's "friendly attitude"
towards China over the past year during a meeting with visiting
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer here today.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has pursued the `One China' policy, supported Hong
Kong's smooth return to the motherland as well as China's early
entry to the WTO, and encouraged dialogues instead of
confrontation on the issue of human rights," Li said while
retrospecting bilateral relations in the past year.
</P>
<P>
China and Australia are both countries of great influence in
the Asia-Pacific region, and they share broad common interest and
shoulder common responsibility in safeguarding the world peace and
stability, especially in stimulating the regional economic
co-operation, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that China has always stressed its relations with
Australia and is ready to expand contacts, deepen understanding,
closer consultation, and develop co-operation between the two
countries through joint efforts in order to bring a developing
mutually beneficial Sino-Australian relations into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago,
bilateral co-operation in many sectors have undergone sound
progress, with economic and trade relations expanding and mutual
investment ever increasing, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the new progress in Sino-Australian relations would
be impossible if it was without the efforts from Prime Minister
John Howard and Foreign Minister Downer himself, he expressed the
belief that through concerted efforts of both sides, bilateral
relations will keep the present good momentum.
</P>
<P>
Downer agreed with Li on his evaluation on bilateral
relations. He spoke highly of the development of bilateral ties
especially the economic and trade relations over the past 25
years, saying that the Australian government and people are
pleased about the progress.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China exerts a great influence and plays
an important role in the Asia-Pacific region and the even the
world as a whole.
</P>

and will adhere to the "One China" policy and continue to expand
its mutually-beneficial co-operation with China, Downer said.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Brisk sales in the United
States retail market have fueled Hong Kong's toy exports, which
are expected to grow by 10 percent this year, sources from the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Young, chairman of the TDC's Toy Advisory Committee,
said that the American retail market registered satisfactory
growth in the third quarter and sales were particularly strong
during the Thanksgiving period.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, Hong Kong's total
exports of toys, dolls and games added up to 66 billion HK dollars
(8.5 billion US dollars), up 8 percent over the same period last
year. Exports to the United States rose by 7 percent and accounted
for 48.2 percent of Hong Kong's total toy exports.
</P>
<P>
Toy exports to Southeast Asia could be affected since Hong Kong
products are relatively expensive for consumers in those
countries, where currencies were depreciated in recent financial
turmoil, according to Young.
</P>
<P>
The TDC will organize a large-scale toys and games fair in
January 1998, in an effort to promote Hong Kong's products to a
wider spectrum of markets. Young said that baby toys and sporting
goods were two main categories in Hong Kong's toy exports.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Trying to Improve Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia needs to improve its
poor image to attract more foreign investment, Bwalga Ng'andu,
director of Zambia Investment Center (IC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing held at the State House, Ng'andu said that
Zambia shared a "poor" image with Africa as a whole, which
impedes the inflows of foreign direct investment into the
country.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Xinhua to specify Africa's negative image which
Zambia shares part of it, Ng'andu said that the image is
characterized by military coups, AIDS, lower productivity and
inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
He added that this image has weakened the investors'
confidence and leads to a conception by western countries that
the continent is a "small African village".
</P>
<P>
This is the obvious reason why the continent has so long been
ignored by potential investors, stressed the IC director.
</P>
<P>
However, Ng'andu pointed out that "business is not 100 percent
risk free", urging foreign investors to "come and have a look" in
order to have a better understanding of the country and its
people.
</P>
<P>
He added that Zambia needs to inform the world that things are
changing and the investment environment is improving since there
is no foreign exchange controls in the country and the country's
tariffs is the lowest in the sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the inflows of foreign direct
investment into Zambia represents a growing tendency. In 1995,
according to Ng'andu, the country registered 56 million U.S.
Dollars of such investment while in 1996, the inflows reached 62
million Dollars, with an increase by about 10 percent.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian security forces seized
a man who hijacked a passenger plane with about 140 people aboard
on Wednesday and all the hostages were released unharmed, airport
and security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker was arrested by anti-terrorist "Alfa" group when
he came out to negotiate at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, a 59-year-old man, seized the Ilyushin-62
airliner earlier on Wednesday after it took off from the Far
Eastern city of Magadan en route to Moscow with about 140
passengers and crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker had demanded 10 million U.S. dollars in cash and
safe passage to Switzerland, officials said.
</P>
<P>
An airport spokeswoman said earlier that the hijacker had
surrendered but later reports made clear he had been seized by
commandos.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zaitsev, head of Russia's Federal Aviation Service,
said the hiajacker had been "wired up" but it was not immediately
clear whether he had been carrying any real explosives.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at about 11.30 a.m. local time (0830 GMT) at
Sheremetyevo airport. The hijackers released 48 hostages at 12:15
a.m. (0915 GMT). There were no foreign passengers on board the
plane.
</P>
<P>
The seized hijacker hinted earlier that there were three
hijackers, the Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, as saying the president was pleased by the peaceful
outcome to the hijacking.

MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A cloud seeding project of the

equivalent to 14-day consumption, a presidential press release
said today.
</P>
<P>
The release said Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero

Escudero added that cloud-seeding aircraft will also be sent
this week to provinces in the central and southern parts of the
country to ease the drought there caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
However, witnesses said that a water rationing system is still
in effect in Metro Manila due to the sharp fall of water levels of
main reservoirs supplying water to the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been taking measures to cushion
the effects of the El Nino phenomenon, including digging deep
wells, constructing water projects and water rationing as well as

SHANGHAI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- From January to November,
1.85 million CDs were imported through Shanghai Customs, 10.2
times more than the same period of last year, according to
statistics released by the customs office of this economic

down on pirate products and smuggling, and maintaining sound
import and export order.
</P>
<P>
Most of the imported CDs here feature Chinese classical music
and dancing music with domestic copyright. Experts say the reason
behind is that Chinese CD makers lack the ability to produce

70 percent of the CDs coming through the Shanghai Customs are

operation of the Hong Kong government, soldiers of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) might bring troubles to the peaceful life of
the Hong Kong citizens and cases of corruption might increase
after the handover, Bodenmuller said.
</P>
<P>
"But now I see no sign of interference from Beijing, the PLA
soldiers are out of sight of the people and a recent report of the
Independent Commission Against Corruption said that the cases of
corruption had decreased," the gray-haired Bodenmuller said.
</P>
<P>
Sitting comfortably in his chair and smoking a pipe,
Bodenmuller spoke highly of the efficient work of the ICAC after
the handover. "ICAC has been widely recognized for its excellent
contribution to the anti-corruption."
</P>
<P>
Looking out from the windows of his office, which is on the
37th floor, ships were sailing on the Victoria Harbor and cars
running in streets.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the sea and the streets, Bodenmuller said: "Look,
everything is working the ways it worked before. I don't notice
any changes. Of course, the flags are different."
</P>
<P>
Bodenmuller, born and educated in Berne, joined the diplomatic
service in 1973 and has undertaken several foreign postings in
Copenhagen, East Berlin, Pretoria and Rome.
</P>
<P>
Last month was special for Bodenmuller and his colleagues. They
were busy organizing the month-long promotion entitled
"Switzerland Greets Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The objective of the activity was to make Switzerland and its
many-sided faces better known to the people of Hong Kong. They
showed the Hong Kong people Switzerland's business, tourism,
culture, gastronomy, arts and music.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss people and enterprises want to express their strong
confidence in the future of Hong Kong and their firm commitment to
enhance the excellent bilateral relationship between Switzerland
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Bodenmuller described the activity as "very successful". "We
are very happy about the results. The press coverage was very good
and we got very positive responses, although the events coincided
the stock market volatility in Hong Kong," Bodenmuller said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will recover from the financial crisis in Asia faster
than other economies in the region because it has good economic
fundamentals, good financial operation systems, rich foreign
exchange reserves and, above all, a team of financial experts.
</P>
<P>
Bodenmuller said Hong Kong's prospects will be very bright. It can
play a more important role for China because it is a gate for
foreign businessmen to do business with China.
</P>
<P>
"I think Beijing really fulfills its promises to give Hong Kong
a high degree of autonomy," Bodenmuller said.
</P>
<P>
The policy of "one country, two systems" is so far so good.
That is a unique concept, which can also serve as an example for
the other countries and regions to solve the problems left over by
history, he commented.
</P>
<P>
There are around 200 Swiss companies in Hong Kong. The biggest
are the Nestle, a producer of chocolate, cream, food and world
leader for baby milk, and ABB, a combined company between Sweden's
Asean and Switzerland's Brown Boweri, which specializes in power
stations.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's exports to Hong Kong jumped by 20 percent in the
first 10 months of this year and the imports from Hong Kong
increased by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bodenmuller, 55, said he loves Hong Kong because this is an
interesting place. His son and daughter have been to Hong Kong
several times and once to Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Hiking is his hobby and he often goes to Lantau Island, Sai
Kung and "every corner of Hong Kong". His another hobby is to
collect pipes. On a table in his office, there are more than 20
pipes from different countries.
</P>
<P>
"One of my regrets is that I have few opportunities to talk to
the ordinary people because I am unable to speak Cantonese. I am
very sorry about this," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Recovers 1.33 Billion Dollar Overdue Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 59.84 billion taka
(1.33 billion U.S. dollars) of overdue loans were recovered in the
period of January-October this year, the national news agency BSS
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah AMS
Kibria while addressing a gathering of students and teachers of
the Dhaka University Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievement to some stern measures in the
banking sector and the strict supervision of the Bangladesh Bank,
the central bank, by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proportion of overdue loans had come down to
37.87 percent at present from 40.31 percent earlier.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of overdue loans has exceeded 100 billion taka
(2.22 billion dollars), according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
"The country's overall economic condition is now in a
satisfactory level, and Bangladesh's economy can reach a
respectable position in the world arena through successful
coordination of our natural resources and skilled manpower," the
finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that credit in the private sector, which was
increasing at a rate of 16.78 percent currently, was "very
satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Export growth was estimated at 21 percent in the July-September
period this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government followed a non-inflation growth strategy, the
minister said, adding "the current rate of inflation is still
below 5 percent."
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to privatize loss-making industries
and national organizations as these industrial units were causing
an annual loss of 25 billion taka (555.6 million dollars), the
finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that the country's "present foreign exchange
reserves of 1.6 billion dollars were not at a comfortable level."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian leaders attending an
international peace conference here have agreed to introduce a
common passport and citizenship law for their country as a gesture
to implement the Dayton peace accord, diplomatic sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which still needs approval of the Bosnian
parliament, had been demanded by German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine during their
recent trip to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bosnian leaders have not agreed to a common
currency and a common car license plate which had also been sought
by the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The two-day international conference on the implementation of
the Dayton peace accord for Bosnia will be concluded later
Wednesday with the adoption of a final declaration which is
expected to put additional pressure on the Bosnian parties to
comply with the peace agreements in exchange for further Western
help.
</P>
<P>
The conference is also seeking to strengthen the role of
Western mediator Carlos Westendorp to push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are delegates from 51 countries and 21
international organizations, including Bosnian presidency members,
Alija Izetbegovic, Kresimir Zubak and Momcilo Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Westendorp are due to give a joint press conference

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Tackle "Millennium Bug" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- South African
Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo Tuesday announced a plan
to counter the year of 2000 computer problem, which experts
warned was too late.
</P>
<P>
The potentially disastrous problem, dubbed the "millennium
bug", involves the inability of many computer programs to
recognize the turn of the millennium because years are identified
by only their last two digits.
</P>
<P>
Computers' internal dates will revert to 1900 instead of
moving on to 2000 when the date changes over on December 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide cost on a solution had been estimated at 600
billion U.S. dollars, while the cost to South Africa was
estimated at 25 billion Rand (5.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Naidoo told a news conference that a national coordinating
committee would be formed by the end of January next year, using
skills of representatives from both the private and public
sectors.
</P>
<P>
It would oversee six sub-committees focusing on different
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The national committee would report monthly to a cabinet
ministers' committee, chaired by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
convened by Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
An interim committee had drawn up the proposals presented
Tuesday, and would be replaced by a full-time secretariat early
next year, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
A complete assessment of computer programs that would be
affected by the millennium bug must completed before April, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Industry has welcomed the initiative, but there is a feeling
that government is doing too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
Year 2000 experts warned that, by now, organizations should be
busy with code conversions, or even beginning to test corrected
codes. Yet the committee is due to complete its assessment of the
size of the problem only by April 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was also doubted that such a massive amount of work could
be done with South Africa's limited resources.

<HEADLINE> Former Thai Central Bank Governor's Bonuses Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda has been asked to explain why the former governor
of the Central Bank blamed for ruining the country's financial
system was given a huge 'golden handshake.'
</P>
<P>
Former governor of the bank of Thailand Rerngchai Marakanond
was reported to be among a few former top executives of the
Central Bank who are being given huge benefits and annual bonuses,
even though they are allegedly held responsible for the financial
debacle.
</P>
<P>
Chart Pattana Party Spokesman Sunai Julpongsatorn, who lodged a
so-called 'fresh interpellation' on Tuesday, said Tarrin will have
to come up with sound reasons for letting those top executives,
former and present, go unpunished after their 'erratic and
devastating' decisions eventually forced the termination of 56
financial firms on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai and a few other top executives of the Central Bank
have been accused of causing losses estimated at 430 billion baht
(10.24 billion U.S. dollars) in a vain bid to bail out the
liquidity-strained finance firms.
</P>
<P>
A source said the ex-governor was allowed to pocket 20 million
baht (476,000 dollars) plus a fat bonus despite causing so much
ruin to the financial system of the country.

The Changzhou Diesel Engine Group bought an otherwise bankrupt
factory in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and got a
considerable share of the market in the northwest China by using
its own technology, product quality, and management methods.
</P>

Labor-intensive enterprises in the province's pharmaceutical,
clothing and light industries have moved elsewhere in the country.

LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian engineers have been
asked to tap the ingenuity of their counterparts in the Asian
countries that would facilitate the development of a cheap and

<HEADLINE> Adobe Kang In Rural Beijing Fast Becoming A Thing Of The Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The adobe kangs, that
venerable raised adobe sleeping area in Chinese houses, has
disappeared from 720,000 households in rural parts of Beijing,
where they are replaced by wooden or metal beds.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing Daily, more prosperous families in the
city's outskirts say that kangs are difficult to find nowadays,
and 90 percent of the peasants there no longer sleep on them.
</P>
<P>
The kang was common in all rural parts of northern
China. Peasants would build a raised area out of sun-dried mud
bricks in part of the southern side of the house. In winter, they
could build a fire under it and use it as a warm bed. And, along
with a wife and children, it came to be considered a basic
condition of a happy life.
</P>
<P>
When visitors came to call, they were invited to sit on the
kang, on which a little wooden table could be set, to serve from.
</P>
<P>
However, the kang is immobile and gets dirty and dusty
easily. So, in the modern age, as peasants got richer, they
changed their kangs into beds.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhanao, a peasant in the southern suburb of Beijing, said
that after his kang was replaced by a bed, he found that his house
was wider and cleaner. Zhang uses a stove for warmth now, and some
of his neighbors even heat their houses in the same manner as in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that more than 200 households in his village have
gotten rid of their kangs, but some old men still refuse to
abandon their warm kangs.
</P>
<P>
According to a Beijing resource conservation office, most
peasants in mountainous areas outside the city still use kangs,
because coal is not available, but they have found ways to improve
the kang.

<HEADLINE> Media Urged To Join AIDS Prevention Crusade in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The mass media can make a
greater contribution to China's AIDS prevention drive by providing
HIV/AIDS information to the public, according to Liu Kangmai, an
expert with the Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Liu told a symposium on HIV/AIDS in China that the media reach
a large audience and have made a contribution to preventing the
spread of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections in China
since the first case was reported in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In a survey in Qingdao City in east China's Shandong Province,
the percentage of people who could correctly answer questions
about HIV/AIDS was 74 percent after newspapers, radio, and
television increased coverage of the disease by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of condoms and books about HIV/AIDS and sexually
transmitted diseases also increased by 55 percent and 49 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Radio and television reach about 85 percent of the Chinese
people. In the 15 provinces and municipalities where the most
serious epidemic of HIV/AIDS in China is reported, the coverage
rate has reached more than 80 percent or almost 100 percent, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health will join some departments next year to
ask national and local media to carry or broadcast programs on the
problem regularly, for free, said Shen Jie, a ministry official.

relations and exchanges in all fields since they established
diplomatic relations and that the Fijian government attaches great
importance to its relations with China, and thanked the Chinese
government and people for their assistance in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said he also appreciates the Chinese government's upholding
of justice and adheres to the principle that all countries, big or
small, are equal in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Fijian government will adhere to the "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed expanding bilateral
economic and trade co-operation and increasing exchanges and
co-operation in agriculture, fisheries, education and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Expecting Return of Lost Dunhuang Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- With the upcoming 100th
anniversary of the discovery of the Dunhuang scriptures cave, some
Chinese scholars are expecting the return of lost relics to the
motherland, the "People's Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang cave was found in Gansu Province in the year
1900. In the early years of the discovery foreigners flocked there
to obtain a multitude of ancient books and other relics at
exceptionally low prices.
</P>
<P>
The cave contained 40,000 to 50,000 volumes of writings,
including approximately 30,000 volumes in Chinese and more than
10,000 volumes in Tibetan, the newspaper said, plus about 1,000
paintings.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 300 volumes at the Dunhuang Research
Institute, with others scattered in a number of Chinese cities.
More than three-fourths of the lost relics are believed to be in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
For the past century, scholars around the world have devoted
their lives to Dunhuang studies. However, some Chinese researchers
and specialists have lamented over microfilms from foreign museums.
</P>
<P>
The cave is viewed not only as a site to exhibit the glamor of
China's splendid academic history, but also a place of humiliation
in its early years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars, who are engaged in Dunhuang and relevant
studies, met at Beijing University recently to appeal for the
return of Dunhuang relics.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend forum, scholars said that the return of lost
relics are more significant to protecting the integration of human
civilization than legal issues of ownership.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang studies have become popular around the world, but the
relics' brilliance belongs to the motherland, scholars said.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xianlin, a well-known scholar with Beijing University, noted
that there are four leading culture systems around the
world: Chinese, Indian, Muslim and Europeans. The paintings and
books at Dunhuang resulted in the melting of cultures.
</P>
<P>
"How to make them display a bigger role, and how to better
study and protect them should be the common cause of the entire
world," the newspaper quoted Ji as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Fan Jinshi, deputy director of the Dunhuang Relics
Research Institute, the return of lost relics could be difficult
for foreigners long have held that the relics had been rightfully
purchased.
</P>
<P>
"But people with the least common sense can see that the meager
money was not enough to afford even one item," Fan said, adding
that the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) imperial government at that
time, though weak and corrupt, had issued orders to seal the
relics.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations will be held in the year 2000 to mark the 100th
anniversary of the discovery of the scriptures cave, and some of
the lost Dunhuang relics could be shown in the motherland even if
they are not returned by that time, Fan said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China is taking steps to
rectify errors in the judicial system throughout the country,
according to a story in today's "Legal Daily."
</P>
<P>
Between January and October, the courts of central Henan
Province affirmed misjudgements in 94 cases concerning 146 court
officials who made mistakes, the Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The province's Higher People's Court corrected five misjudged
cases by punishing a vice-president, an assistant judge and other
three officials in a local court who accepted bribes.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court in Zhuhai City, southern
Guangdong Province, is seeking a better mechanism for effectively
checking trial errors. The city's special court, established six
years ago, has reviewed more than 380 cases on appeal. Of those,
71 were re-tried and 45 judgements were amended, the story said.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappings Tied to 1998 Elections in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Blaming some politicians behind
the recent rash of kidnappings in Metro Manila, Justice Secretary
Teofisto Guingona today hinted that the series of kidnapping cases
may have been related to the forthcoming 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
Guingona, citing several intelligence reports, was quoted by
the Philippine News Agency as saying that several elected
officials were deeply involved in the perpetration of kidnapping
cases in a bid to increase campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the names of the politicians pending
the validation of the reports, adding the politicians acted as
either financiers or protectors of kidnappers while some others
were directly involved to finance their election budget.
</P>
<P>
Guingona also defended the arrest of 28 kidnapping suspects in
the latest police operations, saying illegal possession of
firearms were only filed against the suspects because the police
are still waiting for the kidnap victims to file charges.
</P>
<P>
The suspects could be charged with kidnapping for ransom once
the victims lodge complaints, he said, urging the victims to stand
out to identify their suspects and file charges.

BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese first on-line mall
opened its doors Wednesday with the launch of a website on the
Internet for shopping while surfing, Lebanese newspaper the
Beirut Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that net surfers in Lebanon and around the
world can now make purchases on the shopping mall created by the
Data Management, the country's largest Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
The payment procedure is done through a Klebox, a secure
virtual wallet which contains credit cards for expensive
purchases and change in the customer's own currency for small
purchases.
</P>
<P>
The Klebox service was developed by KLELine, a financial
service company based in France, which offers a set of secured
payment services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"For the customer, this service is completely free of charge as
no fee transaction is debited. The merchant is the one paying the
whole cost," said Abdallah Hitti, general director of KLELine.
</P>
<P>
The Data Management spent 250,000 U.S. dollars and eight
months of constant work to set up the website.
</P>

In Lebanon with a population of about 3.5 million, personal
computers currently stand at about 80,000 and internet

<P>
CANBERRA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- As the price of gold bullion
slipped to an 18-year low overnight, local gold producers cut
short the life of its mines.
</P>
<P>
Overnight in New York, the gold price reached an 18-year low,
hitting 281.35 U.S. dollars an ounce, overall the gold index
closed down 26.7 points, or 3.04 percent at 851.1.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the spot price of gold bullion dropped 4.85 U.S.
dollars closed today at 284.00 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold casualties include Aurora Gold, which shed 10 cents, or
7.69 percent, and Central Norseman, which lost seven cents, or
15.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the stock market weakened, the head of Normandy Mining Ltd,
Australia's largest gold producer, predicted "very tough times
ahead" for the local gold industry.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously that can't go on for very long and you'll see a lot
of mines close down," Normandy's chairman Robert Champion de
Crespigny said over ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
His prediction was given credibility by Goldfields Kalgoorlie
Ltd, which announced it had cut short the life of its Paddington
mine in Western Australia by 18 months.
</P>
<P>
However, the stockbrokers and analysts saw there was a brighter
side to the story, "It suggests that companies are starting to
believe that the gold price is close to some sort of turning
point," they said.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the laws of supply and demand are such that
reduced production would start to push the price up at some point.
</P>
<P>
But sentiment could push the price down further temporarily,
they admitted.

<HEADLINE> Better Social Insurance System Needed for Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
trying to reassure laid-off workers by establishing a public
welfare system, a "People's Daily" story said today.
</P>
<P>
Most laid-off workers favor re-employment with state-run
businesses, but dislike working in any non-public enterprises,
some of which provide good benefits, the story said.
</P>
<P>
A bankrupt distillery refused a proposed merger with a township
business, which did not offer a pension insurance system.
Laid-off distillery workers feared that they would not receive
housing, medical benefits and pension insurance, the story said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises long have pursued the policy of "lifelong
jobs, high perks but low wages," and government-controlled
production, profit allocation and employees' wages in the planned
economy. Thus, the state-owned enterprises, actually representing
the government were held responsible for compensating the laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
However, most businesses on the edge of bankruptcy, cannot
afford to continue traditional welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
The deepening reform should be closely linked with all the
supportive reforms. A sound social welfare system will safeguard
any further reform in the market economy, the story said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the younger laid-off workers in the Jixi Mineral
Resources Bureau, in northeastern Heilongjiang Province, however,
voluntarily chose farming instead of jobs in another factory.
</P>
<P>
The bureau promised to maintain their medical and housing
benefits, and provide them with low-interest loans and 60 percent
of wages for the first six months after being laid off.
</P>
<P>
The country has extensively boosted unemployment insurance and
pensions in state-run enterprises, the story added. But, except
for the two items mentioned above, China has yet to establish
social pools for other insurance.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments have adopted a different financial
pooling proportion between businesses' accounts and personal
accounts in various industries.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that the country should set up a uniform
social insurance system covering the state-funded, collective,
foreign-funded, township and non-public enterprises, the story
said.

<HEADLINE> Lead Poisoning: A Threat To Beijing Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A recent study found that
nearly 70 percent of the children in Beijing suffer from some form
of lead poisoning because of polluted air and other causes.
</P>
<P>
Lead in chidren's bodies can affect their nervous, circulatory,
and digestive systems, according to Prof. Ding Zongyi, head of the
survey group.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that even small amounts of lead in the
blood can stunt a child's intelligence, according to today's
Beijing Youth Daily. Things like height, weight, and chest
measurement decrease as the amount of lead in the blood goes up,
says Prof. Ding.
</P>
<P>
Children who suffer from lead poisoning are also more prone to
ill-tempered and aggressive behavior and are more likely to suffer
from respiratory diseases, anemia, urinary infections, and even
renal failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that automobile exhaust, preserved eggs, and fruit
peel can all be sources of lead pollution, and that the lead
contained in pencils, paint, and the colored covers of textbooks
is not up to safety standards. Even the lead in some brands of
crayons is enough to cause poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Children's Hospital has already started lead
poisoning tests for children in nearby areas and will soon set up
a special center for treating lead poisoning in its new emergency
treatment center, the paper said.

<P>
The municipal government has decided to build ten more housing
sites in suburban areas, with six to be completed by the end of
this year, according to the Municipal Urban and Rural Construction
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has pulled down 2.89 million sq.m. of
shabby housing in the past five years and moved at least 8,500
families from these aging houses.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the city has given priority to improving the living
conditions of people with special difficulties and has built 1.88
million sq.m. of housing for them, and has seen to it that any
whose per capita living space is less than 4 sq.m. can move into
new housing by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> French Gaullist RPR Chief Sharpens Attack on Jospin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- President of the Gaullist Rally
for the Republic (RPR) Philippe Seguin Wednesday accused the
Socialist Party of sharing "exactly the same objective" with the
far-right National Front (FN), which is to eliminate the
mainstream right-wing parties from the political life of France.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Europe-1 TV station, Seguin said that
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is copying late President Francois
Mitterrand's old strategy of "making rise the FN to weaken the
(rightwing) opposition."
</P>
<P>
He said that the "visible wish of the prime minister would be
to weaken the function of the president."
</P>
<P>
Seguin, who described the system of cohabitation between the
president and the prime minister as "not a good regime," accused
Jospin of "trying to develop a theory of two heads of executive,
of a bicephalous system, of two consuls put on an equal stand in
the style of the ancient Rome."
</P>
<P>
But he also expressed reserve over the suggestion on re-writing
the French Constitution to make the presidential and legislative
elections take place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to organize the simultaneity of the presidential
and legislative elections, you enter a regime of American style.
Are we ready, I don't think so," he said.
</P>
<P>
On whether the RPR will rally with the FN in the regional and
cantonal elections to be held in March 1998, Seguin said the
Gaullist party would not ally with "the men whose vowed objective
is to eliminate us from the political life."

LHASA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Nagqu Prefecture in China's
Tibet Autonomous Region has had heavy snowfall this winter that
has blocked roads and made life difficult for local people.
</P>
<P>
Highways have been covered with thick ice and the snowfall in
the central part of the prefecture was 30 to 50 cm on
average. Some villages reported nearly a meter of snowfall.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government reported snow falling 30 times, on
63.7 percent of the prefecture, from mid-September to the end of
November. The previous record snowstorm was 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The heavy snow has caused problems for herdsmen and loss of
weight for their livestock. It is reported that some herdsmen have
to use their furniture for fuel.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has brought in 400,000 yuan (about

<HEADLINE> China Spreads Efficient Irrigation in Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China has been spreading
water-efficient irrigation in farming in its vast rural areas by
constructing water-saving projects and application of advanced
water-saving technology.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Chunyuan, Vice Minister of Water Resources,
who was here attending a national meeting on water-efficient
irrigation, China has invested 11 billion yuan in water-saving
irrigation projects in farming since the beginning of 1996 and has
completed construction of water-efficient irrigation facilities of
various kinds on 2.33 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
It has also established 70 high-standard water-efficient
irrigation demonstration parks, said the vice minister.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's 13 water-poor countries and its per
capita water resource availability is just one quarter of the
world's average level. Water shortages have become a key factor
in restricting agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
China started to spread water-efficient irrigation technology
nationwide in 1996. It has designated 300 major counties to pilot
increasing grain output through water-efficienct farming, as well
as a group of water-saving irrigation zones.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, many provincies and autonomous regions
of the country have set up leading groups to take charge of the
effort. Great progress has been made in the development of
water-efficient irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments have also taken effective
measures to arouse the initiatives of localities and individual
farmers in making investment on water-efficient irrigation in
farming.
</P>
<P>
The spreading of water-efficient irrigation has greatly helped
increase agricultural output. In the past two years, an
additional 19 billion kg of grain have been gathered.

SHANGHAI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Now that Shanghai's
Fuxingdonglu Road is open to traffic, the massive renewal project
in the old Nanshi part of the city is partially completed.
</P>
<P>
The 2.2-km road runs through the hub of the city and an area
that contain shacks, and unsafe housing that need to be upgraded,
with an average width of less than 12 meters.
</P>
<P>
The renewal project, which began in March of last year and cost
1.5 billion yuan (180 million U.S. dollars), which mainly came
from the city government, meant moving 5,690 households and 282
units.
</P>
<P>
The average width of the six-lane new road is 45 meters. It
also has 30,000 sq.m. of greenery alongside.
</P>
<P>
Residential and commercial buildings are also being built with
Hong Kong and Singapore financial backing.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Surges in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou City of east China's
Jiangsu Province did 7.04 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign
trade in the first ten months this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 740 million U.S. dollars more than the city's
total foreign trade volume of the entire year of 1996, said local
sources.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the rapid growth in foreign trade to
their efforts made to improve the city's export-oriented economic
structure, foster new economic powerhouses, and bring about a
simultaneous growth of foreign trade scale and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The city has approved the establishment of 7,485
overseas-financed businesses, 5,112 of which have already started
operation.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, dubbed as "paradise on earth" and famed for its
numerous stylish parks, has treated overseas-backed enterprises as
a powerhouse to develop export-oriented economy, and has worked
out preferential policies to encourage them to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the overseas-financed enterprises
in the city had exported 2.86 billion U.S. dollars worth of
commodities by the end of October this year, up 49.7 percent and
accounting for 69.6 percent of Suzhou City's total.
</P>
<P>
The city has also made efforts to adjust its export structure
and to concentrate on development and export of high- and
new-technology products. Economic benefits of export enterprises
have been improving as export scale increases and the structure of
export commodities improves.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou has also made great efforts to expand overseas markets
since the beginning of this year. Now commodities made in the city
are exported to 111 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Leader, President Meet Saudi Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami have met
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, with both sides
pledging to further bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were held Tuesday night at the sidelines of the
ongoing Islamic summit, which brought together leaders and
ranking officials of the 55-member Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), according to the official news agency IRNA
today.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Tehran is the first such visit by a Saudi
leader in about two decades. Post-Islamic revolution Iran had
called on Saudi Muslims to rise and topple the monarch and later
Riyadh sided with Baghdad in its eight-year war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries had been
severed off after hundreds of protesting Iranian pilgrims were
killed in the holy city of Mecca in 1987 during a clash with the
Saudi police.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei told the Saudi crown prince that Iran has no real
problem with any of the Islamic countries, and there is a vast
potential for cooperation, the materialization of which depends
on the two countries' resolve.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-Saudi cooperation is instrumental in promoting OIC
goals of unity and solidarity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei admitted that there are numerous problems facing the
Muslim world, but accused "enemies of Islam" of sowing discord
and fabricating most of the problems. Through unity and
unbending resolve of the Muslim states, he said, many of those
problems can be settled.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed hope that through bilateral efforts, the
problems between the two countries would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Khatami told Abdullah that appropriate time has come for the
two big Muslim countries to start a new round of relations,
citing unity and coordination as a need.
</P>
<P>
He deemed Abdullah's visit as a "harbinger of good omen" for
the two countries' future relationship and the region in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
The holding of the Islamic summit in Tehran offered Iran an
unparalleled opportunity to carry out diplomatic efforts to woo
regional countries and reach out for the Arab and Islamic world
as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Fall on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index lost another 30.7 points to close at 1,703.52
points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that prices fell lower because of worries over
Indonesian President Soeharto's health and the overnight weakness
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank further to 149.02 million units,
valued at 340.58 million Singapore dollars (210.23 million US
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 194 to 90, while 326
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering again was the most
actively traded stock as it registered a turnover of 23.04 million
units. It was followed by Genting which had 6.78 million shares
traded. IPC Corporation was next with 4.33 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
Uniphoenix led the gainers of the day as it rose by 30 cents to
finish at 3.6 Singapore dollars. KL Kepong increased by 18 cents
to end at 3.84 Singapore dollars, while Roth S. picked up by 15
cents to close at 8.9 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Genting was the biggest loser as it declined
by 2.09 dollars to end at 0.2 US dollar. Local soft drink and food
maker F&AMP;N fell by 50 cents to close at 9.15 Singapore dollars.
Property developer City Developments lost 45 cents to finish at
8.1 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Building Radial Level Oil Well By High-Pressure Water Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oilfield experts and
engineering workers have successfully constructed its first radial
level oil channel in northeast China's Liaohe Oilfield by using
high-pressure water flows.
</P>
<P>
Information reaching here said that in early November, experts
and workers used high-pressure water flows to cut a 15.86 m-long
passage, with a diameter of 110-130 meters, from the
1,013. 2-m-deep oil-bearing strata of an existing well.
</P>
<P>
The underground situation of the Liaohe Oilfield is very
complicated. After certain periods of development, the use of
conventional methods to exploit oil in some wells have been proved
to be difficult and bear low economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The application of radial horizontal well drilling technology
can help raise the oil recovering rate and explorable reserves by
big margins, tap production potentials of the old oilfield to the
greatest extent, improve service life and production capacity of
oil wells, said experts.

<HEADLINE> Internet Opens up New Dimensions to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa, a continent which is
often seen as the last frontier for information technology, where
radios are still the main source of communication with the
outside world in most of its rural areas, is now forging ahead by
getting itself wired up on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
For Africa, a continent with the least developed
infrastructure, namely only two percent of the world's
telephones, Internet service has undoutbly offered a "jump-start"
opportunity to narrow its gap with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Currently 47 of the 54 countries in Africa have developed some
form of Internet access - either a local dial-up store and
forward E-mail service with a gateway to the Internet, or a full
leased line service, said Michael Jensen, who is considered as
the "father of Internet in Africa" through his Internet-related
work in 29 African countries over the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Of these, he added, 42 countries and territories have achieved
live Internet public access service in their capital cities.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is not surprising to see name cards or
advertisements carried in newspapers now with E-mail addressed to
the time-honored postal and physical addresses.
</P>
<P>
This telecommunications marvel has just started to infiltrate
into various sectors of the economy. Tanzania has placed its
tourism atttractions on the Internet, the Sukuma Museum in the
country recently became the first museum in east Africa, and
probably in the entire sub- Saharan region to offer visitors
virtual tours via the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, manufacturers seeking to export to the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member countries may
soon benifit from a new computer service by making use of an
E-mail system that functions via the local area network.
</P>
<P>
In Namibia, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism has
invested in an on-line booking system, which will enable customer
queries and reservations to be processed in minutes.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the "technology-hungry country" which has the
most advanced telecommunications network on the continent, is
even providing services like Internet banking in the country,
which is well ahead of the information-rich the United States,
according to Amolo Ng'weno, an executive from Africaonline, a
multi-national Internet provider headquartered in S. Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ng'weno, who is based in Nairobi, Kenya, said there are 150 to
200 Internet service providers in Africa, in which 70 are
stationed in S.Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africaonline, the premier Internet company in Kenya which was
founded in 1994, now has approximately 6,000 subscribers in the
country, 95 percent of which are small and medium-sized
businesses. In Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, the
company has another 6,000 users to its services. and the number
is still increasing by 10 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
"The nice things about the service," said Ng'weno, "are that
businesses see an immediate return both in reduced communication
cost and in finding things they need. It's very exciting to see
people interacting internationally and easily."
</P>
<P>
The picture in South Africa is much brighter than in the rest
of the continent. It is estimated that the number of South
Africans on line was about 500,000 in September, and could reach
one million by the end of this year. The country now ranks 14th
in the world concerning domain names, leaving behind some first
world countries such as New Zealand, Denmark and Austria.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by International Data Corporation shows that 71
percent of South Africa's top 200 organizations have set up a web
server or are planning to do so.
</P>
<P>
What is more, on-line advertising is the largest component of
Internet electronic commerce. By the end of the century, the
South African internet site development and advertisingmarket
could be worth one billion Rand (222 million U.S. dollars) with
more than two million Rand (about 44,4000 US dollars) of on-line
transactions a year, noted Robin Parker, a Web publisher.
</P>
<P>
No wonder studies by the Geneva-based International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the World Bank indicate a
direct link between effecient telecommunications and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
However, on-line advertising is still making a minimal impact
in Africa, with a possible total of no more than around US$20,000
a month on popular websites, said Arthur Goldstuck, an expert
on Internet business, adding 90 percent of this spending is
probably taking place in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Commercial transactions which currently involves mainly
travel, books magazines, records &AMP; Cds, cars and property &AMP; real
estate, are believed to be taking a long time to take off.
</P>
<P>
Internet, which takes a phone line and a computer unit for a
user to cruise down the world informations superhighway, has
confronted some major obstacles in Africa, namely the "existing
telephone infrastructure and regulations in the telephone
industry", noted Ng'weno.
</P>
<P>
Africa still has the slowest growth in the number of telephone
lines per 100 people of anywhere in the world. Sub-Sahara Africa
has an average of just 0.48 telephone lines per 100 people. Yet
the number of people waiting for a phone line is reported to be
growing at 7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
With 12 percent of the world's population, Africa has only two
percent of the world's telephones, compared with other regions of
the world -- Latin America has six percent of the lines and eight
percent of the population and Asia, 13 percent of the lines with
57 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The ITU estimates it will cost in excess of US$28 billion to
increase sub-Saharan teledensity levels to one line per 100
people by the year 2000. With individual nations unable to meet
the cost, it is suggested that the example of Ivory Coast and
Ghana be followed, which is to inject private capital combined
with a relaxation of regulatory environments.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to note that some African countries have
made telecommunications a priority and are installing digital
switches with fibre optic inter-city backbones and newest
cellular and mobile technology.
</P>
<P>
These would consequently give a great push-up for net service
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Internet business is nothing now, but it's growing quickly.
And its' a business that can only grow," said Ng'weno, who
believed the prospects for Internet are enormous.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Be Tough over Dumping: VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has said that his government would take necessary
measures including enacting anti-dumping legislation to protect
local industries.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted the vice-president as saying
Tuesday that Kenya would not allow the dumping of
highly-subsidized imports into the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some countries were employing "predatory
tactics" in penetrating into the Kenyan market by subsidizing
their export products.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti reaffirmed that the government was committed to
fair-play and is, therefore, using non-tariff barriers to create
a level playing field for all industrialists in the East African
country.
</P>
<P>
Measures to be taken are aimed at providing suitable
environment for the private sector to take the lead in economic
development in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion to mark the 75th anniversary of Kenya
Breweries Ltd. (KBL), Jeremiah Kiereini, KBL Chairman, said that
Kenyan beer produced by his company had not been able to
penetrate into the South African market due to the high taxes
demanded by the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
He complained that while Kenya opens its doors to foreign
products, South Africa does not reciprocate.

<HEADLINE> Labor Market Offers Employment for Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- More and more people in China
now turn to the labor market for employment instead of government
appointment, as the country's economic restructuring has made it
possible for the market to play a dominant role in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province in east China is a good example. By now it
has established more than 1,000 labor service intermediary
agencies, which provided employment services for over three
million urban and rural laborers in the past five years. And 2.6
million of them have found jobs as a result.
</P>
<P>
The province has taken steps to reform its government-dominated
employment and personnel systems, and given employers and
employees two-way choices.
</P>
<P>
Labor markets also play a role in helping laid-off workers find
new jobs. Some 80 percent of the more than 100,000 laid-offs in
the province, who have been reemployed over the past few years,
benefited from market services.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has also opened 90 markets for professionals,
including a provincial-level personnel market and a state-level
market for rural enterprise professionals. The markets have helped
120,000 technicians and managers sign contracts with employers.
</P>
<P>
Some labor service agencies and personnel markets also offer
necessary training for workers.
</P>
<P>
The province is working to set up a labor information network
and to link it up with the national network.

NANNING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank-funded sewage
treatment project began yesterday on the Chaoyangxi River in
Nanning, capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a comprehensive water treatment program
costing 200 million U.S. dollars, with half of it from World Bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
The 14-km river, which has 280,000 people living along its
banks, has been referred to as "Black River" because of the
serious industrial pollution and residential waste in it. The
waste treatment project will use 48 million U.S. dollars of WB
loans and 400 million yuan (48 million U.S. dollars) of city
government funds, which will also be used for a waste treatment
facility with a 240,000 to 480,000 ton daily capacity.
</P>
<P>
Other projects will include Lijiang River in Guilin, a famous
scenic spot, and some other rivers severely polluted by sugar
mills. Guangxi is China's largest sugar producer.
</P>
<P>
The work is scheduled to be completed by the year 2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China has taken measures to protect the rights and interest of
overseas investors, and its sincerity in the effort is paying off.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, a foreign investor showed interest in an
expressway project of the province. But the province's Party
Secretary Xie Shijie told him frankly that though the highway
would have huge amounts of traffic flow upon completion, it
couldn't bring good benefits as most of the traffic flow would be
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Xie encouraged the investor to shift his capital to
hydropower development, which would bring steady returns. The
investor followed his advice.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has adopted an investment policy of "You get good
profits and we enjoy fast development". Accordingly, such
multinational corporations as Motorola, Siemens, Bell, and Toyota
began to invest in the province. By the first half of this year,
the province had opened more than 4,600 overseas-backed businesses
</P>
<P>
The Parkson Plaza, a joint venture, complained about excessive
consulting service charges. The provincial government intervened
and ordered the departments concerned to apologize to the company
and return the money.
</P>
<P>
The province set up a foreign investor complaints center last
year to take care of complaints by overseas-funded enterprises. By
now the center has received more than 100 complaint cases, most of
which have been dealt with satisfactorily.

SHANGHAI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Qian Ming, a Shanghai
resident, has never brought the keys to his apartment with himself
since he moved into his new house, for whenever he comes back
home, a light press on the door lock is enough for him to enter
his cozy apartment.
</P>
<P>
As a resident of the second Youdian village in Hongkou
district, the first computer-managed residential quarter in
Shanghai, Qian has been enjoying a lot of convenience brought
about by the computer management.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million
US dollars), the Municipal Post and Telecommunication
Administration built the quarter into computer-managed one in
November, and 300 of the quarter's total 1,200 households have
taken the lead in hooking up to the quarter's computer network
center.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance of the residential quarter, the traffic flow is
managed by a computer, and a large screen was erected broadcasting
weather information and news. All major roads within the quarter
are equipped with monitors to ensure security.
</P>
<P>
The computer center of the network is the nucleus of the whole
system, taking charge of the system's maintenance, design, and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Through the network, residents can pay bills for gas, water,
and electricities; be alarmed at gas leaking, enjoy music, and
receive medical treatment. Small amount of fees are needed for the
service.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase computer management project has also been
launched for the quarter, and is expected to be completed by the
second half of next year. When it is completed, people can hook up
to the Internet, and enjoy video-on-demand service at home.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar is
plummeting with a distinct lack of buying interest driving the
currency to new depths.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Australian dollar closed at 66.75, after dropping to
a new four year low of 66.48 earlier in the session. It was at
66.90 US cents late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
ANZ head of foreign exchange sales John Reedyk said the local
unit was last at these levels in December 1993. The previous low
was 64.10 US cents in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Exporters are taking a back seat and seeing what happens -
they are generally the buyers in the Aussie market, so they are
notable by their absence," Reedyk said.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold reached an 18-year low overnight in New York,
hitting 281.35 US dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the pressure on the local currency today, the South
Korean won fell to a record low against the US dollar after the
South Korean government suspended operations of another five
merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen this evening, the Australian dollar finished at
86.69 from 87.24 yesterday. It was also at 1.1958 marks, from

TAIYUAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China
will take steps to further promote the private sector as it has
become a major factor behind local economic growth, said Hu Fuguo,
the province's Party Secretary.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark during a recent meeting with private
entrepreneurs. The majority of the private business people have
made a career through hard work under market competition, and made
considerable contributions to the society and the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will work out plans and policies to further develop the
private sector in the form of cooperation, acquisition, leasing,
and joint stock. Fine private entrepreneurs can also compete to
become managers of state enterprises," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the private sector does business abiding by the
law, we will give it a free hand in development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that by the end of last year the province's
private sector had had 13.5 billion yuan in registered capital,
accounting for 9.49 percent of the province's total, involving 1.4
million employees.
</P>
<P>
The province will also make a new effort to help form some
private enterprise groups and develop name-brand products.

finished the day on a low note, buffeted by a fall on Wall Street
and a further plunge in the price of gold.

hoping to pass special legislation today to prevent the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) from conducting its census
in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The PNA census is scheduled to begin today throughout the
territories under PNA control.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli ministerial committee had approved amending a law on
activities in eastern Jerusalem Tuesday night to give Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani the legal authority to prevent
the census in Jerusalem, Israel's only English newspaper The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The amendment is to be put to a cabinet vote by phone, and
then brought before the Knesset (parliament) for approval today.
</P>
<P>
Ophir Pines, who co-chairs the Jerusalem caucus in the
Knesset, has written to Faisal Husseini, PNA Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs, to ask him to refrain from carrying out the
census in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Pines said the census is an unwarranted provocation, and it
would be better to discuss Jerusalem's status in the talks on
the permanent arrangements, rather than try to create facts on
the ground regarding sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday instructed
Kahalani to prevent the PNA from carrying out the census in
eastern Jerusalem. He said that a Palestinian census in the city
violated the peace accords that give the Palestinians limited
autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to us that in the sovereign state of
Israel, a foreign body is trying to undermine our sovereignty,"
Netanyahu said. "This is a gross violation of an agreement, and
I have asked Minister Kahalani to thwart the attempts by the
Palestinians" to carry out the census in Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
But PNA Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said that "the
question of Jerusalem now is not one that needs
interpretation: it is not under Israeli sovereignty; it is
legally a part of Palestinian territories, and therefore the
census should cover Jerusalem and will cover Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Some 4,500 field workers today will begin collecting the
500,000 copies of the 78-question census which were mailed last
month, according to Hassan Abu Libdeh, director of the
Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big day," Libdeh said. "I am giving the
Palestinian people a very clear message: if we are to use our
resources in a better way, to go into the 21st century in better
shape, we have to use our resources, more wisely, and we must
take part in the census."
</P>
<P>
Libdeh did not confirm whether the census would also take
place in eastern Jerusalem, saying only that the PNA has the
right to do so.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, throughout the West Bank and Gaza, a census
campaign was kicked off with marches to raise public awareness.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Hebron, some 1,000 census takers,
boy scouts, and the mayor walked through the streets carrying
banners declaring, "the census is the way to build our state."
</P>
<P>
Volunteers distributed posters, bumper stickers and baseball
caps with slogans such as "Another step toward the building of
independent Palestine" and "Contribute to the success of the '97
census."

<HEADLINE> China to Enter Aged Society in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China will enter an aged
society in the year 2000, an expert says.
</P>
<P>
Tian Xueyuan, director of the Population Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua here today that
people aged at and over 65 will account for seven percent of the
total Chinese population at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
That means China will be defined as a society of senior
citizens according to a UN criterion, the scholar notes.
</P>
<P>
In 1982 Chinese people aged over 65 accounted for 4.9 percent
of the total population, and the rate reached 6.8 percent in
1996. About one-third of Chinese provinces and municipalities,
including Beijing, Shanghai and Sichuan, have entered the aged
society, according to Tian.
</P>
<P>
He attributes the situation to China's birth control policy
which leads to the drop of the birth rate, making young people
accounting for a smaller proportion in the population.
</P>
<P>
Tian notes that the change will cause great impacts on China in
many aspects, including welfare, family structure, traditional
morality and employment.
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the government adopt measures to deal with the
situation.

HEFEI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who live
under the poverty line in east China's Anhui Province has dropped
by 60 percent from 4.18 million in 1993 to the present 1.6
million, a provincial official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the poor people used to live in the Dabie Mountainous
area, southern Anhui and flood-afflicted areas along both banks of
the Huaihe River.

The official attributed the success to improvement of farming
infrastructures, especially the construction of water conservancy
facilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments have allocated three billion yuan
to build flood-control projects which can prevent 2.28 million ha
of farmland from flood damage, repair 1,500 roads with a total
length of 110,000 km and erect 4,800 drinking water projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nine central government departments including the

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen fruitful bilateral cooperation in
political, economic and cultural areas, he said, adding that the

<HEADLINE> Speaking Trashcans On Beijing Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Try to put your plastic bag in
a green trashcan on the streets of Beijing and you're liable to
find it telling you, "Please put only paper waste in", but a
yellow one will tell you, "Thanks for helping protect the
environment."
</P>
<P>
The colored talking trashcans are made by the city's
environmental protection department and can be found in front of
large department stores. They tell people to separate their trash
and to put it into the proper can: green for paper, blue for metal
and glass, yellow for plastic, and red for other items.
</P>
<P>
The city of 12 million produces a large amount of trash every
day, including 600,000 styrofoam food boxes. When trash is
discarded indiscriminately, it results in serious pollution and
wastes resources.
</P>
<P>
An environmental protection department official says that after
the trash is separated, it is transported to disposal plants where
it can be recycled. More of these trashcans will be used in
future, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Building Electron Gun Components Production Base in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
has recently decided to invest 197 million yuan in constructing a
base for producing electron gun components for color picture tubes
in Dalian, a port city of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Color Picture Tube Co. Ltd. imported key technology
and equipment for production of electron gun components for color
picture tubes from Toshiba Company of Japan in 1990 and has formed
a capacity of independently developing a 64-cm electron gun
component for color picture tubes.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian company, designated as the only base for producing
electron gun components for color picture tubes in China, now
holds 40 percent of the market share in China, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that besides importing a small amount of key
equipment and die sets, the company will mainly use existing
equipment and technology to carry out new product development
independently.
</P>
<P>
It has already had a registered capital of 59.9 million yuan
for construction of the production base of electron gun components
for color picture tubes.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2001, it is expected to be able to produce 47.8
million sets of electron gun components for color picture tubes in
a great varieties ranging from 47 cm to 74 cm, and will also earn
1.5 billion yuan from sales of such products, as well as increase
its market share to over 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Price Cuts Allow More Chinese to Buy Automobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Price reductions on
Chinese-made mini-cars and mini-vans with 1.0-liter engines are
making autos more affordable for Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
Alto cars made in Chongqing have been reduced by nearly 10,000
yuan, while Tianjin-made Xiali cars are 3,000-to-5,000 yuan
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Yunque cars made in Guizhou Province are the first Chinese-made
autos to be priced below 50,000 yuan, what analysts call the
"purchasing point of family cars."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of the 70,000 minis sold in Beijing this
year, 90 percent were purchased by individuals.
</P>
<P>
Tian Weisheng, vice president of Tianjin Auto Industry Sales
Co., Ltd., said people had long been talking about "cars entering
Chinese families," but a remarkable rise of auto sales will be
unlikely if the gap between actual purchasing power and price is
not narrowed.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, some automakers are tapping market
potential by initiating loan policies.
</P>
<P>
In a program between Chongqing Alto and a Beijing sales
partner, 200 Alto cars were sold in just five days as buyers only
had to pay a down payment of 18,000 yuan with the remainder due in
18 months.
</P>
<P>
Other automakers followed suit. In Beijing, an average of a
dozen Xiali cars are sold every day, and no loan agreements have
been broken.
</P>
<P>
Mini-cars are expected to improve sales next year. Purchases by
individuals are estimated at 50 percent of total sales.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt Withdraws Income Tax Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government
Tuesday formerly withdrew the proposal to impose the levy of five
percent of individual and corporate income tax but refused to
withdraw the other three taxes now already in force.
</P>
<P>
In a ministerial statement in parliament, Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa said the government had accepted the resolution
of the ruling Zanu (PF) annual conference, the views of the
general public and parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore announce that the proposed five percent war
veterans levy on individual and corporate income tax stands
removed," Murerwa said.
</P>
<P>
The levy together with increases on sales tax on goods, fuel
tax and electricity tax were introduced through the finance No. 2
bill which was brought before parliament last month.
</P>

The proposals met with stiff opposition from the ruling
party's members of parliament who blocked it from passing, as

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poverty Alleviation in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Though the Sri Lankan
government has for many years targeted poverty alleviation as one
of its top priorities, much remains to be done in the country's
efforts to phase out the serious social problem.
</P>
<P>
Basically a traditional agriculture country, Sri Lanka has no
solid industrial base to provide enough jobs to its large labor
force. The country of 18.5 million people has an unemployment rate
of 10.5 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the country adopted free economic policies and
opened up to the outside in 1978, the gap between the rich and the
poor has been broadened while the national economy got boosted.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the seriousness of the social problem, the Sri Lankan
government carried out the Janasaviya Plan in October 1989 to
alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The plan was part of the economic development strategy of the
government in its bid to create more jobs and increase incomes for
the people.
</P>
<P>
The government offered 2,500 Rupees (42 U.S. dollars) as relief
and employment funds to each of the selected poor families, which,
upon obtaining the funds, were required to get rid of poverty in
two years by way of self-employment.
</P>
<P>
The plan was carried out in five phases from 1989 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the plan brought certain benefits to the
poor under the then government of president Ranasinghe Premadasa.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan lost its momentum after the president was
assassinated in a bomb explosion in Colombo on May 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1995, the present People's Alliance government
assumed office and renamed the Janasaviya Plan as the Samurdhi
Movement.
</P>
<P>
Till the end of 1996, the government had released 34 million
dollars of relief fund and 12 million dollars of employment fund
to 27,000 poor families.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan parliament passed a package of provisions
concerning the Samurdhi Movement last February in an effort to
boost the campaign. The provisions helped the government
strengthen its supervision over poverty alleviation activities.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation organizations were set up at all levels
throughout Sri Lanka and a national poverty eradication committee
was established comprising President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Prime
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and several other cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, poor people still account
for 70 percent of the total population in Sri Lanka. Among them,
more than a quarter, or 325,000 to 390,000 people, are living
below the poverty line -- a fact which can never be neglected.
</P>
<P>
In view of the problem, the government has stepped up
propaganda to help the poor build confidence in shaking off their
own problems.
</P>
<P>
Rural youths are organized to participate in social activities
or development projects while women are encouraged to make
handicraft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government conducted surveys in rural areas to
collect first-hand information on the current poverty situation.

<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The East African region has
become an emerging market with vast opportunities for investors,
the East African Standard quoted a leading stockbroker as saying.
</P>
<P>
John Munge told the daily newspaper that the region comprising
of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had a trade deficit of about two
billion U.S. Dollars a year which means that investor can
comfortably put their money in industries which produce import
substitution goods, the stockbroker added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that investment opportunities in agriculture
and agro-based industries were enormous as agriculture accounts
for 65 percent of the region's export earnings and 70 percent of
the labour force.
</P>
<P>
There is room for investment if only agricultural products are
processed for local consumption, Munge noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the region's stock markets can be used as
vehicles to raise funds for long-term investments and the Nairobi
Stock Exchange (NSE) had raised 104 million U.S. Dollars through
divestiture of 207 non-strategic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) and the
Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) would be operational some time
next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Munge, Tanzania has even greater potential as the
listings are expected to include Tanzania Breweries, Tanzania
Cigarette Company, British Petroleum Tanzania, Agip Petroleum and
Tanzania Electric Supply Company.
</P>
<P>
Munge argued that emerging stock markets become unstable when
foreign investment capital is higher than its local component.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the current turmoil in southeast Asian
markets had left the NSE largely untouched because it is mainly
driven by local capital.

<HEADLINE> Asian Airlines to Delay Taking Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Company of the
United States said Tuesday that Asian airlines may delay taking
delivery of as many as 60 jetliner over the next three years due
to the regional economic problems.
</P>
<P>
For Boeing Company, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer,
the growing economic crisis in Asia could force it to delay 20
Asian deliveries a year through 2000, company spokesman Marta
Newhart said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, Asian air passenger traffic has
decline by about 11 percent on average, said an analyst of the
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
However, the delivery delays could be a silver lining for
Boeing company so that it would have more time to tackle assembly
line problems caused by parts shortages, the analyst said.

TOKYO -- Japan's current account surplus in October surged 220
percent from a year earlier to 1,081.3 billion yen (about 8.3
billion dollars), the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.

Exports increased by 16.9 percent to 4,507.5 billion yen (about

marginal growth of 0.7 percent to 3,299.7 billion yen (about 25.5

<P>
TEHRAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei received Pakistani Prime Minister Mian
Nawaz Sharif Tuesday, underlining the importance of bilateral
ties, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the difficulties between Iran and Pakistan
were resolvable, stressing the need for further bolstering
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were traces of mysterious and dangerous
hands involved, whose objective is to disstabilize the relations
between Islamabad and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist activities against Iranian interests in Pakistan
were the direct outcome of those perilous hands, he said,
expressing hope that the Pakistani government should take measures
to punish those involved in killing five Iranian military
technicians in Pakistan last September.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Afghanistan, the Iranian
supreme leader said that the current Afghan crisis could be
solved with the establishment of a broad-based government
acceptable to all the people of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Pakistan and Iran can help Afghanistan form
such a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Pakistani prime minister said that both
Iran and Pakistan have suffered severe setbacks due to
Afghanistan's crisis and unstable conditions.
</P>
<P>
No country in the region is more keen in resolving the Afghan
crisis than Iran and Pakistan, he said, adding that the two
neighboring nations could use their influence to get all the
Afghan groups at a conference.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the promotion of bilateral relations, but
expressed his concern over the ongoing terrorist activities in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that the Pakistani courts would soon be able to
dispense their justice over the criminals who killed five
Iranians.

NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Electoral Commission
has set up a committee to monitor compliance with the electoral
code of conduct by political parties in the campaign for the
December 29 General Election, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu as
saying Tuesday that "the commission condemns unreservedly all
acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission was saddened that some party
leaders had allegedly vowed to disrupt functions of other parties
by "disorderly behavior and thuggery".
</P>
<P>
The electoral code of conduct forbids thuggery and use of
abusive language against other candidates and political parties.
</P>
<P>
These leaders are violently and deliberately infringing this
code, said the commission chairman, adding that this cannot be
allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "offended parties may be encouraged to
respond in a similar manner, leading to further violence and in
the end to a national catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
The election official urged Kenyan police to take firm action
against the perpetrators of violence and encouraged all Kenyans
to report all acts of violence and offensive behavior by
political party leaders, candidates and their supporters to the
commission and the police.

The Citizen
</P>
<P>
-- South African weather experts Tuesday criticized a local
newspaper report that the El Nino weather pattern had been
weakened and no longer posted a threat. They said the phenomenon
varied in intensity from month to month but was on course to
unleash a very hot and dry summer over southern Africa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda Coffee Export Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda coffee export dropped
60 percent in October and November but the overall export project
of the crop this season will not be affected, The New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda exported 130,828 bags in October and 179,600 bags in
November this year, comparing to their counterparts of 340,000
bags and 436,000 bags a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Every bag contains 60 kilogram of coffee.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Coffee Development Authority attributed the sharp drop
to the heavy rains recent weeks delaying the drying of coffee
seeds countrywide, and the coffee season will end around April
instead of the usual February, said William Naggaga, the
Secretary of Uganda Coffee Board.
</P>
<P>
But he assured the overall coffee export project will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is a leading export plant that earns some 65 percent of
its foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has exported a record of 4.2 million bags of coffee in
last coffee season.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan officials predicted the country will export some 4
million bags of coffee this season. The shortfall of 200,000 bags
is caused by drought earlier this year, they explained.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Resume Formal Peace Talks with NDF Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Solicitor General Silvestre
Bello said the government is ready to resume the formal peace
talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) rebels, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bello said the government peace panel will meet today to come
out with plans and possibly leave for the Netherlands on December
11 for weekend discussions with the NDF peace panel, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
NDF leader Jose Ma. Sison was in exile in the Netherlands, so
the government and the NDF peace panels held peace talks there.
</P>
<P>
"If this weekend schedule is not possible, we will find ways to
leave on December 26 or 27, right after Christmas, to complete
discussions concerning human rights and international humanitarian
law before the end of the year," Bello said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to resume the disrupted talks came on
the heels of the release of a police officer and a military man
captured by the NDF in a series of military attacks against
government units.
</P>
<P>
The government peace panel withdrew from the formal talks early
in November to press for the release of the two officers.
</P>
<P>
From his base in the Netherlands, Sison told the Philippine
media that the release of the hostages would help "improve the
climate for the resumption of the peace negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Sison had also announced the NDF decision to declare a
ceasefire from December 22 this year to January 2 next year in
response to the 30-day unilateral ceasefire declared by President
Fidel Ramos during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

<HEADLINE> Underwater Yangtze Museum to Be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China is going to build a
museum, 40 meters under water, at Baiheliang (White Crane Ridge),
in Fuling of southwest China's Chongqing city, to protect
hydrological relics at the site.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History and an
official in charge of the protection of cultural relics in the
Three Gorges area, said that Chinese experts have worked out two
designs for the project, one is in the shape of a fish and the
other in the shape of a diamond.
</P>
<P>
Yu said more experts like the fish-shape design.
</P>
<P>
The 1,600-meter-long and 15-meter-wide natural rock ridge of
Baiheliang is located in the Yangtze River to the south of
Fuling. It was given the name because of white cranes that used to
stop on it in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Carvings on the rock ridge include over 30,000 characters and
18 fish figurines providing evidence on the changes in water level
of the Yangtze River during a period from the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) to the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that Baiheliang is 140 meters above sea
level, only two to three meters higher than the lowest water level
of the Yangtze River in normal years, but 30 meters lower in flood
seasons. Baiheliang will be submerged 175 meters deep when the
Three Gorges Project is completed, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The museum, to cost 300 million yuan (37.5 million US dollars),
will also contain other hydrological cultural relics in the Three
Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
According to the design, the museum will be in four parts: an
underwater hall protecting Baiheliang carvings, a cultural relics
exhibition hall on land, a passageway connecting the underwater
facilities with the river bank and a tower.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Triples in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in October surged 220 percent from a year earlier to 1,081.3
billion yen (about 8.3 billion dollars), the Finance Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp increase to strong exports
aided by the weak yen against the U.S. dollar and weak imports.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased by 16.9 percent to 4,507.5 billion yen (about
34.8 billion dollars), while imports, in contrast, showed a
marginal growth of 0.7 percent to 3,299.7 billion yen (about 25.5
billion dollars), the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trading in October, Japan registered a
surplus of 651.9 billion yen (about five billion dollars),
compared with a deficit of 10.7 billion yen (about 82.5 million
dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in merchandise trade in October jumped by 96.8
percent to 1,277.8 billion yen (about 9.9 billion dollars), up for
the seventh straight month, following a 30.4 percent surge in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
In service trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of
625.9 billion yen (about 4.8 billion dollars), smaller than the
deficit of 660.1 billion yen (about 5.1 billion dollars) a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future current account surpluses, Japanese
government officials reiterated the government's view that the
surplus is unlikely to continue rising sharply over a medium or
long term because of structural changes in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
But private sector economists forecast that the surplus will
continue to expand due to favorable overseas economic conditions,
particularly in the United States and Europe, and the continued
weakness of the yen against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Move to Third on NBA's Career Scoring List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan advanced to
the third spot on the National Basketball Association's career
scoring list after accumulating 27,432 points in 13 seasons on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Jordan reached the milestone in the first quarter of the
Chicago Bulls' game against the New York Knicks, making a short
bank shot over Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
That basket gave Jordan 27,411 points in 13 seaons, two more
than Moses Malone had in 19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
The two players ahead of Jordan are Wilt Chamberlain (31,419
points in 14 season) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 in 20).
Jordan will end up in the No. 3 spot if he goes through with his
plan to retire after this season.

<HEADLINE> Keep Away from Drugs: Students Are Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen City, China's first
special economic zone, is taking measures to keep its 250,000
primary and middle school students away from narcotics.
</P>
<P>
All primary and middle schools in this south China city
organized students to watch movies on drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Keep away from drugs and do not harm your beautiful life,"
says the narcotics control department and education bureau of
Shenzhen in a joint proposal.
</P>
<P>
The education bureau of Nanshan District also organized
discussions on the harms of drugs among teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
The China National Narcotics Control Commission and the State
Education Commission issued a circular this month, calling for
efforts to enhance education on drugs among students in primary
and middle schools and institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out that the anti-drug move is a serious
matter related to social stability and the future of the country,
and that halting the emergence of new drug addicts is a major task
listed in the country's development plan.
</P>
<P>
"To provide education on drugs among students and to keep them
away from drugs is an extremely important task that will help
prevent the spread of drugs," the circular says.
</P>
<P>
To echo the circular, Shenzhen proposed again that all primary
and middle school students should abide by laws and regulations on
narcotics control and never let drugs pollute their life and the
campus.

<HEADLINE> Qing Dynasty Tombs Considered for World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China has recently filed
a formal application with the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO
for including the Eastern Imperial Tombs group of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) on the World Cultural Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Imperial Tombs group in north China's cultural
relic-rich province of Hebei is one of the two biggest groups of
imperial tombs built for the imperial families in the Qing
Dynasty, the last in China's feudal society, according to the
application filed by the Eastern Imperial Tombs Administration.
</P>
<P>
Rich in unique design and artistic taste, the tombs had reached
a peak as far as ancient Chinese architecture is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, state and provincial governments have invested
substantial sums into the tombs' maintenance. The state allocated
20 million yuan for maintenance in 1991-1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
The architectures and 40 square kilometers around the tombs are
well preserved, according to Yin Qinglin, who is in charge of
protection and maintenance of the ancient buildings.
</P>
<P>
"The tombs' architecture make it a very important component of
world heritage," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were among the first group of key relics to be put
under state protection in 1961, and was one of 58 historical sites
in the province on the list.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee -- under the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) --
annually considers candidates for the World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
The cultural and natural sites which are considered of
outstanding significance and universal value will be placed on the
World Heritage list for international protection.
</P>
<P>
So far, 19 historical and natural sites in China are on the
list.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Breakthrough Reported in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The total industrial output
of township enterprises processing agricultural and farm-related
products is expected to reach 9 billion yuan (1.1 billion
U.S. dollars) in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
this year.
</P>
<P>
That is an increase of 26.5 percent over 1996 in the sector and
amounts to 70 percent of the total rural product in the region,
according to local statistics.
</P>
<P>
The region's grain output topped 2.5 billion kilograms this
year despite a number of natural disasters. The output of meat,
eggs and milk all increased by 30-to-50 percent.
</P>
<P>
These achievements in agricultural production have led to
improvements in living conditions. More than 600,000 local farmers
are leading comparatively well-off lives. Another 200,000 farmers
in the southern mountainous areas have risen above the poverty
line. Per capita net income in the rural areas has hit 1,580 yuan
(198 U.S. dollars), 6 percent more than 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government's investment in agriculture increased 22 percent
over last year, said Cui Yongqing, director of the region's
Agricultural Department.
</P>
<P>
Since last year the region has transformed 43,000 hectares of
medium- and low-yield fields into high-yield land, and improved
some 70,000 hectares of irrigated areas. The region also has added
37,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that the total grain-growing areas exceed 770,000
hectares, an all-time high, and that more than 50 percent of farm
products are sold in the markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region has adopted advanced technologies to
guide agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Network Operates in China's Fieldwork Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a network for
obtaining data and research in resources, environment and ecology,
turning China's fieldwork research from individual to group
efforts, according to an ongoing conference here.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) said at the Second Fieldwork Conference that the network
will enable scientists to attain or provide fundamental data more
quickly, more accurately and in a wider range. The network can
better serve economic growth as well as scientific and
technological research, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fieldwork serves as the foundation of scientific research
concerning resources, the environment, biology and agriculture, as
well as being an important means for promoting high-tech
applications, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has established 112 fieldwork centers and
observatories, covering research into forestry, lakes, deserts and
geomagnetism.
</P>
<P>
The CAS spent nearly 26.3 million U.S. dollars, of which 20
million dollars are loans from the World Bank, in setting up a
research network for ecological systems and one for biological
diversity research and information management.
</P>
<P>
China's fieldwork has provided a scientific basis for
government policy and strong technological support for industrial
development, and directly serves economic growth. It has also led
to the establishment and development of a number of new subjects
and theories.

<HEADLINE> Salary Cuts Sought for Thai MPs, Cabinet Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's Democrat Party is seeking support from other parties to
cut the salaries of members of parliament and cabinet members to
reduce state spending.
</P>
<P>
The party is proposing a 10-30 percent salary cut.
</P>
<P>
Coalition party whips are now seeking backing from opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
Thai MPs earn 77,000 baht (1,833 US dollars) a month and are
entitled to employ up to five assistants, each at a stipend of
7,000 baht (167 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of assistants might be cut to three, and the 500
baht (12 dollars) meeting allowance could also be cut.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members' salaries will be slashed by the same extent as
that of the MPs, if parliament endorses the move.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Party sources said that if the proposal is approved by
parliament, the salary reductions would become a "new year gift"
to the country from politicians.

NEW DELHI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- India witnessed an inflow of
3 billion U.S. dollar foreign direct investment during the first
nine months of 1997 despite sustained political instability in the
country, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
This has surpassed the total inflow of 2.4 billion dollar
foreign direct investment during the 1996 calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Going by this trend, official sources here said they expected
the 1997 calendar year to close with an actual foreign direct
investment inflow of 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The basis for this projection was that more telecom and power
projects were expected during the forthcoming months to further
bolster the inflows, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Reducing Business in Asia: Thai Vice PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi has stated that foreign banks, particularly
those from the United States and Japan, were reducing their
business in Asia as they deem it "a risky region".
</P>
<P>
He said that although American and Japanese banks are reducing
their exposure in Asia for different reasons, the result would be
the same: loans to Thai companies would be recalled, putting
further pressure on the Thai currency, today's Bangkok Post quoted
him as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said American banks due to close their books on
December 31 would have to reduce high-risk loans, mostly likely to
Asian companies, while Japanese banks are under pressure to boost
reserves to cover an increase in non-performing loans, but
domestic economic problems meant they are unlikely to be able to
raise the capital required.
</P>
<P>
To ease their burden, the Japanese banks will likely reduce
lending to other Asian countries. Recalling of loans will likely
start in January to improve the books before they close on March
31, according to Supachai, who is a well-known economic
specialist.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the reduction in exposure would be steady, as
central banks worldwide have advised their commercial counterparts
to reduce lending to Asia because it is considered "a risky
region".

BUENOS AIRES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Argentine
leather will break a record of 900 million dollars, the Chamber of
the Tanning Industry of Argentina (CICA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CICA Chairman Eduardo Wydler said that overseas sales of tanned
leather doubled over the last five years, going from 460 million
dollars in 1992 up to 900 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the increase was due to steady investment and
the implementation of new technologies for the industry.
</P>
<P>
CICA said that Argentine tanned leather is exported to 70
countries. The United States is the main importer with purchases
totaling 147.3 million dollars in 1996, 20.3 percent of the whole
export.

she said.
</P>
<P>
Evelia Diaz, who lost her husband Pablo Roberto Diaz, said that
nobody has helped her nor her 12 children.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Government and Justice Raul Montenegro recently
granted 144,880 U.S. dollars to relatives of soldiers killed
during the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Pitty is demanding the Panamanian government pay the same to
relatives of civilian victims.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church estimates that some 560 people died during
the invasion, most of them civilians trapped by cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian organizations and the ruling Democratic

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund has cleared the way for lending Thailand another 2 billion US
dollars before February from the international rescue package,
according to local news reports today.
</P>
<P>
The approval in Washington on Monday indicates the IMF Board's
confidence in Thailand's economic program.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a statement that
Thailand had made solid progress in implementing the IMF-supported
economic program, especially in the key area of restructuring the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2 billion dollars, 800 million dollars will be made
available to Thailand from the IMF this month.
</P>
<P>
A further 800 million dollars will come from Japan and 400-500
million dollars from central banks in the region before Thailand's
progress is next assessed in February.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-arranged international rescue package totaled 17.2
billion dollars to help Thailand overcome economic problems caused
by the collapse of the baht and mismanagement of the finance
sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet on Tuesday

<HEADLINE> China Distributes Anti-Poverty Loans to Rural Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Li Xinzhi used her 1,000-yuan
poverty alleviation loan obtained from the local government to buy
a buffalo and two sacks of chemical fertilizer for growing grain.
</P>
<P>
Li must repay 40 yuan each month on the loan she received in
June. She plans to sell hens from her farm to own the buffalo
outright by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
An ordinary woman from Cuihua Township, Li is one of many rural
residents receiving anti-poverty loans in Yi-Miao Autonomous
County of Luquan of southwest China's Yunnan Province. Her saying
of "using hens in exchange for a buffalo" is a popular poverty
alleviation method called "small credit" now being tried in rural
areas of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, small interest-free loans are made directly to
an impoverished rural household.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Yunnan Province has
implemented the plan with more than 7,000 rural households in 25
townships, issuing loans exceeding 6 million yuan. All the loans
have been repaid within the required time, and rural residents
have improved their living standards.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Chen Junsheng, head of the Aid-the-Poor
Office, spoke highly of this practice during a recent inspection
tour of this southwestern Chinese province. Chen called for
expanding the plan to more rural areas of China.
</P>
<P>
During past decades, the Chinese government at central and
local levels have earmarked increased amount of money for
anti-poverty work. The efforts have begun to pay off. China's poor
population has decreased to 58 million from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years alone, the small-loan plan has been used
for 15 projects in the country's 12 provinces and autonomous
regions where many of the country's poor are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, where many ethnic groups reside, has been known for its
arduous efforts to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xueren, a provincial official in charge of poverty
alleviation in Yunnan, said the small-loan method gives poor
families both motivation and pressure to use their initiative and
hard work to rise above the poverty line.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A commuter plane crashed in
central Canada today, killing three people and injuring 14 others,
television reports here said.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed about 100 meters off the end of the runway at
about 3:30 p.m. local time while trying to land in "icy, misty"
weather.
</P>
<P>
There were two pilots and 15 passengers on board when the
accident happened.
</P>
<P>
Three of the survivors were critically injured and are waiting
to be flown out of the small community, about 300 kilometers
northeast of Winnipeg, capital of Manitoba province.
</P>
<P>
Two military aircraft and a helicopter were sent to the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather had prevented the planes from leaving the community
called Little Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
Two companies had previously canceled flights into the region
because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The plane that crashed was an EMB 110, a twin-engine turb-prop
regional commuter aircraft with a capacity of 19 people. It was
built in 1982 by Brazil.

SAN JOSE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A national study shows that
the intended turnout for next year's general elections in Costa
Rica is very low.

<P>
The study, conducted by the National University's Institute of
Social Studies on Population, said the intention to vote had
reduced from 58 to 56 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The main causes for the disappointment are the unfulfillment of
previous promises, the deception of politicians, and
dissatisfaction with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Slightly above two million Costa Ricans are registered voters
for the elections which are scheduled for next February.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen candidates are competing for the presidency, but just
two of them -- the Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez and the
Social Democrat Jose Miguel Corrales -- have a chance of winning.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Enterprises Urged to Improve Management, Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A large electrical equipment
producer was held up by the Beijing government recently as an
example for failing industrial enterprises to emulate.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Switches Factory, like thousands of state enterprises,
suffered from the "big enterprise syndrome" -- industrial giants
with long histories, redundant workers, a large number of retirees
and an inflexible management system unable to adapt in a changing
market. In 1991, Beijing Switches Factory was on the edge of
bankruptcy with a loss of 4 million yuan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"It was not for me to write the last chapter of the factory,"
said Huang Guocheng, director of the factory. To improve the
management and train his staff, Huang formulated a slogan:
99+1=0. Huang said it meant that a single poor product or one
quality-check error could cancel out all the positive results. "I
apply the slogan to all the enterprise's work flow," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Strict management has made Beijing Switches Factory the market
leader among China's electrical equipment producers. In terms of
economic return, the enterprise last year paid the state 27
million yuan in profit and taxes. "Nowadays, we don't owe a penny
in loans or taxes to the state," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
A marketable product, strict quality control, cost-efficient
management and a widespread post-sales service network are all
considered factors contributing to the factory's success. All
these factors are "applicable to other state enterprises," said
Yang Anjiang, vice mayor of Beijing in charge of its industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
After the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, the Chinese government has introduced all possible means to
activate inert state-owned industries. These enterprises, still
the majority of China's industry, were also urged to improve
quality control and overall management to become more
cost-efficient.

<P>
MANAGUA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will provide a loan of
100 million U.S. dollars for Nicaragua to strengthen bilateral
economic cooperation, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan embassy in Mexico said Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo will visit Nicaragua on December 18 and transfer the
credit to the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
A Mexican security and protocol team has already come to
Managua to prepare for the visit by Zedillo who will be
accompanied by ministers and investors.
</P>
<P>
Both Zedillo and his Nicaraguan counterpart, Arnoldo Aleman, are
scheduled to sign the Free Trade Agreement reached during Aleman's
visit to Mexico last September.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Ministry of Economy said the agreement will permit
Nicaragua to export 5,000 tons of meat and powdered milk, 4,000
tons of beans and 500 tons of fresh cheese, sugar, rum and other
products to Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Fulfills Customs Tax Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The customs office of the
Chinese capital collected 4.73 billion yuan (about 600 million
U.S. dollars) in taxes by Dec. 3, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The customs office fulfilled its yearly tax-revenue target, 4.7
billion yuan, 28 days ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The improved collection of duties came mainly as a result of
greater importance attached to the import tax, greater publicity
of customs law and continued reforms, according to a Beijing
official.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the smooth collection was an increased
effort to avoid tax losses. For instance, 75.4 million yuan in
customs taxes was recovered because many items had been
undervalued.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Seeks to Attract Winter Visitors to Mount Huangshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A promotion campaign has
been launched to attract Guangdong residents to scenic Mount
Huangshan as a winter destination.
</P>
<P>
Huangshan in east China's Anhui Province is considered by many
to be the most beautiful mountain in the country, who say: "After
visiting Huangshan, you may not be interested in any other
mountain in China."
</P>
<P>
The mountain is on the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization's list of World Natural and Cultural
Heritage sites.
</P>
<P>
Though most tourists visit the mountain during the peak season
between May and October, its beauty in winter makes it equally
attractive.
</P>
<P>
Since winter tours were introduced in 1991, more than 600,000
Chinese and overseas tourists have visited the mountain in the
off-season. Between January and November, tourist arrivals
increased by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
As one of the richest regions in the country, the Pearl River
Delta area centering around Guangzhou has also been China's major
tourism market. Increasingly, area residents are choosing to go to
the northern part of the country for the snowy landscapes.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Liwei, vice mayor of the city of Huangshan,
all major air routes will continue to operate in winter, and all
the scenic spots on the mountain will remain open.
</P>
<P>
Through March 15, Huangshan's hotel rates will be reduced 30 to
50 percent and entry fees will be lowered for scenic spots.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Constant Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector has
been stable this year in sharp contrast to global financial
turbulence, particularly in Southeast Asia, "China Securities"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Appropriate growth in the money supply and improvement in the
structure of the loan portfolio are important symbols of stability
in China, the daily financial newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
show that the outstanding value of M2, which is the combination of
cash in circulation plus all sorts of deposits, was up 17.1
percent in the first three quarters from last year. The growth
rate was 8.2 percent down from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of M1, which is the combination of cash
in circulation plus demand deposits of enterprises, grew 17.3
percent between January and September, during which the M0, or the
value of cash in circulation, rose 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
All three indices were near or approaching the Chinese
government's target for financial macro-control for 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan has been
stable throughout the year, with its exchange rate slightly
consolidated against a group of Western currencies led by the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign exchange, China has the second largest
amount with 134.07 billion U.S. dollars at the end of September,
up 29 billion U.S. dollars from the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has also been successful in enhancing supervision and
preventing and eliminating risks this year, which is named the
"Year of Preventing Financial Risks."
</P>
<P>
For instance, the outstanding value of debts involved in bond
re-purchases plunged from the previous 70 billion yuan to 16.5
billion yuan at the end of July, down 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Overall and systematic debt risks have been basically
eradicated," "China Securities" declared.
</P>
<P>
Also this year China increased its financial support for
reforming state-owned enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Shanghai
have recently crushed a smuggling case involving 130 pieces of
precious Chinese cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The relics were found in four parcels mailed by a Japanese
tourist from a local express mail service company. He claimed
these relics as "bowls" in the customs declaration forms.
</P>
<P>
Inspections by experts found that 64 pieces are cultural relics
that strictly banned by the state from being taken out of the
country. They include a blue porcelain dish dating some 3,000
years back, a 2,400-year old pottery jar and lots of articles from
Dynasties of Han, Song and Ming, with 350 years of history at
the least.
</P>
<P>
The rest 66 pieces belong to modern China. Such relics should
gain the state permission before they are taken out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Customs and cultural relics protection authorities in Shanghai
have called for reinforced efforts to stop relics smuggling.

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Exhibit Cultural Treasures Globally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China is making greater
efforts to present its long and eventful history to foreigner in a
more interesting and attractive way, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
About 100 officials from provincial cultural relics bureaux
have gathered in Beijing to explore ways to display more of
China's cultural treasure trove abroad. The three-day meeting
opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The world is probably now experiencing its most fervent "China
craze" since Marco Polo wrote about his travels in China. This
wave has been given momentum by the increasing number of cultural
relics being allowed abroad for display in exhibitions or being
introduced to the world through a variety of other channels.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, China has held more than 150
exhibitions abroad. Several large exhibitions such as "Treasures
from Tibet of the People's Republic of China," "The Civilization
of the Yellow River," and "Ancient China" have attracted millions
of foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
One of the direct results of such international exchanges is
that international organizations have paid more attention to the
protection of relics in China. Since 1992, China has received more
than 20 million US dollars in financial aid form abroad.
</P>
<P>
"New technologies and money from abroad have helped to protect
cultural relics in a more scientific and efficient way, and to
train the personnel involved in protection work," said Zhang
Wenbin, director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
okayed a 250 million U.S. dollar loan to Pakistan for banking
sector adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The loan will provide balance of payment assistance to the
government and central bank of Pakistan, which have already
completed the first phase of reforms aimed at stemming the flow of
bad loans and curtailing loss-making of banks.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government and the central bank began the reforms
early this year in an effort to eliminate political interference
that had left the predominantly state-owned banking sector on the
verge of crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Strengthens Evaluation of Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing Import and
Export Commodity Inspection Bureau has discovered a difference of
120 million yuan (15 million U.S. dollars) between the value
quoted for equipment provided by overseas partners in joint
ventures and the equipment's actual value.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has evaluated 183 groups of equipment and
installations since 1993. The quoted price for the equipment
provided by overseas investors was more than 980 million yuan
(122.5 million U.S. dollars). However, the bureau's evaluation
established the actual value at 860 million yuan (107.5 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The overseas partners will be required to compensate Chongqing
for the 120-million-yuan difference, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
When importing equipment, some overseas investors reportedly
quote higher prices than the actual worth. For example, a chemical
plant in Chongqing put up 600,000 U.S. dollars while foreign
investors offered 790,000 U.S. dollars to buy equipment for a
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors were asked to use the 1.39 million
dollars to buy the equipment. However, the equipment was evaluated
at only 360,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation of overseas investment serves as an important
economic safeguard, said Zhong Dechang, director of the bureau,
and should help the city become the economic center for the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the city approved 134
overseas-funded projects, an increase of 14 percent over the same
period last year. The projects involve contractual capital of 195
million U.S. dollars, up 13 percent; and 106 million U.S. dollars
have actually been spent, up 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Source Faces Environmental Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The ecological environment at
the source of the Yangtze River, China's longest river, faces
great peril from human activities, with pasturelands receding,
rare animals species on the verge of extinction and the
evolutionary chain of living beings facing great damage.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned conclusions were reached by an inspection
team organized by the China Environmental Protection Foundation.
The team reached its conclusions following an on-site
investigation and analysis of the ecological environment, water
quality and flow capacity of three major rivers at the source of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The source area of the Yangtze, located on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, a region widely knowq as the "Roof of the World", covers
140,000 sq.km. severely lacking in vegetation due to the high
elevation, low temperatures and poor soil conditions.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the team have called on relevant departments to
draft a comprehensive plan to protect the ecological environment
in the source area of the Yangtze. They have also called for
strict controls on activities such as grazing, hunting, tourism
and economic exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The team's recent report also pointed to the good water quality
and relatively good air quality in the source area.
</P>
<P>
The team of 14 experts, scholars and personnel from seven
institutes, as well as two experts from Japan, completed the
inspection over an 18-day period.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Support Civil Rights Nominee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bill Lann Lee's supporters
rallied in several cities Tuesday for a Senate vote on his stalled
nomination to be the assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
Supporters hoped these events in major cities would help
pressure Republicans to schedule a vote on Lee, a career civil
rights lawyer whose nomination the Senate Judiciary Committee
failed to clear so far.
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said
a vote was unlikely because Lott also opposes Lee.
</P>
<P>
Asian-American and civil rights groups rallied in several
cities including Los Angeles, New York, Detroit and Cleveland to
drum up support for Lee, 48, a son of Chinese immigrants, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Democratic senators also scheduled radio interviews.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the 40th anniversary of the civil rights division,
which has been without a permanent head since January.
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough. The civil rights position has been vacant
too long," Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat, who chairs
the Congressional Black Caucus, said at a rally at the Asian
Pacific Legal Center in her Los Angeles district.
</P>
<P>
Clinton issued a statement saying he nominated Lee because the
job of "fulfilling the promise of our civil rights laws... is far
from over."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Bill Lann Lee deserves to be America's next
assistant attorney general for civil rights."
</P>
<P>
The coast-to-coast events and Lee's appearances in Washington
Monday and Tuesday are part of a campaign to force the Senate to
act.
</P>
<P>
But Senate critics, led by the Judiciary Committee chairman,
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican, say Lee's support of
affirmative action makes him unfit for the job of protecting all
Americans from bias.
</P>
<P>
Lee is the Western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Higher-ranked players
dominated the first day's matches when the FIDE World Chess
Championship, which drew some 68 grandmasters and masters, opened
in Groningen, Netherlands on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The only exception was Hungarian Peter Leko, who ranked 2635,
lost to German Roman Slobodan (2550) but no one was eliminated on
the first day because of the two-game format, with players
exchanging white and black for the return game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 28 of the top players would enter the second round
directly on Thursday after receiving first-round byes.
</P>
<P>
The top finisher of the 22-day marathon tournament will win the
right for a six-game shootout with FIDE champion Anatoly Karpov of
Rissia in Lausanne of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Indian Viswanathan Anand is a favorite to challenge Karpov for
the top prize Money of 1,370,000 U.S. dollars, since the rival
Professional Chess Association World Champion Garry Kasparov and
Vladimir Kramnik were absent from the FIDE field.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Minister: Latin America Ready for FTAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Commerce
Minister Jose Manuel Salazar said Tuesday that Latin America is
ready to set up the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Salazar made the remarks in Miami, the United States, where he
is participating the 21st Conference on Latin America and the
Caribbean attended by 650 businessmen and officials.
</P>
<P>
The FTAA was proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the
heads of states of the 34 hemispheric countries in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Extensive negotiations on the FTAA will start in 1998 at the
western hemisphere summit in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
Salazar gave assurance that at the summit, the Latin American
leaders will release a final document and will define the
negotiating goals, terms, structure and role of ministers when the
FTAA is established.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there will be negotiations about special
treatment for small economies, as well as environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Doubts about the negotiations have emerged as the U.S.
Congress denied Clinton authorization to negotiate the FTAA
establishment through "the fast track."
</P>
<P>
The fast track is a commitment by the U.S. Congress to accept
without change agreements the president negotiates with other
nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian revenue from tourism in
the summer of 1997 was 10 percent up from the same period of 1996,
Deputy Trade and Tourism Minister Mariyana Assenova told a
national tourism conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He contributed this partly to the arrest of a three-year
downward tendency in foreign visitors arrivals. The number of
tourists went up by eight to ten percent from 1996, of them, the
Germans accounted for 41 percent, Assenova said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism once generated some 9.4 percent of Bulgaria's gross
domestic product and offered 8.6 percent of job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In order to further promote the tourism market, Assenova said,
a Tourism Act will be worked out to provide new regulations for
licensing and awarding star rating to tourism companies in
addition to an inventory of facilities.

<HEADLINE> Zhou Enlai's Hometown Builds Museum in His Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The late Premier Zhou Enlai's
hometown, Shaoxing in east China's Zhejiang Province, has
built a museum for Zhou, who was one of the founders of the new
China.
</P>
<P>
The museum, covering an area of 2,150 square meters, is
scheduled to open to the public on March 5, 1998, the 100th
anniversary of Zhou's birth.
</P>
<P>
A white marble statue of Zhou in martial attire stands at the
middle of the museum. The east hall exhibit is dedicated to the
close relationship between Zhou and his hometown. The west hall
contains photos of Zhou's life, according to the designer
of the museum.
</P>
<P>
The ancient-style museum is based on the former residence of
Zhou, in which Zhou's father and grandfather had lived for years.
When Zhou participated in the Chinese revolution, he returned
often to his hometown. In March of 1939, Zhou came back to sweep
the ancestral tombs and to propagate the idea of resisting
Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zhou's former residence has become a base for
patriotic education. Chinese leaders such as Jiang Zemin and Li
Peng have visited the site. In March this year, local governments
decided to renovate the residence and build a new museum.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 60 items left by Zhou and his wife, Deng
Yingchao, have been collected, as well as 20 letters and documents
and more than 100 photos.

</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, who arrived in Moldova Tuesday for a two-day

MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine banks posted growth
in the third quarter of this year despite the volatile financial
markets in Southeast Asia, the Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted data from the Central Bank as saying that
the assets of 52 commercial banks operating in the country reached
2.366 trillion pesos (about 67.6 billion U.S. dollars), up 4.3
percent from the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Loans grew up to 1.477 trillion pesos (42.2 billion dollars),
up by 5.5 percent from the previous quarter and 34.6 percent from
the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, investment accounts
surged to 369.2 billion pesos (10.5 billion dollars) while
deposits expanded to 1.4 trillion pesos (40 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said the capital adequacy of local banks
remained high with a risk asset ratio of 16.5 percent as of
October, indicating that the country's commercial banks "remained
healthy" in the financial crisis sweeping much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior official of the Department of Finance warned
that the banks' current stability was being threatened by soaring
interest rates which were forcing borrowers to take in huge
losses.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance is considering allowing more foreign
banks to enter the country to lower the "artificially high"
interest rates, but the Central Bank and the Bankers Association
of the Philippines oppose the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Italy's 1998 Budget Awaits Approval From Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government's 1998
budget is awaiting final approval from the lower house today with
a key chapter on pension reforms undecided and the opposition
promising to end tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
Though Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi urged the lower
house to pass the budget quickly, a dispute over the pensions for
the self-employed and the opposition's filibuster could hold the
budget from approval by the parliament till next year, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said that if approval of the budget does not meet the
December 21 deadline, Italy's chances of qualifying for the
European single currency would be seriously jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
Lower House Speaker Luciano Violante also called for a speedy
approval of the budget bill. He suggested, however, the government
listened "carefully to the questions raised by the opposition."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Freedom Front has recently staged a marathon
filibuster in the lower house to block the approval of government
measures to raise VAT rates.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacles to budget approval are a series of proposed
changes to the pension system for the self-employed, which were
put forward by the center-right Freedom Front last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Romano Prodi is reportedly meeting
his finance, treasury and labor ministers today for a solution to
the issue of self-employed.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs European Aerospace Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Romano Prodi is
"extremely interested" in proposals for the reorganisation of the
European aerospace and defence electronics industry, and fully
approves the reorganisation of Airbus, said a government statement
issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were contained in today's joint declaration by
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President Jacques Chirac and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The three governments had asked German Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
Frence Aerospatiale and British Aerospace to come up with a
project for the reorganisation and integration of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "the Italian government had long hoped for
rapid development in the sector... to ensure efficiency and
competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of defence, the Italian statement said:
"Integration at an European level is necessary if the sector is to
compete internationally and produce a clearly identifiable
European defence structure, essential to the political unification
of Europe."
</P>
<P>
It said the Italian government "favored and encouraged" the
integration efforts of Italian industries and was "closely
following" plans for the entry of Alenia, the Italian aerospace
company, into the Airbus consortium.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Falls To Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah fell to
4,600/4,630 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday afternoon from an
opening of 4,145, losing 11 percent in a singly day -- the
sharpest fall since Indonesia abandoned fixed exchange rates in
1971.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has already fallen by 94 percent since January when
it stood at 2,363 to the U.S. dollar, and was down 91 percent
since the government floated the currency on August 14.
</P>
<P>
"This is crazy. The rupiah is just like jumping from a plane
without a parachute," a dealer with a local bank said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the free fall of the rupiah was driven by market
rumors that President Soeharto was suffering a stroke. The rumor
was denied by State Secretary Moerdiono later in the day.
</P>
<P>
"Emergency action is needed, otherwise the rupiah could go down
as low as 5,000 against the U.S. dollar. What is happening now is
beyond imagination. Now every hour we see a new low," a market
analyst with a joint venture bank said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that drastic policies such as capital
controls may be taken, but there would be a cost for such a move.

World Cup.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Joao Havelange was to give AUF the go-ahead

<HEADLINE> Ramos Explains Choice of Ruling Party's Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said House of Representatives Speaker Jose de Venecia's
better winning chance in the 1998 presidential elections prompted
him to anoint de Venecia as the ruling party's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Ramos defended his choice of de Venecia over former Defense
chief Renato de Villa on Tuesday, saying the choice was not based
on loyalty but on many factors, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We based our party decision on many factors and the most
important one is the winnability of the Lakas (ruling party)
ticket from top to bottom," Ramos was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ramos said, he based his endorsement on the results
of a survey conducted among congressmen, city mayors, provincial
governors, district chairmen and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ramos anointed de Venecia, who won widespread support of a
large contingent of congressmen and their constituencies, as the
Lakas-NUCD ruling party's presidential bet in the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
For his part, de Venecia said his running mate will be
announced in a week after consultations with President Ramos and
other party leaders. He said Vice President Joseph Estrada will be
his most formidable rival in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
On his platform, de Venecia said he would continue the
successful economic reforms and modernization efforts initiated by
the Ramos administration.

<HEADLINE> Greece Says No to Proposed European Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed its
opposition to the holding of an European conference which is to be
attended by the 15 member states of the European Union (EU), 11
prospective members and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament tonight, Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said that his country considered it unnecessary because
the content of the conference was unclear and issues for
discussion had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Turkey's participation in the conference, Simitis
said that Turkey could attend the conference under three
conditions, namely the jurisdiction of the international court at
the Hague, the unimpeded course of Cyprus toward EU accession, and
progress in the talks for solving the Cyprus issue on the basis of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Greece was in favor of a simultaneous start
to negotiations with all 11 prospective members.
</P>
<P>
As for the economic cost of EU expansion, Simitis said that
Athens would put up a strong fight so that along with the other
countries of the south, it would not lose resources from the
structural funds, and so that the third community support
framework would provide the necessary credits.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today okayed
a 25 million U.S. dollar credit for Albania's economic
rehabilitation program and a 5 million dollar equivalent as
technical assistance for its recovery program.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation credit will provide financial support for

program. The second credit will provide assistance to implement
the government's program in such key areas as the financial
sector, public sector management, public administration and
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation credit will address two key issues:
structural weaknesses in the economy that have caused the recent
crisis, and the strengthening of the social safety net through the
alleviation of poverty and unemployment created by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
After Albania joined the IDA in 1993, IDA commitments to the
country total some 273 million dollars for 20 projects.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Figures Show Asian-Americans Younger, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Asian-Americans tend to be
younger and better educated than other Americans, and they're more
likely to live in cities and less likely to be divorced, according
to Census Bureau figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The profile of the nation's 9,653,000 Asians and Pacific
Islanders, or 3.7 percent of the population, was based on the
March 1996 Current Population Survey.
</P>
<P>
Asians are concentrated in the West, with 55 percent living in
that part of the country, and 94 percent of Asian-Americans live
in metropolitan areas, compared with 80 percent of the total
population, according to the Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The median age of Asians and Pacific Islanders is 29.8 years,
while The nation's median age is 33.9 years, the figures show.
Median means half of the people are older and half younger than
that age.
</P>
<P>
Only 3.8 percent of Asians are currently divorced, compared
with 8.9 percent of all Americans at age of 15 and over. About
the same share is currently married and living with their spouse
-- 53.5 percent for Asians and 53.4 percent overall -- but more
Asians have never married, 34.8 percent compared with 27.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
For people age 25 and over, 41.7 percent of Asians have a
college degree, compared with 23.6 percent of the general
population, said the Bureau report.

LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said here today that Britain supports Turkey's bid to join
the European Union (EU) and Turkey should be included in the
European Conference of EU membership hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz this evening, Blair reaffirmed Britain's backing for "an
increasingly close relationship between Turkey and Western
institutions, notably the EU."
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed that Britain, due to take over the rotating EU
presidency, wanted Turkey's EU membership application to be
"judged by the same criteria as those of other applicants."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yilmaz told Blair that Turkey's bid to join the EU
should not be discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government has proposed a European Conference
should be established early next year to ensure that a close
dialogue is maintained between the EU and those countries which
are not invited in the next wave of EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders are expected to make a final decision concerning the
conference later this week at the EU summit in Luxembourg.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Indicates Willingness for Dialogue With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
renewed a call for dialogue with Iran after Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami suggested a dialogue with the West.
</P>
<P>
"We've long been open to a dialogue with the Iranian
government," State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters
at a regular briefing. "Our only stipulation has been that such a
dialogue take place with an authorized representative of the
government and that it be acknowledged publicly."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Khatami's speech at the Organization of
the Islamic Conference summit in Tehran today.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, suggesting the time for a dialogue with the West has
come, said, "Our era is an era of preponderance of the Western
culture and civilization, whose understanding is imperative."
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States would "welcome and support the
idea of an open dialogue between different cultures and
civilization."
</P>
<P>
Foley also said the United States had "no quarrel with the
Iranian people" and was "not seeking to change the nature" of
Iran's Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
Foley denied his remarks constituted a policy shift but
observers here said the remarks reflected an important change of
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
"We're coming out on the side of dialogue and also," said
Richard Murphy, a former assistant secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Some other observers here said Foley's remarks came at a time
when the Clinton administration is feeling left out in the cold
while many of its closest Arab allies, including senior officials
from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are in Tehran for the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Syrian Leaders Call for Islamic Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei today met Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, saying it
is time for the Islamic world to rally against Israel and its
supporter, the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long meeting with the staunch supporter of
Iran in its 1980-88 war with Iraq, Khamenei said the frustration
over the U.S. policy of unconditional support for Israel is widely
felt in most Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
This has become a rallying point for Muslim states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the victory of Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has
declared Israel an enemy, calling it a usurper Zionist regime and
opposing any peace-making with it.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said Syria, which lost its Golan Heights to Israel in
the 1967 war, is the "pivot of anti-Zionist struggles
and a frontline country in the campaign against" Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad called on Khamenei on the sidelines of the ongoing
summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which is
attended by most of its 55 member nations. This is his
first participation in the OIC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei expressed the hope that Iran's hosting of the summit
would offer a "good opportunity to tap potential in the Muslim
world for confronting" Israel and guaranteeing Islamic interests.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president said that selecting Tehran as the
venue raised hopes of success of the summit, adding this is
the reason for his first presence at an OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
In the face of closer military cooperation between Israel
and Turkey, Iran and Syria have tried to join hands to
counter the possible threat.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Seeking Changes of Fuel System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Company is
examing possible changes to fuel systems of the 747s after
investigators focused their attention on the system in probing the
explosion of a Trans World Airlines Boeing 747 that killed 230
people near New York in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The company's move was explained by Ivor Thomas, a fuel expert
of the company, at the second-day hearings on the accident at
Baltimore, Maryland, today. But Thomas said the company was
progressing carefully to make sure it did not introduce some new
safety problem.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) tests this
Summer designed to replicate the flight of TWA 800 showed fuel in
one portion of the center tank reaching 145 degrees Fahrenheit
(62.7 C), well above the 100 degrees the industry sets as a lower
limit.
</P>
<P>
Based on the tests, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on November 26 asked airlines to install new equipment to
shield certain wiring in the fuel monitoring system in some Boeing
747s and called for immediately inspections on wiring in some fuel
pumps in older Boeing 747s after the NTSB's tests.
</P>
<P>
At the hearings today, aviation industry representatives and
the FAA explained that the fuel tank vapors were always assumed to
be explosive so they had concentrated on eliminating ignition.

<HEADLINE> Study Gives New Approach to Environmental Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Policy-makers and
investors should know the long-term benefits of investments in
environmental protection instead of chasing after the short-term
gains through conventional investments, a U.N. study showed.
</P>
<P>
Small changes in the way governments and investors look at
environmental resources can save billions of dollars, the study,
Valuing our Future: Cost-Benefit Analysis and Sustainability,
issued here today said.
</P>
<P>
The 47-page study said people tend to take a "utilitarian"
investment approach.
</P>
<P>
Author of the study Geoffrey Heal, professor of Economics and
Finance at Columbia University, depicted his point with an example
of New York City's water system.
</P>
<P>
The city has to invest its water purification plants, each
costing 6 to 8 billion U.S. dollars because damage to soil
ecosystems by pollution has reduced their ability to purify water
collected in reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
However, the purification "can be achieved by restoring the
ecological integrity of its watershed region at the cost of 1.2
billion dollars," Heal said, adding that "the economic value of an
environmental asset, a functioning watershed, is dramatically
illustrated by this case."
</P>
<P>
Introducing the study to the press, United Nations Development

<HEADLINE> Richardson: Iraq Brings forth New Problem on Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bill Richardson, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, accused Iraq of bringing forth
new problems ahead of a planned visit to Baghdad by chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a commentary by an Iraqi English-language
newspaper the Baghdad Observer, which said Butler's visit to
Baghdad was not welcome.
</P>
<P>
"He is coming back to Iraq unwelcomed and should behave
himself by acting as a U.N. official, not as a U.S.
representative who seeks excuse for America to launch
aggression," the daily newspaper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
In response to the commentary, Richardson said: "This
statement is another one of a number of problems that Iraq seems
to bring forth."
</P>
<P>
"I know Butler is planning to go and it's important that he
has a successful visit," he said during his speech at the
National Press Club in Washington. "But, again, we have to wait
and see what the outcome is."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said demand for "continued, unfettered access by U.N.
inspectors to all sensitive sites in Iraq is nonnegotiable."
</P>
<P>
"Only then will this situation be resolved," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Holds On to Its Candidate for Euro Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn stressed here today that Paris sees no reason to back
down from its nomination of French central banker Jean-Claude
Trichet as a candidate to lead the future European central bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with his German counterpart, Theo
Waigel, in Bonn, Strauss-Kahn noted that every country had the
right to nominate its own candicate for the top post at the
European central bank. It was up to the EU government leaders to
make the final choice, he added.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over who will head the European central bank was
ignited last month when the French government surprisingly
announced that it wanted Trichet, governor of the Bank of France,
to take the job.
</P>
<P>
Most other EU countries, including Germany, had expected the
Dutch head of the European Monetary Institute, Wim Duisenberg, to
take the post.
</P>
<P>
According to Strauss-Kahn, there is no hurry to make a decision
on the leadership issue at next week's EU summit in Luxembourg. EU
states could take time to make the choice until next March, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Military Ties With Ankara Directed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Turkish cooperation
is aimed at resisting regional military threats that target the
two countries, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who arrived here Monday on a three-day visit, was
quoted by Anatolia News Agency as saying these threats come from
some unstable countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
If a country supports terrorism and is also eager for access to
chemical and nuclear weapons, it can be deemed as threat,
Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the Israeli official is referring
to Syria and Iran although he failed to give specific names of the
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai reiterated that Israeli's military
cooperation with Turkey is by no means directed at any other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the closer ties and cooperation between the
two countries will contribute to peace and stability in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mordechai visited the Turkish Aerospace
Industries, a producer of Turkey's F-16 jets.
</P>
<P>
The increasing relations between Turkey and Israel have
triggered strong criticism from the Arab countries, which accused
Ankara of betraying the interests of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but secular state, has said
that its move to develop military cooperation with Israel will
not produce negative impact on its friendship with the Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is the first Israeli defense minister who pays
official visit to Turkey, according to Israeli Embassy in
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Adams to Urge UK Government to Leave N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- President of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of IRA, Gerry Adams, said today he would tell
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday to pull out of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since 1921, a British prime minister is
going to hear Irish republicans politely, but very firmly, tell
him that it's time to go, that it is time for Britain to end its
constitutional claim to a part of our country," local reports
quoted Adams as saying at a Sinn Fein meeting.
</P>
<P>
Adams is scheduled to meet with Blair on Thursday in Downing
Street No. 10, to become the first leader of Sinn Fein to have
such talks with British prime minister in London for 76 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1921, Northern Ireland republican leader Michael Collins
signed a treaty in London with prime minister David Lloyd George
that set up a Free State in most of the island of Ireland but left
six northern counties under British rule, a deal that sparked a
bloody Irish civil war.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the talks would be "another phase in the republican
struggle", adding that he wanted some idea of Blair's vision for
the future of Anglo-Irish relations.
</P>
<P>
"But let me assure you that when we meet Tony Blair in London
this week at the top of our agenda is a free, independent and
united Ireland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has been fighting to end the
British rule for the past 30 years, called a ceasefire in July,
which enabled Sinn Fein to have a seat at all-party talks on the
future of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Hopes for Better Arab-Iran Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Arab
League Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid today expressed his hope that Iran
will step up efforts to improve its relations with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the eighth summit of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), Meguid said that he
has felt a new approach by Iran and some Arab countries to improve
their ties.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is opening a new era with the Arab world," he said, "and
I believe Iran is keen to have good relations with Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
Tehran's relations with the Arab neighbors cooled down after
its Islamic Revolution in 1979. It has either territorial disputes
or religious divergences with them.
</P>
<P>
However, it launched a series of diplomatic initiatives this
year to better its relations with the Arab world, the Gulf
countries in particular.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that the ongoing Islamic summit, which lasts from
Tuesday to Thursday, would serve the development of future
relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leader of the 22-member Arab body criticized
Turkey for striking military pacts with Israel, saying it would
have negative impact on the ties between Turkey and Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meguid dismissed the accusation that Syria supports Turkey's
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in its separatist drive,
noting that the PKK issue is an internal affair of Turkey and has
nothing to do with any Arab country.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility that the Arab nations will take
unified actions against Turkey, saying the Arabs expect Ankara to
understand their concerns over its military cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meguid announced his readiness to mediate between Turkey and
Arab states to remove misunderstandings and improve relations.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed opposition to any military actions by the
United States against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"As a superpower, the U.S. can maintain its forces in the
Persian Gulf region, and we are not afraid of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
But "we will oppose it if it wants to take any military action
against Iraq," he added.

<HEADLINE> New Tool for Detecting Space Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists said they
could predict space storms that threaten astronauts and satellites
in orbit and knock out power and communications systems on Earth
more accurately owing to a new instrument called coronograph
aboard the SOHO spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
The scientists presented their findings Monday at the fall
meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The instrument, jointly operated by NASA and the European Space
Agency, can block out the bright light of the Sun so as to allow
scientists to focus on the Sun's dimmer corona.
</P>
<P>
With this new tool, scientists detected nine giant solar
eruptions, called coronal mass ejections, that threw big chunks of
the Sun's atmosphere toward Earth between December 1996 and June
1997.
</P>
<P>
All the nine giant solar eruptions of positively charged
particles caused magnetic storms on Earth, and one of them,
observed on January 10, had permanently knocked out the major
communications satellite Telstar 401.
</P>
<P>
Scientists had in the past to derive their predictions of
magnetic storms from observing solar flares, but the coronal mass
ejections detected by SOHO can occur with no flares or only weak
flares.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rate Remains Above Gov't Target in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's underlying annual rate
of inflation was unchanged at 2.8 percent last month, causing the
government to miss its 2.5 percent target for its seventh month in
power, showed official figures today.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the Office for National Statistics
showed that the headline rate of inflation at 3.7 percent in
November was also unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The figures were largely in line with economists' expectations.
Most analysts had expected the underlying rate, which excludes
mortgage interest payments, to fall to 2.7 percent while the
headline rate had been forecast to pose a modest rise.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the figures indicated that the Bank of
England would probably raise the interest rate again in order to
meet its inflation target.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges "New Lease of Life" for NHS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair pledged today he would give the National Health Service
(NHS) "a new lease of life."
</P>
<P>
"I will take on those who say that the NHS has had its day and
that all we can do is preside over its slow decline," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 10-year plan for health reforms is due to be set out in a
government White Paper. These are expected to include abolishing
the NHS internal market, saving 1 billion pounds (1.7 billion U.S.
dollars) by cutting red tape, reducing the number of NHS trusts
and health authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I have great ambitions for the NHS, not just muddling through
or coping but taking a bold and positive leap forward," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government had already allocated 1.5 billion
pounds (2.5 billion U.S. dollars) for the NHS this year and next,
with more money for tackling breast cancer,improving children's
services and building new hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The government plan for reforming NHS has be welcomed by
doctors, nurses and union chiefs, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The British Medical Association said the new plans were driven
by patients needs and were positive in improving health services.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Syrian Leaders Call for Islamic Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei today met Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, saying it
is time for the Islamic world to rally against Israel and its
supporter, the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long meeting with the staunch supporter of
Iran in its 1980-88 war with Iraq, Khamenei said the frustration
over the U.S. policy of unconditional support for Israel is widely
felt in most Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
This has become a rallying point for Muslim states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the victory of Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has
declared Israel an enemy, calling it a usurper Zionist regime and
opposing any peace-making with it.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said Syria, which lost its Golan Heights to Israel in
the 1967 war, is the "pivot of anti-Zionist struggles
and a frontline country in the campaign against" Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad called on Khamenei on the sidelines of the ongoing
summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which is
attended by most of its 55 member nations. This is his
first participation in the OIC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei expressed the hope that Iran's hosting of the summit
would offer a "good opportunity to tap potential in the Muslim
world for confronting" Israel and guaranteeing Islamic interests.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president said that selecting Tehran as the
venue raised hopes of success of the summit, adding this is
the reason for his first presence at an OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
In the face of closer military cooperation between Israel
and Turkey, Iran and Syria have tried to join hands to
counter the possible threat.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea May Restrict Arms Purchases Because of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea may restrict its
arms purchases because of a recent economic crisis but will not
reduce its financial support for 37,000 U.S. troops there, South
Korean Defense Minister Kim Dong-jin said today.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the forthcoming tight budget, I feel there will be
some restrictions on the purchase of foreign weapons and exchange
of personnel between our countries," Kim said at a joint news
conference with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen after their
annual bilateral security talks, called the Security Constructive
Meeting, at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is true that the Korean government is having
difficulties with its economy, I do not feel it will affect the
alliance structure that we have between our two countries," he
added with regard to housing and other support for U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
When asked about four-party peace talks on the Korean
Peninsula, now convening in Geneva with the participation of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, the United
States and China, Kim declined to make any predictions at an early
stage, saying "the fundamental purpose of the four-party talks is
to have a long-term, stable peace agreement along the Korean
Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
Cohen also made cautious remarks, saying the talks were "not
something we look at in terms of spontaneous or very quick
solutions to a long-standing problem."
</P>
<P>
The annual Security Constructive Meeting was originally
scheduled to be held in Seoul last month during Cohen's planned
visit to Asia. But as Cohen postponed his trip because of a
weapons inspection crisis in Iraq, the venue has been shifted to
Washington.
