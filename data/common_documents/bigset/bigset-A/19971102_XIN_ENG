<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz Denies Interest in Buying Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- German Daimler-Benz said today it
was at the moment not interested in buying the prestigious British
luxury marque Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
"A purchase of this nature is not an issue at the moment," said a
spokesman of Daimler-Benz, parent company of carmaker
Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after the news magazine Der Spiegal said the
Stuttgart-based firm was competing with Munich-based luxury carmaker
BMW to buy up Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
The Vickers industrial group, the British parent company of
Rolls-Royce, announced its sale of Rolls-Royce last Monday. So
far, BMW, Ford and Ferrari have expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
BMW is already producing engines for Rolls-Royce. According to
Spiegal, BMW thought the price of 400 million pounds demanded by
Vickers was too high.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Spiegal to go on sale Monday quoted Daimler
passenger car board member Juergen Hubbert as saying: "We want our
bid to succeed, Rolls-Royce fits in with our concept."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Daimler-Benz has not yet examined in detail
purchasing Rolls-Royce.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Doha Conference Meaningless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said here today that it is meaningless to convene the
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference in Qatar next
month as Israel sticks to its hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the UAE Television, the Egyptian
president also made clear before he concluded his two-day visit to
the United Arab Emirates, that Egypt will not quickly make its
last words on its participation.
</P>
<P>
If there is tangible progress in the Middle East peace
process, the Egyptian president said that "it will be encouraging
for (Egypt's) participation in the conference."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks after Qatar said the conference will
"give new impetus" to the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he "do not think any significance at all for
the economic conference because of Israel's current rejection of
respecting what it agreed (with Arabs)."
</P>
<P>
He said the conference, the fourth since it was initiated in
1994, had been affective to the Middle East peace process, but
that was in cases of the Arab-Israeli peace talks were kept on
track.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president explained that Israeli former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres adopted the idea of attending the conference
in a bid to support the peace process which had been kept moving
when Israel signed with Arabs the Oslo agreement and agreed to
return some cities to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
"The conference launched in Casablanca and then held
separately in Amman and Cairo when the Middle East peace process
had been stepping on track," he stated.
</P>
<P>
"We will await until the last minute to see what will happen
during the meeting which is to be held between the Palestinians and
Israelis in Washington on Monday," he said on possible Egyptian
participation of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the United States will agree together with Israel to
implement the agreements (signed) with the Palestinians," said the
Egyptian president.
</P>
<P>
The conference, traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the other parts of the world, has
been boycotted by some of Arab states such as Syria, Lebanon, the
Palestinian National Authority, the UAE and Saudi Arabia due to
Israel's appearance.
</P>
<P>
The countries said that Israel should not be given chances
to benefit from the economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Qatar argued that they considered the conference will "give
new impetus to the Middle East peace process and advance
economic development in the region."
</P>
<P>
Doha has sent invitations to 92 countries and international
organizations in the world and so far more than 50 countries
from Europe, Asia and America have promised their participation.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries, the United States, Israel and the European
countries will send delegations at the ministerial level. Israeli
Foreign Minister Levy and the U.S. Secretary of State Albright
will represent their countries in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Doha has not mentioned the participating Arab states. Observers
here said that Jordan and Yemen are the only two Arab countries
who have confirmed their appearance while most of the others
remain hesitate to make their last words.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's First Lady Calls for National AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare has been challenged to expedite the
introduction of an AIDS policy to help curb the rapid spread of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
The challenge by First Lady Grace Mugabe in a speech read on
her behalf during a dinner dance hosted by the AIDS Counseling
Trust came in the wake of reports of victimization of people with
AIDS due to lack of a clear-cut policy.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of policy leads to confusion, exploitation and
victimization of people living with AIDS," said the first lady.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 percent of Zimbabwe's 12.4 million population is
estimated to be infected with the AIDS-causing HIV. Experts say
most of the affected are in the productive age group.
</P>
<P>
She said there should be attempts to save children from the
scourge in order to break the pandemic and ensure an AIDS-free
generation.
</P>
<P>
She castigated adults who sexually abused children and in the
process infected them with venereal diseases including HIV.
</P>
<P>
She said, "we need to focus intensely our HIV/AIDS prevention
program toward the uninfected age group, namely, those children
between five to 15 years and ensure that they enter adulthood
free of infection."
</P>
<P>
The law, she said, should be harsh with sexual perverts who
abused children.

JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National

Committee meeting today in Gaza to map out PNA's stand for the
upcoming Washington peace talks, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The committee briefed Arafat its preparations for the

Washington, but no details of the meeting and Arafat's
instructions were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Gaza on Friday that he supports the upcoming
Washington peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis, but
there will be no final-status talks unless Israeli troops being

the negotiating principles formulated by the Israeli inner cabinet

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Ross Perot is scheduled to
address the Reform Party Convention going on in Kansas City, in
the Midwest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
To earn official status, the Reform Party needs to complete a
platform and a constitution, and elect national officers. Most of
the events, which involve some 800 people from 47 states, are
being held at the Convention Center and the Marriott Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Perot, a Texas billionaire, got only 8.5 percent of the
presidential vote in 1996 down from 19 percent of the vote in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party's National Founding Convention opened Friday
amid the hope by some that the party produce a battle in coming up
with a candidate for the 2000 presidential election, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Perot was virtually unopposed in gaining the party's nomination
in 1992 and 1996. He has yet to declare whether he will seek a
third nomination.
</P>
<P>
A number of dissatisfied party members branched off last year
to form the American Reform Party, complaining Perot was
subjecting the party to his unbending will and ideas.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- About 15,00 radical
Palestinian university students held an anti-Israeli rally today
in the West Bank city Nablus, calling for further confrontation
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was held by supporters of the militant group
Islamic Jihad to mark the second anniversary of the death of the
group's head Fathi Shakaki, who was murdered in Malta by Israeli
agents.
</P>
<P>
The students burned Israeli and American flags and chanted
anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans. Speakers in the rally
repeatedly called for more terror attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan Shalah, leader of Islamic Jihad, spoke to the
demonstrators through telephone, urging them to continue the path
of confrontation and the Jihad (holy war) against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad is the one of the two leading militant
anti-Israeli groups, together with the most famous Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), which have been engaged in launching
suicide bombing attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
The organization suffered a fatal blow early last year in
a major crackdown launched by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) following a wave of suicide attacks on Israeli buses
perpetrated by it and Hamas, killing 62 people and wounding
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of its activists were detained and put into jails
by the PNA under the Israeli pressure. Since then, Islamic
Jihad has not launched major terror attacks against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Employees' Quality of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Industrial relations and the
quality of life of employees have been drastically eroded in
countries undergoing structural adjustment programs (SAPs), the
Zimbabwe Industrial Relations Association (ZIRA) said today.
</P>
<P>
ZIRA Secretary Arnold Sibanda said here that the disturbing
fact about SAPs is an erosion of the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence we are getting is that SAPs have caused a lot of
suffering among people. If they have achieved growth here and
there this has not translated generally into improvement of the
quality of life of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZIRA held its second congress which focused on industrial
relations and structural adjustment programs in Africa this week.
</P>
<P>
He said the congress's assessment of the impact, shortfalls of
SAPs and the role of actors in industrial related fields was
timely.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to take stock of effects of the program on
industrial relations. By industrial relations we mean employees,
the unemployed, under-employed, employers and administration,"
said Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
He said phasing out of SAPs is not the issue but the content,
design, implementation and monitoring of programs remain.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, should learn from experiences of other
African countries and experts on industrial relations.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Mutual Understanding Between China, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin today called for enhancing mutual understanding between
China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at Harvard University, Jiang said it would
be impossible for countries to build trust and promote cooperation
with each other without mutual understanding which is the basis
for state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
"Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and
the United States, the exchanges and mutual understanding between
our two peoples have broadened and deepened steadily," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, this is not enough," he noted. To promote the
development of China-U.S. relations, China needs to know the
United States better and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples
date back to more than two hundred years ago, he said. Many
Chinese contributed to the nation-building of the United States,
while a lot of American friends helped and supported the national
liberation cause of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"We will never forget their contribution which has touched us
deeply," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to IBM, AT&AMP;T and the Bell laboratory
Friday gave him some first-hand knowledge of the latest
successes in modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"In our course to further open up and achieve modernization, we
have spared no efforts in learning from all the fine cultural
achievements of the American people," he added.
</P>
<P>
To know China better, it is important to approach China from a
historical and cultural perspective because China is a country
with 5,000 years of civilization, the Chinese president noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Harvard University's efforts on China
studies, Jiang said: "In order to promote the study of China's
past and present, I will present Harvard with a set of newly
published Twenty-Four Histories with Mao Zedong's Comments."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-Four Histories are important classical works on China's
history of several thousand years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Harvard is among the first American
universities to accept Chinese students. The Chinese educational,
scientific and cultural communities have all along maintained
academic exchanges with Harvard.
</P>
<P>
"Harvard has thus made useful contribution to the enhanced
mutual understanding between the Chinese and American peoples," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on a nine-day state visit to the United States, the
first by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.

Industries (CZI) has called for more trade and investment
missions to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by combined
government and private sector delegations.
</P>
<P>
CZI President Jomee Blanchfield today said this is necessary
in order to understand the business culture of the people there
and to explore new avenues for trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"We need to make a determined effort through fiscal support
for firms participating in such activities. We know there are
fiscal constraints at present, but the benefits will outweigh the
immediate fiscal difficulties. We should go for it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Blanchfield urged the business community to be more aggressive
in its quest for entry into the DRC market.
</P>
<P>
Some business people, she said, have already been to the DRC
to explore opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The CZI official said they should however be wary of the fact
that this is a new venture and in many cases the results will
take time to positively reflect on the balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
Business organizations like the CZI must be seen to be taking
a positive attitude in trading with the DRC, she said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Commerce Chamber Announces Boycott of Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Chamber of
Commerce and Industry announced today its boycott of the Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference scheduled in Doha in
November due to the lack of progress in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber's Director General Ahmad Rashed Al-Haroun was
quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying that it would officially
boycott the conference although all Kuwaiti businessmen could attend
the meeting as individuals.
</P>
<P>
The response was made by the chamber following receiving
official invitation from the Qatari Embassy in Kuwait to attend
the gathering. So far Kuwait's government still has not publicly
announced its decision as to whether to take part in the meeting
which also involves the participation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's announcement was made three days after Saudi
Arabian Chamber of Commerce and Industry made a similar decision
of boycotting the conference by all the Saudi private businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Chamber of Commerce and Industry officially boycotted
the three previous conferences held in Casablanca, Amman and
Cairo, Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, launched in 1994, is traditionally attended
by Arab states, Israel and their major trade partners in the
industrialized world. Nearly 1000 businessmen were attracted to
the conference last year in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Algeria had announced their
intention to boycott the conference in line with the Arab League
decision to suspend normalization with Israel following the
Jewish state's implementation of construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Qatar so far has expressed several times its resolve to host
the annual economic meeting, but its Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Ahmad Ibn Abdallah Al-Mahmud announced last month that the
conference would be downgraded from summit to the level of
foreign ministers.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Israel Aborts U.S. Efforts For Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said here today that the United States is doing all
it can to advance the stalled peace process, but its efforts
had been aborted by an incorrigibly obstinate Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the UAE TV, Mubarak
said that as an important partner of the Middle East peace
process, the U.S. is "doing all it can (to promote the peace
process)."
</P>
<P>
"U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright went to Israel
and she told them the land-for-peace principle ... and this means
there are U.S. efforts to resolve (Israeli-Arab disputes)," he
said before he left the Gulf country today after a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
However, Mubarak said the U.S. efforts failed to yield any
results until now due to Israel's obstinacy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He warned that such Israeli stand will damage the peace
process and the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace talks will
lead to unstability in the region and the continuous violence in
many areas in the Arab and Israeli world against countries
related to peace.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was stalled after Israel
decided in February to build Jewish neighborhoods in Arab East
Jerusalem which Palestinians want to be the capital of a future
state.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Students Hold Anti-Israeli Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- About 15,00 radical
Palestinian university students held an anti-Israeli rally today
in the West Bank city Nablus, calling for further confrontation
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was held by supporters of the militant group
Islamic Jihad to mark the second anniversary of the death of the
group's head Fathi Shakaki, who was murdered in Malta by Israeli
agents.
</P>
<P>
The students burned Israeli and American flags and chanted
anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans. Speakers in the rally
repeatedly called for more terror attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan Shalah, leader of Islamic Jihad, spoke to the
demonstrators through telephone, urging them to continue the path
of confrontation and the Jihad (holy war) against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad is the one of the two leading militant
anti-Israeli groups, together with the most famous Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), which have been engaged in launching
suicide bombing attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
The organization suffered a fatal blow early last year in
a major crackdown launched by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) following a wave of suicide attacks on Israeli buses
perpetrated by it and Hamas, killing 62 people and wounding
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of its activists were detained and put into jails
by the PNA under the Israeli pressure. Since then, Islamic
Jihad has not launched major terror attacks against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Promotion of Understanding Between China, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin today called for the promotion of mutual understanding
between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at Harvard University, Jiang said that
mutual understanding is the basis for state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
"Without it, it would be impossible for countries to build
trust and promote cooperation with each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said since the establishment of diplomatic ties between
China and the United States, mutual understanding between the
Chinese and American peoples have broadened and developed steadily.
</P>
<P>
"However, this is not enough," the Chinese president said. "To
promote the development of China-U.S. relations, China needs to
know the United States better and vice versa."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that to know China better, it is important to
approach China from a historical and cultural perspective. He
shared his four observations on the Chinese tradition with his
American audience, in a bid to help them know China better.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people have the tradition of solidarity and
unity, of maintaining independence, of peace-loving and of
constantly striving for self perfection.
</P>
<P>
On the tradition of solidarity and unity, Jiang said: "Since
the time immemorial, people of all nationalities have established
closely-knitted political, economic and cultural links and joined
hands in developing the vast land of our country."
</P>
<P>
He said China became a vast unified country more than 2,000
years ago. Solidarity and unity have been inscribed in the hearts
of the Chinese people as part of their national identity.
</P>
<P>
"Despite occasional division in the Chinese history, ethnic
harmony and national unity have remained the main stream in the
history of the Chinese nation, and an important guarantee for
China's development and progress," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new
type of relationship of equality, solidarity and mutual assistance
between the 56 Chinese nationalities has been established, he said.
</P>
<P>
"People of all nationalities enjoy full rights and freedoms
provided for by the law, and in places where there is a high
concentration of minority nationality people, regional autonomy is
in practice," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the tradition of maintaining independence, Jiang said: "Our
ancestors always regarded the spirit of maintaining independence
as the foundation of a nation."
</P>
<P>
In modern times, the frequent bullying and humiliation by
imperialist powers once weakened China. However, after a hundred
years' struggle of the entire Chinese nation, China has stood up
again as a giant, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, in finding a road to development suited to us, we
will proceed from our own national conditions" instead from
"copying other countries' models," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tradition of peace-loving, the Chinese
president said Chinese thinkers living more than 2,000 years ago
advanced the doctrine "loving people and treating neighbors
kindly are most valuable to a country."
</P>
<P>
"This is a reflection of the aspiration of the Chinese
people for a peaceful world where people of all countries live in
harmony," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Chinese people who are committed to modernization
need more than ever a long-term international environment of peace
and a favorable neighboring environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign policy is peace-oriented, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will establish and develop friendly relations and
cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," he noted.
</P>
<P>
A developing and progressing China does not pose a threat to
anyone, and will never seek hegemony even if it is developed in
the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tradition of constantly striving for
self-perfection, Jiang said the fruits of China's ancient
civilization were brought about by the tireless efforts and hard
work of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese
Communist Party led the Chinese people in achieving China's
national independence and people's liberation and in building
China into a socialist country with initial prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Chinese people are
firmly pressing ahead with reform and opening-up and have made
remarkable achievements in the modernization drive," he added.
</P>
<P>
China has entered a period with the fastest and healthiest
development in this century, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples
date back to more than 200 years ago, he said. Many Chinese
contributed to the nation-building of the United States, while a
lot of American friends helped and supported the national
liberation cause of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"In our course to further open up and achieve modernization, we
have spared no efforts in learning from all the fine cultural
achievements of the American people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of Harvard University's efforts on China
studies and presented the school with a set of newly published
Twenty-Four Histories with Mao Zedong's Comments. Twenty-Four
Histories are important classical works on China's history of
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on a nine-day tour of the United States, the first by
a Chinese head of state to the United States in 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Iraq, UN to Solve Crisis Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today called on Iraq and
the United Nations to resolve through dialogue the crisis caused
by Baghdad's decision to expel American experts working with the
U.N. arms inspection team, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
An Jordanian government spokesman at a press conference urged
all parties to hold constructive dialogues to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also urged Iraq to implement all the U.N. Security
Council resolutions to preserve its honor and sovereignty and pave
the way for the U.N. inspection mission to carry out its task.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against punishing Baghdad with military actions or
new economic sanctions which he said would only complicate the
situation, not helpful to produce a solution to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided late last month to expel U.S. weapons inspectors
from Iraq and refused the entry of three U.S. inspectors Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly said it will not rule out military
option to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions against
Iraq after it invade Kuwait. The embargo will remain in place
until the U.N. arms inspection team certifies that Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction have all been dismantled.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Vows to Ensure Transparent Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced today it has
dealt with a number of election irregularities to ensure the run
for parliament smooth and transparent.
</P>
<P>
Mazen Armouti, spokesman for the Tuesday parliamentary
elections, told a press conference that legal procedures have been
taken against 11 candidates found to have confiscated illegally
the voting cards of registered voters last week.
</P>
<P>
He declined to give the names of the candidates before "legal
procedures are conclusive."
</P>
<P>
Armouti said the government will in the coming days take all
necessary measures to counter such irregularities posing threat to
the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that 200,000 from military, security and intelligence
services registered for the elections have been dropped, for they
are barred from casting ballots by Jordan's constitution.
</P>
<P>
And some 120,000 repeated registrations have been found and
deleted from a total of 1.9 million registered eligible voters, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to hide," said Armouti, assuring that the
government will tell the pubic anything about the election, which
will be conducted in a "transparent and honest atmosphere."
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech, entitled "Enhance
Mutual Understanding and Build Stronger Ties of Friendship and
Cooperation" delivered today at Harvard University:

Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I wish to thank Dr. Neil L. Rudenstine, President of Harvard
University, for inviting me to this ancient yet modernized
institution of the United States in this golden fall.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding some 360 years ago, Harvard has nurtured a
great number of outstanding statesmen, scientists, writers and
businessmen, including six of the American Presidents and over
thirty Nobel Prize winners. The fact that Harvard was founded
before the United States of America testifies to its position in
the American history.
</P>
<P>
Harvard is among the first American universities to accept
Chinese students. The Chinese educational, scientific and cultural
communities have all along maintained academic exchanges with this
university. Harvard has thus made useful contribution to the
enhanced mutual understanding between the Chinese and American
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Mutual understanding is the basis for state-to-state
relations. Without it, it would be impossible for countries to
build trust and promote cooperation with each other. Since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United
States, the exchanges and mutual understanding between our two
peoples have broadened and deepened steadily. However, this is not
enough. To promote the development of China-U.S. relations, China
needs to know the United States better and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
To know China better, one may approach it from different
angles. China today has been evolved from its past. China is a
country with 5,000 years of civilization. Therefore, it is
important to approach China from a historical and cultural
perspective.

I recall my first lesson on calculus in senior high school. My
teacher quoted a line from Zhuang Zi, a Chinese philosopher over
2,000 years ago, which reads "Cut away half of a rod and keep on
halving what is left, and there will be no end to that
process." This gave me a vivid concept of limit. It shows that the
ancient Chinese realized the endless process of changes of matters
and had a fairly good understanding of the nature. As early as in
2,500 B.C., Chinese began astronomical observation and
geographical survey, and gradually formed a world outlook of an
"integration of the universe and humanity." China produced in its
history many outstanding philosophers, thinkers, statesmen,
strategists, scientists, writers and artists and left us numerous
volumes of literature. The scene of "contention of a hundred
schools of thought" brought forth in the Spring and Autumn Period
2,500 years ago and the Warring States Period over 2,200 years ago
and the emergence of various schools of thought and their
exponents such as Lao Zi and Confucius about 2,400 years ago all
occupy a very important position in the world history of
philosophy. Ancient China made unique contributions to many areas
of science including astronomy, calendric system, geography,
mathematics, agriculture, medicine and the humanities. Records of
solar and lunar eclipses are found in the inscriptions on bones or
tortoise shells of the Shang Dynasty over 3,000 years ago. In the
2,100 years from the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty (221
BC-1911), the 27 appearances of Halley Comet were all recorded in
China. Zhang Heng of the Han Dynasty over 1,800 years ago invented
a seismograph to determine the location of earthquakes and the
celestial globe that showed the movement of the sun, moon and
other stars. Mathematicians in the pre-Qin days over 2,200 years
ago put forward the proposition known as the Pythagorean theorem
in the West today. In the Northern and Southern Dynasties in the
4th century A.D., China's mathematician Zu Chongzhi calculated the
ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter to be
3.1415926. China's silk weaving, porcelain making, metallurgy and
shipbuilding reached the world's advanced level in ancient
times. In the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Zaiyu initiated the twelve-tone
temperament which later became the universal standard tones. The
Chinese medicine is a unique school of its own. Particularly,
China's four great inventions of paper making, gunpowder, printing
and compass had once changed the face of the world. China had been
a world leader in science and technology for one thousand years
until the 15th century. These inventions and creations of China
have brought forward the rationalistic brilliance of coordination
between humanity and the nature and the integration of scientific
spirit with moral ideals.

China's culture in history has never stopped developing. It has
enriched itself through the contention and infiltration of various
disciplines and schools of thought, and also through the mutual
exchanges and learning between China and other countries in the
world. Since old times, the Chinese people came to know full well
the importance of "drawing widely upon others' strong points to
improve oneself." The Han and Tang Dynasty were both an age of
economic prosperity and also one of flourishing international
exchanges. Imperial envoy Zhang Qian's trip to the "West" in the
Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) over 2,000 years ago opened up the
world-famous Silk Road; Eminent Monk Xuan Zang of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) brought back ancient culture after braving long journey
to South Asian countries. In the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese
navigator Cheng Ho led a fleet to what that then people called the
"West Sea" seven times in the 15th century, spreading the Chinese
culture to distant land. Only later on, especially in late Qing
Dynasty, the feudal rulers adopted a policy of seclusion, which
hampered China's progress and its exchanges with the outside
world. After the Opium War (1840-1842), generation after
generation of enlightened Chinese people have, for national
rejuvenation, spared no efforts in learning from Western countries
advanced science and cultural achievements in combination with
China's realities and pushing for China's social reforms and
development. Today, the Chinese people who are struggling to
achieve modernization have made the opening-up a basic state
policy and conducted extensive exchanges and cooperation with the
rest of the world, thus creating a brand-new situation in its
opening-up endeavor in the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Sunlight is composed of seven colors, so is our world full of
colors and splendor. Every country and every nation has its own
historical and cultural traditions, strong points and
advantages. We should respect and learn from each other and draw
upon other's strong points to offset one's own deficiencies for
achieving common progress.
</P>
<P>
In the prolonged course of development, China has formed its
fine historical and cultural traditions, which have been either
developed or discarded with the changes of the times and social
progress. These traditions have exerted a profound impact on the
values and way of life of the Chinese people, and on China's road
of development today. Here, I would like to make the following
observations which I hope will help you to know China better.

First, the tradition of solidarity and unity. The Chinese
nation is a big family composed of 56 nationalities. Since the
time immemorial, people of all nationalities have established
closely-knitted political, economic and cultural links and joined
hands in developing the vast land of our country. China became a
vast unified country more than 2,000 years ago. The deep-rooted
Chinese culture become a strong bond for ethnic harmony and
national unity. Solidarity and unity have been inscribed in the
hearts of the Chinese people as part of their national
identity. Despite occasional division in the Chinese history,
ethnic harmony and national unity have remained the main stream in
the history of the Chinese nation, and an important guarantee for
China's development and progress. The founding of the People's
Republic of China marked an unprecedented great unity of the
Chinese nation. A new type of relationship of equality, solidarity
and mutual assistance between different nationalities has been
established. People of all nationalities enjoy full rights and
freedoms provided for by the law. In places where there is a high
concentration of minority nationality people, regional autonomy is
in practice. These regions have witnessed continued economic and
social development. All these have laid a solid political
foundation for consolidated national unity.

Second, the tradition of maintaining independence. Our
ancestors always regarded the spirit of maintaining independence
as the foundation of a nation. As one of the cradles of human
civilization, China has all along maintained its cultural
tradition without letup in the history of several thousand
years. In modern times, the frequent bullying and humiliation by
imperialist powers once weakened China. However, after a hundred
years' struggle of the entire Chinese nation, China has stood up
again as a giant. This fully testifies to the indestructible
strength of this independent national spirit of the Chinese
people. Today, in finding a road to development suited to us, we
will proceed from our own national conditions to address the issue
of how to conduct economic construction and political and cultural
advancement without blindly copying other countries' models. In
handling international affairs, we decide our positions and
policies from an independent approach. The Chinese people cherish
its friendship and cooperation with other peoples, as well as
their right to independence they have won through protracted
struggles.

Third, the peace-loving tradition. Chinese thinkers of the
pre-Qin days (over 2,000 years ago) advanced the doctrine "loving
people and treating neighbors kindly are most valuable to a
country." This is a reflection of the aspiration of the Chinese
people for a peaceful world where people of all countries live in
harmony. Today, the Chinese people who are committed to
modernization need more than ever a long-term international
environment of peace and a favorable neighboring
environment. China's foreign policy is peace-oriented. We will
establish and develop friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, especially the principles of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs. We will never impose upon others the kind of
sufferings we once experienced. A developing and progressing China
does not pose a threat to anyone. China will never seek hegemony
even if it is developed in the future. China is always a staunch
force for world peace and regional stability.

Fourth, the tradition of constantly striving for
self-perfection. Through observing the changing nature of the
universe and all earthly matters, ancient Chinese philosophers
proposed the following doctrine: "As Heaven maintains vigor
through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for
self-perfection." This idea has become an important moral
strength, spurring the Chinese people to work hard for reform and
renovation. The fruits of China's ancient civilization were
brought about by the tireless efforts and hard work of the Chinese
nation. In the past one hundred years or so, the Chinese people
have waged arduous struggles to get rid of the sufferings under
semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, China's
forerunner of the democratic revolution, was the first to put
forward the slogan of "rejuvenation of China." He led the
Revolution of 1911 to remove the millennia old autocratic monarchy
in China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese
Communist Party led the Chinese people in achieving China's
national independence and people's liberation and in building
China into a socialist country with initial prosperity. Today,
guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Chinese people are firmly
pressing ahead with reform and opening-up and have made remarkable
achievements in the modernization drive. China has entered a
period with the fastest and healthiest development in this century.

The reform and opening-up endeavor is an embodiment and a
creative development of the Chinese spirit of constantly striving
for self-perfection and renovation in modern times. We refer to
our reform and opening-up as socialist reform and opening-up
because they constitute the process of self-improvement and
development of the socialist system in China. The practice in
recent twenty years has eloquently proved that we are right in
direction, firm in conviction, steady in our steps and gradual in
our approach when carrying out the reform and opening up and have
achieved tremendous successes. We have successfully overcome
various difficulties and risks in the course of our advance
without causing great social unrest. Rather, we have succeeded in
greatly releasing and developing productive forces and maintained
social stability and an all-round progress.
</P>
<P>
We are conducting a comprehensive reform with full
confidence. Economically, we will speed up the establishment of a
socialist market economy and realize industrialization, and the
socialization, marketization and modernization of the
economy. Politically, we will endeavor to develop socialist
democracy, govern the country according to law, build a socialist
country under the rule of law and ensure the full exercise of
people's rights to govern the country and manage social
affairs. Culturally, we will work hard to develop a scientific
socialist culture for the people, a culture that is geared to the
needs of modernization, of the nation, of the world and of the
future, adopt a strategy of rejuvenating China through science and
education, and strive to raise the political and moral standards as
well as scientific and cultural level of the entire nation. In a
word, it is to build our country into a prosperous, strong,
democratic and culturally advanced modern country.

China, a country with vast territory, a big population and a
long history, should make greater contribution to humanity. The
Chinese people waged a dauntless struggle for one hundred
years. They have effected great reforms and changes one after
another to build China into a strong and prosperous country. They
have worked to strengthen ethnic harmony and achieve national
reunification and to promote the lofty cause of world peace and
development. In the final analysis, they have done all these for
one objective, that is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation and China's greater contribution to humanity.
</P>
<P>
In short, the choice of the social system and development path
that China has made, the domestic and foreign policies that it has
pursued and the goals it has identified for the next century are
all based on both the reality and the history. Therefore, they are
not only in conformity with the trend of the historical
development of mankind and that of the times, but also reflect
the characteristics of the Chinese nation. They serve not only the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people, but also world peace,
stability, prosperity and progress. This is the key to an
understanding of the present China and its future.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples
date back to more than two hundred years ago. Back in 1784,
American merchant ship the "Empress of China" came a long way to
China. In 1847, Chinese student Rong Hong and others came to the
United States as the first group of Chinese students to study
here. Many Chinese contributed to the nation-building of the
United States, while a lot of American friends helped and
supported the national liberation cause of the Chinese people. We
will never forget their contribution which has touched us deeply.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always admired the American people for
their pragmatic attitude and creative spirit. My visit to IBM,
AT&AMP;T and the Bell laboratory yesterday gave me some first-hand
knowledge of the latest successes in modern science and
technology. Today's rapid development in science and technology is
bringing about increasingly greater impact on global political and
economic pattern and people's social life. If we persist in our
reform, we will be able to turn our ideals into reality. In our
course to further open up and achieve modernization, we have
spared no efforts in learning from all the fine cultural
achievements of the American people.

Friendship and cooperation between our two peoples are of great
importance to the world. The United States is the most developed
country and China the largest developing country. China is a
country with 1.2 billion people. Its stability and rapid
development is of vital importance to the stability and
development in Asia-Pacific and the world at large. China holds a
huge market and great demand for development and the United States
holds advanced science and technology as well as enormous material
force. The economies of the two countries are therefore highly
complementary with each other. China's potential market, once
combined with foreign advanced technology and capital, will
produce many opportunities and great vigor for development. China
and the United States share broad common interests and shoulder
common responsibility on many important questions which are
crucial to human survival and development such as maintaining
world peace and security, preventing the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, protecting environment for human survival and combating
international crimes. All these provide an important basis for
further developing China-U.S. friendly relations and
cooperation. We should take a firm hold of the overall interests
of China-U.S. relations and settle our differences properly so as
to reach the goal of promoting mutual understanding, broadening
common ground, developing cooperation and building a future
together.
</P>
<P>
During my current visit to the United States, I had an in-depth
exchange of views and reached broad agreement with President
Clinton on the future development of China-U.S. relations. We both
agree that with a view to promoting the lofty cause of world peace
and development, China and the United States should strengthen
cooperation and work to build a constructive strategic partnership
oriented toward the 21st century. This will mark a new stage of
development in the China-U.S. relations.

Harvard University has all along placed importance on China
studies. The late Professor Fairbank was a well-known scholar from
Harvard. He devoted all his life to the study of Chinese history
and culture. In order to promote the study of China's past and
present, I will present Harvard with a set of newly published
Twenty-Four Histories with Mao Zedong's Comments. Twenty-Four
Histories are important classical works on China's history of
several thousand years. In his life time, Mr. Mao Zedong made
numerous comments and annotations on the Twenty-Four Histories,
thus leaving us with a rich heritage of philosophy in
understanding and drawing useful lessons from China's history.
</P>
<P>
I am glad to learn that you, Mr. President, will come to China
next year. I look forward to meeting you again in Beijing or
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
I highly appreciate the motto on the gate of your
University. It reads: "Enter to grow in wisdom" and "Depart to
serve better thy country and thy kind." Young people in China have
also a motto, that is, "keep the motherland in heart and serve the
people with heart and soul." I hope that in the cause of building
our own countries and promoting world peace and development,
younger generations of China and the United States will understand
each other better, learn from each other, enhance the friendship
and strive for a better future.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Long-term Foreign Policy Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior foreign policy
advisor has proposed that Kuwait should prepare "for a future Iraq
becoming part of the regional security order, to maintain, with GCC
and Iran, stability in the area."
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency today, Abdullah Bshara,
advisor to Kuwait's first deputy prime minister and foreign
minister, also stressed the need to continue dialogue with Iran to
establish mutual and constructive relations.
</P>
<P>
These were outlined in a speech by Bshara to solicit a national
dialogue on Kuwait's long-term foreign policy oriented toward
maintaining regional security and cooperation with Western allies
in the years leading up to 2025.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwaiti diplomacy is to take the responsibility of restoring
the security and stability of the north Gulf state by maintaining
economic sanctions on Iraq until Baghdad complies with all the
Security Council resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to realize economic, security,
political and military integration among the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need of clinching cooperation deals between
Kuwait, the European Union, the U.S. and Japan to establish a
strong alliance.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon Arab cooperation, Bshara said the old Arab
system must be replaced with a new one whose guidelines spring
from ongoing developments in the regional and international
arenas, balancing mutual interests and the economic
globalization.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Arab League Ahmed Asmat Abdel-Meguid today expressed here today
his resentment over Israel's obstinate policies towards the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the UAE's Wam news agency, Majid said he was
regretful over Israel which remains obstinate in pushing its
hardline policies towards Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Israel's policies and provocation activities
against Palestinians, saying such stand make the situation in the
region more difficult to deal with.

<P>
He complained that the Arab side has done all it can to
support the Middle East peace process by contacting countries in
the world but its efforts made no achievement.
</P>

The Middle East peace process has been stalled since Israel
decided in February to build Jewish neighborhoods in Arab East
Jerusalem which Palestinians want to be the capital of a future
state. The decision has sparked world-wide criticism.
</P>
<P>
Majid arrived here this afternoon to attend a UAE-organized

<HEADLINE> Iran, Kazakhstan Oppose Unilateral Move in Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Kazakhstan here today
voiced their opposition to any unilateral action by the Caspian
littoral states to exploit the resources of the sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, this view was
expressed at a meeting between Iranian deputy foreign minister
for Euro-American affairs, Morteza Sarmadi, and his Kazakh
counterpart Edrisov.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said any unilateral action on the part of the Caspian
states would further complicate the situation. He proposed that
deputy foreign ministers of the five Caspian states, which also
include Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Russia, hold emergency
meetings to reach a consensus in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral and multilateral consultation among the
Caspian states will not only serve to complete the legal status of
the Caspian Sea, but also boost peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi also expressed Iran's readiness to participate in
launching technical studies, exploration and exploitation of
Kazakh gas and oil and forwarding the products to the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Edrisov said following the disintegration of former Soviet
Union, the Caspian Sea belongs to five littoral states, and
therefore all issues concerning the sea should be settled
unanimously.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea issue was raised after some of the Caspian
states signed agreements with foreign countries to explore oil
reserves in the world's biggest inland sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the Caspian Sea has rich oil and gas
reserves which can turn the region into another arena of
oil-producing competition and even political confrontation after
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In today's meeting, the Kazakh official also expressed his
country's readiness to export its goods through Iran, saying Iran
has potential in oil industry and the Iranian territory is the
shortest route for oil and gas transport from Central Asia to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Edrisov arrived here today to exchange views on bilateral
relations with Iranian officials and to explore ways for
cooperation between the two countries in oil and gas sector.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Public Sector Doctors Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Medical professionals of Jordan's
public hospitals and health centers started a three-day strike
today for failing to share enough revenues collected from wealthy
patients.
</P>
<P>
The strike happened in 22 public hospitals and 650 health
centers across the country, Salim Smadi, vice president of the
Jordanian Medical Association (JMA), told Xinhua this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health signed an agreement with the JMA in
1996, allowing the medical professionals in public sectors to get
60 percent of the annual fees paid by rich patients, but so far it
failed to keep its promise, said Smadi, organizer of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The professionals had only got 36 percent of the total revenues
of about 10 million U.S. dollars a year, and this was unfair for
them, said Smadi.
</P>
<P>
Under Jordan's rules, poor people and government employees are
treated free of charge in public hospitals and health centers, but
well-off patients must pay.
</P>
<P>
Public hospitals and health centers were on strikes for several
days last month. The Ministry of Health agreed on Sunday to carry
out the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of Health Ashraf Kurdi soon changed his mind and
said last night in a television interview that the 60 percent of
revenues could not be given to the professionals, and no new
negotiations with JMA would be held any more.
</P>
<P>
Kurdi said the ministry would only pay 36 percent of the
revenues because it needed to use part of the revenues for
updating equipment.

</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said this initiative includes political, economic
and financial aspects of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no guarantees of complete implementation of the
plan", he said, adding that this depends on the determination and
"ardour" of the sides.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the plan provides for cooperation in
encouraging investments, integration of Russian economy into the
world economic system, rendering assistance to Russian reform,
training of managers, strengthening of a dialogue in the energy
sector and promoting cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to make joint efforts to develop the oil
and gas fields in the Russian Far East and to continue the
development of relations between the defense ministries of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the guarantees for Japanese
investments in Russia, and the two leaders decided to establish a

The Iraq News Agency (INA) today quoted the spokesman as saying
that "the U.S. has suspended 13 contracts for the first phase of
the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Iraq with the
U.N. though five months have passed and these contracts were
submitted in accordance with the Purchase and Distribution Plan
endorsed by the U.N. Secretary General."

medical requisites from Russia; purchase of spare parts for farm
machinery from Holland; purchase of stand-by power generators from
France; purchase of medical requisites from England; purchase of

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Cooperation to Solve Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi called here today for cooperation among the Caspian Sea
littoral states to determine the legal status of the sea.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a meeting with visiting Kazakh deputy
Foreign Minister Erlan Edrisov.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi expressed Iran's insistence that until the legal
status of the Caspian Sea is determined, none of the five littoral
countries has the right to take unilateral measures to explore the
resources of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Edrisov said in the meeting that the Caspian Sea belongs to the
five littoral states, and all issues concerning the sea should be
settled unanimously.
</P>
<P>
The five littoral countries of the Caspian Sea are Iran,
Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea issue has emerged after some of the Caspian
states have signed agreements with foreign countries to explore
oil reserves in the world's biggest inland sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the Caspian Sea has rich oil and gas reserves
which may turn the region into another arena of oil-producing
competition after the Persian Gulf and even political
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Edrisov arrived here today to exchange views on bilateral
relations with Iranian officials and to explore ways for
cooperation between the two countries in oil and gas sector.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong To Elect Deputies To Next National People's Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
said here today the fact that Hong Kong will act as an independent
constituency for the first time and elect its own deputies to the
National People's Congress is a concrete step in implementing the
principle of "one-country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"It also shows that Chinese citizens residing in Hong Kong have
the right to participating in managing state affairs," said the
official in charge of the general office of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee Saturday approved a list of deputies
for the electoral conference of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) to the Ninth NPC, which will convene
next spring in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The electoral conference was established in accordance with the
HKSAR Basic Law and an NPC resolution on electing method of HKSAR
NPC deputies, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, Hong Kong can elect 36 deputies
and Chinese citizens among Hong Kong residents 18 and above are
eligible, but they should not represent any party or organization,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
Deputies elected should abide by Chinese Constitution and laws,
love China and love Hong Kong. They should support the principle
of "one country, two systems" and HKSAR Basic Law and perform
their duties as deputies according to NPC procedures and relevant
laws, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that deputies to the NPC from the HKSAR will be elected
in Hong Kong by Chinese citizens among the HKSAR residents.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an election method drawn up by the NPC, the
36 deputies from the HKSAR should be elected by an electoral
conference which consists of Chinese citizens of the Selection
Committee for the first Hong Kong SAR Government, members of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are Chinese citizens of the
HKSAR but are not concurrently members of the Election Committee,
and members of the Hong Kong SAR Provisional Legislative Council
who are Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The electoral conference will elect an 11-member presidium to
manage the conference.
</P>
<P>
Candidates can be named jointly by 10 members or more of the
electoral conference, and the number of candidates should be
one-fifth or half more than the number of deputies to be
elected. The election must be conducted in a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the electoral conference will hold
its first meeting this month and the election is expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC Standing Committee will preside over the
election. It will convene the electoral conference's first meeting
and supervise the election to ensure it is carried out strictly in
line with the election method approved by the NPC.
</P>
<P>
It will also publish the names of the deputies after certifying
their qualifications, the NPC official said.

<HEADLINE> Haitai Group Applies for Court Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Haitai Group, the 24th largest
conglomerate in South Korea, has sought court protection for seven
of its 15 subsidiaries to prevent bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The financially-strapped Haitai filed for court mediation for
its profitable confectionary, beverage, distribution and trading
units over the weekend in an effort to keep its managerial
rights. Meanwhile, it decided to place three unprofitable units
under court protection.
</P>
<P>
Among the remaining subsidiaries, six will be liquidated on a
step-by-step basis through mergers or sale to a third party, and
two others -- the famous pro-baseball team, Haitai Tigers, and the
Korad advertising agency -- will be managed normally.
</P>
<P>
Haitai has become the fifth business group to seek court
protection for rescheduling debt payments so far this year
following Hanbo, Jinro, Dainong, and Kia.
</P>
<P>
Reckless expansion into unrelated business areas, a sluggish
economy and bank's strict lending policies are to be blamed for
the Haitai Group's financial plight, as has been the case for
other insolvent conglomerates, financial observers said.

KUWAIT CITY, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Higher Defense
Council of Kuwait held a meeting today to discuss the latest
confrontation between Iraq and the United States and prepare to
face all possibilities arising from the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, covered the
potential outcome of the standoff and the necessity to be
prepared to face all possibilities, according to official Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided last week to ban all U.S. inspectors taking part
in the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
eliminating weapons of mass destruction in the country following
the adoption of the U.S. and British sponsored 1134 U.N.
resolution threatening to impose new sanctions against Iraq for
hampering the task of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. called Iraq's refusal "unacceptable" and said the
United Nations was weighing options, indicating that the options
are open to new military attacks against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler declared that all
members of his team will go to Baghdad to resume their mandate
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation put Iraq and the U.S. again on a collision
course which caused concern from Kuwait.
</P>

Kuwait's Council of Ministers also condemned during a weekly
session today the Iraqi decision to ban U.S. members of the
inspection team from entering Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Say Acupuncture Effective Treatment for Insomnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Piercing needles into some
acupoints on the human body has proved to be effective in treating
insomnia, according to a medical report released at the Academic
Conference of the World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion
Society (WFAS) here today.
</P>
<P>
After receiving acupuncture therapy, 33 percent of patients
suffering from serious-level insomnia, 56 percent of the
moderate-level and 72 percent of slight-level were able to sleep
normally, six to eight hours a night.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the acupuncture treatments, they slept less than
three, five and seven hours per day, said Dr. Jou Eel Jia, author
of the report who came from the Brazilian Institute of Holistic
Research on Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Out of 1,899 patients receiving traditional therapy, 35 percent
of the serious-level insomniacs also reported significant
improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
"People are facing more and more life pressures now. According
to traditional Chinese medicine, excess emotional waste and
physical effort harming the heart and the spleen lead to
insomnia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Also, poor sleeping quality can be caused by emptiness of the
blood of the heart and alimentary disorder," he added.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said he pierced needles into key acupoints to
relieve uneasiness, which helped patients go to sleep more easily.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jou and his colleague, Dr. Norvan Martino Leite, also tried
combinations of acupuncture therapy with a kind of phenobarbital,
Luminal, or some herbs in a bid to treat insomnia patients, whose
symptoms could not be eased simply by acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
About 94 percent of patients have resumed sleeping six-eight
hours after receiving acupuncture-Luminal and 72 percent who
received acupuncture combined with herb therapy, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation may get worse if they just use medicines because
of drug addiction. But acupuncture therapy treats insomnia by
looking into both its root cause and symptoms," he said.

<HEADLINE> September 18 Incident Memorial Hall to Be Built in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A memorial hall will be
erected on the ruins of a railway section bombarded by Japanese
soldiers 66 years ago here in Shenyang of northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The hall will commemorate the bombing which marked the
beginning of Japan's military invasion of China and other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing and other senior officials of central departments
and Liaoning province laid the foundation today for the memorial
hall.
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall, named after Sept. 18, the day of the
bombardment, should be completed by Oct. 1, 1999 when China
celebrates the 50th anniversary of its founding.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang People's Government plans to build the memorial hall
into a national monument with modern equipment and accurate
historic data.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered China's 14-year war against fascist
aggression. From Sept. 18, 1931 until Aug. 15, 1945 when Japan
surrendered unconditionally, Japanese troops brought unprecedented
suffering to the people of Asia through their military aggression
against China and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 Shenyang has established several memorial buildings,
including an underground exhibition hall, near the bombardment
site. Over one million people have visited the memorial buildings.
</P>
<P>
The new hall will be an enlargement of the old memorial
buildings with displays of pictures, objects, sculptures, movies
and video films. The exhibition will consist of five parts: plot,
incident, sufferings, fighting against Japanese invasion and
victory.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang's decision to build the memorial hall has been a
popular one. People from all walks of life in Shenyang have
donated more than 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars)
to build the hall.

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution Claims Over 50,000 Lives in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 51,779 people
die prematurely every year due to air pollution in 36 Indian
cities, registering an increase of 28 percent in a period of three
to four years, a study said.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by India's Center for Science and
Environment revealed that a World Bank report on environmental
costs in India had put the figure at 40,351 in 1992-93, according
to Press Trust of India today.
</P>
<P>
During the last three to four years, the study said, the annual
mortality caused by air pollution doubled in the cities of
Calcutta, Kanpur and Hyderabad while in Delhi the figure rose from
7,491 to 9,859, an increase of almost 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deaths caused by air pollution in Calcutta (10,647), Delhi
(9,859), Bombay (7,023), Kanpur (3,639) and Ahmedabad (3,006)
along with other major cities account for 66 percent of the total
premature deaths in India in 1995-96, the study added.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the number of illness that require hospitalization
or medical treatment because of air pollution, the figure is
currently 26 million a year, the study said.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the levels of disease-causing suspended
particulate matter in Delhi, Kanpur, Bombay and Calcutta, among
others, are three to five times higher than the acceptable limit
set by the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Britain Not to Enter European Exchange Rate System: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of Exchequer
Gordon Brown said here today that Britain does not want to
re-enter the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), but he set
the tone for British participation in the European single currency
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current debate about whether Britain should
return to the ERM before joining a single currency, which is to be
launched in 1999, Brown said: "We have no intention of entering
the ERM."
</P>
<P>
"Every country wants a stable exchange rate," Brown said in an
interview with BBC Television. He said that he wanted to have a
strong and competitive pound over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
However, Brown said that there is a strong business consensus
for entry into a European single currency as some 60 percent of
Britain's trade was within Europe.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was not ready to abandon the pound during the
present Labor term, which expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
A standing committee on preparations for the European Economic
and Monetary Union would advise business on "problems of
transition" before a decision on entry was made, he said.
</P>
<P>
The last Conservative government left the ERM in disarray in
September 1992.

<HEADLINE> Young Couple Linked by Yangtze, Yellow River Water Control Projects  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- Cao Weiguo
and Liu Shujin, an ordinary couple in their mid 30s, have been
working respectively on China's two largest rivers.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four-year-old Cao is a driver on the worksite here of
the Three Gorges Project, a gigantic project under construction on
China's largest Yangtze River, only next to the Great Wall built
more than two millennia ago, while his wife Liu Shujin, 35, is a
tunnel and culvert engineer for Xiaolangdi Water Control project,
the biggest on the Yellow River. Both rivers are renowed to have
nurtured and nourished the Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
The young couple, who are admired and often on the lips of
fellow workers or technicians at their respective worksites, have
become the most sought-after figures by journalists, who flocked
to Sandouping and Xiaolangdi to cover them.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of October 28, when the gap of the Xiaolangdi
dam was joined up, Cao learned from his workmates that his wife
was appearing in a live-cast TV program on the daming process by
China Central Television. Just coming off the night shift, he
hurried back to his dormitory.
</P>
<P>
To his disappointment, Cao missed the shots showing his wife
and, in the evening, he made a phone call to her and told her of
his regret at not seeing her on TV.
</P>
<P>
Incidently, that day happened to be the birthday of their
nine-year old daughter Wenwen. Cao then dialed his wife's home,
where they had sent their daughter years ago, and shared with the
girl the joy of seeing her mother on TV.
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody is as lucky as us, as we have been working on
our country's two largest water hydro-power projects." said Liu,
adding that "both of us are filled with pride in spite of the
hardships and arduous jobs we working on."
</P>
<P>
It chanced that they met over ten years ago when both worked at
the construction site of Ankang Hydropower Station in southwest
China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
One evening, upon hearing that Liu's quilt was too thin to keep
warm, Cao Weiguo climbed over the mountains that kept them apart
and sent his own quilt to his sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, they fell in love and did not hesitate to let
others know.

<P>
"What I like of him is that he is so affectionate and care for
me meticulously," said Liu, and she had a deft hand and a lively
character that also attracted him too. Both agreed, she added, and
"what brought us together at the very first is our common career."
</P>
<P>
And they both have sacrificed much for their career. For the
sake of building the two mammoth water control projects, the
couple has met only once annually over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Thirsty for a family union, Cao once urged his wife to retire
earlier or to find herself anther job. And it was his father, a
water conservation veteran worker who encouraged them to stay on
their jobs and continue to contribute their share to the cause of
the country's water conservation and power generation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rapid progress made in the two projects
convinced Cao and his wife and gradually changed their mind.
"Every step forward taken in construction of the projects enable
us to feel our effort worthwhile," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cao Weiguo has made three trips to his wife's worksite in
recent years and, during each trip he felt inspired by her hard
work. But he also has some worries for her health, as he saw Liu
working for long hours each day in the water diversion tunnel
filled with dirt and amid roaring of machines.
</P>
<P>
Liu came to the Three Gorges last September. Seeing the
activities seething with enthusiasm at the construction site, she
couldn't but gasp with admiration at the massive constructions and
felt more proud of her husband.
</P>
<P>
As they live far apart in three places, the couple and their
lively daughter ofter miss one another. "My best pastime, more
than playing basketball and listening to music, is looking at the
photo album of my wife and daughter."
</P>
<P>
When their nine-year-old Wenwen talks to her young pals, she
often said with a sense of pride, "my dad and mum are just great.
One is at the Three Gorges, and the other in Xiaolangdi."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Air Force Destroys Tamil Rebel Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Air Force
destroyed a Tamil rebel supply ship carrying a consignment of
weapons en route to the northeastern coastal city of Mullaitivu
early this morning, the state-owned radio station said today.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Chief Oliver Ranasinghe was quoted by the station as
saying that the ship was completely destroyed near Mullaitivu
early today. Another radio station TNL said the ship was sunken.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels of the Liberation of Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) were about to unload the weapons from the anchored ship at
the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The chief commander described the result of the attack as one
of the greatest achievements of the troops.
</P>
<P>
But it's still unknown how many weapons and what kinds of
weapons were on board the sunken ship. Immediate casualty of the
fighting is also yet to know.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force also destroyed several boats rushed to their
ill-fated ship for reinforcement, it was said.
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate state of their own in
the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> CCPIT to Better Serve China's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) expects to contribute
more to China's foreign trade strategy, said new CCPIT President
Yu Xiaosong.
</P>
<P>
CCPIT should be committed to promoting the entry of Chinese
businesses into the world market, furthering international trade
and introducing advanced foreign technology and investment into
China, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
As an non-governmental trade-promotion organization, CCPIT has
played the role of intermediary by offering services to Chinese
businesses such as providing trade information, holding
exhibitions and carrying out business arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Yu, also president of the China Chamber of International
Commerce, said that the variety of China's foreign trade presented
CCPIT with both development opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 5,000 foreign trade companies, more than 6,000
businesses and 140,000 foreign-funded enterprises have been
granted the authority to handle imports and exports, he
said. China will replace the present foreign trade examination and
approval system with a new foreign trade registration system by
the end of 2000. CCPIT should then be able to establish ties with
all kinds of businesses.
</P>
<P>
Two major priorities for CCPIT, he said, are service to central
and western China and to small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year, CCPIT helped the Ningxia Hui Automonous Region in
northwestern China hold trade fairs abroad with good results, Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will not only further trade with its traditional
partners such as the European Union, the United States and Japan,
but will also advance economic exchanges with South America and
Africa. CCPIT should be more active in promoting China's economic
and trade relations with South America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
CCPIT will hold Chinese commodity fairs in Panama and South
Africa later this month, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ding Guangen on Promoting Ethical and Cultural Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese propaganda official
Ding Guangen said popularizing the guidelines of the Party's 15th
national congress should stress upholding the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and advancing ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Ding, head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central
Committee and member of the political bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, made his remarks during a recent inspection tour in
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China.
</P>
<P>
Advancing ethical and cultural progress must center on economic
construction and serve the fundamental goals of the whole Party
and the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Combining promoting ethical and cultural progress with
modernization construction, the former will produce a uniting
force which in turn stimulates productivity," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that promoting moral progress should proceed from
the reality that China is now at the primary stage of
socialism. "Therefore we should be very practical in making plans
and setting goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ding said the key to promoting ethical and cultural progress
lies in intensifying moral and ideological education, especially
among young people.
</P>
<P>
He called on government officials to concern themselves with
the well-being of the people and do everything in their interests
and solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
"We should make sure that promoting ethical and cultural
progress win the consent and support of our people," Ding
said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Runs High in Vietnamese Countryside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) --- A labor surplus continues to put
heavy pressure on Vietnam's job market, particularly in the
countryside, where 80 percent of the country's population live,
local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said although 1 million jobs are created each year
in Vietnam, unemployment and under-employment remain serious in
its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs
said 40 percent of the 25 million people in the Red river and
Mekong river deltas are fully or partly out of job.
</P>
<P>
What's more worrisome is the low education and professional
level of farmers. Although 93.43 percent of them are literate and
40 percent have completed junior high school, only 7 percent have
had job training, four times lower than in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has adopted a series of policies to
encourage farmers to provide their children with higher or
vocational education. But the percentage of young rural people who
had received higher education or job training remains very low,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Strengthen Anti-Graft Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today vowed to pursue with greater vigor the campaign against
graft and corruption in the government during the remaining eight
months of his term.
</P>
<P>
He said his objective is to institutionalize effective,
preventive, and punitive measures to curb graft and corruption in
the government as one of his lasting legacies to the Filipino
people.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to leave behind a bureaucracy with unquestioned
integrity, efficiency and credibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos reaffirmed his commitment to clean, honest and efficient
governance after receiving an updated report on his
administration's anti-graft and corruption campaign from the
Presidential Management Staff.
</P>
<P>
The report said that so far this year, various government
agencies have disposed thousands of graft and corruption cases,
most of which are minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people including prosecutors, regional directors and
government employees have been dismissed from office or sentenced
to jail for these offenses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ramos ordered all heads of government
agencies to submit a regular report on the implementation of
various measures the government introduced to curb graft and
corruption in their respective offices.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has vowed that he would not seek re-election as his term
of office expires on June 30 next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- World number one Peter Gade
Christensen revenged his two previous losses to compatriot and world
number nine Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen by beating him to take the men's
singles title at the 170,000 U.S. dollars Millennium Hong Kong Open
Badminton Championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a match between two of China's new stars, Gong Ruina
defeated Wu Huimin 2-1 in the women's singles final today. Both
were unseeded layers here.
</P>
<P>
But it was the South Koreans who bagged most titles, in the
men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
Quick-footed Christensen, the second seed for the five-star event,
took over the world's top position from teammate Poul-Erik
Hoyer-Larsen earlier this week. But he had lost to Stuer-Lauridsen
twice in their only two previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
Christensen, finalist in his four latest events including the
Danish Open two weeks ago where he lost to China's Dong Jiong,
overcame a one-game deficit in the final today to beat fourth-seeded
Stuer-Lauridsen 7-15, 15-6, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to beat Thomas (Stuer-Lauridsen) as he had being
playing very well these days," said Christensen, 20.
</P>
<P>
He addmitted that his opponent had controlled the net in the
opening game. "But I tried to build myself up and did quite well,
especially in the third game," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I did a defensive game in the early stage today. I didn't
expect him to be so aggressive, which he was in the first game,"
Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old winner said he "had very good legs during the second
and third games" and was not tired at all after the match.
</P>
<P>
"So long as my legs are good enough, I think I can play for at
least 10 years," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Christensen analysed that his opponent's failure was probably due
to his compartively easier draw so he had not played many hard matches
so far to reach his shape.
</P>
<P>
China's Gong Ruina won the opening game 11-8 in the women's singles
final, with her usual tricky and consistent game. Her teammate Wu
Huimin won one game back in the second by taking three points in a row
after they tied 8-8, largely due to unforced errors from Gong.
</P>
<P>
But more experienced Gong came back strongly in the decisive third
game where she led all the way through to her triumph after an early
2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Kim Dong-Moon and Ha Tae Kwon took an upper hand over
Indonesia's third seeds Hermono and Hiao Eng in the men's doubles
final and won the match 15-4, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
The women's doubles title went to South Korea's fifth seeds Chung
Jae Hee and Ra Kyung Min, who downed China's top-seeded Liu Lu and
Qian Hong 15-7, 15-12.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Funds Help Upgrade State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas funds are playing an
increasingly bigger role in upgrading state-owned enterprises in
Shenyang, a heavy industrial base in China, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, the share of overseas funding in the
city's state-owned enterprises invested in technology has
increased by 20 percent each year. Overseas funds are expected to
rise to account for 60 percent of the total technology investment
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The use of overseas funds to upgrade technology is important in
reforming state-owned enterprises, Shenyang Mayor Mu Suixin said.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1996, 1.1 billion U.S. dollars was committed to
Shenyang's industrial enterprises by overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Mu said these enterprises should try to learn from new
technology and advanced managerial expertise from their overseas
partners.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures with Toshiba Elevator Co. and Toyota Motor Co.,
for instance, have benefited from their Japanese partners'
managerial skills which focus on tapping the potential of staff
members and reducing costs.
</P>
<P>
Of Shenyang's 340 large and medium state-owned enterprises in
such industries as machinery, metallurgical, automotive and
textile, more than 50 rank first in their industries in China.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Supports Bi-Communal Business Contacts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations fully
backs the Cypriot bi-communal business contacts as a way to
promote rapprochement between the two sides on the island, a top
U.N. envoy on Cyprus has said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resident representative for Cyprus Gustave Feissel said
in an interview with the English-language daily Cyprus Mail
published today that he thought business was a very important
area in which concrete steps could be taken to help reach a
comprehensive Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of efforts should be encouraged," Feissel said,
pointing out that it would not be conducive to progress in the
protracted Cyprus problem to wait until after a solution before
beginning such contacts.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said that not enough had been done to promote
rapprochement between the two sides, adding the U.N. always felt
much more is needed to be done to send the right messages.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash that they support joint
business meetings, the U.N. official said it was not enough to
express good intentions, but do things.
</P>
<P>
"Things must go from words to deeds. The authorities must
send a clear message that contacts are good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) would facilitate further meetings between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots at the U.N.-controlled Ledra Palace Hotel in
the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish Cypriot businessmen along with their
counterparts from Greece and Turkey held business meetings in
Istanbul, Turkey, and in Athens, Greece, over the last few
months to promote rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkey landed its troops in Cyprus and took over 37 percent
of the island in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have still been trying to
reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation
despite no tangible results have been achieved in the bicommunal
peace talks for the past 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Build New Home before River Blockage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- Zheng
Bangzhou, a young farmer living beside the Yangtze in the Three
Gorges area, finds it hard to believe that within two and a half
months, his family moved from a simple adobe house into a new
two-story 160-sq m building.
</P>
<P>
Zheng and his family in Quxi village of Zigui County are among
the 39,600 people to be resettled before the flood season sets in
next May, when their present homes will be submerged by the river
as a result of its damming on the coming Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The river blocking will signal the completion of the
first-phase of the Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water
control undertaking.
</P>
<P>
To compensate for Zheng's 116-sq-m house and 0.15-ha cropland,
the government paid 15,000 yuan. With the compensation and their
own savings totaling more than 20,000 yuan, the 30-year-old farmer
and his wife have had built the new house and opened a tailor's
shop by the highway.
</P>
<P>
By now, all the 135 residents in Zheng's village moved into new
homes, and the majority of the rest of the 39,600 people will be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the
relocation of residents at the site of the Three Gorges reservoir,
which is crucial to the success of the massive project, as Premier
Li Peng emphasized repeatedly. The government has drafted an
initial budget of 40 billion yuan for (to be adjusted with
inflation) and 14 preferential policies to resettlement.

A comprehensive development-oriented resettlement program,
moreover, has been in the place of traditional compensation-only
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges reservoir area has been designated as a
national economic development zone, with Yichang, Wanxian, Fuling
and several other cities enjoying policies granted to coastal open
cities.
</P>
<P>
The central government also calls for 20 provinces and
municipalities and ten major and medium-sized cities to render
help to resettlement, and requires all the ministries and
commissions under the State Council to give priority to
resettlement when allocating development projects and funds.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the state helps the reservoir area to
introduce more overseas funds, and recently granted tax breaks to
import of materials and equipment by businesses registered in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the preferences include the recruitment of
workers for construction projects in and near the Three Gorges
area primarily from the areas to be submerged by the Three Gorges
Project; granting of tax breaks to land development and
businesses launched by resettled farmers, and contribution of a
certain proportion of revenues from power generation by the
project to the resettlement fund.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, initiated in December 1993 and
striding Hubei province and Chongqing municipality in central and
southwestern China, will submerged 6.32 million sq km of land, and
the population to be relocated is expected to hit 1.2 million
eventually.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Education to Combat Drug Abuse Among Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese public
security official has called for more education of young people to
combat a serious drug problem.
</P>
<P>
Bai Jingfu, vice minister of Public Security, said in a recent
interview that large-scale educational campaigns need to be
launched among young people and that the program should begin with
students in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Bai, who is also deputy director of China's National Narcotics
Control Commission, said China has 520,000 drug addicts, 80
percent of whom are young people and teenagers.
</P>
<P>
"Having opened China as an international drug-trafficking route
since the 1980s, some drug-smuggling rings are now developing
China as a drug consumption market by luring young people into the
habit," Bai said.
</P>
<P>
Teenagers are curious and have little social experience, he
said, which makes them the most vulnerable. Bai added that "some
of them are just seeking stimulation or trying to be trendy."
</P>
<P>
He warned of the dangers of drugs and the difficulty of
shaking the habit. He said most addicts are remorseful and many of
them have had their future ruined.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to start telling young people, especially
school students, of the dangers of drug addiction," Bai
said. "Drug education should be a required course in school."

<HEADLINE> Arab League's Chief Denounces Israeli Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
22-member Arab League Ahmad Esmat Abdul-Meguid denounced Israel
for its hardline stand in the Middle East peace process here today.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that Israel's current policies and activities are
not "capable of promoting the peace process," instead, its
obstinacy in its ideas and religion will "put the region to the
edge of a danger gap."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his opening speech at a United Arab
Emirates (UAE)-organized three-day symposium which opened here
today under the title "the future of Arab states and the role of
the Arab League."
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's current policies are based on "taking
everything" instead of "giving anything," and such a stand has
opened the door for violence and deteriorated the situation in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Meguid called on the international community, particularly the
two Mideast peace co-sponsors of the United States and Russia, to
take measures against the Israeli policies of "the expansion of
Jewish settlement in Arab lands and the violation of Arab rights."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was stalled after Israel began
the construction of a Jewish settlement in March in Arab East
Jerusalem which the Palestinians want to be the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Despite world criticism, Israel refused to stop the
implementation of the settlement plan, which has caused violent
disputes between Israel and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> HK to Install Computerized Mapping System for  Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tourists to Hong Kong can
literally have at their fingertips the latest information on
hotels, restaurants, shopping and scenic spots in town when a
computerized map inquiry system is in place early next year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Lands Department of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China said today that the system
would integrate advanced Internet map technology to provide a
high-technology tourism facility in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"A number of display kiosks will be installed at popular
tourist locations such as Mass Transit Railway stations and the
airport," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Inside the kiosk will be a computer terminal. Through a digital
location map on the screen, a tourist can gain access to a wealth
of information including sightseeing, shopping, hotel and dining
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the traditional maps, the system will also furnish an
inquirer with interesting photographs and videos relating to the
selected places or events.
</P>
<P>
A useful feature is the link-up with the WonderNet Website of
the Hong Kong Tourist Association from which hotel room rates and
facilities can be retrieved and reservation made, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The map will also be able to perform some intelligent
geographical search of special facilities such as post offices,
police stations, and shopping places within a five-minute's walk
from where the tourist is. A convenient traveling route to the
destination will also be suggested.
</P>
<P>
The tourist information will be available to all Internet users
worldwide. This will certainly be of interest to prospective
tourists and help them plan their sightseeing routes before
arriving in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the system is targeted primarily at tourists, it will
also be available for use by the general public and the access to
the system is free, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, the system
will be set up by the Survey and Mapping Office (SMO) of the Lands
Department with the assistance of the Hong Kong Tourist
Association.
</P>
<P>
The SMO will regularly update the data bank to take account of
the rapid changing relief and topography of land.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Falls Below 4 Percent Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation fell below the four percent mark to 3.97 percent for the
week ended October 18 despite an increase in railway freight
charges during the week, Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, inflation in the previous week was 4.13 percent
and that in the corresponding week last year 6.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fall in inflation is mainly due to a decline in the primary
food articles, which eased by 0.5 percent during the week under
review.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) for "all
commodities" (base 1981-82=100) fell by 0.1 percent to 329.8
during the week from 330.1 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Economists here have suggested that the low level of inflation
may be due to slackening of demand in the economy, which is quite
evident from the slow movement in the prices of "manufactured
products" in the country.

<HEADLINE> New US Bill Worries Indian Software Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indian software industry
has expressed serious concern over a bill in the US Congress
which, if enacted, would affect the country's software exports to
the United States, Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The bill, seeking to amend the immigration and nationality act
of the US, would increase the financial and administrative costs
of hiring Indian software professionals, according to India's
National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM).
</P>
<P>
"The United States is the biggest market for Indian software
exports. The increased burden placed on a US company when hiring
an Indian professional would hamper the free flow of software
trade between India and the US," NASSCOM Executive Director Dewang
Mehta said.
</P>
<P>
In the event of the proposed bill being made into law, the
projected software export of one billion dollars to the United
States is expected to be hit sharply, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The bill is discriminatory in nature. India's competitive
advantage in software would be stifled by these kind of non-tariff
barriers being put up by developed countries," Mehta asserted.

<HEADLINE> Moves for New Sanction on Nigeria Defeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria escaped from fresh
sanctions, including visa restrictions and an oil embargo, at the
just-concluded 25th session of the Lome Convention's joint
assembly in Togo.
</P>
<P>
A resolution on it fell through when the European Union (EU)
and member countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific
Association (ACP) could not reach an agreement on the proposed
measures, the Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the Nigerian delegation to the
meeting, 35 EU member countries voted against the resolution
introduced by a British parliamentarian, while three voted for it
with two abstentions.
</P>
<P>
On the ACP side, the statement added, 21 countries voted
against the resolution while 15 voted for it with two
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The rules of the joint assembly provide that both sides must
agree on any motion or resolution before it is adopted.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the two groups voted separately on the
resolution after an agreement to adopt a proposal for a secret
ballot proposed by the EU members.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, the statement explained, would have imposed
visa restrictions on Nigerian government officials and oil
embargo, frozen the assets of government officials and their
families, and ensured the re-allocation of uncommitted resources,
frozen two years ago, meant for the country to other ACP members.
</P>
<P>
It would also have provided for the publication, by EU member
states, of the list of arms export to Nigeria as well as
jeopardized the chances of participation of the country's
national football team -- the Super Eagle, in the France World
Cup by denying the players visas.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been under sanctions including visa restrictions
on government officials and arms embargo imposed by EU member
countries and other countries including the United States and
Canada due to alleged human rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth last Monday decided to extend the two-year
suspension of Nigeria's membership due to an end this month for
another year, as a means to put pressure on the country's
transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The hostility of its traditional friends in the West has
forced Nigeria to turn to the East for new friends.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development has been witnessed in recent years in the
relations between Nigeria and some Asian countries, including
Malaysia, China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

educators are making joint efforts to promote the application of
information technology on teaching and learning in secondary and
primary schools.

<HEADLINE> Australia Takes Measures Against Drugs Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
today launched his government's response to the drugs menace -- a
three-year campaign aimed at halting the tide of narcotics
flooding the country.
</P>
<P>
The 87.5 million Australian dollar (61 million US dollar)
campaign is also aimed at funding education, research and the
reintegration of drug users into the community.
</P>
<P>
"My government wants to prevent a new generation of drug users
and addicts in Australia," Howard told a Sydney press conference
early today, Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The three-year campaign, which Howard stressed was just the
start, will tackle drugs on three fronts. The main thrust will be
an assault on the multi-billion dollar drug trade.
</P>
<P>
With figures showing 634 Australians died last year from
heroin-related deaths and 300,000 more were using the drug, Howard
was keen to point out the strategy intended to achieve a balance
between tackling importers and distributors and dealing with
problems on the street.
</P>
<P>
Improved drug education in schools, treatment for users and
funding for new research were included in the package.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he wanted to work in partnership with the states
and territories, no matter what differences they had on other
issues, and "with parents, teachers, volunteers and community
organizations and health workers to develop a plan to take us into
the next century".

<HEADLINE> UN Urged to Send Neutral Experts to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian dailies today urged
the United Nations not to be the instrument of the United States
and to send neutral experts to inspect the Iraqi arms
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News said that "Baghdad
claims that 10 Americans and a 40-member inspection team are
busy gathering intelligence in Iraq, and due to the orientation
of the American administration we cannot disregard the Iraqi
allegations."
</P>
<P>
The daily said that all nations must fully support the
U.N. Security Council's efforts and call for destruction of
long-range missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical
weapons, not only in Iraq, but also across the globe.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the inspection in Iraq, the 10 Americans can easily
be replaced by experts from neutral countries so that neither
Iraq nor the U.S. can use this issue as an excuse to fan flames
of another crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
Another daily The English-language Tehran Times said that it
is the credibility of the U.N. which is at stake and it should
not become an instrument in the hands of the U.S. for achieving
its objectives.
</P>
<P>
With the Middle East peace process in virtual deadlock, the
U.S., as the main sponsor of the process, is trying to buy time
as a face-saving device to restore its credibility as the
mediator, the paper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that the U.S. is trying to shift the
center of the crisis from Tel Aviv to Baghdad for sometime to
find a solution for the deadlock, it said.
</P>
<P>
These developments, coupled with the disappointment of Arab
countries with the outcome of the peace process, have created a
new atmosphere in the region, undermining U.S. status as the real
protector of regional security, the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that although Iran supports implementation of the
U.N. resolutions on Iraq, both the U.S. and U.N. must give up
their double standard approaches and policies as they threaten
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
If U.N. resolutions are to be implemented, it should apply to
all U.N. resolutions and not just to those on Iraq alone, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has announced that it would bar Americans from serving
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which is inspecting mass
destructive weapons programs of Iraq. The decision caused a new
round of confrontation between Iraq and Western countries.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today described his informal meeting with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto in Krasnoyarsk as "a real breakthrough" in
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said at a joint news conference after the summit that a
Yeltsin-Hashimoto plan was the main outcome of today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages the strengthening of cooperation between the
two countries and comprises a number of points which provide a
real basis for partnership, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto described the meeting as an excellent start into the
next century, the agency said in a dispatch from Krasnoyarsk, a
Far East city of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders agreed to do their best to conclude a peace treaty
between Russia and Japan by the year 2000, based on the October
1993 Tokyo declaration.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Yeltsin during the meeting that Tokyo was
accepting Moscow's proposal to insure trade deals with Russia
against the guarantees of private Russian Banks and to lower the
insurance premiums for trade transactions with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian Vice-Premier Boris Nemtsov was cited as saying that the
Japanese Prime Minister personally came out with such an
initiative for the first time in the history of the
Russian-Japanese relations.

<HEADLINE> d p s 2162 China-Three Gorges-Residents Relocation Preliminary Success Scored in Three Gorges Resettlement Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 90,000
local residents are expected to move out of the reservoir area of
the Three Gorges Project by the end of this year, leading to a
favorable start of the massive resettlement drive.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project will relocate 1.2 million residents in
the 1,084 sq km-reservoir area, since the reservoir is expected to
inundate more than 630 sq km of land behind the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China will inject approximately 100 billion yuan
into the relocation of the reservoir residents by the year 2009
when the whole project is completed.
</P>
<P>
"The State appropriations into the resettlement endeavor have
been on a steady rise, from the 300 million yuan in 1993, to 2.8
billion yuan this year. And the sum will increase continuously in
the future," according to an official with the Bureau of
Resettlement and Development under the Three Gorges Project
Construction Commission.
</P>
<P>
Along with the resettlement drive, the State also plans to
invest more than 20 billion yuan on the upgrading of local
infrastructure and construction of major industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
"In many areas surrounding the Three Gorges Project site, the
annual state investment at present is equivalent to, or even
exceeds the combined total in the past 40-plus years," said the
resettlement official.
</P>
<P>
State preferential policies, on the other hand, enabled the
Three Gorges Reservoir Area to open itself wider to the outside
world and may have more far-reaching positive impact on its future
development, added the official.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New System Enforcing Traffic Law Developed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli company has
developed a new effective computerized system that can help
police catch violators of traffic laws, the Jerusalem Post daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Telem system, developed by Tracon Systems, is based on
metal sensor tracks laid across a road and attached to a computer
and video camera.
</P>
<P>
The new system is different from existing computerized
law-enforcement systems based on electronmagnetic radiation. The
Technion said the new system can detect the speed and
acceleration rate of vehicles passing between bands of metal.
</P>
<P>
Telem can also detect a vehicle's passing over a solid white
line into oncoming traffic, a frequent cause of accidents, failing
to stop at a red light, a stop sign or crosswalks, and driving on
the road shoulder.
</P>
<P>
A digital camera automatically records the number of the
vehicle that has violated the law and transmits the data to the
police's central computer, human hands are not involved in the
process.
</P>
<P>
Within 10 minutes, a printed report and bill for the fine is
sent to the violator's address. Tracon Systems said Telem
operates day or night, in any type of weather. And the price is
relatively low compared to other road surveillance systems and
requires only minimal maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Due to its simplicity, exactness, low cost and automatic
enforcement of a large number of violations, Israeli police has
expressed interest in applying the new systems on the country's
main roads in order to check the increasing problems of car
accidents, that have cost more 500 lives so far this year in the
country with a population of only 57 million.

<HEADLINE> Flamingo Population Reduced in Kenya's Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The flamingo population has
failed to build up to more than half a million in Lake Nakuru of
Kenya for the past several years, the Sunday Nation today quoted
conservationists as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the famous lesser flamingo lingered below
50,000 by the beginning of the year and had not built beyond
300,000 even after the heavy rains in May and June.
</P>
<P>
Lake Nakuru, about 160 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, used
to host 1.5 million flamingoes, more than half of the lesser
flamingo population in the entire east African region.
</P>
<P>
Flamingoes have turned the Lake Nakuru National Park one of
the leading tourist attractions in the east African country which
receives about 200,000 local and foreign tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the number of flamingoes is described as a
symptom of a deep-seated ecological crisis unfolding in the lake
area, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The lake has markedly lowered volume of water than ever
recorded in the last eight years and had witnessed severe water
recession during the dry seasons in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The water recession had resulted in disrupting the complex
food chain of biomass and diversity of species in the lake
established over a long period.
</P>
<P>
According to conservationists, most affected have been the
lower animals and plants like algae, molluses, cruslacea and
insect larvae which serve as food for massive flamingoes in the
lake.
</P>
<P>
For example, conservationists said, the chironomous fly larvae
and tilapia grahami fishes which used to exist in millions have
disappeared from Lake Nakuru yet the fly served as a critical
food resources to many birds and invertebrate animals.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists suspect that the newly-built Nakuru Sewerage
Rehabilitation Project could have contributed very significantly
to the reduction of nutrient loads flowing into the lake, leading
to low primary productivity and subsequently weak food chain.
</P>
<P>
But they pointed out that the real danger for the lake's
survival was now being posed by the massive destruction of
forests in critical water catchment areas where more than 20,000
families have been settled.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Impact of Southeast Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Four months ago, when the Thai
financial crisis swiftly spread to the rest of Southeast Asia, it
caught almost everybody by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Four months later, when the spill-over effect of the fallout
reached beyond Southeast Asia, it, again, nearly caught everybody
off guard.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis entered its fifth month, Southeast Asian
currencies have already depreciated between 10 percent and over 35
percent, the regional economic growth has slowed own, and price
hikes, lay-offs, bankruptcies have often hit headlines of national
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, stock markets in other parts of Asia, and in the
pacific, Western Europe and America have experienced ups and downs
in recent weeks because of the negative effects of Southeast
Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
How great is the impact of the crisis on the regional and the
world economy? No body seems to be able to answer the question
with assurance at the present stage of the crisis, and no body
knows for sure when the crisis will be over.
</P>
<P>
Only one thing is certain: the extent of the impact has
confounded most businessmen, investors and economists.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, the four-month old crisis has created a
great deal of political and economic uncertainties. Demonstrations
and protests against price increases, lay-offs and falling living
standards have triggered political instability in some countries.
</P>
<P>
Due to the unexpected extent of the damage to the region,
economists hesitate to predict whether the economies of Thailand,
The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia would pick up in the
short-term or in the medium-term.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the
recent turmoil in his country's financial markets has set back by
10 years his efforts to turn the nation into a developed country
by 2020.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the crisis, Asian Development Bank
economists estimated recently that the real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth in the region will decelerate further from 7.4 in
1996 to between 4.9 percent and 5.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate range for 1998 is between 4 percent
and 5.5 percent, and for 1999 it is between 5.2 percent and 6.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
If the estimates are to be proved correct, the growth rates
would be the lowest for the region in a decade.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the economy could only expand between 1.6 percent
and 1.9 percent this year, and 2 percent to 2.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the crisis, inflation in the region is projected
to rise from 6.6 percent in 1996 to 9 percent this year. Next
year's inflation rate is likely to rise by 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown in Southeast Asia has cut down the
average growth rate for developing Asian economies from 7.5
percent in 1996 to a range of 6.1 percent to 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for the Asian economy in 1998 has been forecast
between 5.3 percent and 6.2 percent, also the lowest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
In addition to developing Asian economies, the worst hit
country will probably be Japan, whose bank lending to Southeast
Asia accounts for about 60 percent of foreign lendings to the
region. The Japanese banks' lending exposure to Thailand alone is
almost 40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis will make Southeast Asian banks more
difficult to repay their debts, as they too are suffering from
mounting non-performing loans, which will peak at 73 billion
dollars in Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
Singapore Through 1998.
</P>
<P>
Because of the inter-linking of the global economy, the
Southeast Asian crisis could hamper economic growth in other parts
of the world. While only 7 percent of European Union exports go
directly to Asia, European firms have been pushing hard for a
bigger share of the fast-growing markets in recent years, but
their efforts have been clearly hampered by the slowdown in
several Asian economies caused by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
German carmaker BMW has seen sales in Thailand tumbled 47
percent in the first nine months of this year and is now facing a
sharp increase in import duties in Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The sharp devaluation of Southeast Asian currencies will make
their goods cheaper abroad, and European companies will have to
cut their prices to cope with cheaper Asian products.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies will also be affected because some 15 percent of
their exports go to Asia, economists said.
</P>
<P>
French experts warned that an Asian-wide crisis could wipe 0.1
to 0.2 percentage points off French GDP.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as the crisis is continuing in Southeast Asia,
its full impact on the regional and world economy is still
unpredictable, economists said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Attorney General Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Attorney General George
Chilupe resigned on Saturday and President Frederick Chiluba
accepted the resignation, Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
State House spokesman Richard Sakala confirmed the resignation
but declined to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
But sources told the local newspaper that it was the president
who asked the attorney general to resign after some "legal
problems were noticed in the privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)."
</P>
<P>
A total of nine units are to be privatized under the ZCCM and
so far four units have been sold. Kansanshi mine was sold on
competitive tender basis to Cyprus Amax of the United States for
28 million U.S. dollars. The sale raised concern when some miners
lamented that it was undervalued.
</P>
<P>
Chilupe, who participated in the privatization of a number of
companies, is said to have been summoned by Chiluba to explain a
number of issues and was later told to resign, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Chilupe was appointed attorney general on July 23, 1995 to take
over from Ali Hamir after the latter's contract expired.

<P>
 economists have suggested that low level of inflation may
be due to slackening of demand in the economy, which is quite
evident from the slow movement in the prices of +manufactured
products+.
</P>
<P>
 prices of manufactured products increased by just 2.72
per cent during the year compared to 3.26 per cent for
+primary articles+ and 12.23 per cent for +fuel, power, light
and lubricants+.
</P>
<P>
 had it not been for the increase in administered prices
of items like petroleum products and power during the year,
the inflation would have been even lower.
</P>
<P>
 however, the national council for applied economic
research (ncaer) has predicted that the inflation would pick
up in the second half of the current fiscal and is likely to
end the year with an average inflation of six per cent.
</P>
<P>
 on a comparable basis, the inflation based on consumer
price index for industrial workers (cpi-iw) for august
remained at 4.7 per cent as against 3.9 per cent based on wpi
during the same month.

COLOMBO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Air Force

today.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements were put on this week's Daily News, an English

the headline: "Lady pilots, there is a place in the sky for women
too."
</P>
<P>
Air Force Chief Air Marshal Oliver Ranasinghe was quoted by
local press reports as saying the SLAF needs to recruit at least
100 more pilots by January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the SLAF has tried its utmost in the last six
months to recruit men to fill the vacancies, loading government
and independent newspapers, in both Sinhala and English, with
color ads, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the SLAF has decided to recruit
women.
</P>
<P>
The sources said those recruited will first be posted in
surveillance and transport planes, as flight engineers, and then
co-pilots.
</P>
<P>
It will be at least two years before they will be able to take
command of aircraft as pilots, and only then they may be allowed
to pilot Israeli Kfir jets or Ukranian Mi-24 attack helicopters,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The SLAF has lost 19 planes and helicopters, including four
warplanes and attack helicopters, in the past two and a half
years.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the SLAF has employed women only in ground roles,
mainly for office work.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Continues Boycotting Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The seventh session of the
Bangladeshi Parliament is set to begin this afternoon in the
absence of lawmakers from the main opposition party, as all moves
to break the current stand-off failed.
</P>
<P>
The latest initiative of Speaker Rashid Chowdhury also failed
on Saturday as the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
leaders turned down his invitation to attend a luncheon meeting
with the ruling party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP representatives refused to attend a meeting
of the Business Advisory Committee of the House on Saturday,
Parliament Secretariat sources said. The meeting was attended by
the ruling Awami (people's) League and other opposition parties --
Jatiya (national) Party and Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
The BNP lawmakers started boycott of parliament from its last
autumn session on August 30 and made their return to the House
conditional to fulfillment of their demands for proportional
representation on parliamentary committees and an end to what they
said government repression on the BNP party leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
The government, while agreeing to discuss the issues inside the
House, announced that the parliamentary committees would be formed
soon even in the absence of BNP members as the House would remain
ineffective without the parliamentary committees.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the present session is expected to deal
with some burning issues like a peace accord on the
insurgency-torn Chittagong Hill Tracts, which was billed by the
BNP as "betraying the country's independence and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
But the session would become more irrelevant if the BNP
lawmakers remain outside the parliament chamber.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exports Uncompetitive Against S.E. Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian exporters are being
rendered uncompetitive against rivals from Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore and Indonesia due to the recent devaluation of the
currencies of these Southeast Asian countries, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study by the Indian Institute of Foreign
Trade, India stands to lose on account of devaluation of the Thai
baht since the export basket of both countries are similar.
</P>
<P>
But India need not bother about devaluation of the Philippines
peso as the export structures of the two countries are highly
dissimilar, the study said.
</P>
<P>
India's exports would become less competitive by about 15
percent than Thai and Indonesian exports, 10 percent against
Malaysia and the Philippines, and only three percent against
Singapore, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
After a detailed analysis of the depreciation of the currencies
of Southeast Asian countries against the U.S. dollar, the study
has concluded that India would be worst affected in the case of
food products and manufactured goods.

<P>
ANKARA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Greek prime
ministers are expected to meet amid simmering tensions between the
two countries, while attending a summit of the southeastern
European countries in Greece next week.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz will meet his Greek
counterpart Costas Simitis at the two-day summit of Balkan leaders
scheduled to start on the Greek island of Crete Monday, Turkish
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and State Ministers Rifat
Serdaroglu and Cavit Kavak will accompany Yilmaz during his visit

</P>
<P>
Leaders from Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Yugoslavia and
Macedonia will attend the summit sponsored by Greece to discuss
regional economic cooperation, security and stability, good
neighborhood relations, relations with European Union and North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the role of the Balkans on
the international forum and the expansion of European institutions.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and Greece have been worsening
since the Cypriot government announced that it will not give up
the controversial plan to buy 150 kilometer-range anti-aircraft
S-300 missiles from Russia. Meanwhile, Greece accused Turkey of
numerous violations of its air space.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has threatened to take steps to ensure Cyprus not to
deploy the S-300 missiles, while Athens pledged to help Cyprus if
it is militarily attacked.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, station troops in Cyprus,
which has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since when Turkish troops invaded
and took the northern third of the island in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Final Bidding for Seven Major Projects End in S. Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Final Bidding for seven major
construction projects in South Sri Lanka has ended, a spokeswoman
for the Southern Development Authority (SDA) said today.
</P>
<P>
She said a technical evaluation committee will be called in
soon and companies which are bidding for the projects will make
their presentations by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The projects include an international sea port at Hambantota,
an oil refinery near the port, an international airport 18 km
north of the port, diversions of the Uma Oya River and the Menik
Ganga River, a power plant, a highway and an electrified railway.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the projects is estimated to cost two
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 companies participated in the bidding but only
seven of them entered the last round of bidding on Friday, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She said each of the seven companies is bidding for more than
one projects.
</P>
<P>
The Hambantota sea port project attracted more than half of the
bidders, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hambantota is considered to be an ideal location for a port
because it offers the least deviation on the main sea line,
shipping experts said. It also has a natural deep water basin and
a deep draught close to the shore, allowing big ships to come in.
</P>
<P>
The SDA was set up by the government to oversee development of
the long-neglected south, which has rich untapped natural
resources as well as an educated workforce.
</P>
<P>
The government is keen to accelerate development of the region
where unemployment levels are higher than the national average.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Industry Faces Fierce Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Surging demand and anticipated
fierce international competition are prompting China's chemical
industry to chart its course for growth as the 21st century nears,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) of the
Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) which is being drawn up covers
five priority sectors-- agrichemicals, petrochemicals, fine
chemicals, rubber processing and chemical projects related to
energy-efficiency and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
A MCI statement said the drafting of the plan is in line with
four principles in selecting processes: sectors and products that
fall short of demand sharply but have a large market potential;
sectors and products that are vital to the national economy but in
short supply; sectors and products with high technology content;
and sectors and products that are expected to be good candidates
for export.
</P>
<P>
MCI minister Gu Xiulian urged the enterprises operating under
its umbrella to form alliances to combat increasing challenges
both from joint ventures and foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
She also suggested that a broad sales network and concentrated
system for materials procurement be established to link the
related industrial sectors together.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, the total output of
the industry increased a year-on-year 8.7 percent. Exports jumped
up 20.3 percent from the first nine months in 1996 to enable the
trade deficit in the industry to fall 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that sales of the industry will hit 300 billion
yuan this year, and profits will reach 2 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Developed Nations Urged to Lead in Greenhouse Gas Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed that developed
countries should play a leading role in reducing greenhouse gases,
a Thai environment official said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN environment ministers have met in Indonesia recently,
urging developed countries to honor their commitments rather than
trying to force developing countries to cut back greenhouse gas
emissions, Wanee Samphantharak, deputy secretary-general of the
environment policy and planning office, told reporters over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The cost for cutting back greenhouse gas emissions would be too
high for developing countries, Wanee said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official noted that ASEAN countries including
Thailand have agreed to reduce greenhouse gases on a voluntary
basis.
</P>
<P>
Suvit Yodmanee of the United Nations Environment Program also
said that it would be difficult to force developing countries to
cut greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries were the main sources of greenhouse
gases because of their decades of industrial development, Suvit
noted.
</P>
<P>
Every country should make efforts to help reduce greenhouse
gases, but developed countries should play a leading role, Suvit
said.

<HEADLINE> Rate Cut Good for Renminbi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The latest interest rate cut
will help China prevent international speculators from taking
advantage of rate differences between the yuan and foreign
currencies, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
As the interest rate of the country's one-year term deposits
dropped to 5.67 percent, there is only a 0.5 percentage gap
between the yuan and the interest rate of the US dollar, said Tao
Liming, director of the Institute of International Finance of the
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the yuan and US dollar was more than two
percentage points before the rate was cut. As the yuan's exchange
rate against the US dollar has remained stable the past three
years, the recent large gap resulted in some unbalanced fund flow
to currencies with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Tao said that easing the influx of foreign speculative funds
will help somewhat relieve the strong appreciation pressures on
the renminbi.
</P>
<P>
He said an over-strong renminbi will adversely affect the
competitiveness of Chinese exporters. If the country's exports
drop, the operation of some State-owned enterprises and the
overall economic development would also be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
And if appreciation pressure on the renminbi become too strong,
the central bank will be forced to issue more yuan to stabilize
the exchange rate, which could undermine the stability of the
bank's monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Tao said that China can avoid the currency upheaval that hit
southeast Asian countries last summer as China has not released
its foreign exchange control over capital accounts and also enjoys
a more favorable macro-economic situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
launch an emergency program to provide safe drinking water to
people in 200 of the villages worst affected by arsenic
contamination of ground water, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The program will cover 22 southwestern districts where people
have been identified with "symptoms of chronic arsenic poisoning."
</P>
<P>
The six-month program will serve as a model one and a long-term
program will be formulated to address the "national disaster,"
declared by the government in May.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-financed 300,000 U.S. dollar program will implemented
jointly by government agencies and some local non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,800 confirmed cases of arsenicosis across the
country and a large number of people in at least 60 districts are
at risk.
</P>
<P>
Experts said arsenicosis causes malonosis and that the ultimate
result is tissue mutation which may cause cancer, but not in all
cases.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic contamination of ground water was first detected in
Bangladesh in August last year.

<HEADLINE> CCPIT to Develop New Trade Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) will do more to diversify
the country's foreign trade and serve all the firms in China,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Central America, South America, the Gulf Region and Africa will
be the focus of CCPIT's promotion work, said Yu Xiaosong, the new
CCPIT chairman and also chairman of the China Chamber of
International Commerce (CCOIC).
</P>
<P>
He said China's trade with those regions makes up less than two
percent of the total trade volume for the areas. Therefore, great
market potential remains to be tapped, the new chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Promotion work in Central America is especially needed, as
China has not established diplomatic ties with most of the Central
American countries, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He said CCPIT will present Chinese commodity fairs in Panama
and South Africa this month.
</P>
<P>
As for trade across the Taiwan Straits, Yu said CCPIT will do
more exchange work with Taiwan to help realize direct shipping,
postal and commercial links.
</P>
<P>
He urged Taiwan authorities to re-consider their restrictive
policies about across-the-straits trade and Taiwan investment in
the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Yu said a CCPIT delegation, headed by Vice-Chairman An
Chengxin, will visit Taiwan in December.
</P>
<P>
As for serving enterprises in China, CCPIT and CCOIC will face
more challenges as trade liberalization progresses, the chairman
said.
</P>
<P>
Not counting foreign trade houses, more than 6,000
manufacturers and research institutes, and about 140,000
foreign-funded enterprises, have been granted foreign trade rights.
</P>
<P>
China also promised to consolidate the foreign trade
registration system, replacing the present approval system, by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, CCPIT and CCOIC will have to work harder to
establish relations with tens of thousands of enterprises in the
country and provide better services for them, Yu said.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Myanmar to Develop Downstream Wood Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- the Myanmar timber authorities
are making efforts to gradually phase out log sales in the coming
years and develop its downstream industries for value-added
products.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) under the
Ministry of Forestry, plans to convert saw mills into integrated
industries to produce a combination of high value sawn timber and
downstream value-added products, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
More furniture and moulding factories will also be set up to
make maximum use of the semi-finished products from the upstream
industries.
</P>
<P>
As an initial move towards going downstream, the MTE is
cooperating with foreign companies in establishing direct
investment or joint ventures to turn out value-added products.
</P>
<P>
Seven foreign firms from China, France, South Korea, Malaysia,
Norway and Thailand have signed business agreements with the MTE,
setting up plywood, moulding and furniture factories in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Domestic private companies in the manufacturing business buy
logs and sawn timber from the MTE for further processing and
distribution of their products in the domestic market and for
export.
</P>
<P>
The MTE is the sole organization allowed to extract timber out
of forests in Myanmar and it undertakes logging, transportation,
milling, processing, distribution of products within the country,
and exportation.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to stop the export of teak and other hardwood
logs, Myanmar plans to establish two international-level
wood-based industry zones in the capital of Yangon to boost the
manufacture of value-added finished wood products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also plans to undertake the projects for introducing
Myanmar's lesser-used timber species to the world market and
upgrading production efficiency in furniture manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's hardwood export in
the 1996-97 fiscal year ending March was 209,137 cubic meters,
while the export of teak was 196,260 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The country's export of forest products amounted to 218 million
U.S. dollars in 1996-97, accounting for 24.4 percent of the total
export, second only to the export of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs and bans the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
Forest Law in 1992. However, export of value-added wood products
is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with forests covering about
51 percent of its land area. The country has been planting 37,260
hectares of forest annually since the 1992-93 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The total area of forest plantations established from 1963 to
1996 has reached 524,000 hectares, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two New Zealand firms have been carrying out pilot
projects on tree plantations in Myanmar's Shan state since early
last year and a Japan-based non-governmental organization, the
Organization for industrial, Spiritual and Cultural
Advancement-International, also plans to establish agro-forests in
the country's Magway division.

<HEADLINE> Major Economic Briefs from Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Following are major briefs
from the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Industry ministers of Mercosur member countries
signed agreements here on Tuesday on further promoting the trade
of industrial products inside the bloc under fair competition.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was forged during the first meeting of Mercosur
industry ministers, who discussed issues such as the juridical
framework for the association of enterprises, the integration
committees between departments, states and provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to focus more on the quality of industrial
products and to coordinate certification systems in a bid to
strengthen competition in the markets outside the region.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Mercosur countries decided to create
intergovernmental commissions to fight the dengue, hantavirus and
Chagas malady plaguing the region as well as emergency situation
caused by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on October 29 during a meeting held in
Montevideo by Public Health ministers of Mercosur countries --
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and the regional bloc's
associated members of Bolivia and Chile.
</P>
<P>
GUANACASTE, Costa Rica -- Mercosur countries voiced
satisfaction over the results of the preparatory meeting for the
negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) that
ended here on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Perez del Castillo said
on behalf of the Mercosur that the bloc's positions were accepted,
but some important themes are still pending. They are subject to
discussions starting next year.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur also expressed special interest in bringing up the
agriculture theme, and backed Rio de Janeiro, of Brazil, as a
candidate for the site of the FTAA secretariat.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Presidents of Mercosur countries will meet for
the 13th time on December 15 to discuss relations between the
Mercosur and the FTAA, said the Uruguayan provisional presidency.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will also try to finalize trade liberalization
agreements with Mexico, Venezuela and other Andean countries at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Mercosur countries and those of the Andean
Community failed at a three-day meeting starting October 29 to
prepare a free trade agreement scheduled for signing before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Main obstacles include the definitions for the terms of tariff
exemptions and the drafting of a list of "sensitive" products
between the two blocs.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur countries and Andean Community members decided to
restart their talks two weeks later in Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Mercosur will start negotiations with Canada
on a juridical framework of economic cooperation, said Uruguayan
Foreign Minister Alvaro Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The minister, now on a visit to Canada, confirmed that there is
political interest on the part of Canada to approach the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
"They have handed us a juridical framework project and we are
going to submit it to the consideration of the Mercosur organs to
arrive at a definitive common position on the matter," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Pensions Agreement Paves Way for 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government reached an
agreement with trade unions today to save 4 trillion lire (about
2.3 billion U.S. dollars) from the national pensions program.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still an agreement in principle, the latest move
is hailed by observers here as the removal of a major hurdle to
the approval of the government's 1998 budget plan.
</P>
<P>
While the two sides are working on details of the measure, the
government is expected to file an amendment of welfare expenditure
to the financial bill for 1998 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unions will endorse the overall cost reduction agreement,
crucial for Italy's entry into the single European currency union,
when it is approved by union members.
</P>
<P>
Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Communist Refoundation, said
he believed that the agreement will lead to a reduction in
disparities of pension treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Cofferati, of the Cgil labor federation, said the
document provides a "fair solution" defending workers and giving
stability to the pension system.

<HEADLINE> Crisis May Spur Global Depression: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The massive loss of confidence
in the global capital market could lead to worldwide economic
depression unless the economic and currency crisis in Southeast
Asia is properly addressed, a Thai economist said.
</P>
<P>
Somkiat Osotsapa, an economist at Thailand's Chulalongkorn
University, said a crisis in one region could affect markets all
over the world because economies have become more globally
integrated.
</P>
<P>
Since the July 2 Thai baht floatation, the Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah have tumbled along with the
baht, and Indonesia has also had to accept an International
Monetary Fund rescue package.
</P>
<P>
The contagion has spread to East Asia, causing the South Korean
won to plunge. The Hong Kong dollar is also under pressure from
money speculators.
</P>
<P>
"When the baht broke through the 40 baht to the dollar barrier,
it entered into a free fall which Thailand by itself cannot stop,
which will cause Southeast Asian currencies to fall further,
inflicting serious damage to economies across the region," Somkiat
was quoted as saying by the local press.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the baht could sink to 50 to the dollars, a 100
percent drop in value from the pre-float era. Regional problems
could also affect Japanese multinational corporations and banks
which have invested heavily in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Somkiat predicted that the problem would spread to other
financial markets if Japanese firms repatriate their funds to help
their subsidiaries in Southeast Asia stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
One could imagine the damage to the U.S. financial sector, the
dollar's strength and real economic health if the Japanese give up
their stock and bond holdings in the U.S., as America is the
world's biggest debtor nation with debts estimated at 860 billion
dollars, most of it owed to Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trouble in Asia will certainly hurt U.S. exports to the region,
lead to the slowdown of corporate earning and then damage the U.S.
stock and banking sectors, he said. European exports to Asia would
also drop and EU corporations in the region could not escape
without losing, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Europe have to take seriously the bailout of the
Southeast Asian region by offering enough funds and markets open
to import products, in order to prevent the problem from getting
out of hand," Somkiat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should also consider opening its markets to more
exports from the region and support the creation of the Asian
Monetary Fund as well as increase regulation on hedge funds which
destabilize regional currencies, Somkiat said.

<HEADLINE> China's State Sector May Open to Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- China's troublesome state
sector is likely to open to foreign investment, according to
today's Business Weekly of the Beijing-based English newspaper
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government is weighing policies allowing foreign
investors to merge, lease or buy out China's medium and small
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are showing great interest in China's ongoing
reforms of its state sector, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The participation of foreign investors in reforming the State
sector will help improve Chinese firms' management and technology,
change their operational mechanism and speed the accretion of
their assets, said Xia Youfu, professor of the Chinese University
of International Business and Economics and president of the Gear
Development Center for International Trade and Investment. He
noted that many of the country's about 100,000 Sino-foreign joint
ventures involve state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
However, Xia cautioned that the State should make appropriete
policies to prevent the negative aspects of such massive
co-operation.

<HEADLINE> Polish New Cabinet Stressing Social Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The new Polish cabinet is
orienting toward a series of social reforms to restructure the
country's health care, education and social security systems.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, appointed by President Alexander
Kwasniewski two weeks ago and operative from Saturday, made his
priorities clear at the first meeting of cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Buzek was quoted as saying by a Polish Press Agency report that
his cabinet would decentralize the country's fiscal process to
separate the state and local controls over public financing.
</P>
<P>
While some authority would be granted to local autonomies, he
said, many state businesses would be privatized to help improve
the industrial output, especially by the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Poland's bid for an early entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) has a priority on
the new cabinet's agenda, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Buzek, of a political coalition winning the parliamentary
election in September, assumed the premiership after his
predecessor Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz resigned on October 17.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Importers Warned of Quality Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Import and Export Commodities Inspection (SACI) has sounded an
alarm for the domestic cotton industry, today's China Daily
reported .
</P>
<P>
SACI has called the attention of business people in the
industry and related authorities to the problems of imported
cotton and measures to curb those problems.
</P>
<P>
According to China's customs statistics, some 460,000 tons of
cotton, worth 808 million US dollars, were imported in the first
half of this year, a 14 percent hike from last year.
</P>
<P>
However, many of those imports have quality or quantity
problems, especially from the United States, SACI said in a
written statement last week.
</P>
<P>
Of the 788 batches of cotton imported in the period, 89 percent
proved to be substandard, which was two percentage points higher
than last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the poor quality, more and more cotton imports are not
as heavy as claimed, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The customs statistics indicate China imported 1.1 million tons
of cotton in the past year and a half. However, only 960,000 tons
were examined by SACI.
</P>
<P>
The problems of imported cotton have greatly hurt the interest
of Chinese cotton farmers and business people, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
SACI suggests that the quality of domestically produced cotton
be upgraded and its distribution network be improved to narrow the
price gap between domestic and foreign cotton.
</P>
<P>
It also advises importers or end-users make clear in their
importing contracts that transactions should be based on SACI's
inspection results and consign the inspection of the imported
cotton to SACT's overseas branches to prevent more losses.

<HEADLINE> Trade Surplus to Shrink in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- China's expected 20 billion US
dollars trade surplus this year will not repeat itself in 1998,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Although China's foreign trade surplus hit 30.6 billion US
dollars in the first three quarters of this year, the imports will
post a moderate growth in the remaining months of this year, which
will not reduce the surplus by a large margin, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Jian, senior researcher under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, next year will witness a
much smaller surplus as a result of China's recent tariff slash,
interest rate cut and the tariff exemption for imports of capital
goods by foreign-funded high-tech firms, expected to be announced
next year.
</P>
<P>
When China's average tariff level was reduced to 17 percent
from 23 percent on October 1, it stimulated imports, and this
effect will be appreciable next year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut, which was announced two weeks ago, will
surely stimulate domestic consumption and investment, and hence
bolster the demand for more imports.
</P>
<P>
Another major incentive for more imports will be the resumption
of free duty on imports of capital goods for high-tech projects,
which would be carried out in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed to China's ongoing technology renovations in
State-owned enterprises and development of the high-tech industry
as major recipients of the increased imports.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, imports of raw materials, such as crude oil
and other natural resources, will grow, as China's production of
those raw materials can not meet the demand of its rapid economic
development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that as the country's bid for admission into the
World Trade Organization progresses, China's import regime will
also be improved, which will be conducive to more imports.

<HEADLINE> Aid to Indonesia Expected to Exceed 37 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The financial aid pledged to
revive confidence in Indonesia's economy could exceed 37 billion
U.S. dollars, sources at the Indonesian Finance Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The assistance comprises 14 billion dollars from Asian
countries and the United States and an International Monetary Fund
(IMF) assistance package valued at 23 billion dollars, said the
sources today.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu and Japan's vice finance
minister Eisuke Sakakibara met with Indonesian Finance Minister
Mar'ie Muhammad here Saturday and pledged to extend up to 5
billion dollars respectively, in stand-by loans, to Indonesia,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Hu and Sakakibara expressed their concern over the excessive
depreciation of the Indonesian currency although Indonesia's
economic fundamentals are sound.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent this
year after being badly hit by the current monetary crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of the financial aid could go up to 38 billion
dollars as Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim has also
pledged one billion dollars in a stand-by loan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is much higher than the 17.2 billion dollars
extended to Thailand, recently hard hit by the currency crisis
that was followed by a worsening political situation at home.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced a reform package on October
31 aimed at restoring a macroeconomic stability badly battered by
the recent monetary and confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform package, the government will slash budget
outlay, curtail monopolies in several food commodities and
liquidate insolvent banks. Indonesia began implementing the reform
package Saturday, with the liquidation of 16 financially troubled
private banks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Arrives in Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin arrived in Los Angeles, California, this afternoon on the
last leg of his nine-day state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jiang flew in from Boston, Massachusetts, where he delivered a
speech at the famous Harvard University before winding up his tour
of the U.S. East.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the Los Angeles International Airport to
greet the Chinese leader were Richard Riordan, mayor of Los
Angeles, Zev Yarolavsky, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors, Lee Grissom, representative of California Governor
Pete Wilson, Fong Sheson, Chinese counsel general in Los Angeles,
and 200 representatives from the local Chinese community. Two
teenagers presented flowers to Jiang and his wife Wang Yeping.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in this largest city on the U.S. west coast,
Jiang is scheduled to meet privately with Governor Wilson and
Mayor Riordan, visit Hughes Electronics Corporation and have
contacts with business executives, Chinese community leaders and
other dignitaries on different occasions.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Jiang were Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, special assistant Zeng Qinghong, Director of
the Foreign Affairs of the State Council Liu Huaqiu, special
assistant Teng Wensheng and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and California have close trade ties with
China. More than a quarter of the U.S. exports to China come from
California, and China currently ranks as California's sixth
largest foreign trade partner.
</P>
<P>
The China market, expected to grow rapidly, imports six billion
U.S. dollars worth of products annually from California, mostly
computers and aerospace equipment. So far this year, California's
exports to China have been up 20 percent, according to the state
Trade and Commerce Agency.
</P>
<P>
This is Jiang's first tour of Los Angeles, a city trying to be
the international trade center for the United States in the 21st
century. He visited San Francisco, also in California, when he was
mayor of Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Technological Boost for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- Unparalleled
technical difficulties used to be a big headache for the ongoing
Three Gorges Project. In solving these difficulties,
high-technology has demonstrated its power.
</P>
<P>
The use of high technology not only saved 4 billion yuan (about
481.9 million U.S. dollars), but also expedited construction
during the past five years, said one project official. The project
so far has involved such a wide range of technological research
and science fields that it could be called a showcase of
high-technology.
</P>
<P>
The official said the project's technological research required
teamwork on an unprecedented scale in such areas as geology,
seismology, structural engineering, hydrology, flood control,
soils engineering, shipping power, mechanical and electrical
engineering, ecology and environmental engineering.
</P>
<P>
Even before the project began, feasibility studies were under
way for almost half a century, the official said, adding that
Chinese scientists have conducted more than 1,800 scientific
research projects during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Although Three Gorges will generate 84.6 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity a year, almost 6.5 times that of the existing
Gezhouba Power Plant, only 20 percent of the manpower required to
build Gezhouba was needed at Three Gorges.

<HEADLINE> d p s 1867 China-Three Gorges-Bidding New Bidding for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges project is expected to purchase more equipment through
international bidding next year, according to a project official
today.
</P>
<P>
Cited as another big deal after the 730 million US
dollar-generator contract concluded last August, it will mainly
include transformers, high-voltage electrical equipment, and
equipment to be used in large-scale power plants, said Li Yong'an,
deputy manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that international commercial loans and export credit
will remain indispensable for the international businesses to win
the contract, and foreign government loans will be "especially
welcome".
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest comprehensive water control project, the
Three Gorges Project is open to bidding in its project
construction, equipment purchase, and management supervision,
according to a company official in charge of the planning for the
project bidding.
</P>
<P>
"We introduced competition mechanism from the very start of the
project, and adopted international conventional methods with
regard to selection of the construction teams and equipment
suppliers in line with 'open bidding, and fair competition and
evaluation'," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the project has signed more than 2,300
contracts by last July, with most of those involved in equipment
purchase won by foreign suppliers. Two European-led conglomerates
won the most lucrative contracts in August for the supply of 14
generators and turbines for the project.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the damming of the Yange on November 8 will
result in an unparalleled amount of construction work, and even
more opportunities for international equipment suppliers, said the
official.

Second, the tradition of maintaining independence. Our
ancestors always regarded the spirit of maintaining independence
as the foundation of a nation. As one of the cradles of human
civilization, China has all along maintained its cultural
tradition without letup in the history of several thousand
years. In modern times, the frequent bullying and humiliation by
imperialist powers once weakened China. However, after a hundred
years' struggle of the entire Chinese nation, China has stood up
again as a giant. This fully testifies to the indestructible
strength of this independent national spirit of the Chinese
people. Today, in finding a road to development suited to us, we
will proceed from our own national conditions to address the issue
of how to conduct economic construction and political and cultural
advancement without blindly copying other countries' models. In
handling international affairs, we decide our positions and
policies from an independent approach. The Chinese people cherish
its friendship and cooperation with other peoples, as well as
their right to independence they have won through protracted
struggles.

Third, the peace-loving tradition. Chinese thinkers of the
pre-Qin days (over 2,000 years ago) advanced the doctrine "loving
people and treating neighbors kindly are most valuable to a
country." This is a reflection of the aspiration of the Chinese
people for a peaceful world where people of all countries live in
harmony. Today, the Chinese people who are committed to
modernization need more than ever a long-term international
environment of peace and a favorable neighboring
environment. China's foreign policy is peace-oriented. We will
establish and develop friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, especially the principles of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs. We will never impose upon others the kind of
sufferings we once experienced. A developing and progressing China
does not pose a threat to anyone. China will never seek hegemony
even if it is developed in the future. China is always a staunch
force for world peace and regional stability.

Fourth, the tradition of constantly striving for
self-perfection. Through observing the changing nature of the
universe and all earthly matters, ancient Chinese philosophers
proposed the following doctrine: "As Heaven maintains vigor
through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for
self-perfection." This idea has become an important moral
strength, spurring the Chinese people to work hard for reform and
renovation. The fruits of China's ancient civilization were
brought about by the tireless efforts and hard work of the Chinese
nation. In the past one hundred years or so, the Chinese people
have waged arduous struggles to get rid of the sufferings under
semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, China's
forerunner of the democratic revolution, was the first to put
forward the slogan of "rejuvenation of China." He led the
Revolution of 1911 to remove the millennia old autocratic monarchy
in China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese
Communist Party led the Chinese people in achieving China's
national independence and people's liberation and in building
China into a socialist country with initial prosperity. Today,
guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Chinese people are firmly
pressing ahead with reform and opening-up and have made remarkable
achievements in the modernization drive. China has entered a
period with the fastest and healthiest development in this century.

<HEADLINE> Milestone of Three Gorges Project (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze
River, the world's third longest, is to be dammed on November 8,
signaling the end of the first-phase construction on the Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The damming will block the main channel of the Yangtze River by
linking two parallel earth-and-stone cofferdams. The water after
the damming is to flow into the man-made diversion channel besides
the construction site.
</P>
<P>
Water and silt between the cofferdams will be removed and work
will begin on the huge dam and workshops to be built on the dried
up riverbed for the Three Gorges Hydropower Station.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors making the damming a difficult job is the
speed and volume of the water flow, experts said. Developers have
to resolve such enigmas as preventing the potential collapse of
the cofferdams and building leak-proof walls. The damming
constitutes not only a test to technologies related to the river
blocking but the first examinaktion on the overall engineering
design of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Rivers are usually dammed in dry season so that the flow is
at its lowest point, making it easier to close the cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
According to studies conducted in Yichang, the Hubei Province
city nearest the dam site, the Yangtze's lowest flow rate occurs
in late January to late February, a mere 2,950 cubic meters per
second to 6,100 cubic meters per second. To allow adequate time
for developers to build cofferdams to the projected height
required during peak water flow during flood season which begins
in May, engineers picked the November 8 as the date to block the
Yangtze.

our reform and opening-up as socialist reform and opening-up
because they constitute the process of self-improvement and
development of the socialist system in China. The practice in
recent twenty years has eloquently proved that we are right in
direction, firm in conviction, steady in our steps and gradual in
our approach when carrying out the reform and opening up and have
achieved tremendous successes. We have successfully overcome
various difficulties and risks in the course of our advance
without causing great social unrest. Rather, we have succeeded in
greatly releasing and developing productive forces and maintained
social stability and an all-round progress.
</P>
<P>
We are conducting a comprehensive reform with full
confidence. Economically, we will speed up the establishment of a
socialist market economy and realize industrialization, and the
socialization, marketization and modernization of the
economy. Politically, we will endeavor to develop socialist
democracy, govern the country according to law, build a socialist
country under the rule of law and ensure the full exercise of
people's rights to govern the country and manage social
affairs. Culturally, we will work hard to develop a scientific
socialist culture for the people, a culture that is geared to the
needs of modernization, of the nation, of the world and of the
future, adopt a strategy of rejuvenating China through science and
education, and strive to raise the political and moral standards as
well as scientific and cultural level of the entire nation. In a
word, it is to build our country into a prosperous, strong,
democratic and culturally advanced modern country.

<P>
China, a country with vast territory, a big population and a
long history, should make greater contribution to humanity. The
Chinese people waged a dauntless struggle for one hundred
years. They have effected great reforms and changes one after
another to build China into a strong and prosperous country. They
have worked to strengthen ethnic harmony and achieve national
reunification and to promote the lofty cause of world peace and
development. In the final analysis, they have done all these for
one objective, that is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation and China's greater contribution to humanity.
</P>
<P>
In short, the choice of the social system and development path
that China has made, the domestic and foreign policies that it has
pursued and the goals it has identified for the next century are
all based on both the reality and the history. Therefore, they are
not only in conformity with the trend of the historical
development of mankind and that of the times, but also reflect
the characteristics of the Chinese nation. They serve not only the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people, but also world peace,
stability, prosperity and progress. This is the key to an
understanding of the present China and its future.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples
date back to more than two hundred years ago. Back in 1784,
American merchant ship the "Empress of China" came a long way to
China. In 1847, Chinese student Rong Hong and others came to the
United States as the first group of Chinese students to study
here. Many Chinese contributed to the nation-building of the
United States, while a lot of American friends helped and
supported the national liberation cause of the Chinese people. We
will never forget their contribution which has touched us deeply.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always admired the American people for
their pragmatic attitude and creative spirit. My visit to IBM,
AT&AMP;T and the Bell laboratory yesterday gave me some first-hand
knowledge of the latest successes in modern science and
technology. Today's rapid development in science and technology is
bringing about increasingly greater impact on global political and
economic pattern and people's social life. If we persist in our
reform, we will be able to turn our ideals into reality. In our
course to further open up and achieve modernization, we have
spared no efforts in learning from all the fine cultural
achievements of the American people.

<P>
Friendship and cooperation between our two peoples are of great
importance to the world. The United States is the most developed
country and China the largest developing country. China is a
country with 1.2 billion people. Its stability and rapid
development is of vital importance to the stability and
development in Asia-Pacific and the world at large. China holds a
huge market and great demand for development and the United States
holds advanced science and technology as well as enormous material
force. The economies of the two countries are therefore highly
complementary with each other. China's potential market, once
combined with foreign advanced technology and capital, will
produce many opportunities and great vigor for development. China
and the United States share broad common interests and shoulder
common responsibility on many important questions which are
crucial to human survival and development such as maintaining
world peace and security, preventing the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, protecting environment for human survival and combating
international crimes. All these provide an important basis for
further developing China-U.S. friendly relations and
cooperation. We should take a firm hold of the overall interests
of China-U.S. relations and settle our differences properly so as
to reach the goal of promoting mutual understanding, broadening
common ground, developing cooperation and building a future
together.
</P>
<P>
During my current visit to the United States, I had an in-depth
exchange of views and reached broad agreement with President
Clinton on the future development of China-U.S. relations. We both
agree that with a view to promoting the lofty cause of world peace
and development, China and the United States should strengthen
cooperation and work to build a constructive strategic partnership
oriented toward the 21st century. This will mark a new stage of
development in the China-U.S. relations.

Harvard University has all along placed importance on China
studies. The late Professor Fairbank was a well-known scholar from
Harvard. He devoted all his life to the study of Chinese history
and culture. In order to promote the study of China's past and
present, I will present Harvard with a set of newly published
Twenty-Four Histories with Mao Zedong's Comments. Twenty-Four
Histories are important classical works on China's history of
several thousand years. In his life time, Mr. Mao Zedong made
numerous comments and annotations on the Twenty-Four Histories,
thus leaving us with a rich heritage of philosophy in
understanding and drawing useful lessons from China's history.
</P>
<P>
I am glad to learn that you, Mr. President, will come to China
next year. I look forward to meeting you again in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
I highly appreciate the motto on the gate of your
University. It reads: "Enter to grow in wisdom" and "Depart to
serve better thy country and thy kind." Young people in China have
also a motto, that is, "keep the motherland in heart and serve the
people with heart and soul." I hope that in the cause of building
our own countries and promoting world peace and development,
younger generations of China and the United States will understand
each other better, learn from each other, enhance the friendship
and strive for a better future.

<HEADLINE> Art Markets Prosperous in Changsha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Visitors touring Changsha,
capital of central China's Hunan Province, are likely to be as
attracted to the abundant art markets as to local scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
But the markets, which sell diverse traditional handicrafts,
calligraphy and paintings as well as copies of oil masterpieces,
aren't for tourists alone: Changsha residents keen on enriching
their lives are spending more on high-priced cultural items like
musical instruments, art and flowers.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the statistics bureau in Changsha in 1996
showed that 35 out of every 100 households own an expensive
musical instrument, and cultural entertainment claims an average
15 percent of the monthly income of each household.
</P>
<P>
As a result, culture-oriented shops have sprung up all over
town in the past few years, predominantly galleries and flower
shops.
</P>
<P>
The Jingdian Art Shop, situated in an alley known as "Street of
Artwork," has been successfully managed by several young men.
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, people began to want to buy art for wedding
gifts, such as Hunan embroidery, a renowned traditional handicraft
item in Hunan, but hunted in local shops in vain," one of the
managers said. "My friends and I seized the trend and invested in
this business."
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a piece embroidered with mountains and rivers, he
said, "This one costs 500 to 600 yuan, a rather high price, but
people are spending more decorating their rooms. This kind of art
is favored by young people. We can sell ten pieces of this kind
every day."
</P>
<P>
Sociologists theorize that the increasing interest in the
expensive artwork may be just a fad now, but they hope it will
encourage people to seek a more advanced cultural level.

SANTIAGO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chile's export earnings from
forestry, livestock and farm produce in the first nine months of
the year were up 1.7 percent over the same period of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Text of Jiang's Speech at Harvard University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech, entitled "Enhance
Mutual Understanding and Build Stronger Ties of Friendship and
Cooperation" delivered today at Harvard University:
Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I wish to thank Dr. Neil L. Rudenstine, President of Harvard
University, for inviting me to this ancient yet modernized
institution of the United States in this golden fall.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding some 360 years ago, Harvard has nurtured a
great number of outstanding statesmen, scientists, writers and
businessmen, including six of the American Presidents and over
thirty Nobel Prize winners. The fact that Harvard was founded
before the United States of America testifies to its position in
the American history.
</P>
<P>
Harvard is among the first American universities to accept
Chinese students. The Chinese educational, scientific and cultural
communities have all along maintained academic exchanges with this
university. Harvard has thus made useful contribution to the
enhanced mutual understanding between the Chinese and American
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Mutual understanding is the basis for state-to-state
relations. Without it, it would be impossible for countries to
build trust and promote cooperation with each other. Since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United
States, the exchanges and mutual understanding between our two
peoples have broadened and deepened steadily. However, this is not
enough. To promote the development of China-U.S. relations, China
needs to know the United States better and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
To know China better, one may approach it from different
angles. China today has been evolved from its past. China is a
country with 5,000 years of civilization. Therefore, it is
important to approach China from a historical and cultural
perspective.

<TEXT>
<P>
I recall my first lesson on calculus in senior high school. My
teacher quoted a line from Zhuang Zi, a Chinese philosopher over
2,000 years ago, which reads "Cut away half of a rod and keep on
halving what is left, and there will be no end to that
process." This gave me a vivid concept of limit. It shows that the
ancient Chinese realized the endless process of changes of matters
and had a fairly good understanding of the nature. As early as in
2,500 B.C., Chinese began astronomical observation and
geographical survey, and gradually formed a world outlook of an
"integration of the universe and humanity." China produced in its
history many outstanding philosophers, thinkers, statesmen,
strategists, scientists, writers and artists and left us numerous
volumes of literature. The scene of "contention of a hundred
schools of thought" brought forth in the Spring and Autumn Period
2,500 years ago and the Warring States Period over 2,200 years ago
and the emergence of various schools of thought and their
exponents such as Lao Zi and Confucius about 2,400 years ago all
occupy a very important position in the world history of
philosophy. Ancient China made unique contributions to many areas
of science including astronomy, calendric system, geography,
mathematics, agriculture, medicine and the humanities. Records of
solar and lunar eclipses are found in the inscriptions on bones or
tortoise shells of the Shang Dynasty over 3,000 years ago. In the
2,100 years from the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty (221
BC-1911), the 27 appearances of Halley Comet were all recorded in
China. Zhang Heng of the Han Dynasty over 1,800 years ago invented
a seismograph to determine the location of earthquakes and the
celestial globe that showed the movement of the sun, moon and
other stars. Mathematicians in the pre-Qin days over 2,200 years
ago put forward the proposition known as the Pythagorean theorem
in the West today. In the Northern and Southern Dynasties in the
4th century A.D., China's mathematician Zu Chongzhi calculated the
ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter to be
3.1415926. China's silk weaving, porcelain making, metallurgy and
shipbuilding reached the world's advanced level in ancient
times. In the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Zaiyu initiated the twelve-tone
temperament which later became the universal standard tones. The
Chinese medicine is a unique school of its own. Particularly,
China's four great inventions of paper making, gunpowder, printing
and compass had once changed the face of the world. China had been
a world leader in science and technology for one thousand years
until the 15th century. These inventions and creations of China
have brought forward the rationalistic brilliance of coordination
between humanity and the nature and the integration of scientific
spirit with moral ideals.

China's culture in history has never stopped developing. It has
enriched itself through the contention and infiltration of various
disciplines and schools of thought, and also through the mutual
exchanges and learning between China and other countries in the
world. Since old times, the Chinese people came to know full well
the importance of "drawing widely upon others' strong points to
improve oneself." The Han and Tang Dynasty were both an age of
economic prosperity and also one of flourishing international
exchanges. Imperial envoy Zhang Qian's trip to the "West" in the
Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) over 2,000 years ago opened up the
world-famous Silk Road; Eminent Monk Xuan Zang of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) brought back ancient culture after braving long journey
to South Asian countries. In the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese
navigator Cheng Ho led a fleet to what that then people called the
"West Sea" seven times in the 15th century, spreading the Chinese
culture to distant land. Only later on, especially in late Qing
Dynasty, the feudal rulers adopted a policy of seclusion, which
hampered China's progress and its exchanges with the outside
world. After the Opium War (1840-1842), generation after
generation of enlightened Chinese people have, for national
rejuvenation, spared no efforts in learning from Western countries
advanced science and cultural achievements in combination with
China's realities and pushing for China's social reforms and
development. Today, the Chinese people who are struggling to
achieve modernization have made the opening-up a basic state
policy and conducted extensive exchanges and cooperation with the
rest of the world, thus creating a brand-new situation in its
opening-up endeavor in the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Sunlight is composed of seven colors, so is our world full of
colors and splendor. Every country and every nation has its own
historical and cultural traditions, strong points and
advantages. We should respect and learn from each other and draw
upon other's strong points to offset one's own deficiencies for
achieving common progress.
</P>
<P>
In the prolonged course of development, China has formed its
fine historical and cultural traditions, which have been either
developed or discarded with the changes of the times and social
progress. These traditions have exerted a profound impact on the
values and way of life of the Chinese people, and on China's road
of development today. Here, I would like to make the following
observations which I hope will help you to know China better.

First, the tradition of solidarity and unity. The Chinese
nation is a big family composed of 56 nationalities. Since the
time immemorial, people of all nationalities have established
closely-knitted political, economic and cultural links and joined
hands in developing the vast land of our country. China became a
vast unified country more than 2,000 years ago. The deep-rooted
Chinese culture become a strong bond for ethnic harmony and
national unity. Solidarity and unity have been inscribed in the
hearts of the Chinese people as part of their national
identity. Despite occasional division in the Chinese history,
ethnic harmony and national unity have remained the main stream in
the history of the Chinese nation, and an important guarantee for
China's development and progress. The founding of the People's
Republic of China marked an unprecedented great unity of the
Chinese nation. A new type of relationship of equality, solidarity
and mutual assistance between different nationalities has been
established. People of all nationalities enjoy full rights and
freedoms provided for by the law. In places where there is a high
concentration of minority nationality people, regional autonomy is
in practice. These regions have witnessed continued economic and
social development. All these have laid a solid political
foundation for consolidated national unity.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project to Take 17 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing
Three Gorges Project, which will be the world's largest water
conservation facility when completed, will take 17 years to build.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project consists of three stages.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory and first-phase projects spans five years from
1993-1997, whose completion is signaled by the damming of the
Yangtze River on November 8.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will run from 1998 to 2003. This phase will be
completed when the first generating unit in the left-bank power
plant goes on line and the permanent ship lock begins operation.
</P>
<P>
The third phase is planned for 2004-2009. This final phase
includes the completion of all 26 electricity-producing
turbogenerators.
</P>
<P>
On October 14 of this year, the 63rd Executive meeting of the
State Council set November 8 as the date to block the Yangtze
River. That will mark the end of the first phase construction and
the beginning of the second phase.

<HEADLINE> d p s 3075 China-Three Gorges-Construction Three Gorges Project Creates Man-made Miracles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- Construction
workers of the gigantic Three Gorges Project had moved 22.4
million cubic meters of soil and hard rock away, and mixed and
poured about 160,000 cubic meters of concrete for the construction
of the man-made canal alone.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, or the first-phase construction of the
giant project, certain big pre-damming projects create man-made
miracles in the engineering construction history of China. The
man-made Yangtze is one of them.
</P>
<P>
To dam the Yangtze River while ensuring the smooth navigation
in this China's busiest river channel after the damming,
developers of the Three Gorges Project dug the canal along
the north bank of this world's third longest river.
</P>
<P>
The open-cut canal, or the water diversion channel, is 3,410 meters
long and 350 meters wide at the bottom. The height of the canal's
dikes hit 58 meters.
</P>
<P>
This "man-made Yangtze" is designed to be capable of combating
against strong flood. In peak flood season, the canal can divert
flood water at 79,000 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Water of the Yangtze first flew through the canal last May. Up to
October 30, some 6,400 vessels had passed the canal since it's
opened to traffic on October 5.
</P>
<P>
After the third-phase construction between 2004 and 2009, the
canal will be blocked, on which the north-bank hydro-power plant
will be built.
</P>
<P>
Another big, and one of the hardest projects, in the
construction of the massive Three Gorges Project, is the erection
of permanent ship locks.
</P>
<P>
In the north-bank construction site, a man-made "grand canyon",
where ships will sail along when the dam is built, has taken shape
on the granite slopes. The 3,800-meter-long, 300-meter-wide canyon
will eventually be turned out to be the permanent ship lock, the
largest to be built in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sandouping, widely described as an ideal dam site for a large
water project, is wholly grounded on granite, the hardest rock.
</P>
<P>
The firmest foundation for the dam, however, posed hardest
challenges for developers. It will a decade to complete this
single project. Soil and rock dug for the permanent ship lock
account to 40 percent of the total amount of the entire Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, most of the digging work has been finished and the
five-level lock rooms have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
The third big project in the first-phase is to start the
construction of the temporary ship lock and ship lifts,
which facilitate navigation in flood seasons.
</P>
<P>
In the flood season, the flow velocity in the open-cut canal
may exceed 20,000 cubic meters per second, too fast for ships to
pass. To ensure the year-round operation on this busy water
channel, developers have worked hard to speed up the construction
of temporary ship locks and ship-lifts.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the channel of the temporary ship lock, with a
height of 130 meters, has been cut from the granite slope.
Builders are seen installing mental structures at the site.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project to Cost Over 200 billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Project was estimated to require a 90-billion-yuan
investment based on 1993 constant prices, but inflation and
expenditures increased the cost projections to more than 200 billion
yuan (about 24 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge amount, the investment is equivalent to just
0.123 percent of the gross domestic production (GDP) and 0.98
percent of the cumulative capital construction investment across
China during the 17 years of construction.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the project come from the following sources:
</P>
<P>
-- A Three Gorges Construction Fund based on appropriation from
electricity charges across China;
</P>
<P>
-- All sales income from electricity generated by the Gezhouba
Power Plant, which is also owned by China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corp.;
</P>
<P>
-- Profits from the Three Gorges power station when it goes
into operation in the year of 2003;
</P>
<P>
-- Loans from the State Development Bank and domestic
commercial banks;
</P>
<P>
-- Bonds issued both at home and overseas and;
</P>
<P>
-- Export credit loans and commercial loans from foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Financing of the project will go through three stages.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will be purely input from 1993-2005; a balance
between revenue and expenses is expected to be reached in 2006,
with no further need to borrow.
</P>
<P>
The second will a debt-repayment period from 2006 to 2012. And
from 2012 on the project is expected to make a pure profit.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Minority Students Enroling in American Medical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of minorities
entering U.S. medical schools dropped this year, particularly in
states affected by affirmative-action rollbacks.
</P>
<P>
A study released Saturday by The American Association of
Medical Colleges finds the nation's 125 accredited medical schools
showing an 11 percent drop in blacks, American Indians,
Mexican-Americans, Chicanos and Puerto Ricans applying to medical
schools.
</P>
<P>
Some 6.8 percent fewer of those minority students were accepted
for 1997 than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some educators fear the figures show that actions of a federal
court in Texas and the voters of California to end educational
preferences for minorities are having impact on the nation.
</P>
<P>
Minorities are discouraged from applying, and administrators
have become overly cautious about admissions policies, they say.
</P>
<P>
The association's president, Jordan J. Cohen, said the downturn
is clearly linked to Proposition 209, with which California's
electorate ended affirmative action in state institutions, and the
Hopwood federal court decision in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Together, they ended affirmative action -- a formal effort to
provide increased employment opportunities from women and ethnic
minorities, to overcome past patterns of discrimination, in four
states.
</P>
<P>
The report says, 17 percent fewer minority students applied to
their state medical schools in California and in Texas,
Mississippi and Louisiana, states covered by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals decision that affirmative action is
unconstitutional. The number accepted in the four states plunged
by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The threat to affirmative action in many states is sending the
signal to minority students that they are unwelcome," said Hector
Garza, vice president for access and equity programs at the
American Council on Education.
</P>
<P>
Some educators at institutions outside those states said they
have witnessed the impact of the rollbacks firsthand.

<HEADLINE> Martin Luther King Jr.' Heir Named to Lead Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) delegates have elected Martin Luther
King III to head the organization of his father, the slain civil
rights leader, founded in 1957.
</P>
<P>
In a special convention at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church
in Atlanta, King, 40, was unanimously elected the fourth president
of the grassroots civil rights group, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
King, a former Fulton County, Georgia, commissioner, will
replace Reverend Joseph Lowery, who announced his retirement
earlier this year, but agreed to stay on until a successor was
named.
</P>
<P>
King told delegates from SCLC chapters and affiliates across
the country, "We've made many strides since the inception of SCLC
40 years ago, but as an organization and a nation, we have so much
further to go."
</P>
<P>
King said in his acceptance speech he would be a "tireless
steward" of the organization.
</P>
<P>
King was the second of the four children. Like his siblings, he
felt the sting of segregation. In 1963, he was denied admission to
Atlanta's private Lovett School because he was black, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
The SCLC was founded by Lowery, Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph
David Abernathy Sr., and others. Lowery has served as its
president since 1977, when he succeeded Abernathy, who took over
after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the
organization's first president.
</P>
<P>
Lowery says King has his full support. King will officially
become SCLC president on Jan. 15, 1998.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Says His U.S. Visit Is a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOSTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said his trip to the United States has produced important results
in enhancing mutual understanding between China and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who flew in this morning from New York to continue his
nine-day state visit to the U.S., the first by a Chinese President
in 12 years, told a luncheon today that his talks with President
Bill Clinton reached understanding on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon was hosted by Massachusetts Governor Paul Celluci
and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in honor of Jiang who earlier
delivered a speech in Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton and I agreed that the U.S. and China should
strengthen cooperation and make efforts to build a constructive
strategic relationship in view of the 21st century for the lofty
cause of enhancing world peace and development," Jiang told an
audience of over 200.
</P>
<P>
Long seen as the birthplace of the American industrial
revolution, Massachusetts has a long history of exchanges with
China, Jiang said, adding that Chinese students' footmarks can be
traced back to the first days of this century.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang said, bilateral exchanges and
cooperation have expanded to cover more areas including economic
and trade, technical and scientific, education, culture, financing
and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his hope to see more people from the state to visit
China, to invest there and to develop trade, Jiang said
Massachusetts can play an active role in promoting bilateral ties
as it is advantageous in high-tech, medical and insurance fields.
</P>
<P>
Celluci and Menino also spoke of their willingness to enhance
cooperation between Massachusetts, Boston and China.
</P>
<P>
Earlier President Jiang met and conducted cordial conversations
with them.
</P>
<P>
Jiang started his U.S. journey on October 26 at the invitation
of President Clinton. He and his entourage left Boston this
afternoon for Los Angeles, the last leg of the visit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Energy, NASA Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today used line-item power to veto 10 government projects
involving 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Projects include a cemetery for veterans, a solar energy
demonstration project and a NASA telescope. The White House said
seven were cut from a 69 billion dollars measure financing
veterans, housing, environmental and other programs. The other
three were tweezed out of a 42 billion dollars transportation
bill.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, Clinton had cast 63 line-item vetoes on six
previous bills, mostly cutting defense programs and military
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The vetoes would reduce 1.9 billion dollars of spending over
the next five years. Clinton said the projects were duplicated
other government projects.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Astrophysicist Found New Moons of Uranus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian astrophysicist has
found two new moons circling the planet Uranus, a report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the moons' existence was made Friday to the
world's astronomical community after a second group of sightings
had confirmed their existence.
</P>
<P>
This brings to 17 the number of known Uranian moons, according
to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Brett Gladman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for
Theoretical Astrophysics in Toronto located the two moons at the
beginning of last month.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gladman, 31, believes that the finding of these two
smallish bodies -- one roughly 80 kilometers in diameter and the
other about 160 kilometers -- raises the possibility that up to
another dozen rocky bits of material may be circling the giant
planet.
</P>
<P>
The moons were found almost by chance using the 200-inch Hale
Telescope in Palomar, California.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gladman was using the telescope to search for comets in
conjunction with Phillip Nicholson and Joseph Burns of Cornell
University and J.J. Kavelaars of McMaster University.
</P>
<P>
There was an hour or so of observing time that was not suitable
for the cometary research, so Prof. Nicholson suggested a look at
an area around Uranus where moons might be present. Then came the
finding.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gladman will get to name one of the moons, while the other
will be named by Prof. Nicholson, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Want Government to Cut Debt, Taxes, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadians want
the government to focus on tax and debt reduction after
eliminating the deficit, according to a poll published today.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail/Angus Reid poll found that only 13 percent
Canadians felt that increasing spending should be the top
priority.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said that the government
should make efforts to reduce the country's 600 billion dollar
(430 billion USD) debt and to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
"This would appear to represent a fundamental change in public
opinion," said the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As recently as February, an Angus Reid poll found nine percent
of Canadians wanted government to meet its deficit target and put
any extra cash toward a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
The most favored option at that time was for the government to
spend more on health and education. This time, increased spending
ranked a distant third on the list of preferences.
</P>
<P>
"There was a very good job done by the Reform and the
Progressive Conservatives (parties) during the (Spring) election
campaign to give some momentum behind the whole tax-cut issues,"
said Darrell Bricker, senior vice president of the Angus Reid
Group.
</P>
<P>
In terms of specific tax reductions, a majority of those polled
indicated the government should first cut the goods and services
tax, compared with 37 percent who said an income-tax cut should
take precedence and 10 percent who favored lowering unemployment
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,515 adult Canadians was conducted between
October 23 and 28. Its results are considered to be accurate
within 2.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.
