<HEADLINE> Wuhan Wins Battle With Flood Crest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.18 million military
and civilian flood-fighters were reinforcing flood-weakened dikes
when the sixth flood crest on the Yangtze River passed through
Wuhan early this morning.
</P>
<P>
A leading official was positioned every 30 meters on the river
dikes to coordinate anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers and armed police
jumped into the water and stood before the embankment with a piece
of plastic cloth in their hands to form a "human wall." Others
patroled the dikes day and night and were prepared to go where
needed as the flood crest stayed in the city for 26 hours.
</P>
<P>
Production in the Wuhan Economic and Technological Development
Zone, which is adjacent to the Yangtze dikes, was reported
normal. One after another Aeolus-Citroen cars rolled off the
production line of a Sino-French motor venture. Trucks of
Coca-Cola were also shipped to other parts of China from the zone.
</P>
<P>
The past 50 days have seen full or partial closure of 1,000
factories in Wuhan as a result of the floods. However, the city's
industrial output value rose to 5.9 billion yuan, up 11.82 percent
over the same period last year and higher than the growth rate in
the first half of the year, said a city official in charge of
industrial production.
</P>
<P>
So far, Wuhan alone has received more than 100 million yuan of
relief funds donated by people in all parts of China and overseas
Chinese, and the figure is snowballing with each passing day, said
a city official.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Can be Transmitted through Breastfeeding: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS virus HIV-1 can be
transmitted to babies after birth through breastfeeding, French
doctors reported Friday in the Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Dr Valeriane Leroy and colleagues from Bordeaux, France, said
that they have studied the frequency of such infection in
developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Children involved in the research were from Europe, USA,
Rwanda, Kenya, and the Ivory Coast. All children were uninfected
at two and a half months of age.
</P>
<P>
Of children in the developed countries, researchers found that
less than five percent overall were breastfed and no children were
infected with HIV-1.
</P>
<P>
However, in the developing countries, in which breastfeeding is
normal, HIV-1 infection occurred in about five percent of all
children.
</P>
<P>
"If breastfeeding had stopped at age four months, transmission
would have occurred in no infants," the researchers calculated.
</P>
<P>
The findings has important implications for public-health
strategies in developing countries, the doctors said.

<HEADLINE> Reducing Risk of Prostate Cancer With Selenium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from Harvard
University said eating food rich in mineral selenium may help men
ward off advanced prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
By a study of 33,737 men, they found higher selenium levels
were associated with a reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
In the study, 81 cases of advanced prostate cancer, were
diagnosed in the test group from 1990 through 1994. After
adjusting for such factors as age, weight, vasectomy, diabetes,
smoking and family history, they found that men with the highest
selenium levels had only about one-third the likelihood of
developing advanced prostate cancer as those with low selenium.
</P>
<P>
Selenium is found in minute amounts in meat, fish, whole
grains, dairy products and vegetables grown in selenium-rich soil.
</P>
<P>
Cancer of the prostate causes nearly 40,000 deaths annually
in the United States. The gland produces fluids that form part
of semen.The cancer usually occurs in older men and often grows
slowly.

<HEADLINE> UK's Lending Rises to Spark Fears of Interest Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Lending by banks and building
societies shot up in July in Britain, sparking fears of another
interest rate rise, according to newly released figures.
</P>
<P>
The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said lending had reached
its highest point all year, while the Building Societies
Association (BSA) said more mortgages were approved in July than
in any other month this year.
</P>
<P>
July is usually a boom month for house sales, but London's
financial City had been expecting the figures to drop in response
to higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
David Smith, analyst at William de Broe, was quoted by local
media as saying: "This has really shocked the City. It is a total
reversal of the downward trend in bank lending and the new figures
certainly suggest the possibility of an adjustment in interest
rates."
</P>
<P>
Many economists said the continued strength of borrowing would
concern the Bank of England but that might not be enough on its
own to force another rate hike.
</P>
<P>
David Coleman at CIBC Wood Gundy said: "This reinforces our
suspicion that at best, monetary policy could be on hold for some
time to come."
</P>
<P>
Growth in the amount of money stored in bank and savings
accounts - M4 broad money supply - accelerated to 10 percent on an
annual basis in July from 9 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
However, it is no longer a key indicator for the Bank of
England due to its erratic nature, according to analysts.

NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- India Friday responded
cautiously to the attacks by the United States on alleged
terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan, and underscored the need
for collective efforts by all countries to combat international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to comment on the U.S. action," said a spokesman
for the External Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "It is high time for the international community
to get together to tackle the problems of trans-national and
trans-border terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that there was a provision in international
law for reprisal raids, but they declined to state whether the
American attacks in retaliation for bombings of U.S. embassies in
East Africa were justified.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said India had always highlighted the need to
tackle the menace of international terrorism globally and find a
lasting long-term solution to effectively put an end to it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police Friday enhanced security at the U.S. embassy
and other American institutions in New Delhi.

<HEADLINE> Benefit Performance Raises 1.1 Billion Yuan for Flood Victims (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A large benefit performance
hosted by the ministries of Culture and Civil Affairs has raised
nearly 1.1 billion yuan (133 million U.S. dollars) for China's
flood victims, Fan Baojun, vice-minister of civil affairs,
announced here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour performance titled "Join Our Hands to Build A New
Great Wall," was staged in the Great Hall of the People in
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Four donation hot lines which were opened for the performance
received 565 phone calls bringing some 403 million yuan in
donations, Fan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the past few days since news of the
performance was released, the ministry received some 690 million
yuan in domestic and foreign donations.
</P>
<P>
Many celebrities in China's entertainment and performing arts
circles participated in the performance, which was broadcast live
by China Central Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The largest donation tonight came from northeast China's
Liaoning Province, China's old industrial base and a center of
financially troubled state-owned enterprises. Despite its own
problems, such as laid-off workers and an economic slowdown, the
province donated 91 million yuan (11 million US dollars) to the
flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren, China's most famous coach of long-distance running,

The performance was the first hosted by China's central
government departments since the country was hit by the worst
flooding in decades early this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hall of the People, meeting place for China's
paramount power organ -- the National People's Congress --
provided the performance site free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Since early June, serious flooding caused by unusually heavy
rain, has plagued a dozen provinces in South China and along the
Yangtze River, as well as north China's Heilongjiang and Jilin
provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Civil Affairs Ministry in early
August put the death toll caused by the floods at more than 2,000,
adding that the number of flood victims nationwide exceeded 240
million.
</P>
<P>
Starting in July, domestic and foreign assistance for the
flooded areas has been pouring in to the Ministry of Civil Affairs
and non-governmental organizations such as the China Charity
Federation and the Red Cross Society of China.
</P>
<P>
Donations to the flood-stricken areas, excluding those received
during the performance this evening, have surpassed 1.6 billion
yuan (193 million U.S. dollars), according to the Civil Affairs
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Rural China Urged to Change Economic Growth Patterns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party leader today
called for a change of economic growth patterns and improvement of
democracy and legal systems in China's rural development.
</P>
<P>
In the new period of a socialist market economy, a change of
growth patterns and improvement of a democratic legal system are
of vital importance to raising agricultural output and farmers'
income as well as maintaining rural stability, said Jiang Chunyun,
a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party of China (CPC), during an inspection tour
of north China's Hebei Province Aug. 18-21.
</P>
<P>
An important measure to change the growth pattern would be to
operate in light of market needs and optimize the agricultural
structure, said Jiang, who is also vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
While stabilizing grain output, farmers should grow more
products with high value such as fruits and vegetables, and
develop aquatic and animal husbandry production, he added.
</P>
<P>
A decisive factor for boosting the rural economy is to raise
the ratio of science and technology used in agricultural
production and to develop agricultural industrialization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang urged government officials and technicians to
provide farmers with assistance in such areas as information and
technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Frogmen of the Chinese Navy were
mobilized today to block seepage from the levees surrounding
Harbin, the largest heavy-industrial center in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 civilians were transferred to safe places
today before the arrival of a third flood peak on the Songhua
River.
</P>
<P>
At 7:00 this afternoon, the water level on the Songhua River
hit 120.84 meters, 2.74 meters above the danger level and 0.79
meters above the 1957 record. The city also recorded a record flow
rate of 17,200 cubic meters per second today.
</P>
<P>
Levees surrounding Harbin are considered to be the best in
Heilongjiang. Nonetheless, bags containing rocks, flour, earth and
lime were the last major defense against floodwaters penetrating
river embankments.
</P>
<P>
Surging water in the Songhua River seeped through the primary
and secondary embankments, with water levels as deep as 20
centimeters on many streets. Soldiers used plastic bowls to
throw seeping water back into the river.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 soldiers and civilians battled surging water
by placing sandbags atop the levees.
</P>
<P>
Streets near the Songhua River were filled with trucks hauling
plastic bags and stones to workers on the levees.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers supplied weary workers with food, including stuffed
buns and gruel to provide relief from the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guanglie, Shenyang Military Area Commander, and Yang
Fuchen, commander of a PLA group army, were present on the front

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army to Tackle Hezbollah Roadside Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Upset by the rising death of
its soldiers in South Lebanon, Israeli army has decided to tackle
the renewed use of roadside bombs by Hezbollah guerrillas, Israel
Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier and one civilian working for the army were
killed late Thursday by Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas in
South Lebanon, less than 48 hours after two roadside bombs claimed
the life of one Israeli soldier and wounded four others.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were driving a truck in the Israeli
self-claimed South Lebanon Security Zone when a roadside bomb was
detonated through remote control by the Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Chief of
General Staff Shaul Mofaz visited the zone Friday for the second
time in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Israeli army officials would study ways to deal
with the renewed use of roadside bombs by Hezbollah, which has
been fighting to oust Israeli troops from the
1200-square-kilometer security Zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel created the zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its
northern border towns from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that
Israel was trying to find a solution to pull out its troops from
South Lebanon, calling it "a major goal" of his government.
</P>
<P>
The deaths Thursday night brought to 12 the death toll of the
Israelis who have been killed in South Lebanon since the
beginning of the year.

ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
telephoned Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Friday evening to
convey his administration's point of view on the overnight missile
attacks on alleged terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Foreign Minister said Sharif told
Clinton that the unilateral U.S. action constituted violation of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent states.
</P>
<P>
The attacks had caused anguish and indignation in Pakistan,
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of resorting to military action against sovereign
states, the U.S. should have opted for dialogue and consultation
to achieve its objectives, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The prime Minister also reiterated Pakistan's strong commitment
to combating terrorism in all its forms, as it had itself been a
victim of state-sponsored terrorism for many years.
</P>
<P>
In a separate press release, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry
said its spokesman has clarified that no casualty has occurred
inside Pakistani territory as believed earlier, nor has any damage
been caused on the Pakistani side of the border.
</P>
<P>
An earlier announcement in this regard was based on inaccurate
information, the press released said.

All casualties and damage, as a result of the U.S. strikes,
have occurred across the border inside Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Follows Flood Situation on Major Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, made several
phone calls to leaders in flood-ravaged Heilongjiang Province and
the Minister of Water Resources in recent days, inquiring about
the situation of major Chinese rivers.
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 p.m. today, Li phoned Xu Youfang, secretary of the
Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), asking about the water level there as the third flood crest
on the Songhua River passed through Harbin.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time that the premier phoned leaders of
Heilongjiang Province since he visited there on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
As the weather gets colder in northeast China, Li urged party
and governments at all levels to pay even more attention to the
health of People's Liberation Army soldiers combating the floods.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters to provide Heilongjiang with adequate relief
materials.
</P>
<P>
Xu told the NPC chairman that his province had received 5
million plastic bags, 20,000 life jackets, 100 tons of wire and
500,000 square meters of cloth from the central government, all of
which was distributed to key river sections.
</P>
<P>
In a call to Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, Li
inquired about the flood situation on both the Yangtze and Songhua
rivers, anti-flood efforts, dangerous sections and weather
forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Two Men Still in Custody for Questioning After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Northern Irish police were still
questioning two men on Friday who were allegedly involved in the
Omagh bombing that killed 28 people last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There are now two people still in custody," a police spokesman
said in Northern Ireland capital Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that under anti-guerrilla laws, the pair
could be detained until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three others arrested with them last Monday were released on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, a breakaway group opposed to a truce by the
mainstream Irish Republican Army, claimed responsibility to the
bombing, the deadliest atrocity in 30-year conflict in the British
province.
</P>
<P>
To hunt down the bombers, police have appealed for information
about two men who were seen 40 minutes before the blast, leaving a
car at the busy junction where it exploded.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said they had been seen by several
witnesses. The authorities wanted to hear from anyone who had
seen the vehicle being driven or parked in the market town.

<HEADLINE> Expert Warns of Cremation Crisis in The UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of doctors willing to
take on specialist work for crematoriums could lead to funerals
being delayed in the UK, the British Medical Association has
warned.
</P>
<P>
Professor Stuart Horner, from the University of Central
Lancashire, said Friday in the British Medical Journal that "the
present system is about to collapse under the impending manpower
crisis."
</P>
<P>
The legislative framework for cremation in the UK was
established in 1902. It requires the signature of a medical
referee in order that cremation can take place.
</P>
<P>
Cremation now accounts for 73 percent of disposals of dead
bodies in the UK.
</P>
<P>
After conducting a survey of doctors currently working as
medical referees for crematoriums, Professor Horner found that
eighty percent of the referees are over the age of 50 years and a
third are over 65.
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted at a crematorium in the north of
England also found that less than 41 percent of the cremation
documentation had been completed sufficiently, thus requiring
further investigation which could delay the cremation process.
</P>
<P>
"We are teetering on the brink of a crisis. Increasingly there
are days at crematoriums when no medical referee is available."
Professor Horner said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that younger doctors may be discouraged from
becoming a medical referee because the work "requires challenging
colleagues about their standards of care form time to time."
</P>
<P>
There is also the issue of the "derisory fee", which is only
2.70 pounds (4.40 U.S. dollars) for completing a cremation, and
referees often have to pay their own travelling expenses when they
attend a crematorium.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns U.S. Attack on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Friday
condemned the United States air raid on a Sudanese facility as
"serious aggression against a sovereign Arab country."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the AL General Secretariat
expressed "shock and resentment" at the U.S. attack Thursday night
on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's capital Khartoum, which
injured several civilians.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member AL accused the U.S. of flagrantly violating
international laws and conventions and the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday on suspected
terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for the
August 7 bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Over 250 people were killed and 5,000 others wounded in the
twin bombings against the U.S. embassies in Kenya's capital
Nairobi and Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. held the Saudi Arabian millionaire Bin Laden, son of a
wealth Saudi construction magnate, responsible for the embassy
bombings. Laden, who had once resided in Sudan, is living in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. justified its air raid against the al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Factory in Khartoum on its assessment that the plan
was manufacturing chemical weapons agents, that could be used by
Islamic militants to launch new attacks against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied the U.S. allegation, saying the factory
produces half of the medicine needed in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League voiced support for Sudan in the face of threats
to its stability, unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.S. to respect international laws and desist from
acts that endanger the sovereignty of other countries and
jeopardize the world peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Blasts SADC Military Aid to Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Friday expressed its
regret over the intervention of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) forces to rescue President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency quoted a government statement as saying
that Rwanda regretted that some SADC member states "have decided
to support President Laurent Kabila and not the Congolese people,
by sending military forces to his rescue."
</P>
<P>
It said it reserved the right to get involved in a conflict in
the Democratic Republic of Congo "in whatever manner it deems
appropriate" and condemned Zimbabwe's call for military
intervention there.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government accused Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, chairman of SADC organ on politics, defense and security,
of having thrown all his support to Kabila "for his personal
interests".
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Patrick Mazimhaka, Minister in the
President's Office, asserted that Rwanda has stakes in the
Congolese war as far as peace and stability for itself and other
countries of the sub-region are concerned.
</P>
<P>
"Stability in Congo benefits not only Congo, but also its
neighbors and Rwanda in particular," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In view of the involvement of the SADC members in Congo and
the lack of prior consultation with Democratic Congo's immediate
neighbors, Rwanda said that it will be dragged into the
three-week crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda, therefore, reserves the right to get involved and to
assist the Congolese people in their search for a lasting
solution in whatever manner it deems appropriate," the statement
warned.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Kigali believe that President Mugabe is the brain
behind the intervention of SADC frorces on the side of President
Kabila, despite all sorts of abuses he has been accused of by his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources there also claimed that Mugabe has a
business deal worth 195 million U.S. Dollars with DRC President
Kabila that he must safeguard at all costs.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Defense Minister Moven Mahachi had earlier this
week accused Rwanda of invading Congo. And Zimbabwean President
Mugabe said Thursday that Rwanda was directly involved in the
Tutsi-led rebellion in democratic Congo according to results
concluded by the fact-finding commission of SADC foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwanda said that the accusations were biased as long
as the inquiry c/mmission set up by seven African leaders on
August 8 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, had not yet made public its
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe's move to raise SADC forces to assist Kabila
against his foes was "not only wrong in principle, but it is
fraudulent in nature," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Dismisses Turkish Press Reports on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Friday dismissed the
Turkish press reports that the U.S. has put forward a new proposal
on breaking the one-year-old deadlock in the Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's media recently reported that in the proposal, the
U.S. urged Turkey to withdraw its demand for recognizing the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus in return for
Cyprus' halt to accession talks with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The said articles appear to be untrue and this is also
reflected in statements by the U.S. envoy for Cyprus," government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said at his daily press briefing
here.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Ankara last week, U.S. State Department
Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller reportedly proposed to create
a no-fly zone over Cyprus in exchange for Cyprus' cancellation of
its plan to deploy Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish press reports said Miller's demand was rejected by
the Turkish government, and he left Ankara empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides insisted that Cyprus' integration process with the
EU was a completely separate issue that should not be related to
the resumption of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus would not give Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash anything in exchange for his return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
He urged Denktash to comply with U.N. Security Council's
resolutions and appeals of the international community to return
to the negotiating table without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island in the wake of
a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process broke down last August when Denktash
quited the talks to protest the EU decision to start membership
talks with Cyprus instead of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He has conditioned his return to the negotiations on the halt
of Cyprus' EU talks and the recognition of his regime in northern
Cyprus that was declared in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island in a bizonal and bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abubakar to Visit S. Africa Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's return to
democracy would top the agenda during talks between Nigerian Head
of State Abdulsalam Abubakar and South African President Nelson
Mandela next week, South African Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day visit, described as official, will be General
Abubakar's first trip abroad since he came to power in June.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar will arrive at Waterkloof air base near Pretoria
Sunday afternoon and will hold talks with Mandela on Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader will fly to Cape Town Tuesday to meet
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and to brief the South African
parliament on the current situation in the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar would also visit Robben Island where Mandela was
imprisoned for 18 years during the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Nigerian leader and his South African
counterpart would cover filateral issues as well as the conflict
in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has played a major role in west African peace-keeping
operations, more recently in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's visit is regarded as another step to the on-going
mending relations between South Africa and Nigeria, two
influential powers in southern and western Africa respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki visited Nigeria on July 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between the two nations had been strained
since 1995 when Mandela led the call for international sanctions
against Nigeria following the execution of several activists in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 26 People Killed in U.S. Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 people were killed
and 30 others injured when U.S. cruise missiles exploded Thursday
night on the Zhawar Kili Albadr base near Khost, about 150 km
southeast of the Afghan capital Kabul, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces on Thursday launched missile attacks against
suspected terrorist bases in Afghanistan allegedly run by Osama
Bin Laden, an anti-American Islamic militant who has been blamed
for bombing the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. retaliation "is such a callous act," said Taliban
spokesman Wakil Ahmed Akhumzada at the militia's headquarters in
the southern city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. had no proof against Laden, according to
reports reaching here from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.S. missiles hit targets near Jalalabad,
about 100 km east of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted officials in Jalalabad as saying that
three people were killed in the attack. However, U.S. defense
officials had said that only the Albadr base was targeted, and six
sites were hit on the sprawling complex.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, News Network International, an independent Pakistani
news agency, quoted the Karkat ul Mujahideen group as saying that
five of its Pakistani members were killed at the camp near Khost.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-based Harkat ul Mujahideen, formally known as
Harkatul Ansar, was included last year in the U.S. State
Department's list of terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said after the U.S. missile attack that Laden was
safe and no damage had been done to any of his companions.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Taliban militia, Mulla Mohammad Omar, denounced
the attack as "a brazen manifestation of enmity against the Afghan
nation."
</P>
<P>
"It is not only an attack against Osma bin Laden but also an
attack against the entire people in Afghanistan," he told the
Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press from his base at Kandahar
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the Taliban had repeatedly given categorical
assurances that Laden was not involved in any terrorist activities
from the Afghan soil and that they were ready to protect him.
</P>
<P>
"We will never hand over Osama bin Laden to anyone," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Laden, son of a wealthy Saudi construction magnate, is believed
to have used his fortune to run the camps. He has been living in
Afghanistan with the permission of the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about a possible U.S. attack had been fueled by the
evacuation a day earlier of all but essential embassy staff in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one media report from Kabul said that a group of
unidentified gunmen seriously injured two U.N. officials in Kabul
early Friday, a day after the U.S. missile attack on the alleged
terrorist bases in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Prayer leaders at mosques in Kabul and Kandahar, the Taliban's
stronghold, exhorted the faithful to protest the U.S. missile
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of angry Afghans took to the streets in Kabul and
Kandahar Friday protesting the U.S. missile attack on their
country.
</P>
<P>
The bazaars and shops in Kandahar were shut in protest.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan on Friday expressed "indignation" over the U.S.
missile attacks on alleged terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said in a statement that he was
not aware of any violation of his country's airspace. However, "it
is being investigated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan, Aziz said, "expresses its
indignation over the attacks" no matter what justifications were
given. "The people of Pakistan are justifiably outraged over the
act," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also reiterated that Pakistan is against terrorism, as it
has been a victim of terrorism including state-sponsored
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan, like in the past, will continue to support
the cause of fighting international terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Somali Moslems Rap U.S. Raids on Sudan, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Somali Moslem leaders Friday
condem~?the U.S. air strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan,
characterizing them as "a terrorist act".
</P>
<P>
The Imams of several well-informed Mosques said the U.S.
attack was just another symbol further clarifying what they
called`Qrgsident Clinton's stance against the Moslems in general.
</P>
<P>
The American air strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan
Thursday night have created anger among the Moslem population in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's most prestigious Islam)c leader, Sheikh Mohamed
Moallim Hassan, also condemned the attack which he characterized
as an animosity against the Islam and Moslems in general.
</P>
<P>
The attack was also inhumane and against freedom, Hassan said,
terming it as against the human rights and justice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in South Mogadishu after the Friday
prayers, the religious leader said the Somalis should now stand
in solidarity with their fellow Moslems worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"This$doesn't mean we applaud for the violence in Kenya or
Tanzania," said Hassan, who also condemned the attacks in the
capitals of the two east African countries and their
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
As the news of the U.S. strikes struck Mogadishu early Friday
evening, people rushed to the TVs wherever available while the
rest gathered at the tea shops along the roadsides, listening to
the BBC-Somali Service which broke the news to them.
</P>
<P>
The Somali people kave been seriously annoyed by the air
strikes which they said are similar to the air bombardment in the
Somali capital Mogadishu in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"America is always like this, misled by their emotions of
anger," said Ms. Amina AhaEd, one of the radio listeners. "What's
the difference between a terrorist group and the government of
America if their reactions are just the same?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
While the general public expressed their anger Friday over the
U.S. air raids, the politicians in Mogadishu have remained
silent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that none of them is now interested in creating
new front lines with the U.S. government which earlier in 1993
clashed with the supporters of late General Mohamed Farah Aidid
who had later on in 1996 died in street battle for control of
parts of South Mogadishu.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- India's first pollution-free
bus to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) was launched here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bus, with an engine imported from the American manufacturer
"Cummins", will be run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) on
a trial basis from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a beginning in our efforts to replace the entire DTC
fleet by CNG vehicles by the year 2001 as directed by the Supreme
Court," Delhi Transport Minister Rajendra Gupta said after
receiving the bus from its manufacturer TELCO.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was aimed at making New Delhi pollution
free by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
TELCO General Manager Ram Nath said the bus has the engine in
the rear, power steering and the hydraulic door closing system.
</P>
<P>
Nath said his company would start mass production of the bus,
worth 150 million rupees (some 3.8 million U.S. dollars) each,
after a green signal is given by the government. The cost would be
much lower since engines would be indigenously made, he added.

UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Friday called
the U.S. military strikes as "flagrant violation to its
sovereignty and territorial integrity and urged the international
community to condemn the aggression.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Sudan's mission to the United Nations said the
United States launched a missile attack on "El-shifa
Pharmaceutical Factory" in Khartoum under the pretext that the
said factory produces chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the destroyed factory produces
pharmaceutical products and is a joint venture between Sudanese
private sector and some foreign investors including the Economic
Community for Central and Southern African States which main
objective is economic cooperation and integration between member
states for the benefit of their people.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. aggression resulted in the total destruction
of the factory, and the death of a large number of citizens and a
number of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said the aggression is also a glaring breach to the
principles and intents of the United Nations Charter, and the U.S.
justification of being measures of self-defense is baseless,
illogical and naive.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating its consistent stance of condemning all forms
of terrorism, Sudan deplored forcefully the aggression and called
on all member states, regional and international organizations to
condemn it.

<HEADLINE> Women Warned to Avoid Alcohol When Trying to Conceive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Women who are trying to conceive
should avoid drinking any alcohol, according to a new research
published Friday in the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
Although it has long been known that women who drink heavily
take longer to become pregnant, researchers from Denmark have found
for the first time that even moderate drinking can affect a
woman's chances of conceiving.
</P>
<P>
Dr Tina Kold Jensen from the National University Hospital in
Denmark and colleagues studied 430 Danish couples aged 20-35
years, who were trying to have a baby for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that those women drinking one to five
units (a unit is a glass of wine or half pint of beer) were a
third less likely to conceive within six months than those who
drank nothing.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Sees U.S. Strikes as "Unilateral Action" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pakistani
diplomat on Friday described the U.S. missile attacks on Sudan and
Afghanistan as "the unilateral action which goes against the
sovereignty of member states of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamal, Pakistan's permanent representative to the United
Nations, told reporters here that "the unilateral action has been
taken in what appears to be an international problem," and "an
international problem requires international response."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan remains firmly oppose to terrorism in all its forms
and continues to back all efforts against terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani envoy voiced his fear that "unilateral
actions of this type might increase the oppose tide of terrorism
in the world."
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Pakistani foreign minister, via the
nation's U.N. mission here, issued a written statement, saying
that "Pakistan takes a serious view of this unilateral action of
the U.S. involving the use of force against sovereign countries in
violation of the recognized principles and norms of inter-state
conduct, which constitutes a dangerous precedent."
</P>
<P>
Five or six civilians were killed Thursday after a U.S. missile
went astray into Pakistan, rather than its original target in the
neighboring Afghanistan, said Kamal.
</P>
<P>
"We suffered from terrorism on the one hand, and we suffered
from the (U.S.) reaction" on the other hand, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday ordered missile strikes
on Sudan and Afghanistan in response of the twin bombings on
August 7 in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed 257 people
and injured more than 5,000 others.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Asia Strives to Bring Women into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- In South Asia, where
socio-cultural discrimination against women prevails, progress has
been made in efforts to achieve the ultimate goal of bringing
women into the mainstream of development with independence and
equality.
</P>
<P>
At their inaugural meeting in December 1985, leaders of the
seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) emphasized that women should increasingly participate in
activities at the regional level and that programs and projects be
devised to ensure their active participation in the development
process.
</P>
<P>
"The primary focus of the social sector for the member
countries has been the conditions of women and children, and the
priority attached by the member countries to women and children is
uplifting their status," said Director Kunzang C. Namgyel at the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"For women, we have a plan of action, the basic objective of it
is to improve the social and economic conditions of women,
eliminate gender discrimination in areas of education, health,
nutrition, employment, and to ensure that they have equal access
to resources and services," she told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The regional plan of action adopted in December 1993 called for
national policies and distinct programs for women, as well as
special training programs for gender awareness to senior
policy-makers and planners in all ministries.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that qualified women be given key positions
at policy and decision-making levels in economic and planning
ministries, and measures be taken to improve coordination among
government, non-governmental organizations and other agencies to
facilitate the implementation of their plans and programs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the plan of action called for extended credit
facilities on easy terms to women for self-employment by using
their knowledge and skills, and social mobilization through
advocacy and awareness-raising activities for achieving the
development of women in general.
</P>
<P>
Namgyel said each member country has set up women affairs
ministry to look after the well-being of women.
</P>
<P>
She said a recent meeting of the Technical Committee on Women
in Development found that most of the member countries have
incorporated gender concerns in their national development plans,
which comprise policies and programs for the advancement of women.
</P>
<P>
"Some have positive steps and provide equal opportunities for
women at decision-making level," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the SAARC states reserve seats for women in
national parliaments and local self-governing bodies, and there
are also pro-women legislations in the member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
She said the member countries are trying to create a safer
working environment for women and have launched vocational,
technical and educational programs for women, especially in the
rural areas to encourage them to develop their skills to make them
at least self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
In addition, special credit facilities have been set up for
women for self-employment, she said.
</P>
<P>
"They (member countries) also discourage many traditional
practices which affect women and the girl child," she continued.
"There are a lot of traditional practices which sometimes affect
not only their health status, but the general attitudes toward
women, such as child marriage and dowry."
</P>
<P>
She said there are a lot of non-governmental organizations
working together to complement the efforts of the government to
ensure that there is greater sensitization of issues relating to
women.
</P>
<P>
On the evil of trafficking in women and children, Namgyel said
that it is an area now given lots of importance by the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that at their 9th summit in May 1997, SAARC leaders
emphasized the issue and expressed grave concern about it, and
they pledged to coordinate their efforts and strengthen and
strictly observe the existing legislations in member countries,
including simplification of repatriation procedures for victims of
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
At their 10th summit held last month in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the
leaders decided to sign the Regional Convention on Combating the
Crime of Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution at
their next summit in 1999, and suggested that the scope of the
convention be broadened to cover purposes other than prostitution.
</P>
<P>
They also recommended the exploration of the feasibility of
establishing a Regional Fund for Rehabilitation of Victims of
Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution on a voluntary
basis.
</P>
<P>
"This is something which I think is a big forward movement and
is the desire of member countries to address the problem
seriously," Namgyel observed.
</P>
<P>
She said South Asia has a big population of women and children
and malnutrition is definitely another area of concern.
</P>
<P>
At their 9th summit, SAARC leaders decided to examine the
possibility of a nutrition initiative to promote availability of
food of essential nutritional value to individual household and
evolve policies for supplementing and fortifying essential
micro-nutrients.
</P>
<P>
"The Technical Committee on Health has come up with a number of
proposals," Namgyel said.
</P>
<P>
She said national polices of member countries on nutrition are
being strengthened as well.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that it is treated more as a national problem,
and not just as a sectoral problem," she added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday stressed the diplomatic status of those
Iranians missing in Afghanistan must be respected and protected
under the Vienna Conventions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 Iranian diplomats and journalists were captured by
Afghan warring faction the Taleban at the Iranian
Consulate-General in Mazar-I-Sharif on August 8 and they have been
missing since then.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Kamal Kharrazi wrote to
Annan on August 10, requesting the United Nations to help secure
the return of these Iranian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Upon receipt of the request, the U.N. Secretary-General gave
instructions that the United Nations should do whatever is
possible in order to facilitate a satisfactory resolution of this
issue.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
expressed his deep concern about the fate of the missing Iranian
nationals and appealed to all the parties concerned, in particular
the Taleban, to help find these missing people and assist in their
safe return to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the United Nations had been in contact with
Taleban authorities, the Pakistani authorities, the International
Committee of the Red Cross and other sources, and these efforts
had produced no positive results so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt renewed a call Friday for
holding a world summit to discuss fighting terrorism in a
collective and organized way, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In response to Thursday's U.S. air raids on suspected terrorist
bases in Sudan and Afghanistan, Egypt called on the United Nations
to host a world summit on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.N. Security Council to take appropriate measures
in line with the U.N. Charter to fight and root out terrorism and
bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday night on a
pharmaceutical factory near the Sudanese capital Khartoum and
suspected terrorist bases in retaliation for bombings on August 7
against its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused Sudan of sponsoring international
terrorism and alleged that the factory was manufacturing chemical
weapons agents that could be used by Islamic militants to launch
new attacks against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Egypt reiterated its warning that organized terrorism could
inflict severe loss of human lives and properties.
</P>
<P>
It called for defining the responsibility that countries that
shelter and support terrorists should take.
</P>
<P>
Egypt itself is a victim of terrorism as Islamic militants have
been launching a terror campaign in an attempt to overthrow the
secular government.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Botha Loses Battle with Special Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P.W. Botha Friday lost his battle with the special
court, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), when he was
convicted for ignoring a subpoena by the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Botha was sentenced to a fine of 10,000 Rand (1,600 U.S.
Dollars) or 12 months' imprisonment for refusing to attend a TRC
hearing on the now defunct state security council (SSC), after a
protracted trial of eight months, which he chaired at the height
of the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
The regional court in George, Western Cape Province, also
sentenced the 82-year-old man to another 12 months in jail,
suspended for five years.
</P>
<P>
What the unrepentant former state president would not like to
see is the scenario that he could still be subpoenaed to appear
before the truth body, which will have its amnesvy committee
continue with hearings for at least another six months before a
total closure.
</P>
<P>
Another refusal to testify by Botha could bring his suspended
sentence into effect.
</P>
<P>
Judge Victor Lugaju said the sentence to the ailing and aged
former president was appropriate, considering that Botha had
shown no remorse throughout the trial and had ignored all the
opportunities to settle the matter amicably.
</P>
<P>
The TRC filed charges against Botha last December after he
defied three TRC subpoenas. After the court accepted the case,
the truth body made a last-ditch effort to have him testify and
settle the matter outside court, but Botha rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The judge said Botha, who held positions from defense
minister, prime minister to state president between 1966 and
1989, should testify in person to help the TRC to find the truth
about the former government's activities.
</P>
<P>
The judge rejected Botha's arguments that the subpoena was
technically flawed, and that TRC chairman Desmond Tutu had agreed
to receive Botha's written answers of questions and spare his
personal testimony.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a grey pinstripc suit, Botha stared straight ahead
throughout proceedings, showing little emotion.
</P>
<P>
Outside the court building, about 50 demonstrators chanted:
"Send him to jail." Some held banners saying: "We can forgive him
his past, send him to jail for his arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Although the sentence was handed down, the legal tussle
between Botha and the TRC seemed far from over. Botha's lawyers
have vowed to appeal against his conviction.
</P>
<P>
TRC acting chairman Alex Boraine Friday repeated his call for
Botha to cooperate with the commission, saying the conviction had
showed no one is above the law.
</P>
<P>
Boraine said he hoped Botha could change his mind and agree to
testify if the TRC's amnesty commission needs his evidence in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was state president between 1984 and 1989, has been
considered largely responsible for the former government's harsh
persecution of anti-apartheid activists. He was implicated in a
string of notorious bombings and assassinations of anti-apartheid
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Former law and order minister Adriaan Vlok claimed last month
that Botha personally gave the order to bomb the South African
Council of Churches headquarters at Khotso House in Johannesburg
in 1988. The blast claimed hundreds of lives and shocked the
world.
</P>
<P>
Botha's sentence drew mixed reactions from major political
parties in the country.
 |*4e National Party (NP), the biggest opposition party, and the
Freedom Front (FF), another white-based party, criticized TRC's
handling of the Botha case, saying the commission was biased.
</P>
<P>
The NP, of which Botha was leadezr between 1978 and 1989, said
the legal action could have been avoided had the TRC adopted a
more amicable approach. The NP complained before that the truth
body is too soft in dealing with members of the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) compared with apartheid government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The FF said the TRC was out to humiliate and discredit the
Afrikaner by insisting on Botha's appearance in hearings. It said
Botha could be "admired" for defqkng the truth body, despite the
risk of his being found guilty and sentenced.
</P>
<P>
However, the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)
welcomed the verdict, saying it was a clear message that no one
was above the law. The PAC said the conviction was "predictable"
because "everything he (Botha) had done was wrong."

AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Responding to the U.S. air raid on
Sudan, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan said Friday that disputes
should be solved through dialog rather than the use of force.

<P>
During a telephone conversation with Sudanese Vice President
Ali Osman Mohammed Taha, Hassan said that Jordan believed that
force could not be used at all times and places, the official

Taha called Hassan to brief him on the U.S. attack Thursday

Taha said the factory was for producing only medicines and
not chemical weapons as the U.S. has alleged.

The U.S. said that it launched air raid on the Sudanese plant
for fear that the chemical weapons could be used by Islamic
militants to launch new attacks against U.S. targets. The U.S. has

<HEADLINE> Ugandan FM in Luanda to Explain Stance in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama
Mbabazi said here Friday that his country "has never invaded the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."
</P>
<P>
After talks with Angolan Prime Minister Franca van-Dunem on
the unfolding conflict in Congo, Mbabazi told reporters that
"just like other countries in the region, Uganda is concerned
about the situation in Congo."
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan foreign minister asked van-Dunem to convey a
letter from Ugandan President Yueri Museveni to Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi came to Luanda as the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states are split on whether to send
troops to help Congolese President Laurent Kabila vight the
Tutsi-led rebels, who are pushing toward capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chicote confirmed
Wednesday that there was a plan to help Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a collective decision that every kind of help
should be given to President Kabila, including military support,"
said Chicote.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angola poured troops into its northern
enclave Cabinda Friday, moving toward the border with the rebel
held Congo River corridor of the Congolese territory.
</P>
<P>
Angolan troops moved through the same territory last year to
help Kabila oust late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the spluttering Angolan peace process, the
Uganndan foreign minister said that his government "supports the
efforts made by the Angolan government to build up peace and
normalize the political and military situation in the country."
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi dismissed as groundless the rumors saying that Uganda
has something to do with Jonas Savimbi, President of the
opposition movement National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"My country has nothing to do with the UNITA president," the
Ugandan minister said, adding that he has only heard of the name.
</P>
<P>
After the one-day brief visit to Angola, Mbabazi will leave
for Namibia to discuss with other southern African leaders about
the current scenario in democraticgo.

<P>
GENEVA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is evacuating international
staff from Afghanistan after U.S. strikes on sites in eastern
Afghanistan and Sudan, said the U.N. agency here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Four non-American staff members were leaving the country on
Friday following a U.S. State Department warning on Tuesday of a
serious threat to non-Moslem expatriates, said UNHCR spokeswoman
Maki Shinohara at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
An American staff member had already left for neighboring
Pakistan, she said. UNHCR activities were being carried out by
local staff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) said it had pulled out about a dozen international

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Ready for War With DRC: Says Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda is ready for war
with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) if Zimbabwe andNamibia failed to imm
ediately recall troops allegedly sent to the
DRC, Rwandan Ambassador to South Africa, Ben Karenzi, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Karenzi as
saying that Rwandan troops are ready to go into the DRC to
protect "Rwanda's vital interest in eastern Congo."
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan ambassador said his government had information
that Hutu rebels, allegedly responsible for Rwandan genocide in
1994, are still active in eastern DRC. They are allegedly
regrouped and rearmed.
</P>
<P>
"One would like to point out that Rwanda has a very vital
interest in eastern DRC," he said. "It has an interest to
protect the safety of its people as well`as the country's
internal security."
</P>
<P>
Karenzi called on South African President Nelson Mandela to
intervene and to persuade Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and
Namibian President Sam Nujoma into withdrawing their military
support for DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela should take the lead as Chairman of SADC
(Southern African Development Community). We expect SADC to take
full responsibility for the actions of its members."
~?According to his information, Karenzi said, Zimbabwean and
Namibian troops have already been deployed in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government was surprised by the move of the
two SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila has declare$ himself an enemy of Rwanda. Any other
party who supports him therefore also is an enemy of Rwanda and
they might be met with Rwandan military force," Karenzi warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that although his country is completely dissatisfied
with Kabila's regime, his government supports an immediate
cease-fire to allow the DRC people to find a political solution.
</P>
<P>
"The Congo (DRC) is not just a member of the SADC, but also of
the Great Lakes Economic Community and other regional groups.
Intervention by SADC members would not necessarily benefit the
people of the Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of being behind rebel forces
in his country, but the two countries immediately denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
Karenzi's war threats came one day before Mandela is to host
peace talks among the presidents of the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda in
Pretoria, followed by a SADC meeting on the crisis in centr`l
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to SAPA, a Namibian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Friday denied Namibia's military intervention in the DRC as
alleged by Karenzi.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Tonata Emvula reiterated a
statement by President Nujoma that Namibia was looking for a
peaceful solutions.
</P>
<P>
"We are not involved militarily and never had any intention to
do so," Emvula was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Namibian Defense Minister Erkki Nghhmtina said Friday
that SADC members would not allow one of their members to be
attacked and destroyed, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
On his return from Botswana and Zimbabwe, the Namibian
minister said SADC would make sure that any aggressor targeting
SADC member states would think twice before carrying out such an
act.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Namibia had pledged logistical support for
Kabila such as food and medical equipment. He neither denied nor
confirmed reports about the tons of weapons and ammunition flown
out of Namibia to the DRC at the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Russian Blue Chips Down 5-15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian share prices shed another
5-15 percent in extremely thin trading on Friday as the market
waits for clarification on the planned swap of government treasury
bills.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax composite ruble index dropped 4.92 percent to
21.74, a fresh record low for this year. The RTS1-Interfax index,
which does not include Gazprom shares, went down by 5.56 percent
from the previous day's close of 81.76.
</P>
<P>
So far, the prices of the most liquid shares on the Russian
market have decreased 25-40 percent over the past week since the
government and central bank's move Monday to effectively devaluate
the ruble and suspend payment of short-term treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The week's trade was extremely sluggish with composite RTS
turn-over standing below 40 million U.S. dollars, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruble further devalued Friday and the central bank set
Saturday's official exchange rate at 7.005 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The composite RTS-Interfax ruble index dropped over the week by
more than 24 percent to 21.6 points, a record low. The
RTS1-Interfax index decreased some 30 percent to 80.8 points.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Debates in the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, which demanded President Boris Yeltsin to step down
voluntarily and threatens a no-confidence motion on the
government, further slackened the stock market.
</P>
<P>
But the fallouts of the Duma session was minimal as the results
were expected, observers say.
</P>
<P>
At closing on the Russian Trading System, Unified Energy
Systems of Russia was at 0.053/0.053 dollar, down 11.7 percent in
volume of 1q#3N(G.208 million shares; Lukoil was at 4.925/5.15
dollars, down 2.5 percent in volume of 309,000 shares; Mosenergo
was at 0.026/0.0275 dollar, down 10.3 percent with 8.89 million
shares changing hands; and Rostelecom plunged 16.7 percent to
0.75/0.875 dollar with 390,000 shares traded.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange, which are included
on the RTS-Interfax composite index, dropped 16 percent to a
record low of 0.781 rubles in slim trading of 5.744 million
rubles.

UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday called
for "greater international cooperation and coordination" in
fighting terrorism in the world.

<HEADLINE> Israel Prods PNA to Intensify Fight Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Following the killing of a
Jewish settler, Israel on Friday renewed its demand that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) do more to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A Jewish rabbi was stabbed to death Thursday night in the
flashpoint West Bank city Hebron, escalating the tension among
the settlers and Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his summer
vacation in the north Friday and conferred with his aides in
Jerusalem to discuss the security of settlers.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised that the government would strengthen
security measures and "do everything possible" to protect Jewish
settlers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He accused the PNA of failing to fulfill its obligations on
fighting terrorism, while urging PNA President Yasser Arafat to
take steps to capture and punish the assailants.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers have imposed a curfew on the Tel Rumeida
Jewish neighborhood in Hebron, while Palestinian police searched
in the much larger Arabic areas for the attacker, who fled the
rabbi's home after knifing him and set fire to the house.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, where about 450 Jewish settlers live among 120,000 Arab
residents, has been a major flashpoint for the Israeli-Palestinian
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The stabbing was the second time in less than a month that
Jewish settlers were fatally attacked in the West Bank. Two Jewish
settlers were ambushed and killed on August 4 in the Yitzhar
settlement near another West Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who visited the
home of the murdered rabbi in Hebron, accused the Palestinians of
failing to carry out their commitment to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"They must do it now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of right-wing Israelis took part in the funeral of
the slain rabbi Friday and security was beefed up along the road
while his coffin was brought from Hebron to Jerusalem for burial.
</P>
<P>
Settlement leaders and right-wing lawmakers, criticizing the
government for not doing enough to protect Jewish settlers, urged
Netanyahu to halt the talks with the PNA on the long overdue
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Rafael Eitan called on the government to
enlarge the Tel Rumeida neighborhood as it did following the
killing of the two Jewish settlers near Nablus. The Israeli
cabinet decided to expand Yitzhar to retaliate for their killing.
</P>
<P>
In a sign pointing to the rising tension, a Palestinian youth
was kidnapped and beaten by several settlers in Yitzhar Friday
before rescued by Israeli soldiers, Israel Radio reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudan decided Friday to recall
its diplomats in Washington to protest the U.S. air raid on a
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a cabinet meeting chaired by Sudanese President Omar
Hassan al-Bashir, Minister of Culture and Information Ghazi Saleh
el-Din said the government has also decided to file compliants
with the United Nations, the Arab League and other international
organizations over the U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
The country's International Civil Aviation Authority will
adopt measures to prevent U.S. aircrafts from flying over the
Sudanese airspace to preserve its national security, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched a missile attack on the pharmaceutical
factory in retaliation for the bombings on August 7 of
its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has been accusing Khartoum of sponsoring
international terrorism, alleged that the factory was
manufacturing chemical weapons that could be used by Islamic
militants to attack U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
But Sudanese officials said on Friday that Sudan could prove
that the factory is only for producing medicines and not
chemical weapons as claimed by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Sudanese media reports said the factory, which opened in 1996,
produced about half of the country's medicines, mainly antibiotics
and drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis.

WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. missile strikes did
"moderate to heavy damage" to their targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan, a U.S. official said on Friday.

"We have had some very preliminary information indicating that
there was moderate to heavy damage to each of the targets," Under

Pickering dismissed the argument that the attacks on the two
so-called "terrorist-related" targets would accelerate a cycle of
violence, leading to more attacks on Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to take steps to deal with this in all areas means
that we are opening ourselves up to be a bigger target and a
bigger bull's eye," he said.

"Clearly it is important for us to act forcefully when that's

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Term Extended to Hear Tripp Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The term of a Howard County
grand jury in Maryland, that is considering possible wiretapping
violations by Linda Tripp will be extended indefinitely, a
prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jurors have met twice monthly since March and took up the Tripp
question earlier this month. They had been scheduled to adjourn
September 17 after two more sessions.
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli's request for an extension
was granted Thursday by Circuit Judge James B. Dudley, said Howard
County State's Attorney Marna McLendon.
</P>
<P>
"We're not finished," The Associated Press quoted Montanarelli
as saying. "We've got a job to do and I'm going to do it. I was
handed this investigation.... I didn't ask for it."
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Mrs. Tripp, who lives in Howard County,
broke Maryland law by secretly taping telephone conversations with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The tapes triggered an investigation by Special Prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, and led to President Bill Clinton's public
admission Monday that he had an improper relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Recording a telephone conversation in Maryland without the
other person's consent is a felony punishable by up to five years
in prison and fine of up to 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors must prove that someone accused of taping a
call without permission knew it was illegal. Tripp's lawyers have
maintained that their client wasn't aware of the law when she was
taping the conversations.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Murtha, an attorney for Tripp, said his client has not
been asked to appear before the jury and was "highly disappointed"
to hear of the extension.
</P>
<P>
"I still think, and we all believe, that this is a politically
motivated investigation," he said. "We believe it would be
appropriate just to close the investigation and allow Linda to get
on with her life."

MAPUTO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi said here Fridai that his country will not send
army to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to support Laurent
Kabila's government in suppressing the armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique will not take any unilateral action to send army
to the DRC, nor will it ever do like this to any country in
conflict without consulting directly with other countries,"
Mocumbi declared at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's position should be in line with the resolution
adopted by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), of which it is a member
country, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On some SADC and OAU members which have taken their individual
positrions, Mocumbi said, every country is entitled to take the best
stand in its view. "However," he added, "This should not be
regarded as the stand for all other members."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Zimbabwe decided to give Kabila military
and personnel support while South Africa refused to militarily
intervene in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
This, said Mocumbi, should not be viewed as any differences on
the Congo (K) issue among SADC countries, and "Zimbabwe iP*free
to take its own stand."
</P>
<P>
"I believe the heads of state and governments of SADC members
will keep contact with each other through various channels and
people will soon know SADC's stand on the issue," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Seports said Zimbabwe, with the support of Angola, Zambia and
Namibia, is for military intervention in the DRC, whereas South
Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and Tanzania favour negotiation to
settle the issue.

CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Commodity transport movement in Algeria's largest
port of Algiers registered a remarkable decline of 11.04 percent
in July 1998, as compared to the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest bulletin of the Algiers Port Administration,
the Algerian news agency reported that the total tonnage of
commodity dealings last July amounted to 454,481 tonnes as compared
to 510,906 tonnes in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The cotton plantations in Syria have been seriously
damaged by the recent heat wave which swept through the country ,
particularly that it coincided with the growth of the cotton buds.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Syrian agricultural
sources as saying that the average damage was some 23 percent of
the planned production by the Ministry of Agriculture. As a
matter of fact, the percentage of damages vary in regard to the
dates of cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Last year Syria produced more than 1 million tonnes of cotton.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili
has disclosed that Egypt is currently producing 50 percent of its
needs of wheat, and is importing the rest in cash in conformity
with its own terms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar held in the Cairo university Wednesday,
the Minister said that Egypt in 1982 was producing one fifth of
its bread, with the rest coming from donor countries on their own
terms. By then, he said, the wheat reserves were not even
sufficient for a week.
</P>
<P>
But the situation has greatly improved through the economic
reform policies. Now Egypt's foreign exchange reserves at the
central bank can cover Egypt's imports for 18 months, a fact that
is unprecedented in Egypt's recent history.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt imported 500,000 tonnes of wheat last year,
and would import this year only 197,000 tonnes. He said Egypt's
objective is to obtain 75 percent of self sufficiency for the
wheat consumption.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Dubai Municipality has decided to establish a
new gold market in the city next next year.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said that an appropriate site is
being considered so as to start preparing the designs that will
portray the distinct characteristics of the existing gold market,
presently located in one of Dubai's old districts.
</P>
<P>
The sources add that the new market will have an information
center linked with the various world stock exchanges, to be
abreast with gold and other precious metal dealings in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the center will make studies on market trends and
effects of the diverse developments in world gold trading. The
Dubai gold market will also embrace units for gold designs with a
view to promoting the export of golden jewellery.
</P>
<P>
Last year Dubai exported more than 52 tonnes of golden jewellery,
and there is a growing demand on the part of regional markets in
Egypt, Pakistan and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Dubai is one of the biggest gold markets in the world in terms
of gold import which exceeded 600 tonnes last year.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Refuses to Contribute to New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has
decided not to contribute to the 1.25-billion-dollar Holocaust
settlement between two major banks and Jewish claimant.
</P>
<P>
"The Swiss National Bank will not make a financial contribution
to the costs of the settlement between Swiss banks and
representatives of class-action suits in the United States," the
Swiss central bank said in a statement issued Friday in the Swiss
capital of Berne at the end of its supervisory board meeting.
</P>
<P>
SNB Chairman Hans Meyer said that the central bank that as a
public institution it could not and did not want to take part in a
settlement between private parties, adding that the SNB's helping
to finance the accord would have lent an official character to the
settlement that was not in the overall interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has also refused to help finance the deal,
which protects the Swiss government and industry, the SNB, and
other Swiss banks from possible boycotts by U.S. cities and
states.
</P>
<P>
UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland's two biggest banks which
made the deal with the claimants on August 12 in New York, have
said they would like other firms and the central bank who benefit
from the deal to contribute to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a statement Friday welcoming the SNB's
decision not to make a contribution.
</P>
<P>
"This decision flows seamlessly from the position taken thus
far by the government and National Bank that the state and its
institutions will not take part in an out-of-court settlement,"
the statement said.

BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Urging efforts to advance the
Mideast peace process, a U.S. senator warned here Friday of the
danger in the Middle East if the process continues to be
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, Chuck Hagel, chairman of U.S. Senate's
International Economic Policy Subcommittee, called for joint
efforts by all parties concerned to salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hagel arrived here in the day to continue his Mideast tour,
which has taken him to the Palestinian self-rule areas, Israel and
Egypt. He will also visit Syria and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is on a fact-finding mission aimed at getting
to know how the people in the region are viewing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I believe if we understand each other, the policy makers in
the U.S. Congress are able to make a practical decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled since
March last year after Israel began the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
the capital of a future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The talks are currently stuck over the overdue Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Israel and its two neighbors
Lebanon and Syria has been suspended in early 1996 due to the
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senator underscored the importance of Lebanon in the
peace process, saying that it is a critical part and an effective
member in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a border strip in south Lebanon to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
the Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed willingness to pull out its troops from
South Lebanon unilaterally, provided the Lebanese governmnet
negotiates security arrangments with it. But Lebanon, backed by
its powerful ally Syria, has rejected the demand.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Raps at U.S. Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan on Friday
lashed out at Thursday's U.S. missile strikes, saying that such a
move "is against all norms and principles of international law"
and "sets a terrible example for the world."
</P>
<P>
The Afghan U.N. mission said in a faxed statement that "We
condemn in the strongest possible terms the United States missile
attack against the sovereignty of the Islamic Emirate of
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile strike "is against all norms and principles of
international law," the statement said. "The U.S. has violated its
own long-held view that no individual, group or country should
take this kind of action into their own hands."
</P>
<P>
The United States on Thursday launched missile attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation to the August 7 twin bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania, in which U.S. officials alleged Osama bin
Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire, was involved.
</P>
<P>
In the case of bin Laden, the Afghan mission said in the
statement that the Asian nation "has made it clear by
communicating to various concerned parties that we were ready to
discuss the matter -- provided the U.S. presents some kind of
evidence."
</P>
<P>
But "these communications were completely ignored," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement described the U.S. request of the
millionaire's extradition as "untrue," saying "the United States
has yet to officially request that we hand bin Laden over to
them." Washington has so far failed to provide Kabul with
evidence which Afghanistan said is legally essential to the
extradition of the U.S.-claimed suspect, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said Kabul will "limit bin Laden's
capacity to carry out subversive actions or propagandize against
any country from Afghan soil."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that 30 Afghan civilians were killed and 23
others were injured in the wake of the U.S. missile attacks.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Minister on Multi-Racialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
said that the current severe economic downturn has put Singapore
society under great stresses and the country's multi-racialism
demonstrates some merits and demerits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Sikh community national day dinner at Singapore
Khalsa Club Saturday evening, Minister for Information and the
Arts and Second Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo said,
"we do not know what other unhappy consequences will arise out of
this severe economic downturn" and "We can not assume that
Singapore society is invulnerable to such stresses."
</P>
<P>
Taking the topic on multi-racialism of which the Singapore
government is proud and in pursuit, the minister said, "our
multi-racialism is both a strength and a weakness."
</P>
<P>
"It is a strength because the different ethnic groups link us
to different parts of the world," he said, "without this
diversity Singapore cannot be a cosmopolitan entrepot and an
international financial center."
</P>
<P>
"However, our multi-racialism also means that we do not always
react in the same way to external events and foreign pressures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the hope expressed by a few Singaporeans that
the different races in Singapore will one day meld together into
a kind of local Singapore community, the minister said "this is
unlikely to happen because the races in Singapore have very
different historical memories."
</P>
<P>
"We have different gods, different patron saints and different
heroes." he said, adding "our religions are not going to fuse into
one and the rituals governing birth, marriage and death will
always remain different."
</P>
<P>
Calling for being "realistic and practical", George Yeo said
"in managing the complexities of multi-racialism in Singapore, we
should try to maximize our strengths and minimize our weaknesses."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: No Sign of Relief Yet in China's Flooding Situation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Yangtze flooding has brought direct economic losses of at
least 200 billion yuan (24.1 billion U.S. dollars). More than 240
million people have been affected by the disaster.
</P>
<P>
And statistics show that more than 8.5 million people, or a
quarter of the total population in Heilongjiang Province, have
been affected by this year's devastating floods, with agricultural
losses of 14 billion yuan (1.69 billion U.S. dollars). Water has
destroyed 3.1 million hectares of farmland in 52 counties and
cities, damaged 1.44 million houses, killed 14,000 livestock, and
swamped more than 1,400 oil wells at Daqing Oil Field, the largest
in China.
</P>
<P>
Floods aroused great concern from State leaders. President
Jiang Zemin has postponed his visits to Russia and Japan because
of the flooding.
</P>
<P>
And Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, made several phone calls again on Friday to
leaders in flood-ravaged Heilongjiang and the Minister of Water
Resources in recent days, inquiring about the situation of major
Chinese rivers.
</P>
<P>
As the weather gets colder in northeast China, Li urged Party
and governments at all levels to pay even more attention to the
health of People's Liberation Army soldiers combating the
floods. He also called for adequate relief materials to be sent to
Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), visited
flood-stricken areas in central China's Hebei Province on Friday,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: No Sign of Relief Yet in China's Flooding Situation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The floods are still flowing at
a high-water level today in China, a sign of continuing difficulty
in the anti-disaster effort.
</P>
<P>
The third flood crest on the Songhua River today passed through
Harbin, a major heavy-industrial city in China's northernmost
province of Heilongjiang, with the water level climbing to 120.89
meters, 0.84 meters higher than the historic high, while the water
flow rate reaching 17,300 cubic meters per second by 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the city has not yet lowered much, according
to evening reports from China Central Television
(CCTV). Authorities attributed this to poor distribution on the
river section, noting that the width there ranges from 1-to-10 km,
which adds difficulties for the flow of the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
"It is at a crucial moment to counter the flooding," said an
on-the-spot water control expert. A total of 400,000 soldiers and
civilians are safeguarding the city.
</P>
<P>
The sixth flood crest on the Yangtze River has reached Jiujiang
in east China's Jiangxi Province. It will have passed through
Jiujiang by Sunday afternoon. The water level at the city stood at
22.46 m at 2 p.m. today, 0.04 m more than Friday's level,
according to the latest information from the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters (SFCDRH).
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 troops of the People's Liberation Army and
armed police are working together with local residents to defend
the major embankments of the city.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters dropped an insignificant 0.04-to-0.09 m today on
the section from Shashi to Hankou and at Dongting Lake on the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Water levels on the upper
reaches and the downstream section from Hankou, however, are still
rising.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at Chongqing, Shashi, Lianhuatang, Luoshan,
Hankou, and Chenglingji along the Yangtze stood at 180, 43.9,
35.7, 34.86, 29.32 m, the SFCDRH said.

The SFCDRH is sending more materials to flood-ravaged areas
along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers. By Wednesday, the headquarters had sent 200
million yuan (24.1 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods to the
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang provincial civil affairs department has sent
eight working teams to help flood victims in the 10 hardest-hit
counties and cities. It has also provided 10 million yuan (1.2
million U.S. dollars) of relief funds, 17,000 cotton quilts and
900 tents to Qiqihar, the worst-hit industrial center, and Daqing
Oil Field.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign donations sent to the Ministry of Civil
Affairs and its sub-departments across the country have surpassed
1.06 billion yuan (130 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A large benefit performance hosted by the ministries of Culture
and Civil Affairs Friday evening in the Great Hall of the People
raised nearly 1.1 billion yuan (133 million U.S. dollars) for
China's flood victims.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC Members have also opened their purses to provide funds
for flood victims in recent days, with seven non-governmental
entrepreneur members donating more than 30 million yuan (3.6
million U.S. dollars) of relief funds and materials, a number of
celebrated painters and calligraphers who are members selling 26
new works for charity, and members in Hong Kong providing 18
million Hong Kong dollars of relief funds.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has pledged that every penny of
the relief funds will be used for the country's flood victims,
whose total number exceeds 240 million.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang said that the epidemic control
situation in China's flood-stricken areas is stable but infectious
diseases such as snail fever are threatening.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, about 400 cases of snail fever have been reported
to the ministry from Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Anhui,
Jiangsu and Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, the areas which have suffered the most from the
floods. But experts have expected more cases in the near future
since snail fever has a fairly long latent period of 40 days.
</P>
<P>
The health minister acknowledged that the incidence of
intestinal epidemic diseases, dysentery, hepatitis and colds has
increased from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The major problem for epidemic control in the flood-stricken
areas is a shortage of funds and medicine, adding that the problem
could become worse in the next three months, usually the peak
period for the spread of epidemics in China, Zhang said.

CHANGDE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A temporary hospital has been
delivering free medical service to flood victims and sick
flood-relief workers on an embankment of Dongting Lake in central
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, stationed in a grease factory at Guanwan Township

<P>
All the medicine at the temporary hospital, valued at tens of
thousands of yuan, is supplied by Xiangya Hospital.

JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's hopes of
negotiating a peaceful solution to the crisis in Democratic Congo
(DRC) were dashed Saturday when neither DRC President Laurent
Kabila nor his representative arrived in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
An official at Waterkloof air base, where participants of the

Sunday, according to South African Press Association. Earlier

<P>
It appeared that the Rwandan and Ugandan delegations for the
peace talks were still in Pretoria Saturday afternoon.

The air base official said no return flight plans had yet been

South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- One Palestinian youth was
lightly injured in West Bank city of Hebron in a violent clash
Saturday between dozens of Palestinians and Israeli soldiers,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out when Israeli soldiers prevented the
Palestinians from crossing into the Israeli-controlled sector of
the city, which has been under curfew since late Thursday after a
Jewish settler was stabbed to death in his home by what the
Israelis said was a Palestinian assailant.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians threw stones and bottles at the Israeli soldiers,
who fired tear gas and rubber bullets, the radio
said. Palestinian police helped bring the several-hour clash to
an end by dispersing the Palestinian protesters.
</P>

Hebron, home to more than 400 Jewish settlers surrounded by
about 120,000 Arab residents, has become one of the flash points
between Israel and the Palestinians since it was divided into two
areas separately controlled by the two sides under an agreement
signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Radio reported that Palestinian police
arrested three suspects in a Palestinian refugee camp near the
West Bank town of Bethlehem Saturday after Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police were attacked by firebombs during a joint
patrol.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
-- The Administration made measured claims of success Friday
for the cruise-missile attacks in the Sudan and Afghanistan.
Officials said the attack on a mountain redoubt in Afghanistan
would disrupt training and, possibly, future attacks by terrorists
sponsored by Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton continues to draw high ratings from the
American public for his job performance, but his acknowledgment of
a relationship with a White House intern has produced signs of a
darkening public view of both the president's moral character and
his overall personal image, the latest New York Times/CBS News
Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
-- After years of resistance, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
is preparing to distribute to states with nuclear power plants a
drug that blocks a type of radiation that causes thyroid cancer,
and already, people in Connecticut and other states are clamoring
for the medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton testified this week that he gave Monica S.
Lewinsky several gifts during a meeting at the White House the
Sunday after Christmas, the last time they were together before
their secret affair triggered a criminal investigation, sources
familiar with his account said Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- Reports from Afghanistan indicated that at least 21 people
were killed and more han 50 wounded in the American strike on a
group of training camps around Khost, near the Pakistan border.
Pakistani journalists who visited two of the targeted camps said
they saw widespread damage and at least 20 craters from cruise
missile impacts.
</P>
<P>
-- Law enforcement and transportation officials in Washington
have adopted tighter security measures, stepping up patrols at
tourist attractions, at federal buildings and in the 95-mile
subway system. Military installations across the region also
stepped up security, causing backups at some bases as military
police conducted stricter-than-normal identification checks at
gates.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Sudan Call for Arab's Unity Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Sudan Saturday called
for an Arab solidarity to confront "the U.S.-imperialist
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a meeting between Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and the visiting Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said they discussed the U.S. air strikes
on a Sudanese pharmaceutical factory on Thursday and Iraq's
suspension of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the necessity for Arab solidarity to face up to
the "U.S.-imperialist aggression targeting the Arab nation,
mainly the continued military aggression on Iraq, Sudan and other
unjust embargoes imposed for vicious political goals," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz denounced the U.S. move in Sudan together with the
previous military attacks on Iraq and Libya, saying they "have
turned the U.S. into an international criminal committing
terrorist acts in a flagrant and immoral manner."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the United States launched air strikes on
what they termed as "terrorist-related" bases in Afghanistan and
Sudan believed to have been behind the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In the twin bombings on August 7, over 250 people were killed,
including 12 Americans, and more than 5,000 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister, who arrived in Baghdad on Friday
afternoon, reiterated his country's support for the Iraqi people
and called for lifting the unjust sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Iraqi government announced suspension
of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
complaining that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and attempting to prolong the
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. sanctions on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that
it is free of chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been insisting that the Security Council must consider
its legitimate demands by lifting the sanctions immediately,
otherwise, its decision to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM will
not change.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference held on Friday evening, Ismail described
as "savage" the U.S. aggression against his country, calling on
Arab governments to denounce it.
</P>
<P>
Sudan was one of the Arab states that sided with Iraq during
the 1991 Gulf War, and is branded by the U.S. as one of the
countries that sponsor terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims in Jiujiang Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Flood victims in Jiujiang city
in Jiangxi Province, east China, are returning to their homes
after being forced to flee by floodwaters on China's longest
river, the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jianxin, owner of a small shop 100 meters from the
city's levees, said that traffic and the supply of drinking water
in the city have been resumed. However, the normal supply of
electricity has not been restored, he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang's shop has been reopened for business. His house,
submerged by floodwaters from the Yangtze, had been cleaned
thoroughly before his return.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xiujun, Huang's next-door neighbor, said that she went
back to her home with her mother and sister Friday and disinfected
her house with bleach provided by local health departments.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that many residents have returned home from their
temporary shelters. She said that one of the most urgent jobs is
clearing away layers of mud outside the house and taking
precautions against diseases after the floodwater subsides.
</P>
<P>
The Sanjiaoxian Flyover on the Jiujiang-Ruichang Highway, which
was forced to shut for 11 days, is now open to traffic.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, an area of 9 square kilometers in
the western part of Jiujiang was swept by floodwaters on August 7,
1998, when the city's levees were breached.
</P>
<P>
About 71,000 local residents were evacuated to safety. And the
city government located 100 more pumps in urban areas to remove
floodwaters day and night.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Civilian Wounded in Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A young Lebanese civilian was
wounded Saturday afternoon during an Israeli shelling on villages
in south Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Samir Youssef Hamoud, 20, was wounded by shrapnel of Israeli
shells fired to the village of Arab Salim in the Iqlim al Tuffah
area facing the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, he was transferred to the hospital in
the nearby city of Nabatieh for treatment, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
He was the second injured by Israeli bombardment in less than
two days.
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, Israeli artillery troops have been pounding the
villages suspected to host an operation base for Lebanese
guerrillas after two Israelis were killed by a roadside bomb in
the south.
</P>
<P>
A 70-year-old Lebanese civilian, also from the village of Arab
Salim, was wounded Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Lebanese civilians have been killed and 73 others
wounded so far this year in clashes between Lebanese guerrillas
and Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border
attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israel's occupation.

<HEADLINE> 15 Somalis Died of Intoxicated Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people have died
and more than 35 others are now in critical condition after
drinking intoxicated water in the central Somali town of Abudwaq
in Galgudud region.
</P>
<P>
According to Colonel Abdirizak Hassan Awl, one of the main
militia commanders in the area, the people are apparently
intoxicated by water they drank from a barrel several days ago,
reports reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, a group of young men have left the
village of Ellanleh, 70 Km North of Abudwag district, on August
17 in search of grass to cover their troughs from the heat of the
sun and dust. Since the place was quite far away, the young men
have carried with them water in a barrel to keep them going for a
few days.
</P>
<P>
The VHF radio reports said the deaths began after people drank
water from the barrel, and before dying the victims seemed to
have gone off their heads and lost control and they started
throwing away their clothes and acting childishly before falling
down unconsciously and died.
</P>
<P>
Since the area has no water wells, some young men filled the
barrel with gallons of water from nomads who could not be
identified as they have moved away and their whereabouts remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
Twenty more people, after drinking the water, have fled to the
jungle and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
According to colonel Awl, the dead include a man and his
teenage daughter and two brothers from the same village of
Ellanleh.
</P>
<P>
Those who just drank a little survived and were brought to the
hospital of the town of Abudwag for treatment.

<HEADLINE> Kabila, Mugabe Stay Away From Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Embattled Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Laurent Kabila and his
Zimbabwean ally Robert Mugabe failed to turn up for peace talks
in Pretoria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart,
Pasteur Bizimungu arrived at Waterkloof air base outside Pretoria
shortly before lunch, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's talks were aimed at securing a cease-fire in Congo
(K) and preventing an unprecedented war in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila sent his Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo in his place.
</P>
<P>
South African presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said Kabila
was resting on the advice of his doctor.
</P>
<P>
On Mugabe's failure to turn up, Mankahlana said South African
President Nelson Mandela had asked Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano to persuade the Zimbabwean leader to join Saturday's
meeting and Sunday's 14-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) summit in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki would also
try and convince Mugabe to attend.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's troops appeared to have come under fire in Congo
Saturday, with rebels claiming that two jet fighters had been
shot down. But the Zimbabwean government denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Mugabe and Mandela have been strained over
the chairmanship of SADC's organ on politics, defense and
security.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two men further intensified when Mugabe
headed a separate initiative in Congo and eventually called for
military intervention as opposed to Mandela's call for a peaceful
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is chairman of the SADC.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, whose troops are
also backing Kabila in Congo, would not attend Sunday's summit
for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
He would also send a representative, Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
All other SADC leaders would be present. It was hoped that
Saturday's talks between the Ugandans, Rwandans and Congolese
would work out a basis for putting a process in motion to
establish a government of national unity in the DRC and find
agreement on resolving the problem of the DRC through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped Saturday's meeting would produce a proposal for
peace that would be tabled at Sunday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana declined to comment on whether South Africa
expected a cease-fire to be conditional on the complete
withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo.
</P>
<P>
On whether Uganda and Rwanda, who are not members of the SADC,
would be observers at Sunday's meeting, he said: "We'll have to
find a way of allowing them to have a good sense of what is
happening, because they are key players in the conflict."

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Drug Use Among the Young up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More young people in the
United States used illicit drugs last year, according to a survey
publicized by the government Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among those between the ages of 12-17 who were surveyed, 11.4
percent reported using some drugs within the past month, compared
with 9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 9.4 percent of this group used marijuana, up from
7.1 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported
that the number of this group using heroin remained steady last
year, with only 0.2 percent stating they had used heroin within
the past month, the same figure as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana is popular because many teens don't see it as
dangerous, said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
Parents need to inform their children that marijuana is
dangerous -- that it can impair learning and memory, Shalala
said. They must also be more aware of the attitude they send to
their children about drugs.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted last year by interviews with 24,500
people in their homes.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated an estimated 14 million people used drugs
last year, about 6.4 percent of the population. The overall drug
use rate in 1996 was 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Drug use among adults has been stable for years. Last year's
figure is slightly more than half the peak year in 1979, when
there were 25 million users.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: World Gripped by Conservation of Domestic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Initiatives and programs are
now under way around the globe for the conservation of domestic
animal diversity which is losing rapidly, especially in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt that the 160 or so developing countries
harbor the majority of the world's farm animal genetic resources
and associated animal diversity," said Jacques Diouf, director
general of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in a
statement to the Fourth Global Conference on Conservation of
Domestic Animal Genetic Resources which ended here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary survey by FAO showed that most countries possess
a number of the 5,000 or so remaining breeds of farm livestock,
with the majority of them occurring only in one or another
developing country.
</P>
<P>
"However, some 1,500 of the breeds are now categorized by FAO
as endangered, and very preliminary data shows that less than 10
percent of these are being maintained in any managed population or
cryoconservation bank," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On reasons for loss of domestic animal diversity, the statement
noted that the need to provide rapidly increasing amounts of
animal protein to expanding and more affluent human populations
results in increasing pressure on the world's livestock sector and
its major transformation.
</P>
<P>
It explained that since traditional feed resources are limited
and animal numbers cannot expand to meet the expansion in product
demand, livestock production is intensifying at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
In the process of intensification, the environmental
constraints to animal production are alleviated or removed, as
more and better resources, housing and veterinary care are
provided.
</P>
<P>
"This process is inevitably associated with marked changes in
the genetic resources required since some species and breeds can
make better use of these high potential and much less variable
production environments.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the many widely differing, lower input production
environments each require highly adapted and different animal
genetic resources to realize sustainable systems," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that while some loss of animal genetic resources is
inevitable, and should be planned, the process of intensification
at all input levels is not always driven by rational principles,
nor is it always accompanied by appropriate technologies.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to loss of genes include natural
disasters, wars and other forms of socio-political instability.
</P>
<P>
It said that globally, animal production contributes to 40
percent of the total value of food and agriculture, with 1.96
billion people obtaining at least part of their livelihood from
livestock.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that human population growth, progressive
urbanization and increased purchasing power of people will result
in the increasing demand for livestock products outpacing that for
plant products over the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that the demand for meat for the developing
world will increase from 65 million tons in 1990 to 170-220
million tons by 2020," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
For better use and development of the diversity associated with
the irreplaceable biological resources to meet current and future
food and agriculture needs, the governing bodies of FAO raised
concern in 1989-90 and asked the organization to examine the
feasibility of developing a program for the global management of
animal genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in signing the Rome Declaration on
World Food Security and developing the World Food Summit Plan of
Action in 1996, governments reaffirmed the right of all human
beings to have access to safe and nutritious food and to be free
from hunger.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to promote the conservation and sustainable
utilization of animal genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
Now governments of 176 countries have ratified the U.N.
Convention on Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of Sustainable Development of Animal Genetic
Resources, 161 scientists from 32 countries assembled in Kathmandu
on August 18-21 and held discussions on sustainable agriculture,
genetic distance and molecular markers, breed identification and
characterization, and conservation of domestic animal diversity.
</P>
<P>
Director General Diouf said in his statement that future
activities will be guided by two main considerations.
</P>
<P>
The first is that the conservation of a critical amount of
animal genetic resources and the maintenance of diversity are
considered of high importance.
</P>
<P>
And the second is that the necessary substantial increases over
the coming decades in rate and efficiency of livestock production
will inevitably lead to changes in both the genetic composition of
livestock populations and the relative importance of different
breeds, he said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Republic of Congo Expels Two French Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) has expelled two French diplomats for "activities
incompatible with their diplomatic status", according to reports
from Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The official radio of Kinshasa said on Saturday that the two
French diplomats expelled were the first secretary of the French
embassy Philippe Parisi-Faure, and a secretary of the embassy,
Daniel Philibert.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion is linked with the violation of air space of the
DRC by a French military helicopter that flew above the Congo
River Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
France said the helicopter, which took off from Brazzaville,
the capital of the Congo Republic, for a night training mission,
caught fire by light gunfire and was forced to return to
Brazzaville.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held to Promote Cooperation in Sea of Japan Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of local authorities
of three countries bordering the Sea of Japan met today in
Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, to discuss
mutual exchanges and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The heads of Jilin Province of China, Kangwon Province of the
Republic of Korea, and Tottori Prefecture of Japan were present at
the forum, but leaders of Primorskiy Kray of Russia were absent.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the four regions have made it a rule to meet once a
year to discuss regional cooperation. They have met four times
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Mongolia's Tuv Aimag was invited to attend
the forum this year.
</P>
<P>
The topics under discussion at the forum include promoting
development of the Tumen River Valley and international
cooperation at Sakai Minato of Japan, building an effective
transportation network, exchanges of talented people, and
cooperation in building environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yunkun, governor of China's Jilin Province, addressed the
meeting by saying that more efforts should be made to increase
exchanges and cooperation among the four regions.
</P>
<P>
So far, Hunchun City of Jilin Province has opened both
passenger and cargo air routes to Posiet of Russia and Sokco of
the ROK. A railway connecting Hunchun City with a border city
of Russia will soon begin service.
</P>
<P>
The four countries have reported substantial progress in
developing transnational tourism projects, developing Zarubino
Port of Russia, and opening an air route between Changchun of
China and Vladivostok of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace Talks Vital in Averting Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A regional bloodbath seemed imminent following reports that
Zimbabwean and Angolan troops have arrived in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) to support President Laurent Kabila
against rebels, whom Kabila claimed are backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Rwandan ambassador to South Africa said his
country was ready for full-blown war with the DRC if Zimbabwe and
Namibia failed to immediately recall troops allegedly sent to the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwandan troops were ready to go into the DRC to
protect "Rwanda's vital interest in eastern Congo".
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government said Friday it reserved the right to
get involved in a conflict in the DRC" in whatever manner it
deems appropriate" and condemned some members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), led by Zimbabwe, for their
call for military aid to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
South African officials were locked in a planning session
Friday night to ensure everything was in place for the Saturday
meeting, which South Africa hopes will ensure a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will see Kabila sit down with his
allies-turned-foes, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu and
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, with Mandela and South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki acting as brokers.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether representatives of the rebel
forces will be present and whether Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, a supporter of military intervention in the DRC, will
attend.
</P>
<P>
The 14-nation SADC, a regional economic bloc, is split on the
approach to resolve the crisis in the DRC, where Tutsi-led
rebellion since the beginning of the month had wrecked havoc and
rebels had advanced close to the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Zambia called for military
intervention to help Kabila to quell the revolt, and South
Africa, Botswana and Mozambique preferred a peaceful, long-term
political solution.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who chairs the SADC's suspended organ on defense and
security, rebuked Mandela publicly in a rare incidence earlier
this week, telling him not to interfere with SADC members who
wished to assist Kabila militarily.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday talks will be followed on Sunday by a special
summit of the SADC, currently chaired by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman said plans were "far advanced" and there
was an agreement in principle from all the parties involved to
attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba is expected to attend the
Sunday summit, when he would brief his SADC colleagues on the
meeting he had with Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks is the culmination of two weeks of South
African diplomacy aimed at bringing a peaceful resolution to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise
shuttled between South Africa, Kabila's stronghold in Lubumbashi
and the capitals of Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Mbeki also made numerous telephone calls to Kabila
and other regional leaders, including former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has repeatedly said it does not believe in any
military solution to the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
It said the only way out would be to secure a meeting between
the rebels and the Kabila government, which would lead to the
Congolese people hammering out a broad-based democratic order for
their own country.

PYONGYANG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains have wrought
havoc in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) by
flooding agricultural areas and public buildings, and causing
heavy economic losses.
</P>
<P>
More than 182,800 acres of arable land and over 4,250 buildings
containing more than 256 million square meters of space have been
submerged, the Korean Central News Agency reported Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
spend 2.92 billion yuan (about 351 million U.S. dollars) in three
years to improve the quality of low-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
Anhui currently has more than 2.66 million hectares of medium-
and low-yield farmland. The planned funds can help improve the
quality of 446,000 hectares, a provincial agricultural official
said.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has formulated a plan to improve 666,000 hectares of
medium- and low-yield farmland for the five years between 1996 and
2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anhui first launched an effort to improve farmland quality in
1988, with investment for that purpose totaling more than 3.1
billion yuan. So far, Anhui has improved the quality of more than
900,000 hectares of medium- and low-yield farmland, raising the
annual output of agricultural produce by 2.83 billion kilograms.

NANCHANG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
has decided to increase its investment in infrastructure this year
by approximately 7 billion yuan (843 million U.S. dollars) to
boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be invested in projects in water conservation,
transportation, posts and telecommunications, urban construction,
rural power grid, grain storage facilities, and commercial
housing, a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
This year grave flooding has adversely affected Jiangxi's
economy, especially the agricultural sector. The production of
both grain and cotton is expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi missed its targets in retail sales and exports in the
first half of this year, leaving the successful achievement of the
year's economic growth, to a great extent, to a construction boom
for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment in these fields will create more jobs
opportunities and boost the consumer market and the market of
production materials, thereby boosting economic growth, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Manila May Provide Security to Former Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
ready to provide security to former Army Chief of Staff Fabian Ver
in case there is a threat to his life once he returns to the
Philippines, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If there are genuine safety concerns, like any citizen, and if
the government believes that those safety concerns are valid, we
can provide the adequate protection that is required," Barican
told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
But before providing security men to Ver, Barican said, the
authorities will have to first assess the actual extent of the
risk on Ver's life as well as the length of time required to
address such a threat.
</P>
<P>
Barican also said that granting immunity to the former army
chief in connection with the Aquino-Galman double murder case is
not being considered.
</P>
<P>
Ver served as army chief of staff of president Ferdinand
Marcos, and is widely suspected to be one of the masterminds
behind the assassination of former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. on
August 21, 1983. Ver fled overseas when Marcos was toppled in
February 1986.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ver is recovering from a lung disease, and
hopes to be back in Manila "in two to three months."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, President Joseph Estrada gave the go-ahead
to Ver's return to the Philippines on the ground that he is no
longer considered a national security threat.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed hope that Ver would finally shed on the
assassination of former Senator Aquino, but he has to face all
criminal charges pending in court against him.
</P>
<P>
Ver is facing criminal charges as an accomplice in the double
murder case of Aquino and Rolando Galman, the former senator's
alleged hitman.

(Kongolo)," Mumengi said, adding that the two ministers "have
already left by plane and are heading for Pretoria."
</P>
<P>
If a postponement proved unacceptable to Mandela, Mumengi said
earlier, Kabila would send somebody to represent him and would
attend talks at a later date in person.
</P>
<P>
Radio Kinshasa reported Friday that Kabila is at present in
the southern city of Lubumbashi, capital of his home province of
Shaba, directing operations against rebel soldiers from Congo's
ethnic Tutsi community who took up arms on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has invited the presidents of Congo (K), Rwanda,
Uganda, Zimbabwe and Angola, the main players in the crisis, for
talks in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who ousted late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997, accuses his former allies Rwanda and Uganda of invading in
support of the Tutsi-led rebels. Both deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has split the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), with Mandela taking the lead for countries keen
to see a negotiated solution and Zimbabwe's president Robert
Mugabe favoring military assistance for Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said 600 Zimbabwean troops with four
fighter jets might have arrived in Kinshasa and 500 Angolan
soldiers have poured into the northern Cabinda enclave, moving
toward the border with Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
However, government sources in Harare said Zimbabwe will not
attend unless the other four countries -- Angola, Namibia,
Tanzania and Zambia -- are also present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
"A meaningful meeting will have to be one where all key
players are in participation," one government source told the
official paper of Zimbabwe "Daily Herald".
</P>
<P>
But Mandela had asked Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano to
try and persuade Mugabe to change his mind and make the summit
and Rwandan President Pasteur Bisimungu and Uganda's Yoweri
Museveni were already in South Africa for the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Flooding on Yangtze River Remains Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Flooding on the Yangtze River
remains serious although water levels on parts of the river
decreased today, according to the State Headquarters of Flood
Control and Drought Relief.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River water level at a measuring point in
Chongqing, in the upper reaches, hit 180 meters at 2 p.m. today,
which is as high as the official danger mark.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, water levels at several measuring points on
the middle and lower reaches have declined slightly. In Shashi,
upstream of Wuhan, capital of central Hubei Province, the water
level has gone down to 43.9 meters, 0.04 meters lower than Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said that flooding at Dongting Lake, one
of China's three major lakes, has increased though the sixth flood
crest of the Yangtze smoothly passed through Chenglingji on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The lake's water level measured at Chenglingji stood as high as
35.87 meters at 8 a.m. today, which is just 0.07 meters lower than
the all-time high created by the sixth flood crest, according to
an official news release.
</P>
<P>
The embankments of Dongting Lake and the part of the Yangtze
River running through Hunan have been seriously damaged, as they
have been soaked in high levels of water for nearly one month,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
At least 37 trouble spots, including 12 major ones, occurred
Friday in Yueyang City, which is within the lake area, according
to Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Though the flood crest has passed, there is no sight of the
floods easing," Wang said, urging anti-flood workers to remain
sober-minded.
</P>
<P>
Late tonight, some 830,000 soldiers and civilians were still
battling against floods in Yueyang alone.
</P>
<P>
The sixth flood crest of the Yangtze River entered Jiujiang, in
eastern Jiangxi Province, at 8 a.m. on Wednesday and is still
gradually passing through the city. More than 300,000 troops of
the People's Liberation Army and armed police are working together
with local residents to defend the major embankments along the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River's water level at Jiujiang stood at 22.46
meters at 2 p.m. today. Experts say that the sixth flood crest of
the Yangtze will have completely passed through Jiujiang by Sunday
afternoon. The flow-back of the Yangtze River's floodwaters into
Poyang Lake extended the length of time for the flood crest to
pass through the city. The experts say the decline of the Yangtze
River's water level should accelerate in the next two days if
there is no heavy rain in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangsu Province, on the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River, more than 800,000 troops and civilians are ready
to fight against possible floods resulting from the expected
arrival of the river's sixth flood crest on Sunday or Monday.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Backs Probe of Alleged Army Fund Anomalies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday gave his full backing to the investigation being
conducted by Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado into alleged fund
irregularities in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local radio, Estrada said the Department
of National Defense should push through with such an investigation
in line with the administration's campaign against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said Friday that powerful military officers, including
some retired generals, are orchestrating coup rumors as "a
psychological war" tactic to discourage the government from
investigating fund irregularities in the armed force.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that when he was still a senator and later, Vice
President, he had already received complaints concerning the
army's Retirement and Separation Benefits System (RSBS) as well as
the non-release of pension benefits of war veterans.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mercado had reported to him that one possible
anomaly is the surprise increase in the number of veterans
supposedly availing of RSBS benefits.
</P>
<P>
Mercado has been prying into the reported dissipation of funds
at the RSBS and the Philippine Veterans Administration Office.
</P>
<P>
"I am giving my all-out support behind Secretary Mercado
because even the surveys show that the people are fed up with
graft and corruption in government," Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> 40m Ethiopians Suffer From Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health of
Ethiopia estimated that nearly 40 million people in the country
are suffering from iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry, Mekonnen Admassu, was quoted by
the Ethiopian News Agency as saying Saturday that people living
in highland areas in particular are prone to iodine deficiency
mainly due to soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian highlands, called "Roof of Africa", cover the
western and central Ethiopia, two-thirds of the country with
average of between 2,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Mekonnen said the iodine content in the soil and water as well
as the food the local people consume is very low.
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent upon all salt producers to mix the salt they
supply to the market with iodine in order to address the
problem," the official said, adding that this is not often the
case at present.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Health and the United Nations
Children's Fund provide organized salt producers with the
machinery and chemical needed to iodize salt.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations are underway with the Health Ministers
of Yemen and Kenya to facilitate the import of iodized salt into
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian imported iodized salt from Eritrea before the
outbreak of the border dispute between two countries in May, this
year.

<HEADLINE> Sudan-Egypt Flights Unaffected Despite U.S. Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The flights between the capitals
of Sudan and Egypt have not been disrupted by the U.S. strikes
against a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant Thursday night, the Middle
East News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An EgyptAir returned home Friday morning from Khartoum,
touching down at Cairo airport with 161 passengers of different
nationalities on board.
</P>
<P>
Cairo airport control tower received a phone call from Khartoum
airport immediately after the U.S. strike notifying that it will
continue to receive flights from Cairo and that Sudan's air space
will remain open to air navigation.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir's three Cairo-Khartoum regular weekly flights will
proceed as usual, an official at the airport said.
</P>
<P>
In its first response to Thursday's U.S. air strikes on alleged
terrorist-associated facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan, Egypt
called on the United Nations to host a world summit on combating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.N. Security Council to take appropriate measures
in line with the U.N. Charter to fight and root out terrorism and
bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fired cruise missiles Thursday night at a
pharmaceutical factory near Khartoum in what it claimed
retaliation for bombings August 7 at its embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused Sudan of sponsoring international
terrorism and claimed that the factory was manufacturing chemical
weapons agents that could be used by Islamic militants to launch
new attacks against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan, the two Nile neighbors, have be in disputes
over border and other hanging issues, and traded accusations of
harboring militants against each other. There appeared to be a
tentative thaw in relations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Troops Deployed in Congo (K): Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean troops are in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and have been strategically
deployed around Kinshasa to secure the capital from rebel
advances.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia, Zambia and Tanzania agreed at a meeting of
defense ministers to render material or manpower assistance to
Congo as part of the southern African initiative to support its
government in its battle with the Tutsi-led rebels, the Daily
Herald, Zimbabwe's most influential newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deployments are reported to have the limited aim of
preventing the rebels from seizing Kinshasa. Once the war becomes
unfavorable toward the rebels, it is expected that serious
negotiations will become possible, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member Southern African Development Community decided
to act swiftly in support of Congolese President Laurent Kabila
after rebels claimed they were 120 km away from Kinshasa. They
rebelled in eastern Congo on August 2 to oust President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean troops, whose numbers could not be ascertained
Friday, were picked from different battalions around the country.
They left in groups from Manyame Air Base beginning Wednesday,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said 500 Angolan soldiers have
poured into the northern Cabinda enclave, moving toward the
border with Democratic Congo and that 600 Zimbabwean troops with
four fighter jets have arrived in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's deployment in the DRC comes in the wake of
conflicting opinions of how to deal with the escalating crisis in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is trying to discourage SADC member states from
being militarily involved in DRC, a position which contradicts a
decision taken by the regional grouping's Ministers of Defense
meeting in harare this week.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has now called an
emergency meeting of leaders from Uganda, Rwanda, the DRC and
Zimbabwe in Pretoria Saturday to discuss the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be followed by a full SADC summit at the
same venue.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwe will not attend unless the other four
countries -- Angola, Nambia, Tanzania and Zambia -- are also
present, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Government sources Friday said Zimbabwe had wanted other
players in the DRC crisis including Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and
Angola to participate.
</P>
<P>
"A meaningful meeting will have to be one where all key
players are in participation," one source said.

<HEADLINE> Earlist Poems Still Popular in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Literary researchers have
discovered that a group of China's earliest poems are still quite
popular in mountainous regions in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The researchers visited the Heyang Mountain Area in
Zhangjiagang City and found that most villagers there love singing
poetry put to music in the form of folk songs.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 ancient poems have been collected totalling
250,000 characters. Most of the poems tell of local people's daily
lives and labor. Some recorded historical events.
</P>
<P>
The longest one has 8,458 lines, a love story. Another folk
song recording of wood-cutters harvesting bamboo was produced
nearly 2,500 years ago, believed to be one of the earliest poems.

<HEADLINE> Iran, France to Cooperate Despite Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran and France on Saturday
voiced readiness to expand cooperation in all fields, despite of
their differences over some issues.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally there are some differences between Iran and France
in some fields," Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said at a
joint press conference with his visiting French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine after their first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the two countries share similar views over
various regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks with Vedrine as "friendly and fruitful," he
said that Tehran was ready to expand bilateral relations with
Paris in all fields based on mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
"The independence of the two governments' foreign policies
paved the grounds for expansion of Tehran-Paris cooperation,
particularly in the fields of oil and gas industries," Kharrazi
noted.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived here Friday night for a two-day official
visit, said that his first round of talks with Kharrazi was
focused on bilateral relations, particularly the prospect of
mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his stay he and Iranian officials would discuss "every
issue and every point" of concern for the two sides, such as the
British writer Salman Rushdie, human rights and weapons of mass
destruction, Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, who was accused of blasphemy to Islam for his novel
the "Satanic Verses," was condemned to death by Iran's late
spiritual leader Ayatollah khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"France is interested at holding talks with Iran over any
issue and will continue dialogue with Iran in all fields," said
the French minister.

<HEADLINE> 8.5 million People in Heilongjiang Province Affected by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The flood crest on the Songhua
River in northeast China passed through this capital of China's
northernmost province of Heilongjiang today.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Harbin climbed to 120.89 meters by 2
p.m. today, 0.84 meters higher than the historic high at a flow
rate of 17,300 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million flood victims in Heilongjiang have been
evacuated to safety, according to a local civil affairs official.
</P>
<P>
The provincial civil affairs department has sent eight working
teams to help flood victims in the 10 hardest-hit counties and
cities. It has also provided 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars) of relief funds, 17,000 cotton quilts and 900 tents to
Qiqihar, the worst-hit industrial center, and Daqing Oil Field,
the largest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the provincial civil affairs department shows
that more than 8.5 million people, or a quarter of the total
population in Heilongjiang, have been affected by this year's
devastating floods, with agricultural losses of 14 billion yuan
(1.69 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Floods have destroyed 3.1 million hectares of farmland in 52
counties and cities, damaged 1.44 million houses and killed 14,000
livestock.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government has distributed 30 million yuan (3.6
million US dollars) of relief funds to flood victims. It received
an additional 12 million yuan (1.45 million US dollars) of relief
funds, 3.2 million yuan (386,000 US dollars) in relief materials,
200,000 articles of clothing and 150,000 yuan in food and medicine
in recent days, according to the civil affairs official.

<HEADLINE> Lhasa Residents Living in More Spacious Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Lhasa, capital of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, now live in more
spacious apartments than people in many other Chinese
cities, according to the local construction department.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that, by the end of June, the average
housing space for Lhasa residents had reached 15.24 square meters,
one of the largest among 35 large and medium-sized cities across
the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the per capita living space in Lhasa was merely 3.82
square meters, and local residents often complained about their
poor housing facilities.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades since China launched its reform and
opening-up drive, nearly 20 major housing projects have been
completed in Lhasa. In 1997 alone, the city built new apartments
with a total floor space of 280,000 square meters and renovated
nearly 300,000 square meters of old housing, offering a large and
comfortable home to several thousand local households.
</P>
<P>
As the housing system reform has been started nationwide, local
construction officials are expecting a sharp increase in the
purchase of private apartments in the coming months, which they
believe will help further improve the housing conditions in
Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> Ningbo Reports Stable Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- This major port city in east
China's Zhejiang Province has reported a stable increase in
exports this year.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo's exports totaled more than 1.965 billion U.S. dollars
in the first seven months of this year, up 13.6 percent from the
same period last year, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The growth is significant given the negative impact of the
Asian financial crisis since July of last year and the fact that
60 percent of Ningbo's exports previously went to Asia, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
An analysis indicates that Ningbo's exports to the Asian market
in the first seven month edged up merely 3.39 percent on a yearly
basis to 950 million U.S. dollars. However, exports to Latin
America, Africa and Oceania during the period surged more than 40
percent, while those to Europe and North America jumped more than
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 723 production enterprises and Sino-overseas joint
ventures in Ningbo have been authorized to deal in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Architects, Archeologists Try to Save Leaning Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists and architects in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province have been busy working on a
1,000-year-old leaning tower, trying to return it to its original
place.
</P>
<P>
The 23-meter-tall brick tower, built during the Northern Song
Dynasty (960-1127), has been on a county-level protection list
since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to local chronicles, the last renovation was done about
300 years ago. Since then, the tower began leaning northwards, with
the rate increasing during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The province has allocated special funds, and the provincial
historical relics protection department is fully responsible for
the necessary repairs, said an official.

<HEADLINE> INLA Guerrillas Announce Ceasefire in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Irish National Liberation
Army (INLA) guerrilla group on Saturday announced a ceasefire in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Socialist Party, the political wing of the
INLA, announced in Belfast that the INLA ceasefire would begin at
noon on Saturday, according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
"The Irish National Liberation Army has now shifted from the
position of defence and retaliation to the position of complete
ceasefire," the group said.
</P>
<P>
It said it believed that the conditions for armed struggle no
longer exist and units had been ordered to end "offensive actions"
to achieve their goal.
</P>
<P>
The INLA, formed in 1975 after a split with the mainstream
Irish Republican Army (IRA), is one of Northern Ireland's most
ruthless republican guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Another splinter guerrilla group, the Real IRA, which was
responsible for the Omagh bombing a week ago, declared a ceasefire
on Wednesday. The bomb blast killed 28 people and injured more than
200.
</P>
<P>
The Omagh bombing has generated a wave of revulsion in both
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The INLA's statement left
only one Republican guerrilla group -- the Continuity IRA -- still
wedded to violence in the pursuit of a united Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Chad, Niger Meet on Sub-regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Defense and foreign ministers of
Nigeria, Chad and the Niger Republic Friday met in Nigerian
capital Abuja to discuss security problems on their common
border.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were the Nigerian Chief of Defense
Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Al-Amin Daggash, Chadian Minister of
Defense Oumar Kedgelani and Maman Sidikou, the Nigerien Minister
of Foreign Affairs and African Integration.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is coming on heel of a mini-summit attended by
leaders of the three countries on regional issues on August 12.
</P>
<P>
In a communique signed at the end of their meeting the leaders
expressed concern over the threat to peace, security and
stability posed by the activities of rebels, bandits and other
undesirable elements in the Lake Chad area.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian host Daggash was quoted by media reports as
saying at Friday's meeting that there is the need to thoroughly
appraise the problems and the true situation on the ground in all
their dimensions.
</P>
<P>
"It is only through such clear-headed analysis that we can
come out with action-oriented, practical and forward-looking
recommendations that would not only lend themselves to effective
implementation but also stand the test of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Daggash urged the three governments to show their political
will and allow necessary resources for the implementation of
whatever plan that was made.
</P>
<P>
Chadian Defense Minister expressed his optimism on the
region's capacity to find solutions to its problems.
</P>
<P>
If Nigeria can effectively solve the problems of other
countries on the continent, there shouldn't be any force to
prevent it from doing the same to itself and its neighbors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerien Foreign Minister Maman Sidikou reportedly applauded
the decision to eliminate banditry and other crimes in the
sub-region, observing that the three governments were duty bound
to ensure peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Disagrees With U.S. Retaliatory Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Saturday voiced
its disagreement with the way the United States executed its
unilateral retaliatory action against Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in
Cyberjaya, about 50 kilometers from here, that such actions must
be taken via proper channels through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Although they claim their actions are justified, it can
jeopardize procedures of international relations. When one country
decides unilaterally to attack another country which has committed
an offense, what is the role of world bodies such as the U.N.
which should be the forum to discuss such matters to reach a
consensus," Anwar told reporters after visiting the Multimedia
University project site in Cyberjaya.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched a cruise missile attack on
Afghanistan and Sudan Thursday which were alleged to be involved
in the August 7 bombings of the U.S. embassy buildings in Kenya
and Tanzania. Afghanistan and Sudan had since denied any
involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that in an effort to defend its integrity or
sovereignty, one country should not be allowed to attack another
but instead must go through proper channels such as international
forums.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Malaysia's national news agency
Bernama, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday
at Ketereh in the northeastern state of Kelantan that the
launching of missile strikes on innocent people by a Western
nation seeking to avenge the death of its people is "an act of
cowardice."
</P>
<P>
Such tyranny was inflicted on nations that had not declared war
against the Western nation, Mahathir said without naming any
nation, but obviously he was referring the to the United States
which launched missile strikes against alleged terrorist targets
in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the bombing of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier, Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Team Ends Inspection in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A team of the Federation of
International Football Association (FIFA) Friday ended its
one-week inspection of the facilities for the 1999 World Youth
Championship dubbed Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Abuja with the Nigerian Chief of General Staff,
Rear Admiral Mike Akhigbe, FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner said
the team was extremely impressed with the quality of work taking
place at the seven stadiums visited.
</P>
<P>
The seven stadiums are located in Bauchi, Port Harcourt,
Kano,Ibadan, Calabar, Kaduna and Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Warner, however, said the FIFA team had some degree of
discomfort regarding the hotel facilities, except those in Enugu
and Lagos.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that the facilities (in the stadium) shall
all be completed on time and that these facilities shall be
second to none," Warner said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about 500 football players were being expected
as the competition would be beamed to over 160 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
"It is against this backdrop that we are trying our utmost to
ensure that the hotel facilities are acceptable to athletes,
guests and the media," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding, Akhigbe, who was speaking on behalf of the
Nigerian leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar, said the Nigerian
government has taken due note of the observations made by the
team and that the relevant bodies had been directed to address
these challenges to ensure a successful hosting of the
championship.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe assured the FIFA team that Nigeria's political
transition program which is billed to usher in a civilian
government in May 1999 will not affect its hosting of the
championship.

<HEADLINE> Medical Teams to Perform Cataract Operations in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Four medical teams of
outstanding doctors will soon go to 10 counties in north China's
Shanxi Province, where health care conditions are poor, to perform
a series of cataract operations.
</P>
<P>
That is part of a nationwide effort -- Sight First China Action
-- aimed at helping cataract-afflicted blind people regain their sight.
</P>
<P>
This project, a joint venture launched last August by the
Ministry of Health, the China Disabled Persons Federation and
Lions Clubs International, will perform 1.75 million cataract
operations within the next five years throughout China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250 medical teams will go to remote and
poverty-stricken areas during the course of this effort.
</P>
<P>
So far. some 348,000 operations have been performed, including
1,202 in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
With 117,000 cataract patients living mostly in remote areas,
Shanxi plans to operates on 46,000 of them during the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are the cause of blindness for more than four million
Chinese, almost half the total number of blind people across the
country. Each year, about 400,000 new cases of blindness are
caused by cataracts.
</P>
<P>
However, only 2.1 million cataract operations and artificial
lens implants were performed between 1988 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Rehabilitation Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong International
Exhibition on Rehabilitation 1998 with "a Brave New World" as its
theme was opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest of its kind in the Asia and Pacific region,
which is designed to promote public understanding and concern for
disabled persons as well as to enhance equal participation and
building a harmonious society for both the persons with or without
disability.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is divided into three main sections.
</P>
<P>
These include the Jockey Club Pavilion, containing an extensive
range of services supported by the Hong Kong Jockey Club; a public
education pavilion to promote public concern on disability; and a
pavilion consisting of more than 100 booths, mainly introducing
the salutary work of the government, non-governmental
organizations and the voluntary sector.
</P>
<P>
On display are rehabus, wheelchairs, specially-designed kitchen
and eating utensils, equipment to improve accessibility, personal
care materials, medical equipment for the chronically ill, toys
for disabled children as well as various kinds of products made by
disabled people.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign ministers
will discuss the admission of Cambodia into the grouping when they
meet next month, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers would be meeting in New York while attending the
U.N.
General Assembly and Cambodia's admission as ASEAN's 10th member
would be among the matters to be discussed, he told reporters at
Kepala Batas in the northern state of Pulau Pinang, according to
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia's membership in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) would depend on the recommendation of the
ASEAN troika comprising representatives of Indonesia, Malaysia and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The troika's recommendation will be based on the outcome of the
recent Cambodian elections and the formation of a new government,
Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if these are settled by next month, the troika
can recommend that Cambodia be accepted as a member of ASEAN,
which now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> PC Prices Tumble to New Low in U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A California-based personal
computer maker Friday began to sell its product for only 399
U.S. dollars, waging a new round of price-war among the PC makers.
</P>
<P>
PrecisionTec LLC introduced its Gazelle machine for sale over
the Internet through Egghead.com and other Web-site companies. The
lowest price does not include computer monitor, which usually
starts at about 150 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Micro Center, an Ohio-based chain of 13
computer stores, was the first to sell a 399-dollar computer under
the Power Spec label.
</P>
<P>
Personal computer prices, which tumbled below the 1,000 dollars
just 18 months ago, now are breaking through the 400-dollar price
mark.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts noted that low price does not mean the low
quality. They said that today's computers costing below 1,000
dollars are equal or greater in power than PCs costing 1,500
dollars and more just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you don't need a Ferrari to drive 55 miles an hour
down the freeway," said John Torres, head of a California-based
Millennium, whose 499-dollar machine comes equipped with a
200-megahertz microprocessor from Integrated Device Technology, and
runs Microsoft's latest Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that the plunge in PC prices reflects
declining wholesale prices for computer parts, such as
microprocessors, memory chips and hard drives.
</P>
<P>
Because of the sharp drop, they estimated, nearly 50 percent of
U.S. families are expected to own a desktop PC by the end of 1998,
a significant increase from 45 percent at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, they also voiced their concern that the low-priced
computer trend had made it difficult for hardware-makers like
Intel to maintain their historically high profit margins.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Shocked at U.S. Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J.
Habibie Saturday said he was shocked and worried when he received
news about the U.S. missile attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very sorry and very sad. But it was not an attack
against Islam," the president told reporters from the Middle East
during an interview at his presidential office here.
</P>
<P>
Habibie was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying the attacks
could not be against Islam, since the United States has good
relations with Muslim countries like Indonesia, which has the
biggest Muslim population in the world, and the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said that what the world, including Europe, the
United States and Japan, should do together is to declare war on
poverty, injustice and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
"I think the communities of the world, whatever their religion,
have to go hand-in-hand in declaring war against poverty,
injustice and ignorance," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed deep
concern over the implications of the bomb blasts at the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania but disapproved of any
intervention in and aggression against sovereign countries in
fighting terrorism.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarus has described the U.S.
air strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan Thursday as "inadmissible
unilateral use of military force against terrorism without
appropriate sanctions of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released late Friday night, the Belarussian
Foreign Ministry warned that the U.S. missile strikes could
"trigger escalation of violence and lead to new losses of life and
a new wave of terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
"Even precisely targeted missiles and bombs do not tell the
innocent or the guilty. Such unilateral actions can have
unpredictable consequences for peace and stability," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belarus reaffirmed its denunciation of the bombings
near U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. "All those guilty of
committing these and other similar crimes against the humanity
should be brought to justice and meted out adequate punishment
according to law," the Itar-Tass news agency, in a dispatch from
Minsk Saturday, quoted the Belarussian Foreign Ministry as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Belarus firmly stands out against terrorism in
all its manifestations. We are active participants in
international cooperation in struggle against terrorism," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Official Off to London for Talks With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed left here for London Saturday to represent Pakistan
in the fourth round of talks with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad hopes for a better understanding of its security
concern vis-a-vis non-proliferation efforts including the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Officials here confirmed Saturday that the Pak-U.S. talks will
start on August 25. However, it is not clear as to how long the
fourth round of talks will last.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said last Sunday that Washington
expected the London round of talks to be "decisive" in regard to
the "progress forward" in the discussions between Pakistan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad maintains an open position on CTBT but emphasizes
that its vital security be considered deeply.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad made it clear last month that CTBT is not an anathema
for Pakistan, stressing that Islamabad's determination of the time
of acceding to CTBT depends on the protection of its security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Since the third round of talks was held between the two
countries in Islamabad last month, Pakistan has shown its
commitment to the international non-proliferation efforts by
joining the discussions on a fissile material cut treaty in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which started the diplomatic talks with both
Pakistan and India after their nuclear tests in May, has been
urging the two countries to join CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told
reporters here that he was discussing some "very very tough
issues" with the Pakistani officials, with Washington trying to
"reconcile Islamabad's national interests with its
non-proliferation objectives."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Islamabad also calls for "a clear demonstration of
collective engagement on the part of the major powers in the
process of peace and security in south Asia which has to focus on
Kashmir."

ISLAMABAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz denied Saturday that U.S. President Bill Clinton
talked to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on phone about the attack in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not, efforts were made later on but it was too
late," Aziz said in an interview with BBC.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also denied that Pakistan has demonstrated
very soft displeasure with the U.S. missile attack on Afghanistan
and Sudan, which took place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There are diplomatic conditions in which it is a very serious
matter to lodge protests, he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the violation of Pakistani airspace by the
U.S. missiles fired on targets in Khost and other Afghan towns,
Aziz said these are not detected on radar.
</P>
<P>
"But even then there is the presumption that they might have
passed over our territory. We have made very strong protest
against it also," the foreign minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- "The way the United States,
rashly and unwisely trampling all forms of international morality,
attacked Sudan and Afghanistan, is alarming," Secretary General of
the World Muslim Congress (WMC) Raja Zafar ul Haq said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Haq, also Pakistan's minister for religious affairs, said in a
statement that the United States bypassed the U.N. Security
Council and set aside all channels of peaceful resolution of any
"allegations" against these two Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody and above all, the World Muslim Congress can support
terrorism in any form but without removing the genuine causes of
grievances or oppression of very large number of Muslim societies,
one cannot control reactions from individuals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is a time to show statesmanship, restraint and
not rash use of blind force, which would further aggravate the
already tense situation.
</P>
<P>
"By the latest actions of the United States," Haq said, "the
thinking of those negative minds, who consider clash of
civilizations between Islam and the West, would be further
strengthened and encouraged."
</P>
<P>
This fact alone would contribute negatively to an atmosphere of
intolerance and dangers to international understanding and peace,
said Haq.
</P>
<P>
The World Muslim Congress calls upon leaders and intellectuals
of all faiths to raise their voice against these disturbing
developments, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Troops Deployed in Congo (K): Paper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angola, Namibia, Zambia and Tanzania agreed at a meeting of
defense ministers to render material or manpower assistance to
Congo as part of the southern African initiative to support its
government in its battle with the Tutsi-led rebels, the Daily
Herald, Zimbabwe's most influential newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deployments are reported to have the limited aim of
preventing the rebels from seizing Kinshasa. Once the war becomes
unfavorable toward the rebels, it is expected that serious
negotiations will become possible, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member Southern African Development Community decided
to act swiftly in support of Congolese President Laurent Kabila
after rebels claimed they were 120 km away from Kinshasa. They
rebelled in eastern Congo on August 2 to oust President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean troops, whose numbers could not be ascertained
Friday, were picked from different battalions around the country.
They left in groups from Manyame Air Base beginning Wednesday,

the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said 500 Angolan soldiers have
poured into the northern Cabinda enclave, moving toward the
border with Democratic Congo and that 600 Zimbabwean troops with
four fighter jets have arrived in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's deployment in the DRC comes in the wake of
conflicting opinions of how to deal with the escalating crisis in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is trying to discourage SADC member states from
being militarily involved in DRC, a position which contradicts a
decision taken by the regional grouping's Ministers of Defense
meeting in harare this week.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has now called an
emergency meeting of leaders from Uganda, Rwanda, the DRC and
Zimbabwe in Pretoria Saturday to discuss the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be followed by a full SADC summit at the
same venue.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwe will not attend unless the other four
countries -- Angola, Nambia, Tanzania and Zambia -- are also
present, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Government sources Friday said Zimbabwe had wanted other
players in the DRC crisis including Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and
Angola to participate.
</P>
<P>
"A meaningful meeting will have to be one where all key
players are in participatiKI$K+$.+.,Y.XZ2.

<HEADLINE> Survey: More American Teenagers Using Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Friday
showes that 11.4 percent of American teenagers used some illicit
drug in 1997, compared with 9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) was
conducted throughout last year by interviews with 24,500 people in
their homes, the NHSDA report said.
</P>
<P>
The drug of choice among the group (ages 12 to 17) was
marijuana, with 9.4 percent using it last year, remarkably
increasing from 7.1 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most dangerous increase was the number of first-time heroin
users, which was at an all-time high in 1996, the last year for
which numbers were available. Preliminary numbers indicate 3.9
million teens used heroin for the first time in 1996, almost
doubled the 2.2 million who tried it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts blamed the increase of first-time heroin users
among teens on the "relaxed attitude" to their parents.
</P>
<P>
Parents need to inform their children that marijuana is
dangerous -- that it can impair learning and memory, warned Health
and Human Services Setretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, according to the survey, about 14 million people,
or 6.4 percent of the U.S. population, said they used drugs in
1997, compared 6.1 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Steps Up Power Construction in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region recently kicked off a two-billion-yuan project
to upgrade power grids in the region's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In the next four months, Inner Mongolia will build and upgrade
20,000 kilometers of power transmission lines, construct and
enlarge 73 substations, and erect other auxiliary facilities.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates say that power construction in the
region's rural areas will give impetus to production of
manufactured goods with an added value totaling 700 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
This is just part of the region's efforts to build and improve
its infrastructure. To support this work, the regional government
has added an extra investment of four billion yuan mainly to
finance construction and upgrading of projects in six areas,
including power construction in rural areas, environmental
protection in urban areas, transportation and telecommunications,
housing, and grain depots, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Yun Gongmin, vice-chairman of the regional government, said
Inner Mongolia's investment in fixed assets this year will exceed
its earlier budget by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia is set to achieve a ten percent economic growth
this year, two percent of which will be ensured by increasing
investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has set up a leading group to
coordinate infrastructure construction, and a special group in
charge of the construction of grain depots and power grids in the
region's rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Europe Urges Lebanon to Establish Value-Added Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
proposed a new sales tax to replace Lebanon's heavy reliance on
import duties as a main revenue source, the Daily Star reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of an EU initiative to include Lebanon in a
regional trade agreement by the start of next year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, known as European-Mediterranean, will cancel
customs duties on most European goods and allow Lebanon better
access to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Kroll, a high-ranking Austrian Foreign Ministry
official said at a joint news conference with Lebanese Foreign
Ministry's secretary-general Zafer Hassan on Friday that the EU
is advising the Lebanese government on the most efficient method
of setting up a value-added sales tax.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is preparing a study on a Lebanese value-added
tax (VAT) that shows the advantage of moving away from import
duties," said Kroll who visited Beirut Friday and leaves for
Damascus on Saturday. Austria currently hold the rotating
presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The fear of lossing customs revenue has been one of the main
reasons behind Lebanon's reluctance to join the
European-Mediterranean partnership agreement, which has already
been signed by Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Levying duties on European goods has been a lucrative
business for the government. Tariffs account for around half of
the government's revenue and more than 50 percent of the
country's imports come from the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said that a new VAT was one of the reforms that Lebanon
needed to implement in order to gain access to the EU market.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to reform now than to wait. The economy has to
become modern, up to date and face competition," he added.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
will make a Middle East tour next month aimed at promoting the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership as well as trying to revive the
stalled peace talks.

on Friday ordered tighter security on airports. Security for
Government buildings and military bases around the country also
were tightened as a precaution against retaliation from groups
that the U.S. targeted.
</P>
<P>
The FAA cited information from law enforcement and intelligence
agencies about new terrorist threats but cautioned that the new
security measures do not reflect any specific threats at airports.
</P>
<P>
"These are prudent and precautionary steps to ensure the safety
of travelers," said FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner.
</P>
<P>
The measures include increased canine bomb sniffing units and
additional use of trace explosive detector units at security
checkpoints, curbside parking restrictions and posting agency
inspectors at airports in the United States and abroad to monitor
security operations for domestic carriers.
</P>
<P>
The agency has cautioned airlines to be mindful of
discriminatory practices and not to target passengers based on
ethnicity or religious affiliations during screenings.
</P>
<P>
Military bases around the country went to what is known as
Threat Condition Alpha, the first of four levels of increased
security instituted when there is a general threat of terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a precaution advised
operators of the nation's 110 atomic power plants and university
research reactors to step up security.
</P>
<P>
In Washington D.C., tourists and commuters boarding subways
were told over intercoms that a security alert was in effect and
"not to leave unattended items in Metrorail stations and trains"
and to report any suspicious items, activities or persons.
</P>
<P>
Extra police and closer inspections of identification and
packages greeted people entering government buildings and
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, cars and trucks were parked across the
entrances to two driveways. The horseshoe-shaped drives were long
ago closed to ordinary traffic as a precaution against car
bombers.
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service also added guards around various diplomatic
missions.
</P>
<P>
The FBI nonetheless issued a general security warning. "It is
reasonable and prudent to conclude that yesterday (Thursday)'s
action by the United States elevates the risk to U.S. interests
worldwide," the agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The United States said that its cruise missile attacks were
both retaliation for the fatal bombings at two U.S. embassies in
Africa two weeks ago and prevention of future terrorism against
the U.S.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Economic Westward Movement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's more-developed provinces
and municipalities in the east have launched a westward movement
to help boost economic growth in the central and western parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The east has been transferring funds, gifted people,
technology, industries and information to the less-developed
central and western areas at an unprecedented rate, economists say.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's economic and financial center, for example,
has launched more than 260 projects in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, Yunnan Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
since last year.
</P>
<P>
More and more entrepreneurs in Guangdong Province, a showcase
of China's market economy reforms in the south, are moving their
manufacturing plants to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
which neighbors Guangdong but is much less developed.
</P>
<P>
"The westward movement is a major trend of China's reforms and
opening-up program," Hu Angang, a noted economist of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Just as the United States began to develop its western areas in
the 1860s, China has gradually become able to develop its vast
areas in the west, said Hu, who is renowned for his studies on
China's national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"After 20 years of market economy reforms, China has already
had a relatively strong economic power and overall national
strength, and its provinces and municipalities in the east have
developed an ability to bring along economic growth in the west,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The central and western areas, which account for 86 percent of
China's territory and 58 percent of the nation's population, have
rich natural resources, cheap labor forces, and huge market
potential. They have lagged behind the east in economic
development because of historical reasons and poor geographic
locations.
</P>
<P>
When China launched its reform and opening-up program in
the late 1970s, it issued many preferential policies to attract
overseas investment and technology to the coastal east.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Economic Westward Movement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, however, the Chinese government has attached
increasing importance to spurring economic growth in the central
and western parts to narrow the disparity in overall economic
development. The measures adopted toward that end include the
introduction of a fiscal transfer payment beginning in 1995, the
direction of overseas investment and the move of much of the
textile industry to the central and western areas where cotton is
produced, and the launching of many poverty-relief projects in
central and western China, among others.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province, for example, put aside 10
million yuan this year to aid enterprises that launch projects in
Guangxi. Last year alone, Guangdong signed for 60 cooperative
projects in Guangxi, with a total investment of 1.75 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the westward movement by enterprises in the
east has increasingly been driven by market forces, as they often
use their competitive edge in technology, funds, management and
brand names to merge with or take over firms in the less-developed
areas.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai alone has invested 10
billion yuan in founding more than 1,000 enterprises in central
and western China. In many of the new firms, Shanghai has a
controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
Experts also say that the launching of many key projects in the
central and western areas has accelerated the westward movement of
industries and investment.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's Qinzhou, which is on the Nanning-Kunming Railway, a
major line in the southwest, attracted 137 projects transferred
from Guangdong in the first half of this year, with investment
totaling more than 200 million yuan. The projects also created
nearly 20,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has launched 56 cooperative projects in Chongqing,
which used to be part of southwestern Sichuan Province but was
made a municipality in 1997, with pledged investment hitting 350
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Just like Chinese investors from the east, overseas consortia
and companies have also showed their confidence in the development
projects of China's central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
In Yichang, where the giant Three Gorges Projects is being
built, paid-in overseas investment exceeded more than 100 million
U.S. dollars last year alone, about 4.8 times the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
Though overseas companies have continued to invest more in east
China, their investment in central and western China has
significantly outgrown that in the east.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the prevailing westward movement will make the
central and western parts of China a major growth area.
</P>
<P>
So long as the trend continues, the days for coordinated
economic development between the east and the west are not far
away, they say.

<P>
HAVANA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Dominican Republic President
Leonel Fernandez Reyna on Friday called for creating a strategic
alliance between the Caribbean countries, Central America, and the
Dominican Republic to jointly face negotiations with other foreign
blocs.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said in the inauguration of the Caribbean Forum
(Cariforum) that the Caribbean countries must unify their stand in
the incoming negotiations with the European Union about the
Post-Lome IV, and adopt a common position in the projected Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean countries have won their political independence,
but they are far from giving firmness to their economies, and they
require concerted efforts and actions to face future challenges,
said Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Surinam President Jules Widdenbosch, on behalf of the Caribbean
Community (Caricom), highlighted the presence of Cuban President
Fidel Castro in the meeting, saying it confirms that Cuba is part
of the area and the hemisphere. He asked to accept the island
country as a member with full rights in the regional community.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a re-design of the existing cooperation
structures to adapt them to new world conditions.
</P>
<P>
The forum, being held in Santo Domingo for two days, is
attended by 14 Caricom member countries, alongside Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Newspaper Criticizes US Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Panamanian newspaper
Friday criticized the United States for its missile attacks on
Sudan and Afghanistan, saying they were against international law.
</P>
<P>
The El Universal De Panama newspaper said in its editorial that
the "aggression" was held without a formal war declaration, nor
any exhaustive investigation that would prove with certainty the
U.S. charges.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 250 people died on August 7 in bombings in
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the retaliation bombings
could not prevent more terrorist attacks, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"What this serious act of war has achieved is to relieve the
pressure on the White House, haunted by the Lewinsky case, at the
cost of a very explosive and worrying ingredient for the world
community," noted the editorial.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said he ordered cruise missile strikes
from U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea against a
plant in Sudan linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire
suspected of being responsible for the embassy bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania, which killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500
others. Enitem

<P>
TIRANA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Albania firmly supports the
United States in its missile attacks against the presumed
terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan, a Foreign Ministry
statement said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albania fully supports all actions taken in the name of
upholding democracy, peace and respect for human values, to stop
terrorist acts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Foreign Ministry reiterates its stand against
terrorism, organizers of terrorist acts and their supporters, the
statement said, noting that the only possible answer to terrorism
is unremitting and uncompromising attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Prime Minister Fatos Nano said at a cabinet
meeting that the Albanian government fully understands the
underlying reason for the U.S. actions and firmly backs any
actions aimed at preventing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Nano said, there were also terrorists in
Albania. But, he noted, the government had taken all steps needed
to safeguard the security of diplomatic missions in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albania is ready to cooperate with allied nations, particularly
the United States, in a bid to shut terrorists out.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that in cooperation with the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), Albania arrested four Indian
"terrorists" in July and extradited them back to India.

between branches of government contemplated in our constitutional
order," the White House appeal said.
</P>
<P>
"The president's need for confidential consultations with White
House counsel in preparation for proceedings designed to remove
him from office can scarcely be questioned," it said.
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court ruled on July 27 that Clinton's private
conversations with administration lawyers are not protected by
attorney-client privilege from grand jury questioning. The lawyers
are working for the taxpayers, not just the president, the court
said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist refused on August 4 to block
that ruling from taking effect, thereby clearing the way for
government lawyers' testimony while the White House pursues its
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Presidential confidant Bruce Lindsey has not yet testified
because he has been recovering from back surgery. But White House
lawyers Cheryl Mills and Lanny Breuer have gone before the grand
jury in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr's decision to seek government
lawyers' testimony about their advice to the president "has had
for this president, and will have for future presidents, a
dramatic effect on his ability to seek the candid and forthright
advice he needs," the White House appeal to the Supreme Court said.
</P>
<P>
The lower court's ruling came on a matter "in which the
president's need for, and entitlement to, confidential legal
advice is at its zenith: in preparation for potential impeachment
proceedings, the ultimate confrontation between branches of
government," wrote lawyer Neil Eggleston, representing the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"The independent counsel is seeking to question the very
attorneys who would represent the president in the congressional
process," Eggleston wrote, adding that the ruling "grossly
inflates" Starr's authority.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-client privilege should apply for government lawyers
in criminal cases just as it does in civil cases, the appeal added.
</P>
<P>
The lower court ruling "ensures that presidents will simply
make fewer disclosures to their official counsel," Eggleston
said. "It will cause presidents to take ill-informed actions and,
through inadvertence or otherwise, perhaps run afoul of the law
more frequently."

MEXICO CITY, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto

</P>
<P>
Closing the 29th National Meeting of Fiscal Officials held in

Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria said that the Friday drop in

factors; it was the external instability that affected the Mexican
stock market.

The Mexican Stock Exchange Friday registered a high volatility

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) met in New York on
Friday with both delegations tightlipped on the topics and outcome
of the talks while promising to continue meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Charles Kartman and the DPRK was represented by Vice Foreign
Minister Kim Gye-kwan. The meeting at the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations started at 10:00 a.m. and ended at about 6:00
p.m. with a noon break.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened around the Mission one day after the
U.S. launched missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan in response
to the August 7 twin bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. All reporters
were barred from entering the mission compound for news coverage.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the talks may focus on the 1994 Agreed
Framework in which DPRK agreed to abandon a "nuclear weapons
program" in exchange for Western-built civilian nuclear reactors
and fuel-oil shipments.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has complained about Washington's reluctance to
annually deliver 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil amid Congress
blocking funds for the oil supply.
</P>
<P>
The talks were overshadowed by U.S. media reports about a spy
satellite "discovery" of a so-called nuclear complex in the DPRK.
However, the U.S. Administration has downplayed the reports.
</P>
<P>
There is a lack of evidence that the DPRK is violating the 1994
accord, the Pentagon spokesman was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Decorating Industry Thriving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's interior decorating
industry is entering a robust period as the country's consumption
level has risen rapidly in the past two decades, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"The use of interior decorating has been extended from public
facilities into individual households, thereby embracing a large
market potential," Cao Fengquan, vice-president of the China
National Interior Decorating Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Decorating projects across the country earn an average total of
100 billion yuan (12.05 billion US dollars) a year, half of which
is spent by individual households, the Association told the
English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Cao noted that as one of the country's emerging industries,
interior decorating is poised to become even more profitable.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the industry will double its current project
volume to reach a value of 200 billion yuan (24.1 billion US
dollars) by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Interior decorating was mainly applied in public facilities in
China before the 1970s when resident housing served mainly as
merely a basic form of shelter for people due to their limited
financial reserves.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reforms stirred up the interior decorating
industry, which initially focused on hotels, restaurants, shopping
malls and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
"The high-end property market maintains its status as the
biggest customer of interior decorating," Cao told the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are estimatedly more than 40,000 interior
decorating companies in China, which employ a total of about 2.6
million people.
</P>
<P>
"The interior decoration industry can provide a large number of
job opportunities, helping to absorb a number of laid-off
workers," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there still exists the potential for an
outbreak of chaos to challenge this emerging industry, as shown by
the increasing numbers of customer complaints and decorators
operating illegally.

BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's cultural world is at
your fingertips, awaiting the click of your computer mouse, said
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The authoritative Beijing Cultural Hotline (BCH), the quick and
practical web site with 100 categories, began operating yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The directories are catalogued under "Beijing Cultural
Information," "Capital Library," "Web Cinemas and Theaters," and
"Cultural Tourism."
</P>
<P>
The hotline is operated by the municipal governmental branch
responsible for local cultural business and activities. Other
cities in China, including Shanghai and Guangzhou, have similar
information sources.
</P>
<P>
The site is particularly useful for foreign businessmen. They
can locate addresses and telephone numbers for cultural offices
and units, and national and municipal culture-related laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The site will eventually have online ticket sales and
information about bookstores and the talent market. The web site
can be accessed at http://www.bcbnet.org.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Political Initiatives After U.S. Missile Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy Friday voiced its "clear and
unequivocal" condemnation of terrorism and called for "adequate"
political initiatives to step up international cooperation against
it.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement released Friday that
it denounces terrorism of any form and expressed understanding of
the U.S. reactions by striking the presumed terrorist bases in
Afghanistan and Sudan following the bomb attacks on the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement warned that attacks and counter-attacks
might trigger chain reactions and therefore called on the
international community to make concerted efforts to combat
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is the "real danger of the future," Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi said, adding that Italy fully supports
battles against it.
</P>
<P>
"But, we have always said and hoped that the battle against
terrorism should be accompanied by political solutions and an
analysis that is not solely military," he told reporters from his
vacation spot in Puglia.
</P>
<P>
Prodi noted that there could be no "international coexistence
with terrorism."
</P>
<P>
One side of the question is the absolute necessity of a joint
front against terrorism; and the other is the necessity "to
continue political dialogue, without which one can go nowhere,"
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi downplayed theories that President Bill Clinton's Sexgate
affair may have been instrumental in deciding the timing of the
missile attacks.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Says He and Jordan Unlikely to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Scottie Pippen told a radio
in Chicago during his recovering from back surgery that he does
not think either he or his friend Michael Jordan will return to
the Bulls for the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
"I do not forsee a return to the Chicago Bulls because with
each passing day it becomes more evident that I will be going
somewhere else," Pippen told WGN Radio. "The fans are great and I
know they want everyone back. But as players, we believe it's
over."
</P>
<P>
Pippen is a seven-time All-Star who has teamed with Jordan to
lead Chicago to three consecutive NBA championships and six in
eight years, making the Bull's the most powerful dynasty in
sports.
</P>
<P>
But Phil Jackson resigned as coach in June and was replaced on
July 23 by former Iowa State coach Tim Floyd. Jordn often has
said he would not play for any coach other than Jackson and
apparently repeated that in a recent conversation with Pippen.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Michael will not play again. I think he's done,"
said Pippen, who said he had spoken to Jordan within the last
week. "He will not play for anyone other than Phil Jackson."
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Pippen will become a free agent as soon as the
NBA lockout is resolved. He had a relatively low salary last
season about 2.77 million U.S. dollars. He is believed to be
seeking a multi-year deal worth 10-15 million dollars per season
and has expressed a desire to play for the Phoenix Suns, Los
Angeles Lakers or Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
Pippen was a member of the U.S. Olympic teams in 1992 and 1996
that won gold medals and in 1996 was selected as one of the NBA's
50 Greatest Players.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. End Row on Garment Export Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States have reached an agreement to settle their months-long
dispute on garments exports, Philippine Daily Inquirer reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has agreed to extend for one year a
50-million-U.S.-dollar package to compensate the Philippines for
the impact on garments exports of changes in the American rules of
origin implemented in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Garments and Textile Export Board executive director
Escolastica Segovia was quoted as saying the Philippines was "very
satisfied" with the agreement even though the 50-million-dollar
compensation was slightly lower than the 53 million dollars
extended last year.
</P>
<P>
"The terms of compensation are more flexible and we are assured
of another year to avail of compensation from the U.S.," Segovia
said.
</P>
<P>
The garments and textile agreement would allow Philippine
exporters to shift from slow-moving products to highly-in-demand
products such as T-shirts and pants.
</P>
<P>
Segovia said the Philippines would start negotiations for the
terms of next year's compensation by December this year. The
current compensation package would be retroactive to January 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
With the settlement agreement, the Philippines has decided to
drop its plan to raise the dispute to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was forced to compensate garments-exporting countries
like the Philippine after it tightened the entry of quota imports
in the U.S. by recognizing the products' origins from the source
of the raw material.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Urge Concerted Efforts Against TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading U.S. scientists
called for the development of a new, more effective vaccine and
increase in research investment for the elimination of
tuberculosis (TB) from the United States and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, in a report released by the U.S. Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) Thursday, said public
agencies and vaccine manufacturers need to work together to make
TB vaccine development a priority, increase basic research and
develop a clear consensus on the desirable characteristics of a
new vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say there has been only one vaccine available, the
Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, but it has limited effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Although it prevents very serious disease in children and
probably substantially reduces childhood mortality for TB, it does
not prevent infection," said Dr. Rick O'brien, chief of a group of
experts that advise the CDCP, adding that "despite its widespread
use, it's had really limited epidemiologic impact on reducing TB
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Other scientists in the group believe that a better vaccine is
key to eradicating the disease that has been around almost as long
as mankind.
</P>
<P>
"If we could put a man on the moon within decades back in the
1960s, I think we can eliminate TB if we develop the will to do
so," said O'brien, who called for a significant investment for the
research, particularly the large field trials necessary to
demonstrate efficacy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Tourist Industry Set September as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- In a continuing effort to turn
around the declining arrivals, Indonesia's tourist industry is
offering discounted travel packages through next month to foreign
visitors, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The offer is part of the industry's campaign during the period
dubbed Magic Month, beginning on August 10 and lasting through
September 24, to restore the battered tourist sector.
</P>
<P>
The discounts are being offered in 10 main tourist destinations
nationwide of West Java, East Java, Central Java/Yogyakarta, Bali,
Lombok, North Sulawesi, Batam, Bintan, North Sumatra and Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"These packages sell for at least 30 percent of their normal
prices," chairman of the Indonesian Hotels and Restaurants
Associations Pontjo Sutowo told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Offers range from a three-day shopping package tour in Jakarta
starting at 35 U.S. dollars per night, a tour package in Central
Java and Yogyakarta at 39 U.S. dollars per night, to a four-day
adventure package in Sulawesi at 364.50 U.S. dollars per person.
</P>
<P>
National flag carrier Garuda gives a 40 percent discount on the
published fares for international and domestic airfares quoted in
foreign currency. Tickets must be bought at the point of origins
of the international visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Magic Month is the second phase of the "Let's Go to
Indonesia" program, a marketing and public relations campaign
designed to repair the tainted image of the country since
widespread rioting erupted in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The program kicked off with the Happy Day when foreign tourists
arriving on July 30 were awarded with packages of free room and
board and domestic flight tickets on Garuda.
</P>
<P>
Pontjo said the Magic Month might be extended to two or three
months, depending on the future situation.
</P>
<P>
After the May riots, tourist arrivals declined sharply and
several countries issued travel warnings to their citizens. In
Jakarta alone, nearly 1,200 people died and businesses throughout
the city were gutted during three days of chaos.
</P>
<P>
Pontjo said that through improved marketing and efforts to
shift perceptions of Indonesia abroad, the "Let's Go to Indonesia"
campaign hoped to turn international focus on the nation and the
low value of its rupiah currency to an advantage. The rupiah has
sunk by 80 percent of its value from the middle of last year
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.3 million visitors traveled to Indonesia in the first
five months of 1998, bringing 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.2 million visitors arrived last year, bringing in 6.77
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> he082208 - Aussie Armed Forces to Introduce Part-time Soldiering: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Defense Force,
the nation's armed forces, would introduce flexible work
arrangements that would allow military personnel to work from home
or part-time, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements also would allow personnel to take breaks from
difficult periods of service and negotiate flexible hours with
their commanding officers.
</P>
<P>
The changes have been interpreted as an attempt to make the
military more attractive to people with families, and to retain
staff wanting to pursue an education or training.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements would apply to the nation's army, navy and air
force, and were expected to be in place by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The number of Australian servicemen totals 57,000.
</P>
<P>
Arch Bevis, defense spokesman for the Australian Labor Party,
said the flexibility which the Australian federal government was
introducing was good but it had been flagged in 1994 by Paul
Keating's labor government, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Chretien, Bouchard Claim Victory Over Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said here Friday that the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling
against Quebec's separation was a victory for all Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling yesterday by the Supreme Court of Canada is of
extraordinary importance," Chretien told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a victory for governments or politicians. It is a
victory for all Canadians. It protects the legal and democratic
rights of citizens of our country for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The top court ruled Thursday that Quebec does not have the right to
separate unilaterally either under the Canadian constitution or
international law.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the court also noted that if a "clear" majority of Quebecers
vote on a "clear" question to get out of Canada, then the federal
government and other provinces should negotiate with Quebec and let
it go.
</P>
<P>
In his first response the day after the ruling, Quebec Premier
Lucien Bouchard, like his arch-rival Chretien, also claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is something that is comforting the sovereigntist
project and, as such, it should be helpful in the next election and
mainly in the next referendum," he said in Quebec City, capital of
the French-speaking province.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard said that the separatists lost three to four percentage
lead in the last days of the referendum campaign in fall 1995
mainly because of uncertainly about whether Ottawa would negotiate
the breakup of the country.
</P>
<P>
"These Quebeckers find themselves reassured today: their Yes vote
will force Canada to negotiate," Bouchard noted.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard has already said that Quebec would hold another
referendum on its independence if the separatist side can win.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling has been a key part of Ottawa's unity strategy
since it barely won a Quebec referendum in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa hoped that the ruling by the top court will persuade soft
nationalists in Quebec to support the unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
It also sent a strong message to hardcore separatists in Quebec
that a vote for sovereignty would mean a prolonged and painful
process of divorce.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa asked the court for its opinion on three deceptively
simple questions. Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence
under domestic law? Does international law give Quebec a right to
secede? If two laws conflict, which prevail?
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Quebec does not have the right to go
unilaterally under either domestic or international law, and that
there is no conflict between the two.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Balance of Payment Surplus Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payment surplus (BOP) further dropped to 1.4 billion U.S. dollars
as of end-July this year from the month-ago level of 1.6 billion
dollars, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Saturday, the central bank said the
seven-month BOP surplus also stood much lower than the two-year
high of 2.1 billion dollars as of mid-May this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, central bank officials said the latest BOP
level was still a strong turnaround from the 3.36-billion-dollar
deficit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
They said the central bank had to shell out dollars in July to
cover the usual month-end debt obligations and that there was a
slight reversal of the trade surplus sen during the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
BOP accounts the flow of resources between the local economy
and the rest of the world. It systematically records the foreign
exchange flows arising from economic transactions such as trade
and portfolio investments during a given period.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the BOP position from the end-1997 level was
due not only to the narrowing of the trade gap but also due to the
continued inflows from investments and loan proceeds, the central
bank said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Engineers Rootworm-Resistant Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. biotechnology company
claimed Friday that it had genetically engineered a corn that can
resist rootworm, a pest that does major damage to corn crops in
North America.
</P>
<P>
Eric Sachs, business leader for Monsanto Co., said in a
statement that commercial introduction of rootworm-resistant corn
seeds by the biotechnology company would probably come in the year
2001 or 2002, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Corn rootworm does an estimated one billion U.S. dollar damage
annually on about 15 million acres in North America. Farmers spend
about 150 million U.S. dollars each year on a number of chemical
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the damage is done by the larvae of two
beetle species, the western corn rootworm (diabrotica virgifera)
and the northern corn rootworm (diabrotica barberi).
</P>
<P>
The adult female beetles prefer to lay eggs in cornfields,
where they hatch in the spring at the same time corn seedlings are
growing. The feeding on corn roots inhibits the plant's ability to
take up water and nutrients and to stand straight, they explained.
</P>
<P>
In field trials this summer, the corn demonstrated "excellent
control" of rootworm, and none of the plants in the tests fell
over," said Dr. Jay Pershing, the Mosanto entomologist leading the
research.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto Co., which has been working since 1989 to develop a
corn seed that resists rootworm, said it would be the first to
introduce rootworm-resistant corn seeds since there are currently
no such seeds available in the market.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Launches Banking Restructuring Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Government has
launched major banking restructuring moves by merging four state
banks, freezing the operations of three ailing private banks and
nationalizing another four private banks, press reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Four state banks, Bank Exim, Bapindo, Bank Bumi Daya and Bank
Dagang Negara are to merge into a new bank Bank Mandiri, Finance
Minister Bambang Subianto said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government is to strengthen the capital structure of Bank
Mandiri, he said, adding that it has also appointed Deutsche Bank
an adviser and consultant to help restructure the country's
non-listed troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
The seven private banks were placed under the Indonesian
Banking Restructuring Agency (IBRA) supervision on April 4 because
they had received over 2 trillion rupiah (200 million U.S.
dollars) of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, liquidity credits,
500 percent more than their assets.
</P>
<P>
Subianto announced the nationalization of four banks under the
supervision of IBRA, Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Danamon, Bank
PDFCI and Bank Tiara.
</P>
<P>
BCA, which was hit by a recent massive run on deposits, is the
country's largest private bank.
</P>
<P>
"The government has received statements from owners of the four
banks about their willingness to hand over funds and assets. The
deadline for the hand-over is September 21, 1998," Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
The government also said it froze the operations of Bank
Modern, Bank Umum Nasional and Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia,
bringing the number of banks frozen so far this year to 10.
</P>
<P>
Subianto added that the seven banks whose operations were
frozen in April would be liquidated soon. The seven banks are Bank
Surya, Bank Subentra, Bank Kredit Asia, Bank Pelita, Hokindo Bank,
Deka Bank and Centris International Bank.
</P>
<P>
Banking reform is one of the top priorities set by the
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under an
IMF-led 43 billion U.S. dollars bailout agreement as the poor
banking system remains a major contributor to the country's
prolonged economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Cuts Overnight Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has decided to cut its current overnight borrowing and
lending rates by two percentage points with the Philippine peso
stabilizing at the local foreign exchange market, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The overnight borrowing rate will be reduced effective Monday
from 18 percent to 16 percent, and the lending rate will be
reduced from 20 percent to 18 percent, the Philippine Star said.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying the
Monetary Board, the bank's highest decision-making body, decided
to bring down overnight rates in recognition of the peso's
recovery and the easing of speculative pressures.
</P>
<P>
Singson emphasized that "the increase in our overnight rates is
only temporary."
</P>
<P>
But he added that the authority is "ready to respond quickly in
the event of renewed speculative attacks."
</P>
<P>
The central bank resorted to increasing its key overnight rates
to quell speculation against the peso more than a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Vieira Signs Six Year Contract with Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- French international midfielder
Patrick Vieira completed a signing of a new six-year deal with
Arsenal on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After signing the contract, Vieira promised he would try his
best to keep a good relationship with referees.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the London club from AC Milan for 3.5 million
pounds (5.71 million U.S. dollars) two years ago, the combative
22-year-old has suffered at the hands of English referees.
</P>
<P>
He was sent off twice last season and was within one booking of
 a third suspension that would have ruled him out of the F.A. Cup
final.
</P>
<P>
But after signing the new contract on Friday, the World
Cup-winner said: "My worst problem is talking back to the referee
- that is just stupid. I need to change that.
</P>
<P>
"The more you understand the premier league and the English
game, the more you realise you cannot lose your head.
</P>
<P>
"But I cannot change my game - I will always tackle and
compete hard for the ball. I never foul on purpose, I always go
for the ball."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will sign a new
four-year contract next week. "It's just a matter of putting pen
to paper," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Hit by Increased Stomach Bugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- An upsurge in stomach bugs
has troubled New Zealanders this year with Wellington, capital of
the country, as the worst affected area.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, reported Saturday
that the Environmental and Scientific Research Institute of New
Zealand, which has been monitoring the high level of bacterial
outbreaks, confirmed Friday that 1998 is shaping up to be a record
year for campylobacter and salmonella.
</P>
<P>
Institute public health physician Michael Baker said that if
the rate continues there would be about 11,500 cases of
campylobacter and 2,000 cases of salmonella by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months this year 6,369 cases of
campylobacter and 1,329 cases of salmonella were notified, up 30
percent and 68 percent respectively from the figures in the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
On a measurement of cases for each 100,000 people, the
Wellington health district fared worst with 567 cases of
campylobacter, salmonella and yersinia.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Baker said that a likely theory for the big increase is the
 warm winter this year, the warmest since records were started in
1853.
</P>
<P>
The bacterial bugs are transmitted by contaminated food or
water. The illness usually lasts about a week. Symptoms are severe
stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Baker urged people to develop good personal hygiene habits
in order to avoid illness.

Describing the U.S. move as "the flagrant American aggression,"
Sudan also asked the Security Council to "take the necessary

</P>
<P>
The appeal, first of its kind since the U.S. attacks, was
contained in a letter to President of the Security Council Danilo
Turk from Bishop Gobrial Roric, state minister of Sudan's Ministry
of External Relations.
</P>
<P>
Elfatih Erwa, Sudan's permanent representative to the United
Nations, conveyed the letter to the council president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Erwa voiced his intention to ask the 15-member
Security Council to send a fact-finding mission to Khatoum, the
Sudanese capital, to confirm its claim that the plant bombed by
the United States was not involved in chemical warfare activities.
</P>
<P>
The United States Thursday launched missile strikes on Sudan
and Afghanistan in what was seen as a retaliation to the August 7
twin bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257 people.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Refuses to Contribute to New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has
decided not to contribute to the 1.25-billion-dollar Holocaust
settlement between two major banks and Jewish claimants.
</P>
<P>
"The Swiss National Bank will not make a financial contribution
to the costs of the settlement between Swiss banks and
representatives of class-action suits in the United States," the
Swiss central bank said in a statement issued Friday in the Swiss
capital of Berne at the end of its supervisory board meeting.
</P>
<P>
SNB Chairman Hans Meyer said that the central bank as a public
institution could not and did not want to take part in a
settlement between private parties. The SNB's helping to finance
the accord would have lent an official character to the settlement
that was not in the overall interest of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has also refused to help finance the deal,
which protects the Swiss government and industry, the SNB, and
other Swiss banks from possible boycotts by U.S. cities and
states.
</P>
<P>
UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland's two biggest banks which
made the deal with the claimants on August 12 in New York, have
said they would like other firms and the central bank who benefit
from the deal to contribute to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a statement Friday welcoming the SNB's
decision not to make a contribution.
</P>
<P>
"This decision flows seamlessly from the position taken thus
far by the government and National Bank that the state and its
institutions will not take part in an out-of-court settlement,"
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Keeps First Surplus in 29 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Friday
reported a 24.1 billion U.S. dollars deficit for July, 6 percent
less than a year ago, but still keeping on track for the first
annual budget surplus in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
The July deficit, the gap between 143.8 billion dollars in
spending and 119.7 billion dollars in receipts, put the surplus
for the first 10 months of fiscal 1998 at 43 billion dollars,
compared with a deficit of 36.7 billion dollars for the
corresponding period of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal year ends on September 30. Analysts believed that
August will produce another deficit but September, when quarterly
income tax payments are due from businesses and some individuals,
will bring a substantial surplus.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration forecast in May a 39.1 billion
dollars surplus for the whole fiscal 1998, the first surplus since
1969. Two months later, the Congressional Budget Office said the
surplus should amount to as high as 63 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal deficit hit a record 290 billion dollars in
1992.
</P>
<P>
According to the report Friday, the largest spending categories
for July were: Social Security, 36.4 billion dollars; Department
of Health and Human Services programs such as Medicare and
Medicaid, 32.5 billion dollars; the military, 24.6 billion
dollars, and interest on the public debt, 20.8 billion dollars.

LUANDA, August 21 (Xinhua) --The Angolan government reiterated
Friday that if the opposition UNITA stmll refuses to comply fully
with Lusaka peace accord by the end of this month, it will kick
UNITA's representatives out of the national unity government.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government spokesman Higino Carneiro said after a
meeting of the joint committee of peace process, that the current
situation in Angola cannot go on, citing the fact that some UNITA members
are cooperating with government, while some other UNITA men
are engaged in anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) sticks to its demand that it will not hand over the four
cities in central Angola, namely Bailundo, Andulo, Nharea and
Mungo to the government until the end of September.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel movement argued that some of its army are not
de-militarized because ~? were already out of its control. And
the reason its Chairman Jonas Savimbi has not come to the capital
Luanda to work is that his safety is not guaranteed.

<P>
The Angolan peace process is undergoing the worst crisis in
four years due to these major pending issues.
</P>

Although the joint committee meeting has been resumed under
the metiation of U.N. envoy Lakahdar Brahimi, no achievements
have been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Eoropean Stock Markets Nosedive with Fears of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed the
week sharply down on fears of Russian financial meltdown fuelled
by a big slide on Wall Stree and with concerns over consequences
of U.S. air strikes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The London stock market went into freefall Friday wiping more
than 33 billion pounds, or some 53 billion U.S. dollars, off the
price of leading shares.
</P>
<P>
Traders were gripped by fears the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan
and Sudan could escalate and rumors of a fresh round of currency
crises swept around the world, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street opened with dramatic falls on the Dow Jones index
and the London market was driven further into the red during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At one point the FTSE 100 fell to 5455.1, down 212.3. By the
close, however, the FTSE had rallied slightly to close at 5477
down 190.4.
</P>
<P>
The Dow continued its nosedive after London's close boding
badly for Monday's market opening in London, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist at HSBC
Securities, was quoted as saying: "All the markets in Europe are
falling. The Asian contagion has spread to Latin America and other
commodity producing countries. We're all wondering where it will
end. The U.S. air strikes just add to these concerns."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, leading German shares dropped sharply after a
slump at opening on Wall Street, too, with the Russian financial
crisis continuing to weigh heavily on international markets.
</P>
<P>
The leading Dax index closed 324 points lower at 5163.51, a
drop of 6.2 percent. However, the Xetra Dax, reflecting electronic
trading which continued after floor trading finished, recovered in
late trade to close down 209.4 points at 5190.6.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks also showed severe losses in late trade
as U.S. and Latin American markets joined the global slide. The
leading Cac-40 index fell 143.61 points, or 3.6 percent, to close
at 3943.68.

<P>
Dealers were said to be braced for a devaluation Venezuela's
bolivar, which has again rattled markets right across the region.
The shares had been hit hard earlier amid continuing worries about
the economic instability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Today's pull back was heightened by the upcoming monthly
liquidation. With only one more day of trading before the
beginning of the new trading month, investors are selling off
their equity, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
"Monday will be the last day for liquidating investment
positions, which means many people will sell their shares before
then, so as to buy on credit when the new month begins on
Tuesday," Jean Faivre, a trader at CLC bourse, was quoted by local
media as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Forum on Forests to Meet at Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Measures to slow
deforestation are on the agenda for the first substantive session
of the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests to be opened in Geneva
next Monday, it was announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The session, to end on September 4, will also include
background talks on possible elements of a legal agreement, said
the U.N. Department of Public Information.
</P>
<P>
Despite significant progress since the Earth Summit in 1992 in
improving national forest planning and increasing international
coordination, statistics still paint a disturbing picture of
continued deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The world lost an average of 11.3 million ha of net forest area
annually, roughly the size of Honduras, between 1991 and 1995,
according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
Most of this loss took place in tropical forests, which lost
12.36 million ha a year, offset slightly by planting of forest
plantations in other regions.
</P>
<P>
Destruction of rain forests has continued almost unabated since
the 1980s, when the average annual loss of tropical forests was
12.8 million ha.
</P>
<P>
Just a few countries, such as Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Mexico, Venezuela and Zaire, accounted for 50 percent of
the tropical forest loss in 1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. intergovernmental panel on forests created in 1995 went
a long way toward building international consensus in 1997 when
governments agreed on over 135 proposals for action aimed at
sustainable forest management.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are seen as effective guidelines for national
policy and a U.N. report prepared for the session calls for
political support for implementation and increased financial
assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The will review the impact of existing legal agreements and
international work on forests. It will be followed by discussions
planned for May 1999 on identifying the possible elements of
internaitonal arrangements, such as a forest convention.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC to Lose Ground in Election: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) will lose ground in the 1999
general election, according to a survey released Friday.
</P>
<P>
Markdata said in a statement t(at the poll indicated that 57
percent of voters would favor the ANC-led alliance with South
African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, a 5.5 percentage points drop from the 62.5 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP), expected to win only 10.7 percent in
next year's election, will be seriously challenged by the
Democratic Party (DP), which is expected to win 10 percent, said
the survey conducted in July.
</P>
<P>
The NP won more than 20 percent of the votes in the 1994
election.
</P>
<P>
The racial breakdown indicates that the ANC is by far the most
popular party among blacks with 72.9 percent, followed by Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) with 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NP enjoys the most support among the colored with 42.4
percent, followed by the ANC (29.6 percent) and the DP (17.7
percent).
</P>
<P>
Among Indians, support for the DP and NP is at 32.4 percent
and 31.4 percent res0eatively. Both are clearly ahead of the ANC
(19.4 percent) and the United Democratic Movement (UDM) with 10.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Among whites, the DP has established a dominant position at 46
percent, eclipsing the formerly dominant NP (24.6 percent) by a
substantial margin. The ANC has the support of only 2.6 percent
of the white population.
</P>
<P>
A study examining trends in party support from 1994 to 1998
suggests that the ANC has since 1997 lost a great deal of the
nominal or uncommitted support which it used to attract, Markdata
said.
</P>
<P>
The NP has lost support quite dramatically since its departure
from the government of national unity and the resignation of F. W.
de Klet+ as its leader.
</P>
<P>
The IFP appears to be at roughly the same level of support as
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the success stories are the DP, the
Pan Africanist Congress and the newly established UDM.
