<HEADLINE> Arthritis Drugs Fight for Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The two hottest new prescription drugs of 1999  
appear to be stealing market share from over-the-counter remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a third of patients taking the new arthritis drugs,  
Celebrex and Vioxx, were previously relying on over-the-counter 
medications or taking nothing at all for their arthritis pain, 
according to a study released Wednesday by the market data firm Rx 
Remedy Information Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex and Vioxx, both approved earlier this year, reduce  
arthritis pain with significantly less risk of stomach side effects 
such as ulcers compared to aspirin and other prescription arthritis 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``As expected, and feared by some sectors of the industry,  
consumer and physician attraction to the new (arthritis drugs) 
appears to be significantly expanding the market for higher cost 
prescription pain medications,'' says Robert J. Enck, Division 
President of Rx Remedy, based in Mercerville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	New prescription drugs usually gain market share at the expense  
of other prescription drugs, but Celebrex and Vioxx, are unusual in 
also benefiting at the expense of over-the-counter remedies, Enck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed 31 percent of Celebrex patients and 26 percent  
of Vioxx patients previously were not taking a prescription 
painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not break out the proportion of those patients on  
over-the-counter remedies and those taking nothing for their pain. 
But Enck said the study indicates the over-the-counter painkillers 
are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly they are drawing new patients into the category,''  
Enck said. ``They are definitely taking away patients ... who were 
previously using over-the-counter products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, maintain  
that Celebrex and Vioxx have not hurt sales this year. 
Nevertheless, J&AMP;J launched major advertising campaigns this year 
pitching Tylenol for arthritis pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex is jointly marketed by Monsanto Co and Pfizer, Inc.,  
while Vioxx is sold by Merck &AMP; Co. Celebrex, which had a six month 
head start on the market, maintains a commanding market share lead 
among the two products, though Vioxx has closed the gap in recent 
months among new prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Celebrex surpassed the anti-impotence drug Viagra,  
to become the hottest selling new prescription drug ever. Celebrex, 
launched in January, is expected to post more than $1 billion in 
sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Monsanto's pharmaceutical division Searle said  
Celebrex sales have exceeded their projections. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason is the hype surrounding Celebrex has convinced more  
arthritis sufferers to seek help from their doctor. A study done by 
the consulting firm Scott-Levin showed doctor visits for arthritis 
increased 18 percent to 4.8 million in the first four months of 
1999, just as Celebrex was being launched.

<HEADLINE> Edwards: 70 Years in Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Ralph Edwards, this is your life.  
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who created the game show ``Truth or Consequences'' and  
produces TV's ``People's Court,'' has been in broadcasting for 70 
years -- and he's still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
	He stays fit, goes to the office three times a week and, at age  
86, looks back to 1929 when he broke into radio as a 16-year-old 
student from a high school in Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes in both radio and television are mind-boggling,''  
he said. ``In the early days of radio, everything was live ... and 
up until 1948 my weekly radio show, 'Truth or Consequences' was 
done twice each Saturday. When originating in New York, it would be 
done live at 8 o'clock for the East Coast and three hours later 
another live show for the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would use the same script but all new contestants.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then came television.  
</P>
<P>
	``Amazingly enough I did 'Truth or Consequences' on television  
in July 1941. It was the first commercial show for NBC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It featured commercials for Bulova watches. ``A ten-second  
commercial was $9,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	World War II came five months later, and broadcast careers were  
interrupted along with everything else. Resuming after the war, TV 
underwent sweeping change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen many changes and enjoyed them all,'' Edwards said.  
``I still find 'live' the most exciting, particularly for my type 
of shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, ``Truth or Consequences'' was sponsored on TV by  
Phillip Morris Tobacco. Edwards says Phillip Morris didn't like 
Kinescope, a format that allowed delayed West Coast telecasts. So 
Edwards broke ground with the ``live on film'' concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was revolutionary -- in fact, so sensational that the 'I  
Love Lucy' people used it when they made their television debut the 
following year,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truth or Consequences'' contestants were asked goofy questions  
and had to pay for missed answers by performing goofy stunts. The 
show lasted a single season with Edwards as host and then returned 
in 1954 with Jack Bailey as host. Other emcees included Steve Dunne 
and Bob Barker, who made a career of the popular show. 
</P>
<P>
	The show became enormously popular and producers were even able  
to persuade the New Mexico town of Hot Springs to change its name 
to Truth or Consequences as part of the show's 1950 promotion 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``Truth or Consequences'' lived on without Edwards, he  
went on to do ``This Is Your Life,'' which featured guests who did 
not know they were about to be confronted with their pasts. It ran 
on NBC-TV from 1952 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards produced or co-produced an array of other shows,  
including ``Name That Tune,'' ``Place the Face,'' ``End of the 
Rainbow'' and ``The Wide Country,'' a Western. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Edwards starts his mornings with juice and oatmeal,  
but ``strange as it seems I have never drunk coffee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He confers with his partner in Ralph Edwards/Stu Billett  
Productions, reviews tape and makes suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so lucky,'' Billett says. ``He's had shows on that lasted  
for so many years. ... He's got great instincts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards has reviewed and approves of Jerry Sheindlin, who  
started this month as the judge on ``People's Court,'' Billett 
says. Sheindlin, husband of Judy Sheindlin of ``Judge Judy'' fame, 
spent 17 years on the bench in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was born in Merino, Colo., and worked at KROW and KFRC  
in San Francisco while attending the University of California at 
Berkeley. He now lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards' wife, Barbara, died in 1993. He remains in almost daily  
contact with his children, Gary, who works with him; and daughters 
Christine Tandy in Salem, Ore., and Laurie Lenhart in Los Gatos, 
Calif. He has four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	And every few weeks he has dinner with his friend and colleague,  
Bob Barker. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker said Edwards gave him the defining break of his career  
when he picked him for ``Truth or Consequences'' on Dec. 21, 1956 -- 
``the most exciting Christmas of my life.'' The two have met every 
Dec. 21 to celebrate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards is ``a splendid host, an excellent producer, a very  
talented writer -- but beyond all that he's a wonderful man,'' 
Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 43 years of television, I have never heard one person ever  
say anything derogatory about Ralph Edwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	BUYER BEWARE: The average person is exposed to more than 3,000  
ads each day, researchers estimate. ``Spin &AMP; Sell: A History of 
Advertising,'' showing 9 p.m. EDT Friday on History Channel's 
``Time Machine,'' shows how advertising works and how ads influence 
more than our buying decisions. Dick Cavett narrates the two-hour 
special and Roger Mudd is host.

<HEADLINE> Marshall-Toledo Play in Prime Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Chad Pennington has been fashionably  
late for Marshall's game with Toledo the last two years. The 
Rockets hope he doesn't show up at all this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo (3-2, 1-2 MAC West) will get its final shot at the  
Mid-American Conference's career passing leader Thursday night in 
the first MAC regular-season game on national TV since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	This may not be Toledo's best chance. Pennington is having  
another great year and No. 15 Marshall (5-0, 2-0 MAC East) has 19 
starters back. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Chad, you've got an NFL quarterback. What else can you say  
about the guy?'' Toledo coach Gary Pinkel said. ``They're the best 
team I've seen in this league this decade. They might be one of the 
best ever. They are about as strong and sound at every position 
that you can be. Our players recognize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington has completed 63 percent of his passes for 1,569  
yards and 14 touchdowns, ranking him second in Division I-A passing 
efficiency behind Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	The past two years he led Marshall to comeback victories over  
Toledo in the MAC title game in Huntington to earn automatic bids 
to the Motor City Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the year he broke Tim Couch's NCAA record for  
sophomores with 39 TD passes, Pennington threw three second-half 
touchdowns and 322 yards passing in a 34-14 win over the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Pennington was hobbled by a groin pull against  
Toledo, but drove Marshall 61 yards for the go-ahead score in the 
fourth quarter of a 23-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we will put it away earlier,'' Pennington said.  
``It's scary going into the fourth quarter not knowing what's going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall's national ranking is the highest for a MAC team since  
Miami of Ohio finished 10th at the end of the 1974 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the team to beat in the MAC,'' Toledo tight end Mike  
Bilik said. ``They've beat us the past two years. But at the same 
time, we're not going to let that ruin our confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overconfidence could be Marshall's biggest foe.  
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, a 22-point favorite Thursday, owns Division I-A's  
longest home winning streak at 27 games. It also has Division I-A's 
longest overall winning streak at nine games, along with 106 
victories in the 1990s, a record for any decade in Division I-A or 
I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
	The six remaining teams on Marshall's schedule are a combined  
12-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a MAC championship game every game, so we've  
got to be ready no matter who we play,'' Pennington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have injuries at running back.  
</P>
<P>
	Doug Chapman, seeking to become the first Marshall player to  
rush for 1,000 yards in four straight seasons, has just 296 yards. 
He has played three games with a dislocated right thumb but is 
expected to have a soft cast removed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo's Chester Taylor, third in the conference with 519 yards,  
is questionable with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo quarterback Tavares Bolden will get the nod again this  
week after replacing Dan Cole as the starter in a 47-7 win over 
Kent last week. Both threw for two scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just kind of felt we needed a little jolt in our passing  
game,'' Pinkel said. ``This business is based on results.''

<HEADLINE> ConEd To Buy Northeast Utilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Conn. (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Inc. is buying  
Northeast Utilities for up to about $3.5 billion in cash and stock 
in a deal that will create one of the nation's largest electric 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said in announcing the deal today that the  
combined company would have more than 5 million electric customers 
and 1.4 million natural gas customers in the Northeast from the New 
York area to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the utility  
industry as deregulation has driven power distributors to seek 
competitive advantages by teaming up with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their boards approved a definitive merger  
agreement under which Consolidated Edison will pay $25 a share in 
cash and stock for Northeast's 133 million common shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal isn't expected to close until the end of the year 2000,  
and it contains terms that would boost the value of the offer by 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison would pay an additional $1 a share if units 2 and 3  
of the Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting that and an adjustment which raises the value of the  
offer by a third of a cent each day after Aug. 5, 2000, Northeast 
shareholders would get $26.50 for each share if the deal closes at 
the end of 2000, or a total of about $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities, based in Berlin, is the largest electric  
utility in New England, with more than $4 billion in annual revenue 
and more than 1.7 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Edison, based in New York, generated more than $7  
billion in annual revenue in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> PGA Golfer Begay Sheds 'War Paint'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) -- Notah Begay III used to put two  
dabs of ceremonial red clay on his cheeks before a tough golf match 
-- a Native American custom as they begin ``an extremely challenging 
journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay gave up the ritual a few years ago. The only Native  
American playing on the U.S. PGA Tour has shown he can win without 
what his opponents used to call ``war paint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has two victories in the last two months -- including Sunday  
in a playoff in the Michelob Championship in Williamsburg, Va. -- in 
his first season on the world's toughest circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That custom is a bit of a distraction now,'' said Begay, who  
has drawn more curious fans than 19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia 
as they prepare to start Thursday in the 12-man World Match Play 
championship at Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I still see every single round of golf ... as a long  
journey,'' he added. ``You never know where you're going to go and 
you don't know how hard it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay is the only full-blooded American Indian to ever win a  
U.S. Tour event. He lived for seven years on a reservation south of 
Albuquerque, N.M., and was Tiger Woods' teammate four years ago at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	He putts both left- and right-handed, depending on the break,  
and has an unorthodox, self-made swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see myself in the class of a lot of players who are  
here,'' said Begay, who was picked two months ago by Mark 
McCormack, whose International Management Group runs this event. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (McCormack) said he wanted to give some up-and-coming  
American players some exposure,'' Begay explained. ``Maybe I 
deserve to be here, a least a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay, who faces two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal  
in the 36-hole first round, is in a 12-man field that includes 
defending champion Mark O'Meara, two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie 
Els, three-time majors winner Nick Price and top European player 
Colin Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round matches it will be Craig Parry vs. Paul  
Lawrie, Garcia vs. Retief Goosen, and Carlos Franco vs. Padraig 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I lack confidence, but if you pulled out  
everybody's resume, mine would be the shortest. That's just a 
fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay, who calls himself an American Indian or Native American,  
took up golf while tagging along with his father -- Notah Begay Jr. 
-- when he started as a middle-age golfer in a local league. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a golf club to stay out of the way and I liked  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't know how to play, they didn't know the rules. They  
didn't know the strategy. They were just out there because that was 
what they were supposed to be doing at that age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At eight, he began working at a local course for free in  
exchange for a bucket of balls and no greens fees, and eventually 
began to hone his game at a private prep school -- Albuquerque 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stanford, he played with Woods and Casey Martin and still  
stays in touch with both. In fact, at Stanford he played No. 1 
ahead of Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Woods) got a little better, a little faster,'' Begay said.  
``I haven't necessarily had it any more difficult than anyone 
else,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay, whose first name means ``almost there'' in Navajo, said  
he's experienced few racial taunts and hasn't heard any around the 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had any problems being turned away from a particular  
club,'' he said. ``Some places they think I'm a caddie.''

<HEADLINE> Bank of New York VP Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A suspended executive at the Bank of New York  
has resigned, saying she was unfairly victimized by rumors swirling 
around what is alleged to be the largest money laundering scandal 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Natasha Kagalovsky, senior vice president and head of the bank's  
Eastern European Division, said Tuesday in her resignation letter 
that she was tired of living in ``professional limbo'' amid 
baseless rumors. She was suspended by the bank Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find this intolerable, personally very hurtful and extremely  
unfair,'' she said in a letter submitted to bank chairman Thomas 
Renyi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky had been on paid leave since the bank became  
publicly embroiled in an alleged massive money laundering scheme in 
which up to $10 billion was illegally moved from Russia through the 
Bank of New York, the nation's 15th-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The money may have ties to the Russia mafia, though Russian  
officials are also eying corporations and individuals trying to 
avoid paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Renyi assured employees in an August memo that the bank was  
cooperating with investigators, that it has not been accused of any 
wrongdoing, and that no funds have been lost or customer services 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no action was taken against Ms. Kagalovsky, her future at  
the bank remained unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was quitting with a heavy heart because nothing  
justified ``leaving me to swing in the wind, when nothing I ever 
did or didn't do was wrong in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank spokesman Frank Scarangella would only say: ``We  
acknowledge the resignation and wish her well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky's letter was quoted in a statement released by  
her lawyer, Stanley Arkin. He said his client was willing to 
cooperate with the investigation but had little to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's always available to give whatever information is  
required,'' he said. ``She is completely uninvolved and 
unknowledgeable about any wrongdoing. She feels this bank should 
have been more supportive of her. We have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky was not indicted last month when indictments were  
returned against Lucy Edwards, another executive at the bank, Ms. 
Edwards' husband, Peter Berlin, and their business associate, 
Aleksey Volkov, as well as three companies with which they were 
allegedly involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, Berlin and Volkov were charged with conspiring from  
1996 through August 1999 of illegally funneling $7 billion from 
Russia through accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York subsequently fired Ms. Edwards for  
allegedly falsifying records and failing to cooperate with internal 
investigators. She had denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Indians Get $89M To Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department awarded $89 million in  
grants to Indian communities in 26 states to hire, train and equip 
police officers and to build new jails and detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants are aimed at reducing crime rates among the 1.4  
million Indians living on or near Indian territories. Government 
studies show Indians are victims of violent crime more than twice 
as often as any other major group and are more likely than others 
to be attacked by people of other races. 
</P>
<P>
	``These grants for additional officers, training and facilities  
will help ensure that all native Americans living on Indian lands 
will enjoy the decrease in crime being felt throughout the 
nation,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno, who met today with 
tribal leaders to discuss crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported  
that from 1992 through 1996, an annual average of 124 out of every 
1,000 Indians age 12 or older were victims of violent crime. By 
comparison, the rate for whites was 49 per 1,000; and it was 61 for 
blacks and 29 for Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Developed by the Justice and Interior Departments in  
consultation with tribes, the grants will pay for: 
</P>
<P>
	--Tribal communities to hire more police officers or to train or  
better equip existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
	--New regional jails and detention facilities.  
</P>
<P>
	--Technical assistance to devise new justice systems, such as  
inter-tribal courts to share limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
	--Programs for at-risk youths to combat gang violence and drug  
and domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Intertribal exchanges of ideas will be fostered by a  
``comprehensive Indian resources for community and law enforcement 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian communities awarded grants are located in Alaska,  
Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, 
Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The city council has declared the Ku  
Klux Klan a terrorist group and condemned other hate groups as well 
in a resolution approved after an emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was approved on a voice vote Tuesday after  
council members were assured it would not infringe on anyone's 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has a no-tolerance policy for terrorist  
organizations,'' said councilman Kwadjo Campbell. ``This is an 
unprecedented move, undoubtedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center in  
Montgomery, Ala., said this may be the first municipality to 
designate the Klan a terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly  
black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a 
$21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan 
members after the church was burned four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution only expresses the opinion of council and doesn't  
create law, city attorneys said. If the Klan wants to march, they 
may apply for a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsor Wendell Gilliard had said when he first proposed the  
resolution that he wanted to prevent the Klan from holding rallies 
in the city. It has been several years since the group marched in 
Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a black thing. This is a human thing,'' Gilliard  
said. ``This is about race relations. This is about saving lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution says Charleston welcomes diverse opinions ``but  
not those views that instigate fear, bias, bigotry and hate.'' It 
condemns any organization ``whose purpose is to encourage hate of 
any individual, race, religion, culture or way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several council members were concerned the resolution could lead  
to lawsuits and a resumption of Klan marches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer letting the Klan die a natural death rather  
than cutting off their First Amendment rights,'' said Paul Tinkler. 
</P>
<P>
	Horace King, leader of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  
in South Carolina, refused to comment.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission OKs Telecom Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive  
Commission on Wednesday cleared a merger between the Swedish 
telecommunications company Telia AB and its Norwegian equivalent 
Telenor ASA after the two companies committed to a number of 
concessions to allay competition concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Commission said the two companies had made  
``far-reaching commitments'' to loosen their grip on the local 
telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also agreed to divest their respective cable TV  
businesses and other overlapping businesses, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission said the merger as it was originally notified  
would have caused serious competition concerns in a number of 
telecommunications and related services markets in Sweden and 
Norway, in the Irish mobile telephony market, and in a number of 
Swedish and Norwegian TV markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission can block mergers which it judges violate EU  
competition rules.

<HEADLINE> Three French Chefs Share Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chefs Jacques Pepin, Alain Sailhac and Andre  
Soltner are the ``Three Musketeers'' of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, ``more like the `Three Stooges,''' quipped Pepin as his  
fellow chefs surrounded him and giggled like schoolgirls. They were 
enjoying a dinner held in their honor at the French Culinary 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The three chefs share a close friendship -- and a love of the  
culinary arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are so lucky to do what we love and make a living out of  
it,'' said Pepin, 63, the author of 18 cookbooks. Episodes of his 
new series with Julia Child, ``Julia and Jacques: Cooking at 
Home,'' are now being aired on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre is really the top chef in New York and Jacques is a  
superstar,'' said Sailhac, 63, who was executive chef at Le Cygne 
and Le Cirque. Sailhac is senior dean of studies at the French 
Culinary Institute. Soltner, 66, former chef-owner of Lutece, is 
master chef and senior lecturer. And Pepin, who was the executive 
chef of Le Pavillon, is dean of special programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sailhac said he is ``a little jealous'' of his friends -- not  
because of their fame or cooking skills -- but because they are 
``wonderful men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be just a little bit like them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The admiration is mutual.  
</P>
<P>
	``Alain and Andre are people with a sense of taste,'' Pepin  
said. ``They understand that cooking is an expression of culture, 
an expression of more than food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The culinary stars devote much of their time to teaching at the  
French Culinary Institute. ``I've never seen professionals who work 
so hard,'' said FCI founder Dorothy Cann Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	They never complain about long hours, she said. ``And what a  
sense of humor they have!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three chefs, who speak in thick French accents, still look  
forward to getting into the kitchen each day. ``The day someone 
doesn't cook with joy in his heart, they should forget it,'' 
Soltner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really get into a nervous fit if we don't cook for four or  
five days,'' added Pepin. 
</P>
<P>
	When they're not working together at the culinary school, they  
are enjoying meals at each other's homes. (Soltner said Sailhac 
always prepares chicken, while Sailhac's favorite is a pate that 
Pepin makes with ham, parsley and cognac.) They ski together on 
weekends and vacation with their families. Soltner refers to 
Pepin's daughter as his ``niece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the FCI tribute dinner, students prepared foie gras,  
bouillabaisse and veal roasted with wild mushrooms. The students 
weren't told the guest list included Child, Le Cirque 2000 owner 
Sirio Maccioni and food critic Mimi Sheraton of The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pepin shares a secret: They are all among the easiest to  
please. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gluttons. We'll eat anything you put in front of us.''

	Senate Rejects Nuke Test Ban  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today rejected a landmark treaty to  
ban nuclear testing, handing President Clinton a humiliating 
foreign policy defeat. The vote was 48 to 51, far short of the 67 
votes -- or two-thirds -- needed for ratification. As expected, the 
final vote closely followed party lines, with only four Republicans 
voting for the treaty. Democrats vowed to make the rejection a 
prime 2000 campaign issue, claiming polls show most Americans favor 
such a ban -- first proposed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958. 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the pact 
``fatally flawed.''

	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A grand jury decided there was  
insufficient evidence to indict anyone in the JonBenet Ramsey 
slaying, ending a 13-month investigation into the case, District 
Attorney Alex Hunter announced today. The brutal crime set off a 
drawn-out, controversial search for her killer. The prominence of 
the family -- the father the millionaire president of Access 
Graphics, the mother a former Miss West Virginia -- and the beauty 
contest background of the blonde child victim brought worldwide 
attention for nearly three years.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc., parent of the world's  
biggest tobacco company, is acknowledging publicly that tobacco 
isn't safe. The company has launched a corporate Web site to remake 
its image, stating ``there is no 'safe' cigarette'' and that 
``cigarette smoking is addictive, as that term is most commonly 
used today.'' Philip Morris, which for years disputed research that 
found smoking contributed to medical problems, also acknowledged 
that smokers face tremendous health hazards. President Clinton said 
Philip Morris' acknowledgment that tobacco isn't safe ``comes far 
too late but still we must all welcome it.

shortage for the Power Mac G4. The company reported net income of 
$111 million, or 63 cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended

Korean War, a U.S. general and other Army officers ordered the 
destruction of two strategic bridges as South Korean refugees 
streamed across, killing hundreds of civilians, according to 
ex-GIs, Korean witnesses and U.S. military documents. Ex-GIs told 
The Associated Press of the bridge blowings and two other 
incidents, machine-gun and mortar attacks on refugees, during 
interviews about what happened at No Gun Ri, South Korea, in late 
July 1950. In that case, as reported on Sept. 29, veterans

	Indian PM Vajpayee Sworn In  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Amid political upheaval in neighboring  
Pakistan, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in 
Wednesday as India's leader for the third time. Vajpayee's 
government fell in April when a southern politician withdrew her 
party's 18 seats from the coalition and Vajpayee lost a confidence 
motion by one vote. No other group was able to form a government 
and Vajpayee remained in charge of a caretaker government while 
elections were held. Vajpayee had said that one of the first tasks 
of his new government would be to restart peace talks that were 
disrupted by recent fighting in Kashmir, which has been the cause 
of two of the three wars between Pakistan and India.

state-run media and confining the prime minister to his home in a 
lightning move that raised tensions in the world's newest nuclear 
region. In a televised address, Army Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf 
accused the government of ``systematically destroying'' state 
institutions and driving the economy toward collapse. ``You are all 
well aware of the kind of turmoil and uncertainty that our country 
has gone through in recent times,'' Musharraf said. ``Not only have 
all the institutions been played around with and systematically 
destroyed, the economy too is in a state of collapse.''

	SAN JUAN ACATENO, Mexico (AP) -- All they wanted was food for  
themselves and their village. To get it, the 40 men had to trudge 
for three hours along a muddy, damaged road, cross a makeshift 
bridge and shoulder heavy bags of basic foodstuffs. Then, bent 
under their burdens, the return trip to their village, Hueyapan, 
awaited them. It is a scene being repeated across eastern Mexico, 
where a deluge of rain has washed out bridges and roads, isolating 
hundreds of communities and forcing residents to make long journeys 
for food. Efforts to bring in food have been hampered by the 
geographical sweep of the emergency, poor weather, and the need to 
recover the bodies of the dead.

	Wilt Chamberlain Dead At 63

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain was  
found dead Tuesday in his Bel-Air home. He was 63 years old. 
Authorities said there were signs that Chamberlain might have had a 
heart attack. Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's agent, said he had been 
hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat in 1992, and was on 
medication. ``Wilt the Stilt'' played from 1959 to 1973 for the 
Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, the Philadelphia

positioning themselves for a daring mission to the South Pole to 
rescue an American doctor with a lump in her breast. After a 
24-hour delay caused by bad weather, the two planes set out from 
New Zealand for McMurdo base in Antarctica after high winds and 
swirling snow eased on the frigid continent. ``Weather conditions 
both at and above McMurdo station are favorable, with yesterday's 
high winds and whiteout conditions having cleared away during the

	Test Ban Agreement Remains Elusive

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While bipartisan support is building in the  
Senate to delay a nuclear test ban vote, finding a graceful exit 
from near-certain defeat of the pact remains elusive. A small group 
of conservatives continues to threaten to block any effort at 
meeting President Clinton's request that the vote on the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty be postponed. Unless a deal can be 
reached, a showdown vote on the pact will occur late today. Clinton 
and other supporters concede they are far short of the 67 needed 
for ratification if all 100 senators vote.

Braves. It didn't help as the Braves beat the Mets 4-2 in Game 1. 
Piazza missed the last two games of the NL division playoffs

thumb. Piazza, who hit .303 with 40 home runs and 124 RBIs this 
season, said he's about ``95 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Gets Close in Loss To Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra showed acrobatic grace and the  
daring of a thief. 
</P>
<P>
	His two leaping catches kept New York from scoring at least  
three runs in the opener of the AL championship series Wednesday 
night. Unfortunately for Boston, he was nowhere near Bernie 
Williams' drive that cleared the center-field fence in the 10th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer on Rod Beck's second pitch gave the Yankees a 4-3  
victory over the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live and die by the strike,'' Beck said. ``I'm going to  
throw the ball over the dish and take my chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra might have had a chance to drive in the winning run  
in the top of the inning. He was on deck when Brian Daubach 
grounded into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortstop already had kept Boston in the game with his  
catches in the first with runners at second and third and in the 
third with runners at first and third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just jumped and tried to make a play,'' Garciaparra said.  
``I'm glad the ball came down in my glove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, though, he displayed the nimble-handedness of Bill  
Buckner when he bobbled a routine grounder that gave the Yankees a 
chance to go ahead in the seventh inning. However, New York 
couldn't capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the ball hit to him,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams  
said. ``I will never, ever say he is a bad defensive player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the game, the spotlight was on the opposing shortstops.  
Garciaparra won the AL batting title, homered in the decisive fifth 
game of the AL division series in Cleveland and was still nursing a 
bruised wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter finished second in the batting race and, like  
Garciaparra, was an All-Star and one of the best fielders at his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter won the batting competition Wednesday night with two hits  
to none for Garciaparra. The Boston shortstop was better with the 
glove, despite committing two harmless errors for the first time 
since Aug. 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter goodnaturedly accused Garciaparra of showboating on his  
catches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spread his legs a little bit to make it look like he was  
higher,'' Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox are trying to get to the World Series for the first  
time since 1986, when the New York Mets scored the winning run in 
Game 6 as a grounder went through Buckner's legs behind first base. 
New York won Game 7 two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Garciaparra's errors didn't contribute to  
any runs. Jeter's error in the first inning did. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Offerman led off the game with a single, and John Valentin  
grounded to Jeter, who threw toward second. But the ball flew into 
right field and Offerman came around to score the game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough play but it was a play I've made before. I just  
threw it a little low,'' Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees would have gone ahead in the bottom of the first had  
Garciaparra not perfectly timed a leap to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	They had runners on second and third after a walk to Jeter, a  
single by Paul O'Neill and a groundout. Then Chili Davis hit a 
rising liner toward Garciaparra. The shortstop rose to meet it, 
extending his left arm straight up, coming down with the ball and 
landing on his feet. The crowd, expecting two runs, was stunned to 
silence at the sight of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, Garciaparra saved a run with two outstanding  
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jeter doubled and O'Neill struck out, Williams hit a  
grounder that Garciaparra gloved deep in the hole. His throw to 
second to get Jeter went into right field for an error and Jeter 
advanced to third. But he almost certainly would have scored had 
the ball gotten by Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jeter still at third, Tino Martinez hit a liner just to the  
left of second base. Garciaparra, positioned perfectly, leaped 
again. Not as high as the first time, but still with plenty of 
space between the bottom of his shoes and the infield dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just goes with the kind of player the kid is,'' Jimy  
Williams said. ``He plays to win, gives you everything he has 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Garciaparra's glove failed him.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had tied the game 3-3 when Scott Brosius singled,  
advanced on Chuck Knoblauch's sacrifice bunt and scored on Jeter's 
single to right. Trot Nixon's strong throw beat Brosius to the 
plate, but catcher Jason Varitek couldn't handle it as Jeter took 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball started up the line and tailed back into me,''  
Varitek said. ``But I was in the right position to catch the ball 
and make the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill followed with a grounder to Garciaparra, just to the  
left of second base. He bobbled the ball and, after he got a grip 
on it, Jeter was standing on second and blocking the path of a 
throw to first. So Garciaparra held the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He had another chance when the next batter, Williams, hit a  
ground ball that Garciaparra threw to second to force O'Neill as 
Jeter took third. Williams stole second, but the threat ended when 
Davis struck out.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Says It Will Appeal Judgment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. says it  
will appeal a $143 million judgment it was ordered to pay to a 
British medical electronics company that accused it of stealing its 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court jury awarded the damages to Trovan Ltd.,  
which sued Pfizer for using the name Trovan for an antibiotic 
introduced in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug later was linked to several cases of liver failure, and  
the federal Food and Drug Administration has restricted its use. 
</P>
<P>
	``These jury verdicts are not supported by either the law or the  
facts, and we are confident this decision will not be upheld,'' 
Paul S. Miller, Pfizer's general counsel and executive vice 
president, said after Tuesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan Ltd. and its U.S. distributor, Electronic Identification  
Devices of Santa Barbara, contended that their reputations were 
damaged by being linked to the antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company's reputation is everything,'' said Joseph Masin,  
president of Electronic Identification Devices. ``With this 
victory, we can continue to grow our company knowing once and for 
all that Trovan is indisputably ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held Trovan Ltd. manufactures identification tags that  
are implanted with computer chips containing information about 
patients' medical conditions. The tags also are used by researchers 
and hospitals to track blood supplies and by pet owners to track 
their animals if they become lost or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict is the second setback for New York-based Pfizer in  
recent weeks. In August, the company announced it was halting 
development of Alond, a potentially lucrative drug designed to 
reduce diabetic nerve damage. Pfizer had similarly high 
expectations for Trovan when it was introduced in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had projected the Trovan antibiotic to generate $370  
million in worldwide sales this year and about $1.3 billion in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer has said that Trovan has therapeutic advantages and the  
degree of risk associated with the product is not markedly 
different from other antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar edged up against the yen today, as  
Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 106.58 yen by late afternoon, up 0.30 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above the 106.31 yen level in 
New York. During the day it ranged from 105.93 yen to 106.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 336.32 points,  
or 1.86 percent, to close the day at 17,754.49. The index closed up 
28.63 points, or 0.16 percent, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar initially moved higher on buying  
from Japanese institutional investors, inched down by midafternoon 
and then rose again. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were awaiting the outcome of a Bank of Japan policy  
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening news conference, after financial markets here had  
closed, the central bank said it kept its monetary policy 
unchanged. The central bank will watch the yen carefully because 
its rise could hurt economic recovery in private demand, said BOJ 
Governor Masaru Hayami. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has soared in recent months on optimism over Japan's  
budding economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has regained some ground since last month, when  
finance ministers from major countries expressed concern about the 
yen's strength. But the gains have been limited by market 
skepticism about the Bank of Japan's ability to bring the yen back 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial authorities say that too steep a rise in the yen could  
derail the recovery by reducing demand for Japanese goods abroad, 
as a stronger currency makes them more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been struggling to emerge from its worst economic  
downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.87 yen, above  
its level of 113.37 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, share prices fell following a drop on Wall  
Street and caution over the Bank of Japan's policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have adopted a strong wait-and-see attitude,'' said  
Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi-Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 658.51 million shares, down from 692.72 million shares 
Tuesday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 899 to 320, while 
115 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsuguya Onozuka, an equity futures dealer at Yamatane  
Securities, expects the Nikkei to remain in a narrow range ahead of 
the announcement of a supplementary government budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no major buying or selling incentives,'' Onozuka  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 15.84 points, or 1.03 percent, to finish at 
1,526.96. The TOPIX closed up 11.97 points, or 0.78 percent, on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7600 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its 
price rose 0.34 point to 99.48.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Coup Leader Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's new military leader came  
under pressure to restore democracy Wednesday after his troops 
swept away the elected government, raising fears around the world 
at the prospect of army rule in a nuclear-armed nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's nuclear rival, India, put its troops on alert and  
watched warily for the next step by Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, a man 
Indians blame for months of bloody fighting this summer in disputed 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, head of Pakistan's army, gave no hint about his plans  
Wednesday, maintaining silence after announcing before dawn that 
his troops had ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's lightning coup -- sparked by Sharif's attempt to fire  
Musharraf -- capped months of growing army resentment against the 
premier for backing away from the fight over Kashmir. President 
Clinton pressured Sharif into convincing Islamic fighters to pull 
back, reportedly outraging and humiliating army leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned the  
coup created a ``level of uncertainty'' in South Asia. She said 
U.S. officials had been in contact with Pakistan's military 
leaders, trying to persuade them to restore democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
	``A military takeover of this kind ... does make it difficult to  
continue business as usual,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan, which conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests  
last year, have fought three wars in 52 years, two of them over 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon played down worries over  
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, saying in Washington that the 
coup had not changed the situation since control of the weapons 
program had always been in the hands of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from both countries dismissed fears of a Pakistani  
attack on India. But India said efforts to revive their peace 
process would be delayed until the situation in Pakistan 
stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sharif remained under house arrest Wednesday, Musharraf  
met with a range of politicians, raising speculation that he may 
try to cobble together an administration of former politicians and 
technocrats to rule the country. Musharraf also met Wednesday with 
President K.R. Narayanan of India. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf's troops moved swiftly in Pakistan's main cities only  
an hour after Sharif announced the general's dismissal. The 
soldiers seized government buildings and airports and shut down 
state-run TV and radio for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Pakistanis danced in the streets, praising the army for  
getting rid of an elected leader who had become increasingly 
despised for his heavy-handed rule and economic mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Before dawn, Musharraf went on the air to announce the military  
takeover. He said his forces had acted ``as a last resort'' to stop 
Sharif's government, which he accused of ``systematically 
destroying'' the state and driving the economy toward collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The general urged calm and promised ``very soon'' to announce  
his plans for Pakistan's future. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from setting up a provisional government, Musharraf could  
call elections -- a move required within three months under the 
constitution -- or try to rule himself. 
</P>
<P>
	From around the world came demands he hand power back to a  
democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the army to restore  
civilian rule quickly, and the International Monetary Fund said it 
was cutting off aid to Pakistan until democracy returned. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of growing isolation, the Commonwealth -- a  
grouping of former British colonies -- said it might suspend 
Pakistan's membership, a move last taken in 1995 against Nigeria. 
European Union also said it would postpone a new trade deal with 
Pakistan for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	In India, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee expressed concern  
about the coup and said India was willing to talk to any Pakistani 
regime. But his foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said negotiations 
would have to wait until the situation normalizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's army spokesman reacted angrily to India's military  
alert along the border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that India's actions are totally absurd putting its  
forces on alert ... as if Pakistan is going to try to precipitate a 
war.'' Brig. Rashid Quereshi told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent warning to India, Musharraf said ``no outside  
forces'' should try to take advantage of the ``prevailing situation 
in Pakistan ... We shall preserve the integrity and sovereignty of 
our country to the last drop of blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in both countries believe Musharraf orchestrated an  
incursion this spring by Islamic militants into Indian territory in 
the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir. That incursion led to 
months of bloody fighting with Indian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting -- which India says also involved Pakistani troops --  
wrecked the nascent dialogue between the two countries and many 
feared it would spiral into full-fledged war. 
</P>
<P>
	The army has ruled Pakistan for 25 of its 52 years. The last  
military ruler, Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul Haq, ruled for 11 years with 
an iron hand. His death in 1988 paved the way for a return of 
democracy to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the intervening years were difficult ones for democracy  
here, with a succession of elections, dismissals and appointments 
leading up to the coup Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Rob Reiner Gets Hollywood Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rob Reiner's star is alongside his dear old  
dad's. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous as the character derided as Meathead on the old ``All in  
the Family'' TV series, Reiner got a star in the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame beside the one dedicated to his father, comic Carl Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people, including Reiner's father, gathered on  
Hollywood Boulevard to witness Tuesday's unveiling of the walkway's 
2,146th star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a good place next to my father,'' Reiner told the  
cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting to be alive to see your son be applauded,''  
the elder Reiner said. ``The two of us will be able to come here on 
weekdays and polish each others stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the younger Reiner approached the podium, someone in the  
audience yelled, ``We love you Meathead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director shook his head. ``I get Meathead every time.  
`Meathead wins Nobel Prize,' that's what they will say,'' he 
lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Reiner directed such hit movies as ``Stand By Me,''  
``When Harry Met Sally,'' ``Misery,'' ``A Few Good Men'' and ``The 
American President.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Soothes Timber Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDISH KNOB OVERLOOK, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton said a  
forest preservation plan opposed by many congressional Republicans 
and the timber industry would have little or no effect on logging. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to place 40 million acres of remote, federal  
forest land off-limits to development. Vast reaches of other 
federal timberland are already available for logging and other 
development, Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very important to point out that we are not trying to  
turn our national forests into museums,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 5 percent of timber harvested in America comes from  
national forests, and of that amount just 5 percent comes from 
roadless areas, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can easily adjust our federal timber program to replace 5  
percent of 5 percent,'' Clinton said to applause, ``but we can 
never replace what we would destroy if we don't protect these 40 
million acres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roads open forest areas to development, erosion and pollution.  
They also disrupt wildlife, plant life and natural systems. But 
roadless federal land also contains some of the most desirable 
timber owned by the Forest Service. Timber companies and their 
allies in Congress oppose efforts to close off future development. 
</P>
<P>
	The president took a few swipes at congressional Republicans,  
several of whom have already denounced the forest plan, which 
requires no congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, the leaders of the Republican majority are  
polluting our spending bills with special interest riders that 
would promote overcutting in our forests, allow mining companies to 
dump more toxic waste on public land and give a huge windfall to 
companies producing oil on federal lands,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also threatened to veto the Interior Department spending  
bill, which controls funding for a variety of environmental and 
preservation projects, if Republicans do not make it more friendly 
to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issuing decrees from a mountaintop is not the way democracy is  
supposed to work,'' said Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., whose 
western Virginia district includes the majestic view of the 
Allegheny Mountains that Clinton acclaimed as he detailed the 
forest program. 
</P>
<P>
	A section of the surrounding George Washington National Forest  
is among parcels in 35 states that would be protected, the White 
House said. The plan initially affects roadless swaths of 5,000 
acres or more, but could eventually be expanded to include an 
additional 10 million to 15 million acres in parcels smaller than 
5,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the stroke of a pen,'' Goodlatte said, Clinton will  
``circumvent the people's representatives in Congress, who he knows 
would never support such a proposal in the legislative process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Needing no congressional approval, the forest plan will be  
guided by regulations to be issued by the U.S. Forest Service after 
a detailed environmental review and public comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a monumental moment in conservation and American  
history,'' said Ken Rait, director of the Heritage Forests 
Campaign, a preservationist alliance.

<HEADLINE> 'NYPD Blue' Producer Angry at ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The producer of ``NYPD Blue'' is seeing red  
because ABC is considering moving the popular police drama from its 
regular Tuesday night time slot. He's so angry he wants ABC to 
cancel the show so he can sell it to another network. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC may keep its new drama, ``Once and Again,'' on Tuesdays at  
10 p.m. and find a new home for ``NYPD Blue,'' which has occupied 
that slot since its premiere in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It galls me on every level,'' said Steven Bochco, the show's  
producer. ``First, in its cynicism. It galls me in its disrespect. 
We have given the network a hit show in that time slot for six 
uninterrupted years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokesman declined comment on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	But a network executive, who asked not to be identified,  
stressed that ABC has made no decision about the time slot and 
informed Bochco what was being considered out of courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco said he believed a move was ``a done deal.'' He said the  
network hadn't told him where the show would move, but said ``NYPD 
Blue'' would not make its scheduled season premiere date of Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``NYPD Blue'' sat on the bench this fall, ABC has used the  
time slot to establish ``Once and Again,'' about a recently 
divorced man and woman trying to start a new romance amidst family 
complications. ``Once and Again'' had no permanent slot on the 
schedule after Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco said ABC executives are concerned that if ``Once and  
Again'' leaves the time slot, female viewers would flock to the new 
CBS drama, ``Judging Amy,'' which has also been successful Tuesday 
nights at 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The producer said he believed ABC's ownership of ``Once and  
Again'' and its deal to show reruns of the drama on the Lifetime 
cable network drove the decision. ABC has the potential to make 
much more money on ``Once and Again'' since it doesn't own ``NYPD 
Blue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is vertical integration at its worst,'' Bochco said.  
</P>
<P>
	``NYPD Blue'' has been a consistently strong ratings performer.  
Dennis Franz last month won his fourth Emmy Award for best actor in 
a drama and the show has thrived despite the recent departure of 
actor Jimmy Smits.

<HEADLINE> Baby Walkers May Slow Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Baby walkers may be keeping the little one  
occupied and out of trouble, but a new study indicates they could 
also be slowing down the tot's physical and mental development. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies who were placed in walkers were slower to sit up, crawl  
and walk than those raised without walkers, researchers report on 
the current edition of the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral 
Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	And the mental development of the children also appeared to be  
slowed, said the report by Andrea C. Siegel of Case Western Reserve 
University in Cleveland and Roger V. Burton of the State University 
of New York at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, the researchers reported, appears to be that the  
opaque trays placed on the newer walkers as a safety device 
prevents the children from seeing their legs -- blocking the 
feedback they get from moving a limb and seeing the leg actually 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, while crawling infants are stimulated by objects in  
their environment, those in walkers are restricted from exploring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents think this is good because it can keep baby out of  
trouble, noted Siegel and Burton, but limiting the infant's access 
to objects may have a negative impact on its mental development. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton and Siegel studied 109 suburban infants, mostly white,  
including 53 who did not use walkers, 37 using newer walkers with 
opaque trays that blocked them from seeing their legs and 19 who 
used older walkers with narrow trays or no trays, thus allowing 
them to see their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, they found the infants who did not use walkers were  
able to sit up at age 5.39 months, crawl at 5.84 months and walk at 
10.82 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with the older ``see-feet'' walkers sat up at 5.99 months,  
crawled at 6.23 months and walked at 10.70 months. And those with 
new sight-blocking walkers sat up at 6.73 months, crawled at 6.68 
months and walked at 11.66 months. 
</P>
<P>
	They also found that the infants without walkers scored higher  
on the Bayley test of mental development given infants, scoring 
123.16 points, compared to 116.76 for those in see-feet walkers and 
113.15 for infants in sight-blocking walkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers concluded that ``restriction in a walker may  
exert its greatest influence on mental development during the 6- to 
9-month age period,'' a time regarded as transformational in a 
child's intellectual development., 
</P>
<P>
	But they also found that walker children tended to begin  
catching up to their no-walker contemporaries after they began 
crawling and were no longer confined to walkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the see-feet walkers tended to catch up to the  
no-walker children by 9 months and those in sight-blocking walkers 
caught up to the other two groups by 12 months, they reported.

<HEADLINE> CART's Montoya Watching Franchitti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) -- It won't be a match race by  
any stretch, but Colombian rookie Juan Montoya will be keeping a 
special eye on Dario Franchitti in Sunday's Honda Gold Coast Indy 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	One race remains after the Australian event -- the Marlboro 500  
in Fontana, Calif., on Oct. 31 -- and Montoya has a 13-point lead 
over the Scotsman going into Sunday's race on the 2.795-mile 
temporary road course that winds among the high-rises in Surfers 
Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Franchitti a threat -- Canadian Paul Tracy is third  
with 155 points -- Montoya, who has 200 points on the year, will be 
hoping to finish ahead of Franchitti in the race. And that won't 
necessarily have to be in first. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what to expect,'' Montoya said during the  
driver breakfast Thursday. ``Of course I want to go out there and 
win. If I win I get more points, but the important thing is winning 
the championship so we're going to try to do all we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, 24, is bidding to become the first Indy-car rookie to  
win the CART title since Nigel Mansell in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Franchitti knows he will have to win or at the  
very least rely on a continuation of bad luck which prevented 
Montoya from winning the championship in the last race at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya started from the pole in that race but a communication  
breakdown with his pit crew led to him clipping a car which had 
stopped at a tire wall after a full-course caution was declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti finished second in that race in his Reynard-Honda  
behind his Team Kool Green teammate Tracy to give him 16 points and 
a chance for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	On arriving on the Gold Coast this week, Franchitti said another  
1-2 finish for his team was on the agenda but this time with Tracy, 
who cannot win the championship, in the second position. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner and expatriate Australian Barry Green has agreed,  
saying under the right conditions Tracy would probably give way to 
Franchitti. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who has two victories, four seconds and four thirds  
this year, said the race was critical to his chances, as is winning 
the pole on the tight track. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory is the race could go to any one of 10 drivers but I  
have to make sure at least I'm in the leading division,'' 
Franchitti said. ``Whatever happens I have to beat him (Montoya) to 
stay in contention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya came to the CART series after a five-year European  
apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he won the European Formula 3000 championship and this  
year succeeded two-time Indy-car champion Alex Zanardi -- who went 
to Formula One -- with the Chip Ganassi Racing Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has said he would like to try his luck in Formula One  
but for the moment he's content in the CART series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected to win a couple of races but not to be leading,''  
he said. ``So far so good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying sessions are set for Friday and Saturday before  
Sunday's 65-lap race.

<HEADLINE> Texans Upset With Hollywood Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAPPY, Texas (AP) -- It takes a lot to get under the skin of  
folks in this West Texas town. Even the falling prices of corn and 
cotton don't seem to rile them much. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Hollywood has managed to make this town, well, un-Happy.  
</P>
<P>
	The new film ``Happy, Texas'' follows the offbeat and sometimes  
off-color adventures of two escaped convicts who get confused for 
traveling beauty pageant gurus. 
</P>
<P>
	A farce, perhaps, but Happy residents also point out the movie  
features stereotypical Texans in big boots dodging armadillos in 
the road on their way to a gay honky-tonk bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, that's not Happy: The PG-13 rated film wasn't made  
in this town about 120 miles north of Lubbock in the Texas 
Panhandle. And many of Happy's 650 residents aren't amused. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to make a movie about Happy, then let them  
make it about the real place,'' said Ed Burk, a farmer. ``There is 
no gay bar in Happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Jess Rutledge, also a farmer: ``I don't know why they  
decided to name it `Happy, Texas,' if it wasn't filmed here and it 
isn't really about the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miramax film's credits make that clear, thanking the  
residents of Happy ``even though we shot entirely on location in 
Peru, California ... Sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Academy Award nominee William H. Macy, who stars as a  
hard-boiled county sheriff experiencing a sexual identity crisis, 
said the film wasn't intended to poke fun at small-town Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The script made me literally laugh out loud,'' Macy said  
Tuesday. ``It's a great story, a worthwhile story with real 
humanity and a genuine love for all the characters. It could've so 
easily been cliched in that mean-spirited way so many movies are 
now, with cardboard-cutout stereotypes. It could've made fun of 
people, but it didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to set the story in Happy was no accident.  
</P>
<P>
	Co-writer Ed Stone worked as a disc jockey in a town not far  
from Happy when he was in his 20s. He said even then, his jokes 
about the town's annual ``Miss Happy'' beauty pageant raised 
tempers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like most every small town in Texas, Happy's citizens were  
just mad when it came to beauty pageants,'' Stone said. ``As a disc 
jockey from another part of the world, I'd sometimes go on the air 
and poke a little fun at this obsession with pageants and you 
wouldn't believe the angry calls that came in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People in Happy, so named because pioneers who ran out of water  
were delighted to find a creek here, certainly appear to take their 
happiness seriously. The city sits behind a giant billboard 
proclaiming it the ``town without a frown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Happy has been in the spotlight. It  
was the subject of an ice cream commercial and is constantly 
swamped with letters from schoolchildren who want to know about the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	City secretary Patricia Sims said she and other officials voted  
to give the film's producers permission to use the town's name. At 
the time, however, they didn't know the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have requests like this all the time and we grant most of  
them because we want people to know about our wonderful town,'' 
Mrs. Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our hope that the movie doesn't make people think badly  
about a place that is really wonderful. I haven't seen it and I 
don't think most folks around here have seen it, but it doesn't 
sound like anything that could happen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, the farmer, agreed. ``They could've named it  
anything,'' he said. ``Way it sounds, maybe they should have named 
it Lubbock or even Dallas.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Henderson Sick to Stomach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- New York Mets outfielder Rickey Henderson was  
taken out of Wednesday's playoff game with the Atlanta Braves in 
the middle of the second inning with nausea and light headedness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets lost the game 4-3 and trail the NL championship series  
2-0 heading back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson was lying on his back in the runway behind the Mets'  
dugout with ice packs on his head before coming to bat in the 
second inning. He told manager Bobby Valentine that he had the 
stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson was late to the on-deck circle before coming to bat  
with runners on second and third and two out. He hit a grounder in 
the hole between first and second that second baseman Bret Boone 
fielded on the outfield grass and threw to pitcher Kevin Millwood 
to just get Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 0-for-6 in the series, jogged down the baseline with  
a pained expression on his face. He went out to play left field in 
the bottom of the inning but looked ill. 
</P>
<P>
	He slowly fielded two hits to left and didn't engage in his  
usual banter with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual sight during the inning, Melvin Mora played catch  
with Matt Franco in the dugout to loosen up his arm as the Mets 
were apparently concerned about Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	With two runners on and a 2-0 count on Walt Weiss, Valentine and  
trainer Fred Hina ran out to check on Henderson. Center fielder 
Darryl Hamilton and right fielder Roger Cedeno also came over to 
check on their teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief discussion, Henderson was taken out of the game  
and replaced by Mora, who hit his first career homer in the fifth 
inning to give New York a 2-0 lead.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks were higher Thursday morning as  
investors welcomed news of a possible merger between two large 
Japanese banks. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 20.91 points,  
or 0.12 percent, to 17,775.40 at the end of the morning session. 
The average closed down 336.32 points, or 1.86 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 106.93 yen, up 0.35 yen from its level of  
106.58 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above 106.60 yen late 
Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, Tokyo share prices rallied Thursday as  
investors hailed news of a potential huge bank merger between 
Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese banks said Thursday they are in talks toward a  
broad alliance that media reports said would create the world's 
second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate statements, the banks said they were discussing a  
tie-up ``aimed at integration.'' But they added it was too early to 
announce a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	If finalized, the combination would create a financial giant  
with about $938.26 billion in total funds, second only to the 
entity formed by the planned merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji 
Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. Assets at those three banks 
exceed $1.2 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sumitomo-Sakura news has rekindled hopes for industry  
realignments,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at 
Nikko Securities Co. ``But weak New York markets are worrisome, and 
investor buying interests aren't spreading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although financial stocks have gained strongly on the  
Sumitomo-Sakura news, the overall market was top-heavy after 
continued sharp falls in U.S. stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down  
184.90 points at 10,232.16 Wednesday, extending its drop of 231.12 
points Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 7.36 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,534.32. The 
TOPIX closed down 15.84 points, or 1.03 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar rose on buying by Japanese trust  
banks and overseas securities houses, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the yen gained earlier on the Sakura-Sumitomo bank  
tie-up news, trust names are repeating recent moves and buying back 
the dollar,'' says Shigeru Hashimoto, vice president of foreign 
exchange at Sanwa bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the greenback rallied after Japan's  
central bank announced it would begin purchasing short-term 
government bonds to make sure money keeps flowing through the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	That would increase the amount of yen in the market, and could  
help stem the Japanese currency's recent strength against the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders later expressed disappointment that the central bank  
failed to counter the yen's advance with a straight infusion of new 
money supply into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities fear that too strong a yen could undermine Japan's  
rebound from its worst downturn in 50 years by making Japanese 
exports more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 115.58 yen Thursday  
morning, above its level of 114.87 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7650 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7600 percent. Its 
price fell 0.05 point to 99.43.

	Pakistan's Army Chief in Control  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Ousted Prime Minster Nawaz Sharif  
remained under house arrest today in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, 
where troops loyal to army Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf staged 
yesterday's coup. Musharraf showed no signs that he planned to 
relinquish power any time soon. The coup took place within an hour 
of Sharif's announcement that he had fired Musharraf as army chief. 
Pakistani citizens seemed unfazed: Many celebrated the ouster of a 
prime minister who had become increasingly unpopular because of a 
deteriorating economy and his ongoing power struggle with political 
opponents and the military.

	Chechens: We're Ready To Fight  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Despite advances by Russian troops,  
Chechen fighters still hold strong positions and are prepared to 
rebuff Russian offensives, the leader of the rebel republic said in 
an interview published today. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov 
said he was ``100 percent sure'' the conflict would end in peace 
talks. ``But thousands of soldiers will die first,'' Maskhadov 
predicted in an interview with the Russian newspaper Vremya MN. 
Chechnya has governed itself since 1996, when its gruesome two-year 
civil war with Russia ended.

	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinians are denouncing Israeli  
plans for a permanent border crossing between Jerusalem and the 
West Bank town of Bethlehem, saying it will limit travel by 
Palestinians and make the crossing more intimidating for them. The 
crossing currently is a makeshift checkpoint made of cement blocks 
and manned by a few Israeli soldiers. But Israeli officials plan a 
permanent structure to monitor a four-lane crossing. They say the 
new checkpoint is intended to deal with a surge in Christian 
tourists heading for Bethlehem for the new millennium.

	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Defending Austria's image following the  
strong electoral showing of a far-right party, the chancellor 
insisted today his country is not a hotbed of neo-Nazi activities. 
Chancellor Viktor Klima spoke out after many countries, 
particularly Israel, denounced the stunning gains by Joerg Haider's 
anti-immigrant Freedom Party in Oct. 3 elections. ``Austria is 
certainly not a land that has slipped to the right margin by the 
election, nor is it a land of neo-Nazis,'' Klima told a news 
conference. ``Austria is a very solidified democracy.''

Korea today that Washington will provide full cooperation in 
investigating allegations American soldiers killed hundreds of 
Korean refugees in the early days of the Korean War. Assistant U.S. 
Secretary of State Stanley Roth made the pledge in meetings with 
South Korean Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young and Defense Minister 
Cho Sung-tae. On Sept. 30, The Associated Press reported that 
American war veterans confirmed accounts by South Korean villagers 
who said they saw U.S. forces shoot civilians under a railroad 
bridge at No Gun Ri, South Korea, in July 1950.

his analysis of exchange rates and how they affect monetary

far outside esoteric academic circles by clarifying how exchange 
rates fluctuate when a government shifts from a flexible to a fixed 
monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> CIA Welcomes Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If you think about it, the CIA and Hollywood  
have a few things in common. Agents are actors. Spies follow 
scripts at times. Fiction is sometimes dressed up as fact. 
</P>
<P>
	So maybe it should come as no surprise that the usually  
publicity-shy Central Intelligence Agency opened its doors to allow 
Showtime and Paramount Network Television to film scenes for their 
new movie, ``In the Company of Spies,'' in the agency's lobby and 
elsewhere on the closed compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, scheduled to air on Showtime on Oct. 24, depicts a  
retired CIA operative returned to duty to save a captured agency 
officer held by the North Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty off-duty CIA officials participated as extras.  
</P>
<P>
	To mark the most extensive CIA cooperation with movie makers  
ever, the director of central intelligence, George Tenet, invited 
the film's stars -- Tom Berenger, Ron Silver, Alice Krige, Clancy 
Brown and Arye Gross -- as well as director Tim Matheson and 
Washington political luminaries to a private screening and 
reception Wednesday evening at CIA headquarters. the graf after 5th 
graf starts to mark 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing cloak-and-dagger about the evening affair. In  
the fading light of a warm autumn day, black limousines deposited 
stars on the steps of the white headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
	Television camera lights glared and news photographers clicked  
away as several cast members stopped to chat with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenger, who plays the lead role, said the CIA deserves more  
credit than it is generally given. ``If they do something well and 
right you never hear about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet told reporters he was initially skeptical about working  
with Hollywood producers but is glad he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were great to work with,'' he said. ``They portrayed us  
in a very good light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an era of more openness by the CIA, the idea of  
Hollywood stars descending on the agency's wooded compound along 
the Potomac River was remarkable -- especially for those who work 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a change of pace, an enjoyable, fun thing'' for CIA  
employees who spend most of their careers behind cloaks of 
anonymity, said William Harlow, the agency's chief of public 
affairs. Only ``overt'' employees like him, whose names are 
publicly acknowledged by the agency, will attend, Harlow added. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA agreed to cooperate on the movie in 1997 after reviewing  
the script, Harlow said. It apparently helped that one of the 
producers, Robert Cort, had been a CIA analyst in the 1970s. 
Berenger and other cast members were given a limited tour of CIA 
headquarters, including a look at the agency's operations center 
and counter-terrorism center, and met with Tenet. Scenes were 
filmed at the headquarters in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA helped by providing advice on details. The result,  
Harlow said, is a film that is ``closer to the truth about what we 
do than most of the things you see about us in Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The CIA's objectives were clear,'' said Roger Towne, the  
screenwriter who also was the film's executive producer. ``They 
hoped to see a human face put on the agency and we had just the 
story to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Gets Close in Loss To Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra showed acrobatic grace and the  
daring of a thief with two leaping catches that kept New York from 
scoring at least three runs in the opening game of the AL 
championship series Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he displayed the nimble-handedness of Bill Buckner when he  
bobbled a routine grounder that gave the Yankees a chance to go 
ahead in the seventh inning. However, New York couldn't capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra could do nothing in the 10th when Bernie Williams  
hit a ball where no Boston player could reach it. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' homer to center on Rod Beck's second pitch of the  
inning gave the Yankees a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the game, the spotlight was on the opposing shortstops.  
Garciaparra won the AL batting title, homered in the decisive fifth 
game of the AL division series in Cleveland and was still nursing a 
bruised wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter finished second in the batting race and, like  
Garciaparra, was an All-Star and one of the best fielders at his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter won the batting competition Wednesday night with two hits  
to none for Garciaparra. The Boston shortstop was better with the 
glove, despite committing two errors for the first time since Aug. 
23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox are trying to get to the World Series for the first  
time since 1986, when the New York Mets scored the winning run in 
Game 6 as a grounder went through first baseman Buckner's legs. New 
York won Game 7 two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Garciaparra's errors didn't contribute to  
any runs. Jeter's error in the first inning did. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Offerman led off the game with a single, and John Valentin  
grounded to Jeter, who threw toward second. But the ball flew into 
right field and Offerman came all the way around to score the 
game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees would have gone ahead in the bottom of the first had  
Garciaparra not perfectly timed a leap to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	They had runners on second and third after a walk to Jeter, a  
single by Paul O'Neill and a groundout. Then Chili Davis hit a 
rising liner toward Garciaparra. The shortstop rose to meet it, 
extending his left arm straight up, coming down with the ball and 
landing on his feet. The crowd, expecting two runs, was stunned to 
silence at the sight of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, Garciaparra saved a run with two outstanding  
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jeter doubled and O'Neill struck out, Williams hit a  
grounder that Garciaparra gloved deep in the hole. His throw to 
second to get Jeter went into right field for an error and Jeter 
advanced to third. But he almost certainly would have scored had 
the ball gotten by Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jeter still at third, Tino Martinez hit a liner just to the  
left of second base. Garciaparra, positioned perfectly, leaped 
again. Not as high as the first time, but still with plenty of 
space between the bottom of his shoes and the infield dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just goes with the kind of player the kid is,'' Boston  
manager Jimy Williams said. ``He plays to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Garciaparra's glove failed him.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had tied the game 3-3 when Scott Brosius singled,  
advanced on Chuck Knoblauch's sacrifice bunt and scored on Jeter's 
single to right. Trot Nixon's strong throw beat Brosius to the 
plate, but catcher Jason Varitek couldn't handle it as Jeter took 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill followed with a grounder to Garciaparra, just to the  
left of second base. He bobbled the ball and, after he got a grip 
on it, Jeter was standing on second and blocking the path of a 
throw to first. So Garciaparra held the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He had another chance when the next batter, Williams, hit a  
ground ball that Garciaparra threw to second to force O'Neill as 
Jeter took third. Williams stole second, but the threat ended when 
Davis struck out. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra didn't touch the ball again but would have led off  
the 11th for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made sure that didn't happen.

syndrome, saying the agency was wrong to divert millions of federal 
dollars earmarked to study the mysterious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan promised a ``reinvigorated effort''  
to study chronic fatigue, which leaves some people so drained they 
can't perform simple tasks. Some rarely leave their beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, an audit showed the CDC had received $22.7  
million from Congress for chronic fatigue research, but less than 
half the money was used for that purpose. At least $8.8 million was 
spent on other programs and $4.1 million could not be accounted 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear to all of us that we, CDC, have made serious  
mistakes and have done so for several years,'' Koplan told 16 
chronic fatigue patients and their advocates at agency headquarters 
in Atlanta. ``I apologize to each of you personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CDC officials have not explained why the money was diverted.  
</P>
<P>
	The agency has promised to restore $12.9 million for chronic  
fatigue studies over the next four years, but patients say the 
slight was about more than money. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe the CDC's action reinforced a perception among some  
doctors that their illness is a mental problem, an excuse for 
laziness or even a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of patients here feel it speaks as a derision to  
the disease -- `Is there such a thing as CFS?''' said Jonathan 
Sterling of Oradell, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling said he had to quit his job as principal of a junior  
high school after he became ill 10 years ago. He said getting on a 
plane to Atlanta was an ordeal in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can make it through the day. But the next three or four?''  
Sterling said. ``You can hear my throat's already getting sore. I'm 
getting a headache.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers don't know what causes the syndrome, when it began,  
how many people have it or how many new cases crop up each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC is almost three years into a study in Wichita, Kan., and  
estimates that about one-fourth of 1 percent of the population 
there suffers from chronic fatigue. The CDC says it mainly affects 
middle-aged, white women.

<HEADLINE> ConEd To Buy Northeast Utilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Conn. (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Inc. is buying  
Northeast Utilities for up to about $3.5 billion in cash and stock 
in a deal that will create one of the nation's largest electric 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said in announcing the deal today that the  
combined company would have more than 5 million electric customers 
and 1.4 million natural gas customers in the Northeast from the New 
York area to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the utility  
industry as deregulation has driven power distributors to seek 
competitive advantages by teaming up with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their boards approved a definitive merger  
agreement under which Consolidated Edison will pay $25 a share in 
cash and stock for Northeast's 133 million common shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal isn't expected to close until the end of the year 2000,  
and it contains terms that would boost the value of the offer by 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison would pay an additional $1 a share if units 2 and 3  
of the Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting that and an adjustment which raises the value of the  
offer by a third of a cent each day after Aug. 5, 2000, Northeast 
shareholders would get $26.50 for each share if the deal closes at 
the end of 2000, or a total of about $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities, based in Berlin, is the largest electric  
utility in New England, with more than $4 billion in annual revenue 
and more than 1.7 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Edison, based in New York, generated more than $7  
billion in annual revenue in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Injured Yankee O'Neill in Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul O'Neill talked his way into the New York  
Yankees lineup for Wednesday night's opener of the AL championship 
series, fractured rib and all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't take a lot of talking, because I wanted to play  
him,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said before his team took on the 
Boston Red Sox for the first time in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill hurt himself Oct. 2 running into a fence trying to catch  
a foul ball at Tampa Bay. He played the first two games of the 
first-round sweep of Texas, sat out the clincher, then was 
diagnosed Monday with a small fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking batting practice Tuesday, O'Neill said he thought  
he could play despite the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in his body. That's the only thing we can go on, and we  
have to let it fly,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre wasn't sure whether to play O'Neill until talking with the  
right fielder on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't put up a lineup until after he got here today,''  
Torre said. ``We talked about it. I saw how anxious he was to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was 1-for-4 in each of the first two games against  
Texas. Three years ago, he played the postseason despite a torn 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul could have a great career as a lobbyist in Washington,''  
teammate David Cone said, ``because I saw him doing some heavy 
lobbying today in the manager's office -- and it worked. He's an 
intense competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case he couldn't play, the Yankees added outfielder  
Shane Spencer to their active roster and cut Jim Leyritz. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer starred in the 1998 playoff series against Texas, going  
3-for-6 with two homers and six RBIs, but was 1-for-10 against 
Cleveland in the next round and got just three at-bats in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .234 with eight homers and 20 RBIs during the 1999  
season, but was cut for the roster for the first round of the 
playoffs against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed the extra outfielder,'' Torre said. ``We're hoping we  
don't need to use it, but I had to have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz, acquired from San Diego on July 31, hit .227 with five  
RBIs in 66 at-bats for the Yankees during the regular season and 
was 0-for-2 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult, no question,'' Torre said. ``Jimmy  
struggled near the end of the season. It didn't keep me from going 
to him in Games 1 and 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another alternative would have been to cut rookie Clay  
Bellinger, one of the few Yankees with speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little more secure having a pinch runner, especially  
Clay, who can play all around, too,'' Torre said.

<HEADLINE> Agent Reveals How Chamberlain Died </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain seemed the epitome of  
fitness. Even after his Hall of Fame basketball career ended, he 
turned to volleyball and marathons. 
</P>
<P>
	But for years he also endured heart problems -- and they  
eventually killed him, Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's agent and 
longtime friend, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had congestive heart failure,'' Goldberg said the day after  
Chamberlain died at age 63. ``He had deteriorated relatively 
quickly over the last month or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain had lost 30 or 40 pounds over the past few weeks as  
doctors drained his legs of fluid that had accumulated because of 
his heart trouble, Goldberg said after speaking with Chamberlain's 
cardiologist, Dr. Anthony Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was hospitalized seven years ago with an irregular  
heartbeat and was said to have complained of an arrhythmia since he 
was in his early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most likely, with a man of his age group dying suddenly, it  
would be from blockage in the blood vessels, causing an irregular 
heartbeat, regardless of his past medical history,'' said Dr. 
Michele Hamilton, associate clinical professor of cardiology at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services for Chamberlain are scheduled for Saturday at  
10 a.m. at City of Angels Church of Religious Science in Los 
Angeles. Seating for the public will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's sister, Barbara Lewis, said her brother had  
undergone dental surgery last week and looked worse than she had 
ever seen him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cardiac situation was the main thing,'' Goldberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Chamberlain had a heart problem surfaced in the  
early 1960s, but he denied them. Then he was hospitalized for three 
days in 1992 for the mild arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those closest to Chamberlain didn't know how bad the  
problem was. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it had been a little trouble for him, but we weren't  
aware that it could be serious. We did hear something about it a 
few years back,'' Chamberlain's sister, Selina Gross, said from her 
Philadelphia home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe all the playing and activity caused some wear on his  
heart. But he took care of himself and went to the doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Wilt the Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper,'' Chamberlain  
was perhaps the most dominant player in NBA history. He spent 14 
years in the league, with the Philadelphia (later San Francisco) 
Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 2, 1962, Chamberlain scored a record 100 points in a  
game against the New York Knicks. He also grabbed a record 55 
rebounds against the Boston Celtics on Nov. 24, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 31,419 points, a record broken by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  
in 1984, and grabbed a record 23,924 rebounds. Chamberlain went to 
the NBA playoffs 13 times, but won just two championship rings -- in 
1966-67 with the 76ers and in 1971-72 with the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Top IOC Officials To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Atlanta's Olympic bid will be under the  
microscope Thursday as the House Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight 
and Investigations begins hearings on bid practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Several high-profile Olympic officials, including IOC director  
general Francois Carrard and IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, are 
expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch has said he is willing to  
appear before the committee, but couldn't fit Thursday's hearing 
into his schedule and sent Carrard instead. He has said he may be 
able to testify during a meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Sen. Howard  
Baker, both members of the IOC 2000 reform team, are expected to be 
at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Thursday) will be an opportunity to get all the  
information that we've been collecting in the course of our 
investigation out on the table,'' said David Woodruff, spokesman 
for Rep. Fred Upton, the committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodruff said Upton's investigation has focused primarily on  
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, and that will likely be 
the main topic of testimony Thursday, though Salt Lake City's bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games may be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Salt Lake will be coming up,'' Woodruff said.  
``Certainly comparisons can be made, but our people ... are really 
focusing on Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> R.I. Sues Lead Paint Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island is suing manufacturers of  
lead paint for allegedly conspiring to market a dangerous product 
that poisons children, the first suit by a state over lead paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by the multi-state tobacco settlement, state Attorney  
General Sheldon Whitehouse sued eight paint manufacturers and 
called upon the industry to ``take responsibility and clean up its 
mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Superior Court, seeks damages from  
big paint companies like Glidden Co. and Sherwin Williams Co. for 
treatment of children with lead paint poisoning and abatement of 
lead paint from homes and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know now that this industry knew lead paint was toxic  
dating back as early as 1904, yet it promoted its uses and profited 
by that use,'' Whitehouse said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen other states are also considering lawsuits  
against makers of lead paint, said John J. McConnell, a lawyer for 
Rhode Island who is also pursuing a class-action lawsuit on behalf 
of 30,000 lead-poisoned children in Cleveland, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island has one of the highest lead-poisoning rates in the  
nation. Nearly 20 percent of children entering kindergarten last 
month showed high levels of lead paint poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials say dust and flakes from the old paints  
have poisoned one of three children in Providence and cost Rhode 
Islanders millions of dollars for health care, special education 
programs and building repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses paint and pigment makers and the Lead  
Industries Association, their trade group, of conspiring from the 
1920s to downplay the danger and keep selling their products. 
European countries began banning lead in residential paint in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This litigation tries to make a scapegoat of companies,'' said  
Donald E. Scott, an industry attorney. ``It substitutes legal 
wrangling for serious efforts to reduce childhood lead poisoning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles; DuPont  
Co. of Wilmington, Del.; Sherwin-Williams Co. of Cleveland; and NL 
Industries Inc. of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	NL Industries lawyer Timothy S. Hardy said the paint industry  
shouldn't be held responsible, and it is up to landowners, 
landlords and the government to remove lead paint from buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government agencies around the country have recognized that  
for 50 years,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named were Glidden Co., a unit of Imperial Chemical  
Industries PLC in England; O'Brien Corp., which was bought by ICI; 
and SCM Chemicals Inc. and American Cyanamid Co., whose paint 
liabilities were assumed by Cytec Industries Inc. of West Paterson, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead has been banned from paint since 1978. But children in  
older buildings are still at risk of learning disabilities and 
behavioral problems if they eat or inhale the paint as it flakes 
off door jams and window sills. 
</P>
<P>
	At high levels, lead can cause kidney damage, seizures, coma and  
even death.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen; Otherwise Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen on  
Wednesday after Japan's central bank announced steps that will 
increase the amount of yen on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.60  
Japanese yen, up from 106.31 on Tuesday, but well below Wednesday's 
early high of nearly 108 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, with the  
euro rising to $1.0794, up from $1.0758 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rallied strongly against the yen early in the day  
after the Bank of Japan said it will begin purchasing short-term 
government bonds to make sure money keeps flowing through the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the early jump, however, traders expressed disappointment  
that the central bank failed to counter the yen's advance with a 
straight infusion of new money supply into the economy. A strong 
yen could undermine Japan's rebound from a recession by making 
Japanese exports more expensive in other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4734  
Swiss francs, down from 1.4806, and 1.4818 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.4746. The British pound slipped to $1.6559 from Tuesday's 
quote of $1.6567. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8118 German 
marks, down from 1.8179; 6.0765 French francs, down from 6.0968; 
and 1,793.67 Italian lire, down from 1,799.67.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday,  
with the top markets dragged down by the overnight plunge on Wall 
Street and local financial concerns and only a few smaller markets 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell  
336.32 points, or 1.86 percent, to close at 17,754.49. The index 
had risen 28.63 points, or 0.16 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the fall in Tokyo to New York's decline and  
concerns that the Japanese central bank was not taking any actions 
firm enough to halt the Japanese yen's advance against the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed Tuesday at 10,417.06,  
down 2.1 percent, or 231.12 points, its 10th biggest point drop in 
history and the steepest since May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese market fell in response, with traders also worried  
about the yen's recent strength, which some analysts fear could 
stifle the economic recovery by making Japanese exports too 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 106.58 yen  
late Wednesday in Tokyo, up 0.30 yen from late Tuesday and also 
above the overnight 106.31 yen level in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks plunged, triggered by Wall Street's losses and  
concerns over new share placements. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 2.2 percent, or 283.48  
points, to close at 12,475.87. That brought the Hang Seng's losses 
this week to 4.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's fall hurt sentiment, and analysts also said a number  
of Hong Kong traders have been selling shares so they can have cash 
in hand for new offerings soon to hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore prices closed down as Wall Street's drop sidelined  
many investors. The benchmark Straits Times Index slipped 22.67 
points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,095.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stocks plummeted 2.46 percent as investors  
unloaded banking and finance stocks ahead of expected poor results. 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 9.86 points to 391.50. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares ended marginally higher, with the  
index edging into positive territory on late buying attributed to 
government intervention. The JSX Composite Index ended up 0.1 
percent, or 0.565 point, at 571.947. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares ended lower, as the fall on Wall  
Street spooked investors and confusion over the government's bank 
merger plan dampened sentiment. The benchmark Composite Index lost 
1.1 percent, or 8.29 points, to end at 737.28. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks fell on renewed concerns over a  
possible rise in U.S. interest rates that contributed to Wall 
Street's plunge. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index 
dropped 15.68 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,050.72. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed virtually unchanged. The key  
Weighted Price Index finished up just 1.57 points at 7,836.94. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Prices closed marginally lower, after recovering from  
larger losses earlier in the day that were triggered by Wall 
Street's fall. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index shed 0.73 
point to end at 855.52. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower, despite a resilient  
resources sector and a late rally in gold stocks. The All 
Ordinaries Index finished at 2,906.7, down 27.4 points, or 0.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed higher, with the key index  
boosted by gains in market bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand. 
The NZSE-40 capital index finished at 2,095.48, up 25.06 points, or 
1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Braves Turn Starters Into Relievers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- For the third time in the postseason, Atlanta  
Braves manager Bobby Cox had a member of his magnificent starting 
rotation do double duty in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, it was John Smoltz coming on for the ninth inning  
in the first relief appearance of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what was going on,'' said Smoltz, who had made  
379 major-league starts without ever pitching out of the bullpen. 
``I didn't know what to do -- walk in, run in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He compromised with a jog and did just fine in the unprecedented  
situation. Shawon Dunston grounded out, Roger Cedeno flied out, and 
pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla was called out on strikes to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 of the division series, Cox used both Greg Maddux and  
Kevin Millwood during a crucial 5-3 victory over the Astros. 
Millwood picked up the first save of his career with a scoreless 
12th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Mets, Millwood was back in the familiar role of  
starter, allowing only two earned runs in 7 1-3 innings but leaving 
with the tying run at second. Cox called on his closer, John 
Rocker, to face New York's two most dangerous left-handed hitters, 
John Olerud and Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy worked to perfection as Rocker struck out both,  
preserving Atlanta's one-run lead, before returning to the mound to 
begin the ninth. That was merely a ploy to force the Mets to send 
up the right-handed Dunston as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Dunston's name was announced, Cox emerged from the  
dugout while the crowd booed. The reaction quickly turned to cheers 
when the fans noticed No. 29 coming in from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I wanted to get the first hitter out,'' Smoltz  
said. ``I knew if I got the first hitter out, that would take care 
of my nerves. I knew that from all my experience with the role, 
which was none. Actually, I was looking at it like I was trying to 
close out a game as a starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said all of his starters have the mentality to work out of  
the bullpen. He took a plunge into that brave new world last year, 
using Maddux to save a victory in Game 5 of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two games into this year's championship series, Tom Glavine  
is the only starter who hasn't gotten a chance to pitch in relief. 
He is scheduled to start Game 3 at Shea Stadium on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have a good makeup and you have to be kind of  
special,'' Cox said. ``I'm sure a lot of pitchers could do it, but 
these guys have pretty good stuff, too. You kind of want to get 
them in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he should have considered this sooner. Throughout the  
decade, the Braves bullpen took much of the blame for the team 
winning only one World Series title despite making the postseason 
in every non-strike season since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Things go so bad, in fact, that Smoltz volunteered several years  
ago to go to the bullpen as the closer. Cox finally accepted the 
offer Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got an appreciation far greater than I ever had before  
for what those guys do,'' Smoltz said. ``It's funny. I've offered 
many times before to go in situations like this but it never 
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Vermeil: A Dinosaur Roars to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Nobody's snickering at Dick Vermeil anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams won all of nine games the first two years of  
his comeback, and Vermeil was dismissed as a coaching dinosaur. 
Now, with the Rams at 4-0 and the NFL's only unbeaten team, Vermeil 
is very much in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the focal point and the figurehead of it right now,'' he  
said Wednesday. ``And it's fun. I mean, it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, everyone wants a piece of the 62-year-old coach. The  
interview requests keep coming. Monday night football nabbed him 
for a guest spot at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he gave everybody credit but himself,'' offensive  
guard Adam Timmerman said. ``And he definitely deserves some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the NFL chose Vermeil for a national conference  
call -- the same day St. Louis Cardinals great Stan Musial visited 
the team. Vermeil will be on Fox's NFL pregame show before the Rams 
play at Atlanta on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate it, and it gives me a chance to present the Rams  
to the country,'' Vermeil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil's exposure rivals that of his previously unknown  
quarterback. Kurt Warner, the NFL's leading passer, on Tuesday 
turned down a request from David Letterman's show. This week, he's 
on the cover of Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see everybody get a little publicity,'' free  
safety Keith Lyle said. ``It's just fun. It's a good wave to ride 
for everybody right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, most of the Rams' games were dogs of the  
week. After much fanfare in 1997, following a 14-year absence from 
coaching, Vermeil and an older staff that included four former NFL 
head coaches endured a 5-11 season. Last year was even worse, a 
4-12 finish that included an eight-game losing streak, and a 
winless record in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
	As this season began, the Rams had more losses in the 1990s than  
any other NFL team. The team and local TV stations bought up 
tickets to keep alive the team's streak of sellouts since moving 
from Anaheim, Calif., in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Rams are a hot ticket, and Vermeil can do no wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' he said. ``It's a real tribute to some  
people that worked very, very hard. I'm not trying to say we are 
where we want to be, but I think we're on the right road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As best he can, Vermeil is trying to stay grounded. He usually  
says the right things about there being 12 games to go, and he 
hasn't forgotten the down days last year when the Rams dropped 
eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can be a mentally and physically tough team and ignore  
what we've done and only be concerned with what we have to do, I 
think we can continue experiencing success,'' Vermeil said. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes the giddiness shows. His news conference Wednesday  
was somewhat reminiscent of the day he was hired. There were 
references to Super Bowl successes and such friends as Bill Walsh, 
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get down,'' Vermeil said. ``The thing I've always fallen  
back on is my experience. I've done it before.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Sets Oct. 25 Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan  
is preparing to bolt his party and begin a quest for the Reform 
Party nomination Oct. 25, officials close to the conservative 
commentator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, cautioned  
that Buchanan could still reverse course and stay out of the 
increasingly fractious third-party bid. They said they don't expect 
that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	In the clearest signal yet of his intentions, Buchanan's  
campaign mailed invitations to supporters Wednesday inviting them 
to a ``major announcement'' Oct. 25 at a Falls Church, Va., hotel, 
the officials said. His advisers expect him to announce his Reform 
Party candidacy at that time, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's almost too far down the pike to get out now,'' said one  
of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	However, spokeswoman Joanne Hansen said no final decision has  
been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in GOP polls, Buchanan says he believes the party's  
nomination battle is rigged in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
who he says is too moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee would lay claim to almost $13 million  
in federal matching money. Party founder Ross Perot earned 19 
percent of the vote in 1992 and 8 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fear that a third-party run by Buchanan would siphon  
conservative votes from their nominee. He won the New Hampshire 
primary in 1996 and put a scare into then-President George Bush in 
the 1992 primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, however, would not be assured the nomination. A parade  
of celebrities and politicians are mentioned as potential 
candidates, including New York tycoon Donald Trump, Minnesota Gov. 
Jesse Ventura, former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker, actress 
Cybill Shepherd, actor Warren Beatty and Perot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll shows limited support for the  
third-party alternatives. Buchanan had the backing of 9 percent of 
those surveyed in a three-way matchup with Bush and Vice President 
Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner. Trump had 10 percent in a 
similar three-way matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The unfavorability ratings of Buchanan, Ventura and Trump have  
increased as speculation about their presidential bids drew more 
media attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump formed an exploratory committee last week, and says he  
would spend $30 million if he jumps in the race. Buchanan, who has 
had trouble raising money in the GOP race, could not match that 
total but has more political experience than Trump. He is said to 
be worried about Trump's financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest is already heated.  
</P>
<P>
	Trump consultant Roger Stone said Buchanan wants attention, not  
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat's advocation at this point is running for president. It's  
all he does,'' Stone said in a telephone interview. ``Trump will 
spend $30 million to get on the ballots in every state. I don't 
think Pat can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump himself has called Buchanan's views ``prehistoric.''  
Buchanan is a staunch, anti-abortion conservative who drew 
criticism for questioning whether Nazi Germany was a threat to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the party's highest ranking elected official, has ruled  
out a 2000 presidential campaign, though the speculation continues. 
He is urging Trump to seek the nomination, saying Buchanan is too 
conservative on social issues for the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is drawing support from the Perot wing of the party.  
</P>
<P>
	``I say to Roger Stone, `Bring your candidate on.' It'll be  
another head on the wall,'' said Pat Choate, Perot's 1996 running 
mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot himself has not taken sides in the nomination fight and  
has not ruled out jumping in the fray himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials close to Buchanan say his meetings with advisers  
are filled with strategic and thematic discussions about the 
third-party bid. His sister and top adviser, Bay Buchanan, is 
exploring party rules and is already seeking to plant Buchanan 
backers in state party leadership posts. Buchanan and his advisers 
are discussing language Buchanan would use to explain his 
departure, though he has not yet formally begun writing the speech.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Down 67.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as Intel's  
disappointing earnings report hurt technology shares. Blue chip 
stocks extended Tuesday's steep decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 67.75 at 10,349.30. The Dow tumbled 231.12 Tuesday 
in its second-worst performance of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 10.29 at 1,302.75, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 29.99 at 2,842.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, often considered a bellwether stock for the technology  
sector, fell 3 13/16 to 72 7/8. The company, the world's largest 
manufacturer of semiconductors, said late Tuesday it earned 55 
cents a share in the quarter, 2 cents below analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The results surprised many Wall Street investors who have come  
to expect Intel to meet or beat analyst forecasts. Traders said the 
report also fostered nervousness about the semiconductor industry, 
which may face production troubles in the coming months as Taiwan, 
a major producer of semiconductor parts, rebuilds from a recent 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 are expected to post  
average profit growth of more than 19 percent in the third quarter, 
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. But with expectations 
soaring, analysts say the companies that miss Wall Street's 
forecasts are in line for harsh punishment from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Shobin, technical analyst at Lehman Brothers, warned  
that unless investors can shake lingering nervousness about rising 
interest rates, earnings may be unable to drive stocks much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street is expecting phenomenal earnings, and that might  
already be priced into the market,'' he said. ``Right now, 
investors seem willing to ignore the good news and embrace the 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some bad news came from the bond market, where prices slipped  
again, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.24 
percent, from 6.22 percent late Tuesday. Rising yields on bonds can 
lure investors away from stocks as they seek out securities 
offering fixed, guaranteed returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 251.6 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.33 to 422.35.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain Told All in Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Of course, Bill Russell was a prime topic in  
one of the final interviews of Wilt Chamberlain's life. So were all 
the details of his many losses to the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't ask me how I remember them,'' Chamberlain said. ``I've  
never forgotten them, you understand?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who rarely did interviews in recent years, sat down  
for a television piece produced by the Philadelphia 76ers in May. 
Portions of the three-hour interview, conducted by longtime Philly 
sports anchor Al Meltzer, aired this summer on local cable. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a revealing talk in which Chamberlain spoke of regrets,  
his history with women and the man he thought was the best 
basketball player of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Believe it or not, it was Meadowlark Lemon.  
</P>
<P>
	``Meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible  
basketball player I've ever seen,'' Chamberlain said. ``People 
would say it would be Dr. J or even Michael Jordan. For me it would 
be Meadowlark Lemon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's bravado really came through. He bragged about  
wanting to fight Muhammad Ali, explained why he publicized the 
number of women he'd slept with and lamented his teams' many 
failures against Russell's Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you, if you could give me 10 points in all those  
seventh games against the Boston Celtics, instead of Bill Russell 
having 11 rings, I could've at least had nine or eight,'' 
Chamberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Russell -- very, very proud man. He thought his game of  
basketball was as good as anybody who ever played the game. He 
might not tell you that, but that's how he feels. And he may be 
right. With the rings, he can prove that he's right to some 
degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who died Tuesday in Los Angeles, also expressed  
mixed feelings about Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (John) Paxson hadn't made that 3-point shot for Chicago  
five or six years ago, that would be one less championship for 
Jordan,'' Chamberlain said. ``If (Steve) Kerr hadn't made the 
3-point shot, that's one more less championship for Jordan. Does 
that make Jordan a different guy, a different player? Does that 
make him any less great than he is because he lost two or three 
games? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saying this because you ask me: My disappointment is that  
some people view me as a loser. They hold up other guys as winners 
because they won the gold ring and I didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain won two championships, with the 76ers in 1967 and  
Los Angeles Lakers in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was close to signing a contract to fight Ali while  
Chamberlain was still playing basketball, and that renowned trainer 
Cus D'Amato wanted to train him for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight never happened because of money, Chamberlain said.  
</P>
<P>
	His on-and-off appearances with the Harlem Globetrotters scared  
him, ``because I liked them so well that I did not want to come 
back and play in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You must understand as a kid of color in those days, the  
Harlem Globetrotters were like being movie stars,'' Chamberlain 
said. ``You know, this was your dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticized for claiming in his autobiography that he'd slept  
with 20,000 women, Chamberlain explained why he did so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all fascinated by the numbers, as we were about the 100  
points,'' Chamberlain said. ``... So I thought of a number that was 
a round number that may be close and may be whatever, and I used 
that number. Now according to the average person, that number is so 
preposterous that I can understand them not believing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the point of using the number was to show that sex was a  
great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. 
That's the reason why I was single.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said he regretted not explaining the sexual climate  
at the time of his escapades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sexual situation going on than it is in the  
'80s and '90s, and I did a very poor job of describing that,'' said 
Chamberlain, who offered a warning for any men who admired him for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand  
different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life. I've 
found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much 
more satisfying.''

<HEADLINE> Annan Making First Trip to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan  
arrived today on his first trip to Kosovo, just two days after a 
grim reminder of ongoing ethnic hatred in the region -- the killing 
of a U.N. staffer who angered ethnic Albanians by speaking to them 
in the Serb language. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after arriving from the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo,  
Annan met with ethnic Albanian and Serb leaders. He also plans to 
meet with Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. chief administrator in Kosovo, 
and Lt. Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the commander of NATO-led 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general's two-day visit is taking place against  
the backdrop of Monday's brutal slaying of U.N. staffer Valentin S. 
Krumov, a Bulgarian national beaten and shot on the main street of 
this provincial capital after his first day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	An international police officer, Inspector Gilles Moreau, said  
Krumov had been asked for the time by a group of teen-agers, and he 
responded in Serbian. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident reflected the high pitch of hatred felt toward  
Serbs by the ethnic Albanian majority four months after the end of 
an 18-month crackdown by Serb forces that left 10,000 people dead. 
The crackdown ended in June after months of NATO bombing led to a 
Serb military and police pullout. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the NATO-led peacekeeping force that arrived in June nor  
international police who arrived in August have been able to quell 
sporadic ethnic violence -- much of it directed against the 
dwindling minority of Serbs in Kosovo by ethnic Albanians seeking 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Krumov was believed to be the first U.N. staffer killed since  
the United Nations began running Kosovo in June. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Annan appealed for an end to revenge attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have appealed for revenge to cease, we have appealed for  
tolerance and reconciliation which obviously will take some time,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, some of the Serb leaders Annan met with were those  
who resigned three weeks ago from a multiethnic advisory council. 
They quit to protest the U.N. decision to transform the former 
ethnic Albanian rebel army into the purportedly civilian Kosovo 
Protection Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb leaders wanted the ethnic Albanian group disbanded  
altogether. They charged that the uniformed corps is nothing more 
than the old Kosovo Liberation Army under a new name. 
</P>
<P>
	During his Sarajevo visit, Annan apologized to the people of the  
city for the failure of the United Nations to avert war and 
bloodshed in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first such admission by a U.N. official to a  
population that regards itself as the victim of the world's 
inability to stop the three and one-half-year war. Tens of 
thousands of people were killed and half of all Bosnians became 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Annan was the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations  
and a deputy to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one laments more than we the failure of the international  
community to take decisive action to halt the suffering and end a 
war that had produced so many victims,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the war began, Sarajevo's leaders had accused the  
United Nations of violating its own charter, which provides for the 
United Nations to defend an independent country attacked by 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. took no action because it was debating whether the  
fighting was an attack on one country by another or a civil war.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Ramsey Jury Meets Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A grand jury investigating the JonBenet  
Ramsey slaying returned to work for a second consecutive day today, 
one week before its term is to expire. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight women and four men began arriving at the courthouse at  
8 a.m. as about 50 photographers and reporters watched from the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors met for nearly seven hours Tuesday, after which they were  
escorted to their cars by armed sheriff's deputies as part of an 
increased effort to keep the media at a distance. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, district court officers initially barred reporters  
from the Boulder County Justice Center, but relented an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County spokeswoman Margaret McKinney refused to say who  
gave the order to ban journalists, but said, ``There were a lot of 
complaints from the public, a lot of frazzled citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury, which was convened in September 1998, faces an  
Oct. 20 deadline to decide whether to issue an indictment or a 
report, or simply disband without comment.

<HEADLINE> Giants Hire Thompson, Righetti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants replaced their  
first base and pitching coaches on Wednesday, with former All-Star 
players Robby Thompson and Dave Righetti joining the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson takes over from Carlos Alfonso as first base coach and  
Righetti replaces Ron Perranoski as pitching coach. Alfonso will be 
the team's administrative coach and video coordinator next season 
and Perranoski has been appointed special assistant to the general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and Righetti were teammates on the Giants' 1993 team  
and both served as roving minor league instructors this past 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 37, retired as an active player in 1997. He was San  
Francisco's No. 1 draft pick in 1983 and was named 1986 National 
League Rookie of the Year. He holds a number of team records for 
second basemen, including career games (1,304), at-bats (4,612), 
home runs (119) and stolen bases (103). 
</P>
<P>
	Righetti, 40, was named American League Rookie of the Year in  
1981 and was All-Star in 1986-87 with the Yankees. He threw a 
no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox on July 4, 1983 at Yankee 
Stadium. In his 16-year career, he played for the Yankees, Giants, 
Oakland, Toronto, and the Chicago White Sox. He established a Major 
League record with 46 saves in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Ron Harper Signs With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Free agent guard Ron Harper, a starter  
on three NBA championship teams in Chicago, is rejoining coach Phil 
Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, 35, signed a two-year, $4.2 million contract with the  
Lakers on Wednesday. The 6-foot-6 Harper will provide the Lakers' 
backcourt with some much needed experience in Jackson's triangle 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased to add a player of Ron Harper's ability to our  
team,'' executive vice president Jerry West said. ``He's a good 
player at both ends of the floor and also, having played for Phil 
in Chicago, his knowledge of the triangle offense will be a benefit 
to the other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls renounced their rights to Harper last month. A 13-year  
veteran, he played five years for Chicago after three-plus seasons 
with the Cleveland Cavaliers and four-plus seasons with the Los 
Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, who signed with the Bulls as a free agent on Sept. 15,  
1994, once likened leaving the Clippers to getting out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a different tone Wednesday about returning to Los  
Angeles, saying, ``I'm happy to be here and happy to be a part of 
this great team that is hopefully going to be even greater very 
soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper played 35 of a possible 50 games in last year's  
lockout-shortened season with the Bulls, averaging 11.2 points, 5.1 
rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.0 blocked shots and 1.7 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his best year in the 1986-87 season as a rookie with  
Cleveland, averaging 22.9 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists. A 
first-round draft pick of the Cavaliers after playing for four 
years at Miami of Ohio, he has career averages of 14.8 points, 4.3 
rebounds and 4.0 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson left the Bulls after the 1997-98 season, when he coached  
the team to its sixth championship in a span of eight years, and 
was hired by the Lakers last June.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Earnings, Sales Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sales of digital mobile phones gave Motorola  
Inc.'s revenue a boost, helping the company post third-quarter 
earnings that met expectations as it continues an impressive 
comeback from a bad year. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 maker of cell phones, which lost the top spot  
to Nokia in 1998, on Tuesday reported a 7 percent increase in 
overall sales for the third quarter over the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the gains were in digital cell phones, where sales and  
orders increased sharply in the Americas, Europe and especially 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola also is the world's third-leading semiconductor maker,  
and a strong showing in semiconductor sales helped it to overcome a 
significant charge for its disastrous investment in Iridium, the 
ambitious satellite-based mobile phone network that filed for 
bankruptcy in August. 
</P>
<P>
	For the period ending Oct. 2, the company's third-quarter  
operating earnings excluding special items were $332 million, or 53 
cents per share, compared with $40 million, or 7 cents a share, for 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That matched the 53 cents anticipated by securities analysts in  
the most recent survey by First Call/Thomson Financial, although 
some analysts said the ``whisper'' on Wall Street was that it would 
be 55 or 56 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock was falling today in a selloff of technology  
shares, dropping $3.12 1/2, or by 3.3 percent, to $91.81 1/4 this 
afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Tuesday helped show that the Schaumburg, Ill.-based  
communications and equipment maker is rebounding well from a rough 
stretch in which it underwent a billion-dollar restructuring and 
laid off 24,000 people in late 1998 and early 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is good news in the report, ``I think the Street  
will be disappointed they didn't give us a little more on the 
bottom line,'' said analyst Pete Peterson of Volpe, Brown, Wheland 
and Co. in San Francisco, referring to hopes the company would beat 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said third-quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 7  
percent from $7.2 billion for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing results without the businesses Motorola sold since  
last year, the company noted that sales in ongoing operations were 
up 12 percent to $7.6 billion compared with $6.7 billion a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the most rapid cell-phone sales growth occurred in  
Global System for Mobile, or GSM, communications products in 
Europe, which Peterson said will position Motorola well against its 
European competitors when that market takes off. 
</P>
<P>
	``These strong improvements in our financial operating  
performance are a result of significant sales growth in digital 
wireless phones and a focused repositioning and restructuring of 
our semiconductor and digital communications businesses over the 
last year,'' said Robert L. Growney, president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, like its competitors, continues to suffer from  
declining sales for paging products and said paging orders also 
declined in all regions, especially Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola recorded special charges for the quarter of $344  
million, largely to prop up its 18 percent investment in Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income including the special items was $91 million, or 14  
cents a share, up from $27 million and 4 cents per share a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending is the recently announced merger with General  
Instrument, which dominates the market for cable TV set-top boxes. 
Pushing into the fast-growing cable television field, Motorola is 
expected to make General Instrument part of a new business unit 
once the merger is approved, probably in the first quarter of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comprehensive changes we have made across the company over  
the last 18 months are improving our ability to execute and perform 
financially,'' said Christopher B. Galvin, chairman and chief 
executive officer.

<HEADLINE> Mike Patton: a Singer With Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A grin spreads across singer Mike Patton's face  
as he considers the notion of someone remixing the latest musical 
creation by his band Mr. Bungle. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, whose devilish countenance is accentuated by a scruffy  
goatee and hair that is greased and slicked back, dismisses the 
rumor as ``a bunch of hot air'' meant to stir publicity for 
``California,'' Mr. Bungle's third record in nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that the producer for Grammy Award-winning  
singer Lauryn Hill had expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	It might have helped ``if we would've paid him half-a-million,''  
Patton cracks as he sits tucked away inside a wooden booth at a 
downtown club. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of someone trying to decode the album's labyrinthine  
track sheets is mind-boggling. On one track is a bongo, tom-tom, 
three guitar notes and backward cymbal. ``Seriously, it's 
ridiculous,'' the 31-year-old musician said. ``You need a 
dictionary to decipher what's going on in that music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Bungle's music exists on the outer limits of the  
avant-garde. Its place on the musical spectrum is surrounded by the 
likes of Frank Zappa, film composer Ennio Morricone and 
20th-century composer Iannis Xenakis. The band has been together 15 
years, since Patton was a teen-ager in Eureka, Calif. Yet Patton is 
most recognizable as the vocalist for Faith No More, which 
disbanded earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton joined Faith No More 10 years ago, while continuing his  
association with Mr. Bungle. He brought talent and inventiveness 
into the wearisome realm of alternative music, armed with a brash 
attitude and a dynamic voice capable of bellowing out a death metal 
growl or a lilting angelic whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mr. Bungle is known only in limited circles, Faith No More  
was more closely aligned with mainstream rock radio and MTV. The 
band's popularity grew after Patton's arrival, but the newcomer was 
unimpressed and bored by the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. He agitated 
the situation by offering candid and controversial drivel about his 
curious habits, ideas and obsessions. His onstage antics, some 
befitting a freak show, didn't help and bestowed upon him the 
mystique of a mad genius. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the press picked up so much on it because there was no  
other angle to grab on to, meaning I don't think they understood 
the music,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But being connected to the mainstream had its advantages. On the  
1990 video for ``Epic,'' Faith No More's biggest song, Patton 
seized the opportunity to promote Mr. Bungle by donning one of the 
band's T-shirts. A record contract with Warner Bros. followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Bungle's first album was a genre-hopping roller coaster ride  
littered with plenty of raw humor and a variety of snippets taken 
from many sources, including porn films, field recordings of the 
band hopping trains and a 1950s educational skit featuring a 
puppet, from which the band took its name. The album was a 
collision of jazz, speed metal and carnival music. 
</P>
<P>
	``California'' is a surprisingly linear album, even by  
mainstream standards. Though it covers just as much ground as its 
predecessors -- from Romanian gypsy music to '50s doo-wop -- it works 
best as a cohesive album rather than a disjointed crash course in 
musicology. 
</P>
<P>
	That the band has remained on a major label for so many years is  
``really kind of an achievement and pretty surprising,'' Patton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Ipecac Recordings, his new independent record label, ever  
sustain Mr. Bungle? 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we've learned to live on a major label and  
we're used to that kind of diet,'' he said. ``Bungle is a pain. 
Bungle demands a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recording process for ``California'' at times required  
several 24-track machines and more than 50 analog tracks. The 
backbone of the band's current live show is a medley of 
synthesizers and electronic accessories. ``It's pretty new for most 
of us -- learning that whole language, sampling, editing, 
programming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent from the band's current tour are its trademark masks and  
outfits, due to the increased demands of the music. Patton, who 
once hid behind bondage masks, wears a floral-print shirt and khaki 
pants to match the tour's California-tourist theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members had to surrender their personal and social lives  
for a few months to prepare for the tour. For Patton, the sacrifice 
was a labor of love. ``I don't really live anywhere. San Francisco 
is my home, but I go back and forth to Italy because my wife lives 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also divides his time among various musical projects.  
</P>
<P>
	Fantomas, an avant-garde group, evolved out of what Patton said  
is his frustration with the unimaginative state of death metal 
music. Fantomas' debut album is difficult to digest in one sitting. 
But taken individually, its 30 tracks -- some only several seconds 
long -- provide a refreshing take on the genre. 
</P>
<P>
	For another project, Patton is blending the sounds of a small  
choir, live strings, a DJ and plenty of his laudable crooning. 
</P>
<P>
	Both will be released on Ipecac, whose eclectic roster includes  
grunge godfathers the Melvins, Japanese noise artist Merzbow and 
The Kids From Widney High, a group of mentally challenged 
youngsters who opened Mr. Bungle's first two shows on the recent 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a really emotional experience because what's  
coming off the stage is ... 100 percent real and that's a pretty 
precious commodity. Ninety percent of the bands you see in 
nightclubs these days don't have that and these guys did, and it 
was pretty deep, a really beautiful thing. They were smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton wants to take his ideas, energy and obsessions and give  
them structure and a viable medium. ``When I was in Faith No More, 
people assumed it was the real deal and I was joking around with 
all the rest of it. ... And now people will assume that Mr. Bungle 
is where I'm sincere. I have to dedicate a little more time to Mr. 
Bungle, absolutely, it's a touring band. A lot of my other projects 
are studio projects, you do the record and it's over. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's all important.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Rogers Falls Apart in Sixth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Everything was going so well for Kenny Rogers.  
The man who supposedly couldn't pitch in the big games did just 
that for five innings against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all fell apart in the sixth for Rogers and the New York  
Mets, who lost 4-3 Wednesday and trail the NL championship series 
2-0 heading back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers had allowed six singles and two walks through five  
innings, using a tricky pickoff and an effective sinker that led to 
two double plays to help New York hold a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, not known for an intimidating presence on the mound,  
even got in the Braves' heads after picking off Gerald Williams in 
the first inning and Andruw Jones in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jones was on first base in the fourth, he didn't even take  
a lead. Instead, he lined up like a sprinter in the blocks, which 
was only appropriate in the stadium that held the track and field 
events during the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But you can't pick off a player who homers. And it was the long  
ball that got to Rogers in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chipper Jones worked a nine-pitch walk with one out, Brian  
Jordan hit an opposite-field drive that bounced off the screen on 
the right-field foul poll, tying the game at 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Before manager Bobby Valentine could get reliever Turk Wendell  
warmed up, Andruw Jones lined a single to left. 
</P>
<P>
	With the smoke from the firecrackers after Jordan's homer still  
lingering in the stadium, Eddie Perez hit the first pitch he saw 
into the left-field seats to give the Braves a lead they wouldn't 
give up. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine threw down his hat in the dugout and kicked it away in  
disgust. Rogers, who was forced out of New York two years ago 
because of his big-game failings, dejectedly walked off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers fell to 0-2 with a 10.26 ERA in five postseason starts.  
Unlike in 1996 with the Yankees, when Rogers was unable to go 
longer than three innings in any of his three starts -- games the 
Yankees eventually came back to win -- the Mets weren't able to take 
him off the hook with runs of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	They came close in the eighth when Edgardo Alfonzo's RBI double  
brought New York within 4-3. John Rocker struck out John Olerud and 
Robin Ventura with the tying run on second base to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura -- the middle of the Mets'  
lineup -- went 0-for-10 and are 1-for-21 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets started the game undaunted by their Game 1 loss to Greg  
Maddux, their 10th defeat in 13 games this year to Atlanta. Most of 
the players and coaches stood on the top step early in the game 
shouting encouragement to their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	New York even had a lead to celebrate after Roger Cedeno's RBI  
single in the second. When backup Melvin Mora homered three innings 
after replacing the ailing Rickey Henderson in left field, it 
looked like it might finally be the Mets' day in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was just like most of New York's other trips here,  
as the Mets lost for the 15th time in 16 games here.

<HEADLINE> Dent To Officially Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Three years after playing his last  
game, Richard Dent is going to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Dent, the MVP of Super Bowl XX, will officially retire before  
the Chicago Bears' game Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
He'll serve as honorary captain for the game, and a banner with his 
No. 95 will fly at Soldier Field for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A ferocious pass rusher, Dent set Bears records for sacks in a  
career (124.5), single season (17 1/2) and single game (4 1/2). He 
finished his career with a total of 137 1/2 sacks, fifth-best in NFL 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dent was part of the ``46'' defense that led the Bears to a  
Super Bowl title in 1986. The New England Patriots were sacked a 
record seven times and held to just seven yards rushing in 
Chicago's 46-10 victory. Dent had 1 1/2 sacks and two forced fumbles 
to become only the fourth defensive player to earn MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	After 11 years in Chicago, Dent played for San Francisco in 1994  
and won his second Super Bowl ring. He returned to Chicago for the 
1995 season and played his last season with the Indianapolis Colts.

<HEADLINE> Bear Stearns Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. reported its  
first-quarter earnings more than doubled, but the results fell 
short of Wall Street expectations and sent the investment firm's 
stock falling sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns said Wednesday it had earnings of $157.9 million,  
or $1 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 24, up 146 percent 
from $64.1 million, or 38 cents per share, for the same period last 
year 
</P>
<P>
	The company fell well short of analyst expectations of $1.15 per  
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Investors bid 
Bear Stearns stock down $3.50 a share to $36.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $1.05 billion, up from $740.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns said its commission revenues fell 5.1 percent to  
$228.5 million because of a drop in investor transactions as the 
stock market suffered through a volatile period. But gains in other 
businesses -- such as investment banking, where revenues rose nearly 
116 percent to $262.5 million -- offset the commission decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns reported an increase in underwriting, mergers and  
acquisitions activity and merchant banking, all part of its 
investment banking business. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from principal transactions, those made for Bear  
Stearns' own accounts, rose 84 percent to $362.2 million.

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers Required To Lock Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City gun owners will have to use  
trigger-locks or face up to a year in jail under a new law passed 
Wednesday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous vote closed a loophole in a 1998 law that made gun  
sellers responsible for issuing safety devices but didn't require 
gun owners to use them. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani supports the added 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every maximum protection we can provide to protect children  
from guns and any effort to make adults responsible for gun safety 
are worth pursuing,'' said City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, San Francisco and Massachusetts have similar  
trigger-lock requirements. New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman signed 
a bill Tuesday requiring that trigger locks or gun storage lockers 
be sold with every handgun purchased at stores and gun shows. 
California passed a similar law earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Tribune Earnings Up 31 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co., the parent of the Chicago Tribune  
and the Chicago Cubs, reported Wednesday that third quarter 
earnings jumped 31 percent from the same quarter in 1998 led by 
gains in its broadcasting unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits for the quarter grew to $109 million, or 40  
cents a share, from $83 million or 30 cents per share in the 1998 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The company exceeded analysts' expectations, pegged at 38 cents  
a share in a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. Per-share 
results reflect a two-for-one common stock split, effective Sept. 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenue rose almost 11 percent to $836.7 million  
from $757.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune reported gains in all three of its divisions:  
broadcasting and entertainment, publishing and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our broadcasting group again outperformed the industry,  
leading Tribune to a record third quarter. All of our business 
groups have contributed to a great year so far and are well 
positioned for solid long-term growth,'' said John W. Madigan, 
Tribune chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasting and entertainment operating profits were up 40  
percent to $97 million for the quarter. The company cited improved 
results surrounding its operation of the Cubs, which came in last 
place on the field, and at its television stations, particularly WB 
Network affiliates in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune operates 18 television stations and four radio  
stations, as well as four newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 26, Tribune Co. reported  
revenues of $2.4 billion, up 9 percent from $2.2 billion in the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding gains from the sales of subsidiaries and invesments  
and other special items, the company earned $299.2 million, or 
$1.11 a diluted share, compared with $253.9 million, or 91 cents a 
diluted share in the first nine months of 1998. The per-share 
figures reflect the stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune shares fell 43 3/4 cents Wednesday to $50.93 3/4 a share on  
the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported its earnings 
after the close of U.S. markets.

<HEADLINE> Morris Signing at Reagan Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Edmund Morris signed copies of his  
new Ronald Reagan biography at Reagan's presidential library, 
saying his subject was never a ``bookish, nerdy intellectual like 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris told about 40 people at the library Tuesday that the more  
time he spent with Reagan ``the more astonished I was by his 
private ordinariness and his public majesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris has been attacked for injecting fictional elements into  
``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan.'' He thanked the library for 
allowing him to appear, citing the ``potential embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever embarrassment Mr. Morris feels is his own,'' said  
Mark Burson, executive director of the library. ``We aren't 
embarrassed to have him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The library did not send out the usual press notices that Morris  
would appear.

<HEADLINE> Tech's Hamilton Emerges for Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chris Weinke for Heisman?  
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton may be the new favorite to win the  
Heisman Trophy now that Peter Warrick is all but out of the race 
following his suspension, but what about Weinke, Warrick's 
teammate? 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida State quarterback not only plays for the top-ranked  
team, but he directed the undefeated Seminoles to a 41-35 victory 
over Hamilton and the Yellow Jackets on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Hamilton had a terrific game, throwing for 387 yards and  
four TDs, but Weinke was pretty good, too. The former minor league 
baseball player passed for 262 yards and three TDs -- and his team 
won. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton and Alabama's Shaun Alexander, along with Wisconsin's  
Ron Dayne and Purdue's Drew Brees, have picked up support now that 
Warrick faces legal problems following his arrest last week for 
felony grand theft. But Weinke stated his case quite nicely last 
Saturday, throwing for 332 yards and two TDs in leading the 
Seminoles over No. 24 Miami, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could sense him taking over,'' Florida State coach Bobby  
Bowden said. ``I could sense that he thought, `I've got to do it. 
I've got to get it done.' It was unspoken. Some of the kids sensed 
it, too, that he was taking it into his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Weinke: ``Coach Bowden challenged us with Pete out by  
saying that this was an opportunity for somebody else to make a 
name for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke mentioned a few of his receivers, but it was Weinke who  
made the strongest statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton leads the nation in passing efficiency with 1,347 yards  
and 12 TDs (he also has 321 yards rushing and six TDs), while 
Weinke is seventh in passing with 1,627 yards and 13 TDs.

	 *MISSISSIPPI MADNESS:* One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three  
Mississippi. ... 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the 63-year history of The Associated  
Press college football poll, the three major schools from the 
``Hospitality State'' are ranked in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State, 6-0 for the first time in 55 years, checked  
in at No. 12 this week after its 18-16 victory over Auburn on 
Saturday. The Bulldogs moved into the poll on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Mississippi (5-1) and Southern Mississippi (3-2)  
slipped in, the Rebels at No. 22, the Golden Eagles at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi moved out to its best start since 1990 with a 20-13  
victory over Tulane, and Southern Mississippi ended a 22-game 
losing streak against Top 25 teams with a 39-22 victory over East 
Carolina, which dropped from No. 16 to No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three Mississippi schools was in the Top 25 in 1997,  
but not all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANOTHER POLL MILESTONE:* With No. 24 Miami (2-3) still in the  
Top 25 after three straight losses, the question is: When was the 
last time a losing team was ranked so deep in the season? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer: Southern California, in 1971. The Trojans were 3-4  
and ranked No. 24 after a 28-14 victory against No. 6 Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, a 31-21 loser to No. 1 Florida State on Saturday, has  
lost three in a row for just the second time in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	That streak should end on Saturday when the Hurricanes play host  
to Temple (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOW TECH:* Texas Tech doesn't have Ricky Williams to promote  
for the Heisman Trophy anymore, so the Red Raiders are trying to 
cash in on a goal post. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech is selling pieces of the mangled goal post toppled by fans  
after its 21-19 victory over Texas A&AMP;M on Oct. 2. Commemorative 
pieces of the only goal post ever torn down at Jones Stadium can be 
ordered by phone through the Double T Shoppe on campus for $25. A 
limited number of the souvenirs is expected to be sold at the store 
late next week. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXTRA POINTS:* Southern California (3-2), which attempts to  
extend its winning streak over Notre Dame (3-3) to four in a row on 
Saturday, had minus-20 yards in last week's 31-24 loss at Arizona. 
... Rutgers (0-5) is the only one of 114 I-A teams without an 
interception this season. How bad is Rutgers? In his fourth season, 
coach Terry Shea has a 3-20 Big East record; Temple coach Bobby 
Wallace is 3-6 in his second season. ... Could be that Kansas State 
RB Frank Murphy won't return this season after surgery on his 
sprained right ankle. Nobody knows for sure because coach Bill 
Snyder isn't saying much. ``We won't allow him to come back too 
fast,'' Snyder said. ``He'll move along at the speed that medical 
science and his body allow. We're not going to get ahead of 
things.'' ... Duke (1-4) ended a seven-game losing streak with last 
week's 24-17 OT victory over Virginia. Excited Lamar Grant said: 
``We still have bowl aspirations. We're 1-4 overall, but we're 1-1 
in the conference and we can still have a great finish in the 
conference. Easy big fellow, No. 8 Georgia Tech comes to town on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Study Black Cancer Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Blacks are less likely to have lung cancer removed by doctors  
while there is still a chance of survival -- a big reason the 
disease is deadlier for blacks than for whites, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they don't know exactly why this is so, but  
the president of an organization of black doctors suggested racial 
prejudice is at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Early lung cancer has few symptoms, so many patients do not  
learn they have it until it has spread and it is too late to 
operate. Even with surgery, the chances are poor. 
</P>
<P>
	About 34,000 people a year are diagnosed with non-small-cell  
lung cancer -- the most common kind -- early enough for surgery to 
make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York  
looked at such patients and found that the overall five-year 
survival rate among elderly whites was 34.1 percent vs. 26.4 
percent among elderly blacks. However, the study found that the 
black patients were almost 13 percent less likely to have such 
surgery than the whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who had the cancer cut out before it spread, about  
39 percent of the blacks and 43 percent of the whites lived at 
least five years after the diagnosis. Without the operation, only 4 
percent of the blacks and 5 percent of the whites made it that 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the opening question left by this study is what is  
going on in that doctor-patient relationship or interaction'' that 
leads to the black-white difference, said Dr. Peter Bach, who led 
the study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have long known that blacks with lung cancer are more  
likely than whites with the disease to die from it. But the reasons 
have been unclear. This is evidence that different medical 
treatment is at least part of the reason, and at least the second 
major study this year to find that blacks get different medical 
treatment than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks are also more likely than whites to die of heart disease  
-- and earlier this year, a study found that blacks and women are 
less likely than white men to get the best cardiac testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data is coming from so many sources that it is hard even  
with the best of conscience not to think that race is the factor, 
be it conscious or unconscious,'' said Dr. Walter Shervington of 
New Orleans, president of the National Medical Association, an 
organization of 20,000 black doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 10,984 patients in a National Cancer  
Institute database of people in five states and five cities outside 
of those states. To remove the availability of insurance as a 
factor, the researchers looked only at people who were at least 65 
years old, and thus covered by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that 76.7 percent of the white patients had surgery,  
but only 64 percent of the black patients did. 
</P>
<P>
	Since poverty makes it harder to get good care, the researchers  
also tried to look at the poorest patients, black and white. They 
looked for people living in a ZIP code where the average income was 
in the nation's bottom quarter. There was still a black-white 
difference of nearly 9 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it's killing people,'' said Dr. Rodney Hood of San  
Diego, president-elect of the NMA. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Garrett Walsh, a thoracic surgeon at M.D. Anderson  
Cancer Center in Houston, said the racial gap may be an 
oversimplification. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the researchers had ``fuzzy'' information about income  
and whether the patients had other diseases that might have kept 
them from getting surgery. Patients' personal thoughts about 
whether the surgery could help them may also be a big issue, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hood said doctors' bias could keep some elderly blacks from  
getting surgery, as could misunderstandings between white doctors 
and their black patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Many patients -- blacks and whites alike -- are afraid that  
surgery can spread cancer, and believe that was why a friend or 
close relative died after an operation, doctors say.

<HEADLINE> Ivankov Seeks 3rd Gymnastics Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Winning the world team title turned out to  
be an easy vault for China's male gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
	They face a bigger challenge trying to take the individual  
championship away from veterans like two-time champion Ivan Ivankov 
and Alexei Bondarenko in Thursday's all-around competition at the 
World Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's defending champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia faces  
three Romanians with good chances to dethrone her -- 1997 silver 
medalist Simona Amanar, and newcomers Maria Olaru and Andreea 
Raducan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanians won their fourth straight team title Tuesday when  
Khorkina fell off the balance beam on the Russian team's last 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese men took time off Wednesday for a photo session and  
informal news conference for a corporate sponsor, and coach Huang 
Yubin called it ``a good opportunity to relax mentally after a 
stressful night in competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They answered such questions as whether they had phoned  
girlfriends about China's fourth consecutive team triumph -- after 
Huang said that while in training, they weren't permitted to have 
girlfriends. All said, ``No girlfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huang said the Chinese were confident, although Yang Wei might  
have a problem in the vault competition Saturday. He wasn't 
expected to be among the eight qualifiers in that event, and had 
not prepared the second difficult vault that would be required in 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang was the top scorer among the 36 who qualified for the  
all-around gold medal competition, followed by teammate Huang Xu 
and Bondarenko, the 1997 silver medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Tuesday's team finals, Bondarenko and Ivankov were the  
top individuals, improving on their qualifying scores. Japan's 
Naoya Tsukahara, the 1997 bronze medalist, was fifth best. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang qualified for three of the specialty finals -- vault, floor  
exercises and high bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivankov qualified on the rings and parallel bars, and Bondarenko  
on the bars and floor exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had four-time national champion Blaine Wilson,  
the No. 6 qualifier, and Yewki Tomita in the all-around finals, but 
no one in the men's specialty finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's competition, the 17-year-old Olaru and 16-year-old  
Raducan were best in both qualifying and the women's team finals. 
Raducan scored 9.812 on the beam and 9.800 in the floor exercises 
in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Khorkina, third in qualifying, was only 11th best in the team  
finals, where her fall from the beam offset two of the best scores 
of the meet so far -- a 9.825 on the uneven bars and a 9.800 in the 
floor exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which finished sixth in both the men's and  
women's team finals, had three women in the all-around competition 
-- national champion Kristen Maloney, Vanessa Atler and Elise Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney also was in the balance beam and floor exercises finals,  
Atler in the floor exercises, and Ray in the uneven bars gold medal 
event.

<HEADLINE> e-Scan Tracks Online Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Like to drink cola? You probably visit travel  
sites if you sit down regularly to surf the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Buy lots of dog food? Bet you browse ESPN.com or weather.com.  
</P>
<P>
	A cookie lover? Chances are you visit financial sites when  
you're on the Web, with maybe a stop at MTV.com along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Two research firms armed with data showing just such consumer  
quirks presented a project Wednesday that they say gives companies 
an unprecedented ability to target just the right dot-coms with 
their ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint effort, e-Scan, tracks consumer behavior from click-on  
to the grocery checkout line, linking buyers' preferences with what 
Web sites they visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major stride forward in Internet measurement for  
consumer packaged goods firms,'' said Joe Durrett, chief executive 
officer of Chicago-based Information Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	IRI's partner is New York-based Media Metrix, an online  
marketing research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has been tracking the Internet usage and buying  
behavior of 3,000 households since July to learn how the two are 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Media Metrix collects Internet viewing data from software  
installed in computers that follows a surfer's clicks to determine 
the amount of time spent on a site and the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
	IRI tracks purchases made from grocery and convenience stores,  
enlisting shoppers to record them with the use of miniature 
scanning devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have brought their technologies together by installing  
Media Metrix software in the personal computers of IRI shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Early efforts have turned up some predictable results and some  
surprising ones. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, heavy purchasers of non-carbonated drinks --  
typically the young -- browse ty.com, the home of Beanie Babies, or 
nick.com, Nickelodeon's site. 
</P>
<P>
	But cookie consumers, who tend to be female more often than not,  
enjoy surfing Motley Fool's fool.com, a financial news site most 
often visited by men. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Greenberg, president of IRI's e-commerce division, says the  
``revolutionary'' service marks the first time companies can link 
what people are doing on the Web with what they've been buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble, which participated in the testing of e-Scan,  
says it will improve Internet marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us the knowledge to reallocate resources to align  
brand products with specific interactive consumers.'' said Jon 
Mamela, the company's digital research manager.

<HEADLINE> Cable Gains Boost Time Warner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. reported third-quarter net  
income of $360 million, bouncing back from a loss a year ago as big 
gains from cable TV offset weaker results in its music and 
television studios. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest media and entertainment company reported  
Wednesday its earnings were equivalent to 27 cents per share and 
compared to a loss of $37 million, or 3 cents a share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 2 percent to $6.72 billion from $6.59 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's third-quarter profits were lifted by one-time  
gains from the sale and exchange of cable systems, a process cable 
providers use to concentrate their subscribers in specific 
geographic areas. But even without those gains, the company's 
pre-tax cash flow -- a measurement widely used by financial analysts 
-- rose by 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. Time  
Warner's stock started higher but was down $1.81 1/4 at $61.50 as 
prices fell overall on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's stock has been sliding from about $77 since  
mid-July, when the co-chairmen of the Warner Bros. music and movie 
studio resigned abruptly. The stock took another hit this summer 
after a prominent analyst cautioned that Time Warner's music 
earnings would be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from its cable systems, Time Warner also posted stronger  
results in its large magazine publishing division, Time Inc., and 
its cable networks division, which includes CNN, HBO and Cinemax. 
Time Inc. has been reaping benefits from two successful magazine 
launches, Teen People and InStyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The main signs of weakness during the quarter were in the music  
division, where results were off at Time Warner's half-owned 
Columbia House direct sales business, and in movie and TV 
production, where earnings a year ago were pumped up by syndicated 
sales of ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an overall decline in its filmed entertainment division,  
Time Warner well at the box office this summer with the ``Austin 
Powers'' sequel in the United States and with the releases of ``The 
Matrix'' and ``Wild Wild West'' overseas. ``The Matrix'' also had 
big sales in the new DVD format in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin said that despite the decline  
in music earnings this quarter he expected profits to turn up 
modestly next year, when the company plans new releases from 
Madonna, Tracy Chapman and others. ``This year, we didn't have a 
lot of the major acts we had before,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner also posted a wider loss at its growing WB network,  
which is entering its sixth season. The network is doing well with 
young viewers with shows like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' but 
Time Warner blamed the larger loss on steeper costs for programming 
and expanding the number of stations that carry WB. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Time Warner earned $1.06  
billion, or 81 cents a share, compared to a loss of $158 million, 
or 13 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenues 
rose 2 percent to $19.35 billion from $18.98 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-month figures for this year were inflated by the cable  
deals as well as a one-time gain from the early termination of a 
long-term video distribution agreement with MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
	With 13 million subscribers, Time Warner is the nation's  
second-largest cable provider after AT&AMP;T Corp. In September, Time 
Warner launched its jointly owned Road Runner hi-speed cable 
Internet access service in New York City and eight other markets, 
bringing its subscriber base to 420,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Time Warner floated shares in its year-old phone service  
subsidiary, Time Warner Telecom. Like other major cable companies, 
Time Warner is hoping to use its cable TV lines to deliver phone 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first quarter that Time Warner reported fully  
consolidated results from its Time Warner Entertainment subsidiary, 
which holds many of its movie, TV and cable assets. The cable 
provider MediaOne, which holds a 25 percent stake in the 
subsidiary, ceded management rights over its interest to Time 
Warner in August. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which is in the process of acquiring MediaOne, has been  
negotiating with Time Warner over how to restructure the ownership 
of the TWE unit. Time Warner and AT&AMP;T have already agreed to 
cooperate on providing phone service over Time Warner's cable 
lines, a process AT&AMP;T has undertaken with its many new cable 
properties.

<HEADLINE> Morning News Shows Disappoint NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Starting November 1, the top three broadcast  
networks will have morning news shows that look remarkably alike -- 
and that's not something NBC's news chief takes pride in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually a terrible indictment of television that we've  
ended up with three programs now that look so much like each 
other,'' NBC News President Andrew Lack said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he was disappointed in ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
which last month debuted an audience-participation studio in Times 
Square modeled after the success of the NBC ``Today'' show window 
in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ``The Early Show'' starts in less than three weeks with  
former ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel from another Manhattan studio 
that allows passersby to peer in. The three shows will have similar 
mixes of news and features, with local news cut-ins at the same 
times each morning. 
</P>
<P>
	With the morning TV market increasingly lucrative, ABC and CBS  
are bearing down hard against ``Today,'' which last week celebrated 
its 200th consecutive week atop the ratings. Television producers 
are notorious imitators of what's been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he could understand why third-place CBS, given its  
longtime struggles in the time slot, would want to try a show with 
Gumbel, who left ``Today'' in the midst of its run at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he wishes viewers had a dramatically different choice  
in the morning, although he acknowledged he's not sure what that 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokeswoman said ``Good Morning America'' has been doing  
several innovative things in the past few weeks, including 
launching a series of town meetings with presidential candidates 
and a two-hour program on happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps Mr. Lack isn't watching our program as closely as our  
viewers,'' said ABC's Eileen Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``Today'' will be moving into battle temporarily  
without its leader. Executive producer Jeff Zucker is undergoing 
surgery Friday for a pre-cancerous growth on his colon, and will be 
absent four to six weeks. Zucker was treated for colon cancer two 
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Customs Targets Intellectual Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service is creating a center aimed  
at cracking down on the theft of motion pictures, computer 
software, music and other illegally pirated intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly made the announcement  
Wednesday and is part of his agency's ongoing efforts to combat the 
growing piracy problem in this area. 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which will open within 30 days, will coordinate the  
efforts of roughly 15 agencies now involved in investigating and 
prosecuting cases that involve pirated intellectual property, such 
as films, software and music, that are illegally copied. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main objectives ... will be to eliminate duplication of  
investigative efforts between agencies and to coordinate 
multinational investigations,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four current customs officials and four current FBI officials  
are expected to work at the center at customs headquarters, said 
Customs Service spokesman Dean Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
	From fiscal year 1994 through 1998, the value of intellectual  
property rights seizures increased to nearly $76 million from $37 
million, customs said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same period, the number of seizures also increased to  
3,409 from 2,203. Last year, offenders in China and Taiwan 
accounted for nearly half of all the pirated merchandise seized, 
the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Priceline.com Sues Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Priceline.com filed a federal lawsuit  
Wednesday against Microsoft Corp. and its Expedia Inc. subsidiary, 
claiming that a new online hotel pricing service by Expedia.com 
violates Priceline's patent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also alleges that Microsoft is in violation of the  
Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceline.com is seeking monetary damages, and an order shutting  
down the Expedia service, said Evan R. Chesler, Priceline's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen the complaint yet, so we aren't in the  
position to comment in detail. But we are confident that when all 
the facts are on the table, Microsoft's position will prevail,'' 
said Tom Pilla, Microsoft spokesman. ``We respect the intellectual 
property of other companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both services allow a customer to log onto a Web site and book a  
hotel room by answering a series of questions, including how much 
the customer is willing to pay for the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceline.com implemented its hotel service in September, 1998,  
a year before Expedia implemented its service, said Chesler. 
</P>
<P>
	A patent for Priceline's name-your-own-price service was issued  
on Aug. 11, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft showed an interest in the Priceline service and  
representatives from the two companies met in November to discuss a 
proposal for ``co-marketing arrangements,'' the lawsuit claims. But 
after Priceline provided Microsoft with confidential information, 
the discussions ended without an agreement, according to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	During a corporate conference in July, Microsoft chairman Bill  
Gates told Priceline officials he would not let a patent stand in 
his way, the lawsuit claims.

<HEADLINE> China Executes Cult Leader for Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese authorities in the central province of  
Hunan have executed the leader of the outlawed ``Master of God'' 
cult and sentenced another member to 17 years in prison, the 
official newspaper Legal Daily reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Jiaguo was executed after the Hunan High Court upheld his  
death sentence for raping 11 women, including two under the age of 
14, and defrauding members of the cult he founded in 1993. Fellow 
cult leader Zhu Aiqing was given a 17 year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Master of God'' cult is among many that have been targeted  
in a harsh crackdown on all unauthorized religious activities that 
also resulted in the July 22 banning of the popular Falun Gong 
meditation movement. 
</P>
<P>
	According to accounts in the state-run media, Liu broke away  
from another banned cult, the ``Beili King'' group, after 
disagreeing with its leader. After Beili King leader Wu Yangming 
was executed in 1995, Liu sought to lure away his rival's devotees, 
eventually winning a following of some 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the case with the Falun Gong, Chinese authorities accused  
Liu's cult of seeking to overthrow the government and of deceiving 
members. According to an account in the official magazine Liaowang, 
Liu and his cohorts told women followers that they must sacrifice 
their bodies to God, saying that members of their families would 
get sick and die if they did not have sex with them. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Liu and others seduced girls by quoting the Bible out of  
context, claiming that they were ``predestined in a former life to 
be called by God to be `holy spirits,' which would improve their 
karma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Legal Daily report said that Liu and Zhu both had appealed  
their sentences. Liu's appeal was rejected, but the Hunan High 
Court reduced Zhu's original 20 year sentence by three years. In 
addition, Liu was ordered to pay a fine equal to $3,630 and Zhu to 
pay the equivalent of $1,210.

<HEADLINE>  49ers' Young Meets With Neurologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young, still not recovered from  
the latest of several concussions over the last three years, met 
with his neurologist Wednesday with his future in the NFL appearing 
increasingly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the symptoms are lasting a little bit longer than they  
did before,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``In previous concussions, 
he has recovered sooner. That in itself is the concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, a two-time NFL MVP and six-time passing efficiency  
leader who led the San Francisco 49ers to their fifth Super Bowl 
victory in 1994, underwent a day-long battery of tests under the 
direction of Dr. Gary Steinberg, chief of neurosurgery at the 
Stanford Medical School. San Francisco team physician Dr. James 
Klint also was present for the examination. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of the tests wasn't immediately known, but a subdued  
Mariucci said Young was still dealing with post-concussion symptoms 
of fatigue and wooziness 2 1/2 weeks after sustaining the damaging 
head blow. 
</P>
<P>
	The test will be used as part of the evaluation process by the  
medical team, which will either clear Young to resume playing or 
determine there are too many health risks and recommend he retire. 
Repeated concussions can cause premature senility and other kinds 
of brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Mariucci raised the possibility that he and  
general manager Bill Walsh may take a more active role in deciding 
Young's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not there today, but there will come a point where a  
decision has to be made,'' Mariucci said. ``If it were ever to fall 
in our laps, we would make a very conservative decision. Steve's 
health is more important than anything, where we play, who's the 
backup, our Super Bowl chances, the whole thing. Steve's health is 
A-No. 1 in our decision, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, in his 15th NFL season, has been resisting the calls of  
his agent, friends, family and even some current and former 
teammates to quit, saying he still has a passion to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing close attention to and I'm concerned about  
it just like everybody else,'' said Carolina fullback William 
Floyd, a teammate of Young on San Francisco's 1994 Super Bowl team. 
``This is like the fourth or fifth time in as many years and it's 
scary to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci acknowledged Young has been besieged with pleas to  
retire and perhaps his time has come. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people are suggesting the `R' word to him,'' Mariucci  
said. ``He doesn't like hearing it, but sooner or later he's going 
to need to admit it to himself, not hear about it but say it and 
believe that it's right. He hasn't come to that just yet, but 
eventually that will occur. I can't tell you when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as much as Young wants to play, he won't ignore a  
recommendation from his doctors to quit if that's what it comes to, 
said his agent, Leigh Steinberg, who is not related to the 
neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Jerry Rice added he believes Young is at the point  
where he, too, needs a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's dealing with the situation pretty well under the  
circumstances,'' Rice said. ``I don't know exactly which direction 
he's going to go but I think he's ready to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who turned 38 Monday, suffered his fourth concussion in  
three years Sept. 27 against Arizona. He was leveled by blitzing 
cornerback Aeneas Williams, and his head struck tackle Dave Fiore's 
knee before slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of the blow left him unconscious for several seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Garcia has started two games in place of the injured Young,  
and will start again Sunday against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Young eventually receives medical clearance, Mariucci  
said he would probably rest him for an additional period of time to 
make sure he's all right. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Young conceded he was bothered by headaches and  
grogginess after trying to resume practice with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest concussion now appears to be the most serious for  
Young, who endured two in 1996 and another in the 1997 season 
opener at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg said he, along with Young's family and some of  
his friends, have been urging Young to retire for the last two 
years, and they renewed their calls in the aftermath of the latest 
concussion.

<HEADLINE> Zip Code Developer Belen Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frederick C. Belen, a former deputy U.S.  
postmaster general during the Johnson administration who helped 
initiate ZIP codes, died Wednesday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Belen, who had Parkinson's disease, died at Arlington Hospital  
in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	He was assistant postmaster general for operations before being  
named to the second-highest job at what then was the Post Office 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Belen chaired the committee whose studies helped initiate and  
oversee automation of the Post Office, using ZIP -- Zoning 
Improvement Plan -- code numbers for towns and cities and a network 
of regional distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Post Office, Belen, a Lansing, Mich., native,  
had been an aide to two Democratic Michigan congressmen, Reps. 
Andrew J. Transue and George D. O'Brien. He was chief counsel and 
staff director of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee 
before being named assistant postmaster general during the Kennedy 
administration. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Boxer Dies After KO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan super bantamweight boxer  
Carlos Barreto died from head injuries received during a bout in 
which he was knocked out, his mother said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreto, 23, an interim World Boxing Association champion, was  
knocked out last Saturday in the 10th round by fellow Venezuelan 
Jose Luis Valbuena in a match for the Latin American super 
bantamweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreto staggered to his corner after a blow from Valbuena,  
became unconscious and fell into a coma. He died Tuesday night 
after efforts by doctors to bring him out of the coma failed, his 
mother, Nora de Barreto, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	De Barreto said her son had been rushed to a public hospital in  
Caracas, but couldn't be treated because of a lack of functioning 
equipment. He was taken to another hospital, but had to wait three 
hours for treatment while the hospital confirmed that the family 
had enough money to pay for treatment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valbuena said the boxers had been friends for several years and  
often trained together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to need a psychologist to be able to live with this  
weight on my shoulders,'' Valbuena said Wednesday, tears dripping 
from his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreto had most recently been ranked No. 5 by the WBA. He had  
fought professionally since 1996, with a 9-3-1 record including 
nine knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the interim WBA champion in his weight category from  
October to November 1998, temporarily holding the title while 
Mexico's Enrique Sanchez recovered from an injury.

<HEADLINE> ETrade Reports Smaller Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- ETrade Group Inc. reported a  
smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss Wednesday as it added 
310,000 customers in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	For the period ending Sept. 30, the nation's second-largest  
Internet brokerage behind Charles Schwab reported a loss of $26.7 
million, or 11 cents a share, compared to a loss of $15.2 million, 
or 8 cents a share for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street had expected ETrade to lose 13 cents a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The company attributed the loss to the costs of building up its  
infrastructure and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade ended the quarter with 1.55 million accounts, up from  
1.24 million accounts in the previous quarter. It was managing 
customer assets of $28 billion, up from $26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage said it spent $79.3 million, or $238 per account,  
in the fourth quarter to gain new customers, many of whom were 
smaller investors shunned by rival online brokerages. Company 
executives said that strategy will position it well for the future 
as those investors make more money and invest more. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said revenue fell 2 percent from the previous  
quarter to $173.2 million, as it cut prices on some active traders' 
transactions in August to $4.95 from $14.95. Customer trades were 
little changed at about 80,350 daily, compared with about 80,600 
the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade executives said the company also will benefit from its  
pending acquisition of online bank Telebanc Financial for $1.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, ETrade lost $54.7 million, or 23 cents  
per share, compared to earnings of $1.69 million, or 1 cent per 
share, in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $621.4 million, up from $335.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	ETrade shares rose 21 7/8 cents to $25.62 1/2 in trading on the  
Nadaq stock market.

<HEADLINE> Grains Lower; Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures inched higher Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as investors closely eyed the drought in 
Brazil. Grain futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans climbed as much as 7 cents a bushel before closing with  
a minimal gain for the day, barely extending their rally of the 
previous two days.

</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.55 1/4 per bushel;  
December corn fell 3/4 cent to $2.00 1/2 per bushel; December oats fell

<HEADLINE> Cancer-Resistant Mice Bred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have created cancer-resistant mice by deleting  
certain genes that govern the formation of blood vessels -- a 
breakthrough that could lead to new drugs for wiping out tumors in 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57 specially bred mice were each injected with 100 million  
tumor cells. Many of them didn't develop cancer at all; others grew 
tumors, but they eventually shrank or didn't spread. Deleting most 
copies of the genes appeared to have no harmful side effects for 
the mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding is the latest advance in one of the most exciting  
and promising areas of cancer research: angiogenesis, or blood 
vessel formation. Scientists are trying to find ways to kill cancer 
by stopping the growth of the blood vessels that nourish tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in one of the most celebrated developments in  
angiogenesis research, Dr. Judah Folkman of Harvard University 
reported that two proteins, angiostatin and endostatin, caused 
tumors in rats to shrink or disappear by cutting off their blood 
supply. Tests on people are about to get under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The mice study, published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, involves two genes called Id1 and Id3 that were found to 
play a vital role in the little-understood process of angiogenesis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very unexpected and significant finding,'' said Luisa  
Iruela-Arispe, a researcher at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer 
Center at the University of California at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the researchers, Robert Benezra, a cell biologist at New  
York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the findings 
could lead to drugs that target tumors by inactivating the genes. 
In particular, the findings could help scientists develop 
treatments that can distingish between normal blood vessels and 
those sprouting from tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	James Pluda, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute,  
said: ``This may be another piece in the puzzle which might bring 
us closer to better understanding the process and therefore coming 
up with better therapeutics for blocking the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists stressed that further research is needed before  
any human applications are developed. For one thing, mice are much 
simpler creatures than humans. And the cancer-resistant mice were 
injected with malignant cells; they did not develop cancer 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't go around injecting themselves with 100 million  
tumor cells,'' Benezra said. ``Rather, they develop these tumors as 
a result of genetic disposition or mutation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are now breeding mice that develop cancer naturally.  
Such experiments will help determine whether the Id genes play a 
role in these situations, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sloan-Kettering researchers stumbled on the role of genes in  
angiogenesis while they were investigating their place in the brain 
development of mouse embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Each mouse has two Id1 genes and two Id3 genes -- one copy of  
each gene is inherited from each parent. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers first tried to breed rodents lacking all four  
genes. But they found that the growth of brain cells and blood 
vessels stopped early, and the embryos died before birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they tried deleting three of the four genes. These mice  
were then injected with breast cancer and lymphoma cells, and none 
developed tumors, unlike normal mice given the same shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The specially bred mice also were injected with lung cancer  
cells and developed tumors that failed to spread because they 
lacked well-developed blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	To further test their theory, the researchers took samples from  
brain cancer patients and found that they had heightened levels of 
proteins created by Id1 and Id3. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Id genes do not appear to play a role in adult  
development, it is possible that any drugs that inactivate the 
genes will have little or no side effects in people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see them at very high levels during embryonic development,  
but in the adult they're at extremely low levels,'' Benezra said. 
``We have a good chance of developing a drug that doesn't have side 
effects because the protein is not expressed in adults.''

<HEADLINE> UAW Allows Ford To Spin Off Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- As workers at General Motors Corp. ratified a new  
four-year agreement Wednesday, union leaders at Ford Motor Co. 
approved a new contract that guarantees jobs for about 23,500 
workers at Ford parts plants even if Ford turns its parts division 
into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can spin off the plants, but they can't spin off the  
people,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich said in a summary of the 
tentative four-year deal between the UAW and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's Ford executive council unanimously recommended the  
deal; voting by about 100,000 workers is scheduled to end Oct. 24. 
Most of the terms mirror those agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler 
AG -- 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350 signing bonus and 
improvements in pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's biggest problem in this year's negotiations was Ford's  
plans to sell or spin off its Visteon Automotive Systems, just as 
GM did with its Delphi Automotive Systems last year. The theory is 
that the parts divisions need more business than GM or Ford alone 
can provide, but other companies would not work with them unless 
they were independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said under the deal, workers at Visteon will remain  
Ford employees for life -- with Ford paychecks and pensions -- if 
Visteon becomes independent. Those workers would also be free to 
transfer back and forth between Ford and Visteon. 
</P>
<P>
	New workers at Visteon will be covered by an agreement that  
mirrors the one the UAW has with Ford; that arrangement will 
continue for two contracts after the new deal between the union and 
Ford expires. Similar terms were negotiated in the contracts 
between GM, Delphi and the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said the Visteon arrangement was ``a very emotional  
issue'' for the union. Before the contract, the UAW had opposed the 
move, fearing it would lead to lower pay and fewer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Visteon, a lot of people had a lot of things to say about  
what was going to happen,'' Yokich said. ``I think thanks to our 
team ... we made a hell of an agreement for Ford and Chrysler and 
GM. We're very happy with it and I think the membership is very 
happy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said 77 percent of the GM and Delphi workers who voted  
approved the deal. The contracts cover 185,000 hourly and salaried 
workers at GM and Delphi; vote totals were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler workers ratified their contract in September.  
</P>
<P>
	The deals with the automakers include several terms aimed at  
strengthening the union. All the companies pledged to take a 
neutral stance toward union organizing drives, and to not take work 
away from a supplier whose factories organize unions. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, GM and Delphi agreed not to spin off any  
division into a separate business or close or sell any factories. 
The UAW said Ford had suggested three plants in Ohio could close, 
but promised instead to send new work there. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts also include agreements on staffing. For example,  
if employment drops below 80 percent of a set level in a bargaining 
unit, the automakers must replace each job lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi contract allows workers to transfer back to GM when  
openings occur, and gives them until Jan. 1 to retire with GM 
pensions. If Delphi goes out of business during the contract, the 
workers' layoff benefits would come from GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts also improve pensions -- an important goal for the  
UAW's autoworker membership, about half of whom are eligible to 
retire in five years -- increased the lump sum payment retirees 
would get based on inflation.

<HEADLINE> AL Playoffs: Ribs, Arms and Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Red Sox fans look at history and get  
scared, the New York Yankees look at this Boston team and worry. 
</P>
<P>
	They worry about all those runs the Red Sox scored against  
Cleveland, 
</P>
<P>
	They worry about facing Pedro Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
	They worry their traditional rival might finally trip them up.  
</P>
<P>
	``They ought to be playing the Jets or somebody, the way they're  
scoring,'' said Paul O'Neill, who plans to play tonight, fractured 
rib and all. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Championship Series begins at Yankee Stadium with Orlando  
``El Duque'' Hernandez pitching for the World Series champions 
against Kent Mercker. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Kent Mercker.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was getting to start by default,'' said Mercker,  
chased by Cleveland after 1 2-3 innings in Game 4 Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox fans assume the worst, especially against the Yankees.  
They remember how Thurman Munson and Reggie Jackson kept Carlton 
Fisk and the great Boston teams of the late 1970s out of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '70s, there was some hatred among the players: Munson  
didn't like Fisk, Fisk didn't like Munson, the Yankees didn't like 
Bill Lee,'' said Yankees coach Don Zimmer, who managed those Boston 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not there anymore,'' Zimmer said Tuesday. ``I hate to  
use the word, but there is some hatred between the two clubs. The 
way I'm reading the papers now, there may be some between the Mets 
and Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many New York players didn't think Boston would make the  
playoffs, and few thought the Red Sox would overcome Cleveland, 
especially after losing the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They take advantage of whatever weakness they may happen to  
spy on any particular day,'' New York manager Joe Torre said. ``I 
was one of them that thought Toronto was going to pass them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston was 8-4 against New York this year, one of only three  
teams to win the season series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a good lineup,'' New York shortstop Derek Jeter  
said. ``They have a team that scraps for runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Yankees' compliments, Boston said New York is a  
clear favorite to go win its third AL pennant in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a source of motivation to try to prove everybody wrong.  
It is obvious we are an underdog,'' Mercker said. ``We were an 
underdog against Cleveland, but as long as 25 guys and five coaches 
in that clubhouse don't believe that, there is no situation -- you 
are down five runs early, everyone thinks we are supposed to be 
down five runs, so what do we got to lose?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As is usual, the Yankees seemed more concerned about themselves  
than their opponent, convinced that if they play to their 
potential, they can't be beat. After all, they've won 10 straight 
postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees swept Texas in the first round, holding the  
Rangers to a grand total of one run for the second straight year, 
the Red Sox lost the first two games against Cleveland, then won 
three straight, 9-3, 23-7 and 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston outscored Cleveland 47-32. But here's the bad news for  
the Red Sox: Excluding the 10 shutout innings by Pedro Martinez, 
Boston had a 7.83 team ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 3-0 with a 0.41 in three career postseason starts,  
was 2-1 with a 2.70 ERA against Boston during the regular season 
after going 1-0 versus the Red Sox last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no difference if you beat a team up in the regular  
season or they beat you up,'' Jeter said. ``It's a whole different 
intensity level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of intensity, O'Neill is baseball's most prominent  
example. When it's the postseason, no Gatorade jug or water cooler 
is safe when he strikes out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he learned that he has a fractured rib from an Oct. 2  
collision with a fence in foul territory at Tampa Bay, and the 
Yankees worried whether he would be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who sat out Saturday's first-round clincher at Texas,  
took about two dozens swings during batting practice Tuesday and 
more in a cage underneath the stands at Yankee Stadium, then 
pronounced himself ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I wake up tomorrow and have a big setback, then  
everything is go at this point,'' said O'Neill, who hit .298 with 
six RBIs against Boston this year. ``If we were an hour from the 
game right now, I am pretty sure that Joe would have me in the 
lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* David Cone, who didn't pitch in the first round because of  
New York's sweep, will start Game 2 Thursday against Ramon 
Martinez. Roger Clemens starts Game 3 Saturday against Pedro 
Martinez at Fenway Park, and Andy Pettitte starts Game 4 Sunday 
against Bret Saberhagen. ... Boston cut RHP Tim Wakefield and RHP 
John Wasdin from its active roster and added RHP Bryce Florie and 
RHP Pat Rapp. ... New York's two candidates to replace O'Neill both 
struggled against the Red Sox. Shane Spencer was 2-for-18 and Ricky 
Ledee 1-for-8.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Electronics Posts Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. lost $29.6  
million in the third quarter, mainly because of expenses from its 
acquisition of two satellite-TV rivals and higher satellite costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 amounted to 13  
cents a share, and compared with a $42.9 million profit, or 11 
cents a share, in the same period a year ago, Hughes reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Motors subsidiary, whose operations include the  
nation's biggest satellite-television service, had revenues of 
$1.99 billion, up from $1.51 billion in the same quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said much of the loss resulted from its recent purchase  
of Primestar and United States Satellite Broadcasting, which merged 
with the company's DirecTV satellite-TV business. The number of 
DirecTV subscribers rose to 7.7 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by the acquisitions, DirecTV's revenues increased to $1.05  
billion, up from $408 million in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the best quarter ever for new DirecTV subscriber  
additions in the United States,'' said Michael Smith, Hughes 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for Hughes' satellite systems dropped to $510.8  
million, down from $688.9 million in the same period last year. 
Higher capital expenses in Hughes' satellite services division 
contributed to the quarterly loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest expenses also contributed to the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Hughes lost $43.6  
million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a $143.5 million, or 36 
cents per share, profit for the same time in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues came to $5.22 billion, up from $4.17  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Dale Evans Admitted to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- Western movie legend Dale Evans was in  
serious but stable condition today after having her pacemaker 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 86, underwent the procedure Tuesday evening at Loma Linda  
University Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show she may have suffered a mild heart attack, said her  
grandson, Dustin Rogers. He said she is feisty and eager to leave 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing real well,'' he said. ``Her spirits are really  
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was admitted to Desert Valley Hospital on Monday and  
transferred Tuesday to be closer to her cardiologist, Rogers said. 
She suffered a stroke in 1996 and a heart attack in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans' illness may have been prompted by a diet change and  
exhaustion from attending a Lone Pine film festival last weekend, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans starred in 35 movies and a 1950s television series with  
her husband Roy Rogers and co-wrote his theme song ``Happy Trails 
to You.'' She has also written dozens of inspirational books and 
hosts a cable television talk show on the Trinity Broadcast 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband died in 1998 from congestive heart failure at 86.

<HEADLINE> MTV's TRL at Center of Teen Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As host of MTV's ``Total Request Live,'' Carson  
Daly is at ground zero every day of a booming new teen-age culture. 
It made him interested in talking with someone who stood there 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly called the ageless wonder himself, Dick Clark, to set up an  
appointment when he was in Los Angeles recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carson Daly! You're the man!'' the former ``American  
Bandstand'' leader greeted his 26-year-old heir apparent, before 
settling down to chat about what happens when hormones and the hot 
lights of television intersect. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a year on the air, ``TRL'' is the force behind an MTV  
ratings renaissance. More than one million youngsters tune in at 
3:30 p.m. each weekday to hear their favorite music -- and often 
hundreds of fans turn up on the Times Square street below MTV's 
studio to gape at Daly and his guests. 
</P>
<P>
	The program's format is simple: viewers vote on their favorite  
videos, and ``TRL'' counts down the top 10 every afternoon. Fans 
``shout out'' tributes, either on camera from Times Square or the 
studio audience, or through phone calls and e-mail. Their favorite 
musicians often stop in, usually on days their new discs ``drop'' 
in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The lingo may change, but everything else sounds familiar.  
</P>
<P>
	Most ``Total Request Live'' fans will stare blankly at any  
mention of ``American Bandstand,'' the daily, then weekly, house 
party for teen-agers that aired nationally from 1957 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of both shows is the energy and excitement of young  
music fans. ``TRL'' does today what ``American Bandstand'' used to 
-- it lets kids know what their peers are wearing, what they are 
listening to and how they talk. It gives their heroes a chance to 
speak directly to people buying their music or seeing their movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the music itself, the most obvious difference between  
the two shows is the direct impact MTV fans have on what is played 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and the ``TRL'' studio audience doesn't dance -- even if  
there's a good beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets my blood pumping,'' said Dave Willey, 17, of  
Hicksville, N.Y., as he sat in MTV's intimate studio to watch a 
show one day this fall. ``Britney Spears, she's so hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So hot, and so near. The former Mouseketeer turned teen diva is  
the guest host this day, filling in for Daly. Melissa Joan Hart, 
star of ``Sabrina, the Teen-age Witch,'' is her co-host. 
</P>
<P>
	Duties include bantering with rappers Redman and Method Man, who  
have new music to promote. They play a millisecond-long sound bite 
from a current song, and a call-in viewer identifies the artist as 
Kid Rock. Spears says she takes no offense at a Blink 182 video 
that spoofs her own work, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	While videos play, Spears and Hart peer through the window at  
about 300 fans on the street below, most fruitlessly pleading to be 
let up. ``Britney and Melissa, you drive us crazy!'' says a sign 
carried by one boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like it because it's live,'' said Steve Demko, a college  
student from New Jersey who came in to Times Square with his 
buddies, Chris Sorber and Brian Mieczkowski, to stand on the street 
and look up at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Spears and Hart were their main motivations -- two came to see  
Britney, one to see Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	When the taping is over, Spears puts on her game face, talking  
earnestly with a reporter about why ``Total Request Live'' is so 
cool, and so important for burgeoning teen idols. 
</P>
<P>
	As she speaks, Hart comes up from behind to tug on Britney's  
sleeve. She has a question that just won't wait. What are you 
wearing to tonight's movie premiere? 
</P>
<P>
	Both may be successful businesswomen, but they're still young.  
</P>
<P>
	``Total Request Live'' caught the wave of young fans who have  
made Spears and the Backstreet Boys stars, a new generation eager 
for their own heroes. Since the audience determines the ``TRL'' 
playlist every day, the show is guaranteed to reflect what's hot 
minute-by-minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Because ``TRL'' serves a wide constituency, a typical show  
careens from style to style in a way few radio stations would dare: 
the blue-eyed soul of 'N Sync bumps against the corrosive metal of 
Korn, which segues into the rap of Warren G. 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans are hungry for variety, said Tom Calderone, MTV's  
senior vice president of music and talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think five years ago you could have had Stone Temple  
Pilots and Coolio on the same show and have it work,'' he said. 
``Now you can have Jay-Z and Limp Bizkit on the same show and it 
does work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers, he said, '' have surprised us on many occasions. They  
really are just as risk-taking in their music choices on `TRL' as 
we are as a music channel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show is a virtual community to fans who expect an  
interactive experience, said Brian Graden, MTV's executive vice 
president for programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Graden wanted a music show that gives viewers a chance to relax  
after school and before homework. It began informally -- Daly 
introducing videos while standing on a boardwalk -- and has taken 
over MTV's storefront studio as viewership increased exponentially. 
MTV this summer expanded ``TRL'' from an hour to 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was plucked from a job as an overnight DJ at a Los Angeles  
radio station to become MTV's latest heartthrob. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really host the show,'' he said. ``I'm just engulfed  
in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His deadpan demeanor leaves it up to the audience to figure out  
whether he likes what he's presenting or not. He has his favorites, 
but he won't let on. His comments don't bite; if some of his 
viewers love a talentless singing group, who is he to insult them? 
</P>
<P>
	``He has an ability to be reverential without being fawning,''  
Graden said. ``That whole mold of interviewers who fawn 
excessively, I don't think it passes muster today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television executives now call him for advice, anxious to hear  
what he thinks makes today's teen-agers tick. 
</P>
<P>
	For MTV's trend-conscious audience, ``Total Request Live'' has  
the potential to be a franchise. That's important for a network 
with a lot of programming that burns bright and fades fast. Where 
have you gone, Beavis? 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, a ``Total Request Live'' fan who outgrows the  
show will quickly be replaced by someone younger, with another set 
of likes and dislikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always going to change,'' Calderone said. ``It's not  
going to be stale.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain dominated basketball for  
decades, setting records that will probably stand forever and even

</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, the 7-foot-1 center who once scored 100 points in a

in any sport, died at his Bel-Air home Tuesday. He was 63.

	``Wilt was the greatest offensive player I have ever seen,''  
said Bill Russell, Chamberlain's greatest rival and the center for 
the championship Boston Celtics of the '60s. ``Because his talent 
and skills were so super human, his play forced me to play at my 
highest level. If I didn't, I'd risk embarrassment and our team 
would likely lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was found dead in his bed at his Bel-Air home at  
about 12:30 p.m. PDT, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs he might have had a heart attack, authorities  
said. Chamberlain was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat in 
1992, and his agent, Sy Goldberg, said the Hall of Famer was on 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired in 1973, Chamberlain had more points and more  
rebounds than any NBA player, and he will always be remembered for 
epic battles against Russell and the Celtics. Chamberlain, 4 inches 
taller than Russell, often seemed to be viewed as the villain in 
his classic matchups against the Celtics' center. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Lakers' teammate Jerry West said he once told  
Chamberlain, ``Nobody roots for Goliath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Auerbach, coach of those great Boston teams, admired  
Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain had a great deal to do with the success of  
the NBA,'' Auerbach said. ``His dominance, power, demeanor and the 
rivalry with Bill Russell says it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain starred in the NBA from 1959 through 1973, when he  
played for the Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, 
76ers and Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 31,419 points during his career, a record until Kareem  
Abdul-Jabbar broke it in 1984. Chamberlain never fouled out in 
1,205 regular-season and playoff games and he holds the record for 
career rebounding with 23,924. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see  
another one like him,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, an NBA rookie 11 years after Chamberlain  
retired, said: ``His legacy as one of the NBA's greatest players 
and his achievements will stand for all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who began his professional career with the Harlem  
Globetrotters in 1958, was one of only two men to win the MVP and 
rookie of the year awards in the same season (1959-60). He was also 
MVP in 1966 through 1968. He led the NBA in scoring seven straight 
seasons, 1960-66, and led the league in rebounding 11 of his 14 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We truly lost one of the icons of professional basketball and,  
more importantly for myself, someone who I've known for almost 40 
years,'' said a teary-eyed West, now the Lakers vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chamberlain retired, he made news of a different sort,  
stirring controversy -- and a litany of jokes -- by claiming in his 
1991 biography that he had had sex with 20,000 women, averaging 1.2 
a day from the time he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	His boast sparked wide reaction and became a sort of standard  
for extreme sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic Johnson, who revealed shortly after the book was published  
that he had contracted the AIDS virus. Johnson commented, ``I'm no 
Wilt Chamberlain, but as I traveled around NBA cities, I was never 
at a loss for female companionship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was such a force that the NBA changed some of its  
rules, including widening the lane to try to keep him and his 
finger-roll farther away from the goal. He also prompted the sport 
to institute offensive goaltending and revise rules governing 
inbounding the ball and shooting free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	His most famous record is the 100 points he scored in the  
Philadelphia Warriors' 169-147 defeat of the New York Knicks on 
March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 12 years in his armpits, and I always carried that  
100-point game on my shoulders,'' Darrall Imhoff, the former Knicks 
center, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I got my third foul, I said to one of the officials,  
Willy Smith, 'Why don't you just give him 100 points and we'll all 
go home?' Well, we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain also holds the single-game record for rebounds, 55,  
against the Russell-led Celtics in 1960. He averaged 30.1 points in 
his career, including a record 50.4 in the 1961-62 season with 
Philadelphia. He also was one of the most versatile big men ever, 
with an NBA-high 702 assists in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain led his team into the NBA playoffs 13 times, but won  
just two championships. The first came in 1966-67 with the 
Philadelphia 76ers, the second in 1971-72 with the Lakers, who won 
a record 33 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams lost in the finals four other times and were beaten in  
the conference final six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell and the Celtics almost always seemed to be the stoppers  
for Chamberlain-led teams, beating them twice in the championship 
series and five times in the conference finals. Three times, a 
series was decided by a seventh game that Boston won by either one 
or two points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many have called our competition the greatest rivalry in the  
history of sports,'' Russell said. ``We didn't have a rivalry; we 
had a genuinely fierce competition that was based on friendship and 
respect. We just loved playing against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fierceness of the competition bonded us as friends for  
eternity. We loved competition. Wilt loved competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born Aug. 21, 1936, in  
Philadelphia and didn't play basketball until he was in seventh 
grade. He grew 4 inches in three months when he was 15 and was 6-11 
when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading Overbrook to three public school championships and  
two all-city titles, Chamberlain became one of the most recruited 
players ever as more than 200 colleges expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the University of Kansas and Hall of Fame coach Phog  
Allen. In his first game against the Kansas varsity -- freshmen 
weren't allowed to compete against other teams then -- he scored 50 
points before a packed Allen Fieldhouse crowd of more than 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Chamberlain scored 52 points against Northwestern  
in his first game, a total he never surpassed in college, partly 
because of zone defenses designed to keep him from getting the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sophomore, he led the 1957 Jayhawks to the NCAA tournament  
finals, where Kansas lost to unbeaten North Carolina in triple 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by the smothering zone defenses, Chamberlain left  
Kansas after his junior year and went barnstorming with the 
Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, extremely agile for his size, ran cross-country in  
high school and was an outstanding high jumper and shot-putter at 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained active after his NBA career and was considered an  
outstanding volleyball player. He also ran in the Honolulu marathon 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Chamberlain made his first official visit to  
Kansas since his college career ended 40 years earlier. His jersey 
was raised to the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned in life that you have to take the bitter with the  
sweet, and how sweet this is,'' Chamberlain said at the ceremony, 
obviously touched. 
</P>
<P>
	West knew that side of him.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a smart guy, he was well-read. He was an authority on  
everything. He had this bluster about him,'' West said. ``And on 
the inside, he was a soft guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain is survived by sisters Barbara Lewis, Margaret Lane,  
Selina Gross and Yvonne Chamberlain, and brothers Wilbert and 
Oliver Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are pending.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Rises on Brazil Drought Fear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Alarm that a Brazilian drought may have already harmed next  
year's coffee crop sent coffee futures skyrocketing 24 percent 
Wednesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, crude oil rose more than 3 percent after a  
report showed a dramatic decrease in stockpiles, and lumber futures 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee trading saw a record volume in New York as futures buyers  
drove up the market wildly. They were responding to weather 
forecasts that showed no significant rain in sight for key growing 
regions of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a bottom of 80 cents a pound on Oct. 1, when a  
bumper crop of 40 million 60-kilogram bags was expected, coffee has 
soared to its highest price level in four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for December delivery rose 22.80 cents during Wednesday's  
frantic session, closing at $1.1935 a pound. It's up 40 percent for 
the week as more and more speculative firms that had sold coffee 
futures short -- a bet prices will fall -- were forced to buy futures 
to cancel out their previous sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In short selling, traders borrow a commodity and sell it, hoping  
to buy it back later at a lower price, repay the loan and pocket 
the difference. If the price rises instead, the trader must quickly 
buy the commodity to minimize losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a helluva day,'' said Jack Scoville, an analyst in  
Chicago for the Price Futures Group. ``There's definitely going to 
be some damage in Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest prognosis for the 2000-2001 crop is 30 million bags --  
down by a quarter -- because the lack of precipitation comes at a 
critical time, when coffee trees should be flowering and moisture 
is needed in order for the beans to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``That amount of loss (10 million bags) is equal roughly to the  
entire export production of Colombia,'' Scoville said. ``Is all 
that coffee lost? Maybe not, if rains start soon. Nobody can know 
until we get to the end of the year, to the harvest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian drought also has driven up prices for soybeans,  
sugar and orange juice, to a lesser extent. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee drinkers won't necessarily see higher prices for coffee  
or beans -- not yet. Scoville says if the dry spell ends soon, it 
won't have much long-term effect at all, but if prices remain this 
high or go higher coffee consumers would likely feel the effects 
within three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude extended its rally to a third straight day on the heels of  
last week's 16 percent price plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving the market Wednesday were American Petroleum Institute  
data, released late the previous day, showing that U.S. crude 
supplies fell 2.3 percent last week to 298.9 million barrels -- 
their lowest level in 25 months. Also, traders were watching the 
development of tropical storm Irene in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas intermediate crude oil for November delivery rose 76  
cents to $23.06 a barrel; November heating oil rose 1.71 cents to 
59.61 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 0.70 cent to 
63.70 cents a gallon; November natural gas rose 4.3 cents to $2.97 
per million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	North Sea Brent crude oil for November delivery rose 17 cents to  
$22.22 a barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, November lumber futures rose  
the daily trading limit of $10 to close at $296.10 per 1,000 board 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said technical reasons were behind the buying  
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Others cited President Clinton's announcement of the  
preservation of 40 million acres of federally owned forest in 35 
states as protected areas, although its effect on the industry 
wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the U.S. timber industry works off privately held lands.

	John Lithgow won the award for best actor in a comedy at this  
year's Emmys. It was his third award for the NBC sitcom ``3rd Rock 
From the Sun.'' Lithgow joked: ``I really don't know why I have won 
this. As far as I can tell, every actor in this town thinks what I 
do on `3rd Rock' is completely disgraceful.'' Lithgow was born on 
Oct. 19, 1945.

	Sony Pictures Classics will distribute ``Est-Ouest,'' a  
French-Russian film that stars Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine 
Bonnaire. The film was shown at this year's Toronto Film Festival. 
Deneuve was born on Oct. 22, 1943. 

</P>

	Actor Jean-Claude Van Damme wants to remake his image. ``I have  
to reinvent the brand name, because I'm a brand name,'' says Van 
Damme, who was born on Oct. 18, 1960. Van Damme was back in 
theaters this summer with ``Universal Soldier: The Return,'' a 
sequel. His other movies include ``Bloodsport,'' ``Kickboxer,'' 
``Double Impact,'' ``Hard Target'' and ``Sudden Death.'' The 
Belgian-born star is a former European middleweight karate 
champion. ``I'll be successful no matter what because you cannot 
stop a guy who believes in himself,'' Van Damme says. ``If I don't 
make it in a movie, I can be the new guy on TV. I can do, like, a 
romantic James Bond, French-accented comedy like `To Catch a 
Thief.' And people will say, `Hey, cool guy!'''

<HEADLINE> Web Health Cos. Seek Ethics Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading Internet health companies said Wednesday  
they want to avert government regulation by developing their own 
standards for content, sponsorship and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general who owns part of  
drkoop.com, joined representatives from about a dozen Web firms to 
begin hammering out an ethics policy. Although no agreement was 
reached, participants said Tuesday night's meeting among fierce 
competitors was a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that you can have a group of industry leaders get  
together to talk about the problems is significant,'' said Joel A. 
Kahn, chief medical officer for the InteliHealth site, a joint 
venture between Aetna U.S. Healthcare and Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now, he said, is where the group heads.  
Participants set no timetable and made no decisions on how broad or 
how focused the guidelines should be. 
</P>
<P>
	George Lundberg, editor in chief for the Medscape information  
site, said the group may draw on existing standards for medical 
journals, businesses and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry wants to demonstrate that it could police itself,  
Lundberg said. He was fired as editor of the Journal of the 
American Medical Association for publishing a survey on sexual 
attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Fulton, a spokeswoman for drkoop.com, said Koop  
convened and facilitated the meeting because he felt the industry 
needed to address ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Web sites, including Koop's, have come under criticism for  
failing to fully disclose sponsorship. For a time, Koop was 
entitled to a commission on products sold through his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say that sites containing misleading information  
ultimately harm patients and the rest of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Intel Corp. and the American Medical Association  
addressed concerns about privacy by announcing ways to verify 
online the identities of doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Helga Rippen, chairwoman for the Internet Healthcare Coalition,  
may seek to include participants from academia and other sectors. 
Her coalition plans a summit in February to draft guidelines.

<HEADLINE> CDC Sorry for Diverting Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The director of the Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention has admitted his agency made ``serious mistakes'' by 
spending millions of dollars meant for studying chronic fatigue 
syndrome on other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Koplan apologized and promised a ``reinvigorated  
effort'' to study chronic fatigue, which leaves some people so 
drained they can't perform simple tasks. Some rarely leave their 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, an audit showed the CDC had received $22.7  
million from Congress for chronic fatigue research, but less than 
half the money was used for that purpose. At least $8.8 million was 
spent on other programs and $4.1 million could not be accounted 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear to all of us that we, CDC, have made serious  
mistakes and have done so for several years,'' Koplan told 16 
chronic fatigue patients and their advocates at agency headquarters 
in Atlanta. ``I apologize to each of you personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CDC officials have not explained why the money was diverted.  
</P>
<P>
	The agency has promised to restore $12.9 million for chronic  
fatigue studies over the next four years, but patients say the 
slight was about more than money. They believe the CDC's action 
reinforced a perception among some doctors that their illness is a 
mental problem, an excuse for laziness or even a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is credibility,'' said Bob Mulligan of Smyrna, who  
says he's been ill for 13 years. ``You tell your friends, `I've got 
CFS,' they say, `I'm tired too sometimes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of patients here feel it speaks as a derision to  
the disease -- `Is there such a thing as CFS?''' added Jonathan 
Sterling of Oradell, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling said he had to quit his job as principal of a junior  
high school after he became ill 10 years ago. He said getting on a 
plane to Atlanta was an ordeal in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers don't know what causes the syndrome, when it began,  
how many people have it or how many new cases crop up each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC is almost three years into a study in Wichita, Kan., and  
estimates that about one-fourth of 1 percent of the population 
there suffers from chronic fatigue. The CDC says it mainly affects 
middle-aged, white women. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Reeves, the branch chief in the CDC's National  
Center for Infectious Diseases who blew the whistle on the funding 
diversion, said the agency is keeping track of the Wichita 
residents in the study to see if some people recover from CFS or if 
new cases develop. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC also plans a national survey to see if illnesses  
nationwide match the results of the Wichita study.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Man Guilty in Torture Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was found guilty of  
murder, torture and kidnapping for the slaying of an acquaintance 
who was forced to eat glass, prodded with electricity, stapled 
through the ears and burned alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Lyn Davis, of Lawndale, was found guilty Tuesday by  
Superior Court Judge James Cloninger. 
</P>
<P>
	The charred remains of Anthony Guest, 20, of Redondo Beach, were  
found in 1996, under bushes at a recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had waived his right to a jury trial. Cloninger based his  
verdict on grand jury transcripts and testimony from the murder 
trial of co-defendant Spencer Brasure. 
</P>
<P>
	Brasure was sentenced to death after he was convicted of murder  
with special circumstances, torture and threatening witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who said Brasure was the instigator, did not seek  
the death penalty for Davis. At sentencing on Nov. 16, Davis faces 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Willard Wiksell said he would appeal a ruling  
by the judge that allowed a police confession to be used against 
his client. 
</P>
<P>
	A motive for the slaying was never determined.

<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms moved into portions of New York this  
morning and clouds increased over the rest of the Northeast. Rain 
fell in the western Great Lakes, northern Plains and Southeast, 
while mostly clear skies prevailed over much of the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, a cold front was expected to trigger scattered  
showers and thunderstorms over the Northeast, eastern Great Lakes, 
and mid-Atlantic States. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the storms were forecast to be severe across the eastern  
Great Lakes, likely with wind gusts of up to 60 mph and hail up to 
an inch in diameter. Wind gusts of over 30 mph could be expected in 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms also were forecast to develop over parts of the  
Southeast, especially over the Carolinas, where several rivers 
continue above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly cloudy skies and mostly dry, breezy weather was expected  
in the central and southern Plains. A few showers, however, were 
possible over extreme southern Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Another cold front will be responsible for light showers in  
Washington, northern Oregon, northern Idaho, and extreme 
northwestern Montana. Dry conditions were expected over the rest of 
the Rockies and West. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crowds at Hall Pay Respects to Wilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- With flags lowered outside the  
Basketball Hall of Fame, dozens of visitors paid respects to Wilt 
Chamberlain on Wednesday at a special display in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit was quickly assembled following Chamberlain's death  
Tuesday at 63. The memorabilia featured sneakers, jerseys and his 
uniform from his 100-point game in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	A small black wreath and the date of his death were placed  
beneath a silver medallion bearing his likeness. The three flags 
outside the building were lowered. Chamberlain was inducted into 
the shrine in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned by Hall of Fame staffers, about 50 visitors said they  
stopped by specifically to pay tribute to one of basketball's most 
formidable players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted somehow to be close to him,'' said Kimberley Lee,  
a Hall of Fame spokeswoman. ``These are not necessarily basketball 
fanatics, but simply fans of a man who graced courts across America 
with a talent that will probably never be seen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at the Hall will not be totaled until the end of the  
week, but traffic was unusually high for a weekday, Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Girl's Dad Defends Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The father of a 12-year-old who is getting  
financial help from the Roman Catholic Church to dissuade her from 
having an abortion has denied that she is being bribed. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published today, he also said the 15-year-old  
boy who made her pregnant should be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, whose name was not revealed, was quoted as telling  
London's Daily Mail that his daughter has severe learning 
difficulties and a reading age of six, but was adamant about 
keeping the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both my wife and I are very distressed that people think she  
is being bribed to keep her child, which couldn't be further from 
the truth,'' the 35-year-old father, who is Catholic, was quoted as 
saying. ``We vowed to support her whatever decision she came to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has focused attention on a controversial program called  
Pro-Life Initiative. Under the program, Scotland's staunchly 
conservative Cardinal Thomas Winning gives money and other help to 
encourage women not to have abortions. The girls' parents 
approached the program for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement that the Catholic Church was paying the family  
provoked a furious backlash Monday from abortion rights advocates, 
who said it was tantamount to bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl lives in Torbay, in the southwest England county of  
Devon, with her parents. Both the parents are on welfare, and they 
have two other children. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's parents plan to raise the baby, due early next year,  
the father said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl and the 15-year-old boy who impregnated her were pupils  
at a special school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be made an example of. My daughter is 12 years old,  
for God's sake,'' the father was quoted as saying. ``I went down to 
see the boy and his parents, but they don't want to know. His 
mother's exact words were, 'Oh Christ, I've got 18 grandchildren 
already.' It is utterly irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal to have sex with a girl under 16, but Devon police  
said no complaint had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl is the third 12-year-old who has attracted publicity  
here recently for either having a baby or becoming pregnant. 
Britain has Western Europe's highest teen pregnancy rate, and Prime 
Minister Tony Blair has declared a moral crusade to counter the 
problem.

<HEADLINE> Parents Protest Harry Potter Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Some adults here wish Harry Potter would  
just -- poof! -- disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents worried about the influence of the wildly popular Harry  
Potter books by J.K. Rowling have persuaded the state's Board of 
Education to review whether the books should be allowed in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The books have a serious tone of death, hate, lack of respect  
and sheer evil,'' said Elizabeth Mounce of Columbia, one the 
parents who addressed the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state board said it was up to local school boards to decide  
if the books were appropriate, but agreed to review them. 
``Censorship is an ugly word, but it is not as ugly as what I've 
heard this morning,'' said board member Clarence Dickert. 
</P>
<P>
	The three books chart the course of 11-year-old Harry, who  
learns of his famous wizard-family past and is invited to Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-selling novels have cast a spell on young and old  
readers alike: Supportive parents say their preteens are putting 
away the video games and gobbling up the tales of sorcery, magic 
and secret spells. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million hard copies of the books have been sold in  
the United States and millions more are in paperback, said Judy 
Corman, spokeswoman for U.S. publisher Scholastic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think about violence or anything about that,'' said  
Lizzie Allen, 14, of Columbia, who read the first book. ``My mom 
got it for me and said it would be really good. At first, I thought 
is was a little kid's book and then I though 'Wow, this is really 
good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 people waited at a suburban Boston bookstore  
Tuesday to meet Rowling at a book signing. She could not 
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents in South Carolina aren't the only ones who have  
complained about Harry Potter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Marietta, Ga., elementary school principal Jerry Locke  
recently asked a fifth-grade teacher to stop reading the books in 
class until the school decided whether they were appropriate. On 
Tuesday, he cleared one of the books for classroom use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's questionable whether every parent wants their child to  
read or be exposed to books having to do with magic and wizardry,'' 
Locke said. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of parents at a Lakeville, Minn., elementary school  
also objected, but the principal said it was up to teachers whether 
to continue reading Potter's tales to their students. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sioux Falls, S.D., however, sixth-grade reading teacher  
Bonnie Kiesow said she was amazed at the enthusiasm she saw among 
her students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their parents are running all over town trying to find the  
book. I've had kids who said, `My mom couldn't believe it because I 
don't sit down to read for two hours,''' she said. ``This is just 
fun to see.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Soothes Timber Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDISH KNOB OVERLOOK, Va. (AP) -- With the Shenandoah Valley's  
first tinges of fall color for a backdrop, President Clinton said 
Wednesday his sweeping plan to place 40 million acres of federal 
forestland off-limits to development would not harm the timber 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The remote, largely pristine parcels of land Clinton wants to  
preserve represent a mere fraction of federally owned forest, he 
said. Vast reaches of other federal timberland are already 
available for logging and other development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very important to point out that we are not trying to  
turn our national forests into museums,'' Clinton said as he 
detailed a plan environmentalists call progressive and the timber 
industry has called reckless. 
</P>
<P>
	His program would prevent or restrict road-building through the  
larger sections of currently roadless federal forest, most of it in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 5 percent of timber harvested in America comes from  
national forests, and of that amount just 5 percent comes from 
roadless areas, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can easily adjust our federal timber program to replace 5  
percent of 5 percent,'' Clinton said to applause, ``but we can 
never replace what we would destroy if we don't protect these 40 
million acres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roads open forest areas to development, erosion and pollution.  
They also disrupt wildlife, plant life and natural systems. But 
roadless federal land also contains some of the most desirable 
timber owned by the Forest Service. Timber companies and their 
allies in Congress oppose any effort to close off future 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The president took a few swipes at congressional Republicans,  
several of whom have already denounced the forest plan, for what he 
described as shortsighted views on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, the leaders of the Republican majority are  
polluting our spending bills with special interest riders that 
would promote overcutting in our forests, allow mining companies to 
dump more toxic waste on public land and give a huge windfall to 
companies producing oil on federal lands,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also threatened to veto the Interior Department spending  
bill, which controls funding for a host of environmental and 
preservation projects, if Republicans do not amend it to be more 
environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issuing decrees from a mountaintop is not the way democracy is  
supposed to work,'' said Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., whose 
western Virginia district includes the majestic view of the 
Allegheny Mountains Clinton acclaimed as he detailed the forest 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	A section of the surrounding George Washington National Forest  
is among parcels in 35 states that would be protected, the White 
House said. The plan initially affects roadless swaths of 5,000 
acres or more, but could eventually be expanded to include an 
additional 10 million to 15 million acres in parcels smaller than 
5,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the stroke of a pen,'' Goodlatte said, Clinton will  
``circumvent the people's representatives in Congress, who he knows 
would never support such a proposal in the legislative process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forest protection plan requires no congressional action,  
relying on regulations to be issued by the U.S. Forest Service 
after a detailed environmental review and public comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Respect for the environment and for the sanctity of wild places  
should not be a partisan issue, Clinton said. He warmly praised 
Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican president, for the first major 
efforts 90 years ago to create federal forest preserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a monumental moment in conservation and American  
history,'' said Ken Rait, director of the Heritage Forests 
Campaign, a preservationist alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that opponents, reacting to news accounts of the  
plan over the past week, are already predicting ``it is going to 
end the world as we know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative should have almost no impact on the timber  
supply,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, about 18 percent of the 192 million acres of federal  
forest is protected as wilderness. About 60 million acres are 
without roads, or signs of logging, mining and other development.

<HEADLINE> Hirshorn Museum Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton picked an exhibit of  
work by French sculptor Auguste Rodin and his American followers to 
celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Hirshhorn Museum, the part of 
the Smithsonian Institution devoted to modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke to a small group of Hirshhorn devotees Tuesday in the  
sculpture garden she created, a section of the White House grounds 
favored by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Exhibits of modern 
carving there have been one of Mrs. Clinton's favorite projects. 
She spoke in front of a gigantic bronze of Rodin's ``The Thinker'' 
and facing another of his works, ``The Three Shades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're seeing now is our seventh show, which spotlights  
the influence that Rodin has had on 20th century American 
sculpture,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hirshhorn has contributed to many of these shows.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told of President Lyndon Johnson's bid to Joseph H.  
Hirshhorn, a Latvian-born American financier, to donate his huge 
collection for a new national museum, which was built next to the 
popular Air and Space Museum. It opened to the public on Oct. 4, 
1974, one of the world's largest collections of modern art, with 
more than 6,500 paintings and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
	``He insisted that it be free, because he know that the arts are  
central, not peripheral, to our lives,'' she said. ``I know he 
would be pleased by the role that the arts played in everything 
from the development revolution to the revitalization of poetry and 
cinema in so much of the former Soviet Union.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Record Farm Aid Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a  
record $8.7 billion package of emergency farm assistance, the 
second big bailout in as many years for producers clobbered by low 
commodity prices, drought and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices have collapsed, farmers are in desperate trouble and  
there must be a government response,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, 
D-N.D. Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said it was ``a generous 
response to the needs in agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's 74-26 vote sends the package to President Clinton  
for his expected signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of this year's bailout, nearly $3 billion more than  
what Congress approved a year ago, is raising questions about the 
future of the government's market-oriented farm policy. And 
lawmakers may not be through doling out money to farmers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders are considering additional assistance for  
producers whose farms were washed out last month by Hurricane 
Floyd. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., estimated $1 
billion would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	What opposition there was to the package Wednesday came  
primarily from Eastern senators who said it didn't provide enough 
disaster assistance or who wanted authority for New England to 
continue controlling its milk prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While not threatening a veto, the Clinton administration has  
criticized the way the money would be distributed and also wants 
more disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some real issues and real problems with this bill;  
however, there are tremendous immediate needs that farmers are 
facing,'' said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House 
budget office. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he reluctantly supports  
the package but complained that Congress had made ``some of these 
programs unnecessarily complicated. That means we will not be able 
to get some of these payments out as quickly as I would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the package, about $6 billion, is intended  
to help farmers cope with a second year of depressed commodity 
prices, with the bulk of the aid going to the Midwestern Corn Belt. 
Farmers in Iowa would share $610 million, the most of any state, 
followed by Illinois with $535 million, according to the 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides:  
</P>
<P>
	--$1.4 billion for weather-related crop and livestock losses,  
including $200 million earmarked for Eastern livestock producers 
who were hurt by this summer's drought. 
</P>
<P>
	--$328 million to compensate tobacco producers for falling  
cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	--$125 million in subsidies for dairy producers.  
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the legislation extends the government's  
price-support program for dairy products through next year and 
requires meatpackers to start reporting the prices they pay for 
cattle and hogs. Livestock producers say that will make it easier 
for them to bargain with meat processors. 
</P>
<P>
	With this package, direct government payments to farmers are  
expected to reach $21 billion this year, eclipsing the old record 
of $17 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats seized on the size of the bailout to argue that that  
the 1996 Freedom to Farm law isn't working, and even Republicans 
are saying it's time to consider ways to guarantee more help to 
producers when commodity prices fall. Unless the law is changed, 
``we will see year after expensive year in emergency payments,'' 
said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The law ended a Depression-era system of production controls and  
price supports in attempt to get growers to wean farmers from their 
dependence on government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The stockpiles of grain that have kept commodity prices low for  
two years continue to grow and are expected to persist well into 
next year. With USDA predicting only a modest increase in farm 
exports next year, farm groups are likely to be pushing for another 
multibillion-dollar aid package in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later we're going to have to ask the fundamental  
question, 'Is this going to be the only sector of our economy not 
governed by the free market?''' said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the 
National Taxpayers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as Congress regards low prices in agriculture as a  
crisis, taxpayers will be footing the bill forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the Clinton administration hasn't done enough  
to boost farm trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term solution (is) opening up more opportunities for  
our producers to sell their products,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, 
R-Neb. ``The basic underlying principle of Freedom to Farm should 
be preserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first checks to farmers would go out within two weeks or so  
of when the president signs the legislation, according to USDA 
officials. Claims for disaster assistance would take much longer to 
process and may be paid in two installments. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is included in a $69 billion appropriations bill that  
will fund operations of USDA, with its myriad farm and nutrition 
programs, and the Food and Drug Administration for the 2000 budget 
year.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Lottery Referendum Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Gov. Don Siegelman, who lobbied long and  
hard for a state lottery to help fund education, watched the 
measure collapse in defeat at the hands of voters unwilling to 
cross their ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	With 99 percent of precincts reporting, 670,250 votes, or 54  
percent, opposed the lottery referendum Tuesday, and 565,820 votes, 
or 46 percent, supported it. Turnout was estimated at 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal -- a constitutional amendment to allow gambling --  
had once enjoyed a 20-point lead in the polls but came under 
increasing fire from church groups who said it would exploit the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Other opponents also claimed that a recent traffic ticket-fixing  
scandal showed that the Democratic governor's administration could 
not be trusted to oversee gambling in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama joins Arkansas, Oklahoma and North Dakota as states that  
have rejected lotteries at the ballot box. Thirty-seven states and 
the District of Columbia have approved them. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was a stinging blow to Siegelman, who had made the  
referendum's passage a cornerstone of his 1998 election victory 
over Republican Fob James. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my inaugural address, I said that we would dare mighty  
things. I said that we would try new things and if they didn't work 
we would try something else,'' Siegelman said after the votes were 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the results ``only serve to motivate me and to energize  
me in our fight and our quest to change education in this state 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the lottery proposal, two other proposed  
constitutional amendments were on the ballot, and voters in 
Birmingham and Montgomery chose candidates for mayor and city 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
	In Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, interim Mayor William  
Bell led a 14-way race for the mayorship but was forced into a Nov. 
2 runoff against City Councilman Bernard Kincaid. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montgomery, conservative Mayor Emory Folmar led six opponents  
in his bid for a seventh term but was forced into a runoff against 
Bobby Bright, a lawyer backed by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman had promised that the lottery would generate at least  
$150 million annually to fund college scholarships, a 
pre-kindergarten program and computer technology in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has put everything on this,'' said Auburn University at  
Montgomery political analyst Brad Moody. ``He has made it the 
centerpiece of his campaign and the centerpiece of his first year 
in office. He has thrown all his political capital away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Bird was among those who voted against the lottery even  
though her 2-year-old daughter Amanda could have one day benefited 
from the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel like it's morally wrong. I feel like it's going to  
cause problems in lower income families,'' she said. ``I think you 
can get money other ways.''

	Senate Rejects Nuke Test Ban  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today rejected a landmark treaty to  
ban nuclear testing by a vote of 48-51, much to the chagrin of 
President Clinton. As expected, the final vote closely followed 
party lines, with only four Republicans voting for the treaty. 
Democrats vowed to make the rejection a prime 2000 campaign issue, 
claiming polls show most Americans favor such a ban. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the pact ``fatally 
flawed.''

	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- After a 13-month investigation, a grand  
jury decided there was insufficient evidence to indict anyone in 
the JonBenet Ramsey slaying, District Attorney Alex Hunter 
announced today. The crime had set off a long, controversial search 
for her killer. The prominence of the 6-year-old girl's family -- 
the father the millionaire president of Access Graphics, the mother 
a former Miss West Virginia -- and the beauty contest background of 
the young victim brought worldwide attention to the case for nearly 
three years.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Tobacco Cos, Inc., is  
acknowledging publicly that tobacco isn't safe. The company, in an 
effort to remake its corporate image, has launched a corporate Web 
site stating ``there is no 'safe' cigarette'' and that ``cigarette 
smoking is addictive, as that term is most commonly used today.'' 
Philip Morris, which for years disputed research that found smoking 
contributed to medical problems, also acknowledged that smokers 
face tremendous health hazards.

<HEADLINE> Fox Ups Ante on TV Game Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Would you turn on a friend -- on national  
television -- if $2 million was at stake? 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is betting you will, since that's the premise behind  
``Greed,'' a new prime-time game show it hopes to air for at least 
three weeks beginning Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is rushing ``Greed'' through production to be ready  
for the ratings sweeps in November and to beat the stampede of 
network producers developing game shows to capitalize on the 
success of ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time there are five or six of them on the air, they  
won't be as special,'' Mike Darnell, the Fox executive in charge of 
specials, said Wednesday. ``By being second on the air with this, 
we could have an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each show will have a team of five players, who initially work  
together to answer questions on popular culture that start easy and 
get progressively more difficult. As the stakes rise, participants 
can either work as a team to win prizes or compete against each 
other to win more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tongue-in-cheek,'' said show producer Dick Clark, who  
added that a deal with a potential host for the program hasn't been 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will run at least three consecutive Thursdays at 9  
p.m., for either an hour or half hour. Two Fox shows that are 
suffering in the ratings, ``Family Guy'' and ``Action,'' will be 
temporarily shelved. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is bringing back ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and host  
Regis Philbin for a limited November run. Game shows in the works 
at other networks include ``Survivor,'' a CBS series about 16 
people left on a tropical island to fend for themselves, with the 
winner earning $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Rare Ptolemy Book Found in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A 15th-century atlas and 10 other rare  
books that disappeared from a Polish library have been found at an 
auction house in Germany, Polish and German officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was a copy of astronomer Ptolemy's ``Cosmografia,''  
published in 1483 and valued at $670,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reiss and Sohn auction house in Koenigstein an Taunus, near  
Frankfurt, confirmed that Polish experts, working with German 
prosecutors, identified the books this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Library records, descriptions, microfilm and copies were used to  
identify the works, said Zbigniew Pietrzyk, director of the special 
historical collection at the Jagiellonian Library in Krakow, 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had no doubt,'' Pietrzyk said. ``This is a great joy.''  
</P>
<P>
	The books were among 51 reported missing from the Krakow library  
last April. 
</P>
<P>
	The books at Reiss and Sohn had been due to be sold at auction  
Oct. 20-21. The Frankfurt prosecutors' office confiscated them last 
week to allow Polish officials to examine them. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the books left the Krakow library and reached  
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office, Job Tilmann,  
said there were no plans to pursue any charges against the auction 
house.

	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Rhett Warrener has agreed to a two-year  
contract with the Buffalo Sabres worth about $1.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Serena Calls 'Men' Comment a Joke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Serena Williams' eyes sparkled and a big smile  
creased her face when she was asked about playing in a men's tennis 
tournament because ``women's tennis is boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never made that quote,'' the U.S. Open women's singles  
champion said when asked about a story out of Germany last week. 
``I never said anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the story, Williams said she could ``beat the men''  
and asked for a wild card entry into a tournament in Stuttgart, 
Germany, later this month. Markus Gunthard, director of the 
tournament, said Williams had asked him for a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how serious she is. I told her that if she was  
serious, she should apply in writing,'' Gunthard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Wednesday to promote next month's Chase  
Championships, Williams said it was a joke that got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting with the tournament director and asked him for a  
wild card,'' she said. ``He said, `I'm going to announce it.' It 
was all done in fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quote about ``women's tennis is boring,'' she said was not  
from her. 
</P>
<P>
	``No media ever came to me and asked if I said it. I never said  
anything like that,'' she said. ``Women's tennis is exciting, what 
with all the good, young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men's tennis is boring, not women's tennis.''  
</P>
<P>
	Besides, she said, it would be no contest if she played in a  
men's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really have a lot of confidence, but I couldn't beat the top  
men's players,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would probably draw Mark Philippoussis in the first round. A  
10-minute match. Or Andre (Agassi). I wouldn't show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as being in the media spotlight, Williams says she  
expects it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're winning, you have to be comfortable with it. It  
comes with the package.''

<HEADLINE> Gland Transplant Aids Immune Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Doctors have implanted thin slices of thymus gland in babies  
born without it to create an immune system, an approach that could 
give hope to adults whose natural defenses have been beaten down by 
AIDS or cancer treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	At least five such transplants performed since 1993 are  
described in today's New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Louise 
Markert, an immunologist at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies all had the most severe form of a genetic disorder  
called DiGeorge syndrome: They were born without a thymus gland, 
which supplies germ-fighting T cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Five to 10 children a year in the United States are born that  
way, and without treatment, many will die young because they have 
no way to fight off infection. In its less severe form, DiGeorge 
syndrome can cause such problems as heart defects, retardation and 
facial abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies were given slices of thymus gland that had been taken  
from other babies during heart surgery. The thymus nearly covers a 
baby's heart, cascading down into the chest, so doctors usually cut 
away some of the gland when an infant has heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike, say, a lung or a liver, the thymus does not have to be  
transplanted into the same area -- or even in one piece. Slices the 
size of a quarter are laid side by side deep in the baby's thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Markert said thymus transplants someday could give hope for  
adults whose immune systems have been ravaged by AIDS or cancer 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Cancer Society researcher, Dr. Ralph Vogler, said he  
is doubtful the approach would get widespread use among cancer 
patients, because their immune systems bounce back on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for  
Allergy and Infectious Disease, said the approach could work in 
both cancer and AIDS patients and is well worth studying. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people fine-tune this more, I think this is going to have  
implications far beyond this DiGeorge syndrome,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first patient to get such a transplant was 3 months old and  
is now healthy and in first grade in Tennessee, Markert said. The 
next three patients died, two from lung infections and one from a 
brain hemorrhage -- not because of problems with the grafts, Markert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Boroff of Forsyth, Ill., underwent the most recent  
operation, in September 1998. He is nearly 15 months old now. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the transplant, the only way to have kept him alive  
would be to confine him to a germ-free plastic tent like David, the 
``boy in the bubble'' who suffered from a bone marrow disorder. 
Sometimes a sibling can provide a DiGeorge baby with T-cells for a 
transplant, but a genetic match is rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the operation, visitors and therapists had to wear gown,  
mask and gloves in Casey's presence. Now they just put on a mask, 
and either wear gloves or wash their hands well. 
</P>
<P>
	``His immune system's kicking in, we're able to get him out,  
take him places,'' said his mother, Louise Boroff.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Making Pro Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Tonya Harding makes her professional  
debut next week at a small arena in West Virginia, she'll skate to 
the sounds of ZZ Top while wearing a turquoise and purple dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding is determined to have a little fun in her first  
competition since the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, and she doesn't 
particularly care whether it leads to any more offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited that I got this second chance,'' she said  
Tuesday. ``If something comes from this, great, but if it doesn't, 
that's OK too. I take life day by day. I just want to go out there 
and have fun and skate well. Win or lose, it doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding, who turns 29 next month, will perform in the Pro  
Skating Championships in Huntington, W.Va., next Monday and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her adviser, Michael Rosenberg, said the event's promoter told  
him about one-third of the 5,780-seat Huntington Civic Arena's 
tickets have been sold, but that he expected a sellout by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my concern how many tickets they sell in West  
Virginia, which is not skating territory,'' Rosenberg said. ``It's 
how many million people see it on ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network will air the competition on tape delay Oct. 25, Nov.  
1 and Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding, implicated in a 1994 attack on rival skater Nancy  
Kerrigan, is banned for life from competing in an amateur event. 
But the U.S. Figure Skating Association has no jurisdiction over 
professional events. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding announced her comeback plans in February, but Rosenberg  
wasn't able to put together a deal. The big-ticket professional 
revues, and many skaters, had been leery of appearing on the same 
ice as her. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding is unfazed, saying she only skates for her fans now.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's people who do not want me back in the skating  
world,'' she said. ``But that's their problem. Skating is my life. 
It's all I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding will skate the technical and artistic programs. Others  
entered in the competition include Surya Bonaly, Elizabeth Manley, 
Tonia Kwiatkowski and Pasha Grischuk. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on local talk shows, Harding looks fit and much more  
trim than she was in Lillehammer, where she finished eighth after a 
broken shoelace and the enormous pressure made her weep. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan won the silver medal, just weeks after a shadowy thug  
whacked her on the knee during the U.S. Championships in Detroit. 
Harding later pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution, resulting in 
$160,000 in fines and 500 hours of community service. Her 
ex-husband and two other men served time in jail for planning the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than practices at a local mall, Harding last skated in  
public in February 1997, during a two-minute exhibition between 
periods at a minor league hockey game in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding has turned down several other opportunities, including  
one to wrestle in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had many, many offers to do things that for myself are  
not acceptable,'' she said. ``I've turned down things that were in 
the six-digit range because I have high morals and standards for 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As memories of her past fade, Harding also is becoming more  
accepted in her hometown. A recent practice session at the mall was 
met with some applause from the crowds that always gather to watch 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a 60-40 split,'' she said. ``It used to be zero.''  
</P>
<P>
	She said she's looking forward to the less-rigid structure of a  
pro event. Her odd musical selections range ZZ Top's heavy 
metal-tinged ``Sleeping Bag'' to David Sanborn to a song by a group 
called Funky Green Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I picked out music that's very fun for me.''

	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Paul Newman gave thanks to Ireland's  
prime minister after visiting a center for sick children set up by 
the actor's charity foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman, 74, said he was grateful that Prime Minister Bertie  
Ahern provided the Barretstown Castle estate as a location for the 
Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, which has played host to nearly 4,000 
children from 20 European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children from Ireland and all over Europe come to this  
beautiful place, to live and play with others who understand what 
it means to battle against illness and be like children again,'' 
Newman said Wednesday. ``They leave the Barretstown Gang Camp with 
a fresh outlook on life and a renewed strength of spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman started the Hole in the Wall foundation in 1988 and has  
several camps in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Millenium Evening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking ahead to a day when one's health  
future could be known at birth and an interplanetary Internet 
system may orbit the heavens, President Clinton and the first lady 
hosted a discussion of the moral and practical questions raised by 
emerging sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions raised during eighth Millennium Evening at the  
White House, which focused on genetic research and information 
technology, were more puzzling than others: 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I really want a mouse smart enough to go to Princeton?''  
Clinton quipped. ``Won't it be sad to have an Internet connection 
with Mars if there's no Martians to write to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday night event in the East Room, one of a series  
tackling weighty issues for the new millennium, dealt mostly with 
more serious matters, including how scientific advances have 
stimulated progress in the fields of healthcare, commerce and 
education while raising questions about privacy and intellectual 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the discussion were Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton and guests Vinton Cerf, a creator of the Internet, 
and Eric Lander, a professor of biomedical research and director of 
the Whitehead Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Center for Genome Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the evening to renew his calls for closing the  
technology gap between rich and poor Americans and public 
investment in scientific research. He also spoke in favor of 
protecting privacy at a time when science is looking ever deeper 
into human traits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on this,'' he said. ``It's very important  
to me.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Invest Donors' Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Peter Deutsch couldn't resist taking  
advantage of the roaring economy to bolster his campaign fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
	By putting some of his supporters' contributions in Microsoft  
and Coca-Cola stocks and other investments, his campaign made 
$184,531 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsch isn't alone in tapping into Wall Street. Most lawmakers  
who invest campaign funds make modest returns on conservative 
investments, but a few can boast six-figure profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be sort of a disservice to your contributors not to  
figure out what is the maximum way to use the contributions,'' 
Deutsch said. ``It allows you spend more time working for your 
constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Deutsch, D-Fla., grew leery of the market and pulled out  
most of his money this year, he even called one of his campaign's 
money managers, Meyer Berman, as a witness last year at a 
congressional hearing on trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an expert. ... He's been in Business Week and in  
Forbes,'' Deutsch said of Berman, who took the congressman's 
campaign funds on a roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsch's campaign lost $80,126 invested with Berman last year,  
but more than made up for it with other investments. Berman was 
responsible for most of Deutsch's $25,732 gain for the first half 
of 1999, when his campaign treasury had $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate members must report to the Federal Election  
Commission any gains or losses -- even those just on paper -- from 
investments that range from Treasury notes to high-tech stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	While lawmakers must disclose their personal investments  
annually, allowing voters to consider possible conflicts of 
interest, they aren't required to detail where campaign dollars are 
invested. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid the appearance of a conflict, Deutsch has no control  
over how his money managers invest campaign funds, his spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability  
Project, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said that's not enough. He 
wants more disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't know very much about this whole line of  
investing,'' Ruskin said. ``Who knows what stories are there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last decade, candidates have gradually become more  
bullish about investing campaign contributions in stocks, said 
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little lights have gone off in various campaign treasurers'  
heads as they watched the stock market go up, up, up,'' Sabato 
said. ``As long as the stock market goes up, then these candidates 
are going to be better funded than their opponents. If the stock 
market dips, they are going to be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economist-turned-congressman Tom Campbell, R-Calif., learned  
that the hard way, when he lost a total of $56,379 in 1997 and 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell ``would rather not talk about it,'' said his spokesman,  
Suhail Khan. His investments are in the black this year, campaign 
reports show. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal election law, donors can give candidates $1,000  
for each election. If candidates lose that money in the stock 
market, they cannot ask the same donors for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Many candidates stick to only the safest investments.  
</P>
<P>
	The campaign of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, earned  
$88,751 in the first half of this year, primarily from $5.5 million 
worth of Treasury securities, said her campaign treasurer, Ken 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in the business of gambling with (donors') money,''  
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, a Senate candidate,  
has taken small risks. Most of his $1.4 million is in a bond fund. 
But campaign spokesman John Sowinski said McCollum has less than 5 
percent of his investments in two individual stocks, which he also 
invests in personally: Cephalon, a biopharmaceutical company, and 
Diamond Multimedia Systems, which makes portable digital music 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign earned $25,259 from investments and nominal bank  
interest in the first half of the year, FEC reports show. 
</P>
<P>
	The question was, ``How do you manage a $500,000 fund that you  
don't need for a while?'' McCollum said. ``The point wasn't to 
score a home run or anything.''

<HEADLINE> Court Gets States' Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court seemed ready Wednesday to  
shield states against federal lawsuits by employees who say they 
are victims of age bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing arguments in three related cases from Florida and  
Alabama, the justices appeared headed toward ruling that a federal 
anti-bias law, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 
cannot trump states' 11th Amendment immunity against being sued in 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision will be announced by late June.  
</P>
<P>
	In a series of 5-4 rulings in recent years, the court ignited a  
states' rights revolution by sapping the federal government's power 
over states. Nothing in Wednesday's 60-minute courtroom session 
indicated any shift among the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	More difficult to predict is whether the justices will use the  
three ADEA cases to dramatically curtail Congress' power to attack 
various forms of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices, in questions and comments from the bench,  
suggested Congress can enforce the 14th Amendment's 
equal-protection guarantee only when seeking to protect people 
discriminated against because of race, national origin, religion 
and perhaps gender. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court ruled in line with those comments, that could  
undermine -- or even invalidate -- federal laws banning public and 
private discrimination based on age and physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous decisions, the court has deemed race, national  
origin and religion as specially protected categories. Laws or 
government practices that treat people differently for those 
reasons are the hardest to defend. 
</P>
<P>
	Differing government treatment based on someone's sex is also  
vulnerable to court challenges, but not as vulnerable. Differing 
treatment based on other factors -- such as age or disabilities -- is 
most often allowed by courts -- unless found to be based on 
irrational ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled in the Florida and Alabama cases  
that the ADEA cannot be invoked in federal lawsuits against states 
and state agencies, in part because Congress did not specifically 
nullify states' immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This statute does not mention the 11th Amendment,'' Justice  
Sandra Day O'Connor said about the ADEA. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, referring to the 1974 amendment that  
extended the law to cover public employers, said Congress spent 
little time considering the states' immunity question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress did not have the debate we are having here,'' he  
said. ``It didn't come close to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor and Kennedy have joined Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in 
cutting back congressional power while enhancing states' authority. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of those previous cases, Justices John Paul Stevens,  
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer were 
dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Representing state workers, lawyer Jeremiah Collins argued that  
Congress intended to wipe out state employers' immunity against 
federal lawsuits even if it did not specifically say so. He said 
Congress addressed ``a pervasive problem in our society of how 
people look at older workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration lawyer Barbara Underwood also urged the  
court to allow federal court access for ADEA claims against state 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeffrey Sutton, representing the state employers, said  
Congress never had any indication they were engaged in ``pervasive 
and systematic discrimination'' -- a showing needed before Congress 
can invoke its remedial powers. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the three disputes, 36 current and former faculty  
members and librarians at Florida State University and Florida 
International University sued the state board of regents in federal 
court, contending that age bias was why they lost out on certain 
salary increases given to young faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
	In another, two associate professors at the state-run University  
of Montevallo in Alabama alleged that they had been wronged because 
younger faculty members were treated more favorably when it came to 
salaries and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a third, Florida prison guard Wellington Dickson said he  
lost out on a promotion because of discrimination based on, among 
other factors, his age.

<HEADLINE> House, Senate Near Land Bill Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans neared a deal  
Wednesday on a $14.3 billion bill financing land and cultural 
programs, but a veto by President Clinton seemed likely because of 
provisions helping oil and mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide only about one-third of the $800 million  
Clinton proposed to buy park land for the federal and state 
governments. Overall, it falls about $800 million short of what the 
president sought for the Interior Department and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tentative agreement, the bill would let oil companies  
drilling on public lands avoid paying higher royalties to the 
government for up to six more months while a congressional study of 
the issue is completed. The higher payments have been delayed for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hard-rock mining companies now using federal lands would be  
exempted from an Interior Department ruling limiting the size of 
their waste dumps to five acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Both provisions were less favorable to industry than earlier  
versions, but environmental groups complained they went too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is merely another delay tactic,'' Gawain Kripke of  
Friends of the Earth said of the oil royalty language. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting the George Washington National Forest in Virginia to  
describe administration plans to preserve federal forests, Clinton 
accused GOP leaders of ``polluting our spending bills with special 
interest'' provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear,'' he said. ``If the Interior bill lands on my  
desk looking like it does now, I will give it a good environmental 
response. I will send it straight back to the recycling bin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke before the House-Senate bargainers finished their  
work. But White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that based on what 
was known about the House-Senate deal, ``They have not addressed 
all the concerns raised by the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
said the bill was ``almost signable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, just five of the 13 annual bills for fiscal 2000, which  
began Oct. 1, have been signed. Underlining his desire to avoid a 
big budget fight with Clinton, he urged his colleagues to finish 
their work so lawmakers can ``go home and start a new millennium 
next year without being here until Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few loose ends in the Interior bill was a  
House-Senate dispute over how much to provide for the National 
Endowment for the Arts. The House was holding out for $5 million 
less than the $103 million the Senate prefers. Clinton asked for 
$150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill contains money for several projects that appear in  
neither the House or Senate versions of the bill, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$22 million to help Alaskan communities where lumber plants are  
closing, won by Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	--$39 million to prop up a financially ailing fund that finances  
health care for more than 60,000 retired mine workers, won by Sen. 
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.

<HEADLINE> PGA Golfer Begay Sheds 'War Paint'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) -- Notah Begay III used to put two  
dabs of ceremonial red clay on his cheeks before a tough golf match 
-- a tribal custom before an ``extremely challenging journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay gave up the ritual a few years ago. The only American  
Indian playing on the PGA Tour has shown he can win without what 
his opponents used to call ``war paint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has two victories in the last two months, including one  
Sunday in a playoff in the Michelob Championship in Williamsburg, 
Va., in his first season on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``That custom is a bit of a distraction now,'' said Begay, who  
has drawn more curious fans than 19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia 
as they prepare to start Thursday in the 12-man World Match Play 
championship at Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I still see every single round of golf ... as a long  
journey,'' he added. ``You never know where you're going to go and 
you don't know how hard it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay is the only full-blooded American Indian to win a PGA Tour  
event. He lived for seven years on a reservation south of 
Albuquerque, N.M., and was Tiger Woods' teammate four years ago at 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	He putts both left- and right-handed, depending on the break,  
and has an unorthodox, self-made swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see myself in the class of a lot of players who are  
here,'' said Begay, who was picked two months ago by Mark 
McCormack, whose International Management Group runs this event. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (McCormack) said he wanted to give some up-and-coming  
American players some exposure,'' Begay explained. ``Maybe I 
deserve to be here, a least a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay, who faces two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal  
in the 36-hole first round, is in a 12-man field that includes 
defending champion Mark O'Meara, two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie 
Els, three-time majors winner Nick Price and top European player 
Colin Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round matches it will be Craig Parry vs. Paul  
Lawrie, Garcia vs. Retief Goosen, and Carlos Franco vs. Padraig 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I lack confidence, but if you pulled out  
everybody's resume, mine would be the shortest. That's just a 
fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay took up golf while tagging along with his father -- Notah  
Begay Jr. -- when he started as a middle-age golfer in a local 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a golf club to stay out of the way and I liked  
it,'' he said. ``They didn't know how to play, they didn't know the 
rules. They didn't know the strategy. They were just out there 
because that was what they were supposed to be doing at that age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8, he began working at a local course for free in exchange  
for a bucket of balls and no greens fees, and eventually began to 
hone his game at a prep school. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stanford, he played with Woods and Casey Martin and still  
stays in touch with both. In fact, at Stanford he played No. 1 
ahead of Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got a little better, a little faster,'' Begay said. ``I  
haven't necessarily had it any more difficult than anyone else,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay, whose first name means ``almost there'' in Navajo, said  
he's experienced few racial taunts and hasn't heard any around the 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had any problems being turned away from a particular  
club,'' he said. ``Some places, they think I'm a caddie.''

<HEADLINE> Rape Charges Shake Hmong Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Four teen-age girls disappeared from Wisconsin  
last month, lured perhaps by the prospect of celebrating the Hmong 
New Year in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
	When they were found days later and hundreds of miles away in  
Detroit, they said they had been repeatedly raped by as many as 20 
men, assaulted with a leather strap and threatened with death if 
they tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Five boys and young men have been charged with rape and are  
being held on $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not indicated a motive. But the defendants are also  
members of the Hmong ethnic group and are possibly gang members, 
and the case has exposed the tensions caused by Laotian refugees' 
rapid assimilation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Hmong people say they have had to struggle to raise their  
children in a culture far different from the clan-based, 
agricultural world they left behind in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hmong fought alongside U.S. troops in Laos, then fled after  
the Communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975. An estimated 
250,000 Hmong refugees now live in the United States, most in 
California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. About 7,000 are in the Detroit 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheu Xiong of Lansing-based Hmong American Community believes  
the United States fosters a sense of independence readily exploited 
by Hmong youth. In Laos, he said, ``if parents say you can't go, 
you have to stay. Over here, if parents say you can't go, kids can 
say: `Forget it. I'm going.''' 
</P>
<P>
	True Chang of the Hmong Community Organization in the Detroit  
area said the problem is compounded by parents' hesitancy to 
discipline their children as strictly as they would in Laos, for 
fear of being charged as child abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crimes involving teens and problems disciplining children are  
hardly unique to Hmong people. But several recent cases have 
highlighted the problem in the Hmong community. 
</P>
<P>
	In St. Paul, Minn., two 21-year-old men and five teen-age boys  
were charged in January 1998 with the gang rapes of three Hmong 
girls. And in June 1998 in St. Paul, several men were charged with 
repeatedly raping at least seven young Hmong girls as part of a 
gang initiation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fresno, Calif., a year ago, police said they broke up a  
sex-slave ring in which as many as 15 Hmong girls aged 13 to 15 
were gang-raped and forced into prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Detroit case, three girls ages 14, 15 and 16 told police  
they were lured from a party in Sheboygan, Wis., on Sept. 29 by two 
men they had just met, and arrived two days later in Detroit, more 
than 400 miles away by car. They said they were taken to a house 
where a 17-year-old Hmong girl from Wisconsin was already being 
kept. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger girls said they were raped by as many as 20 youths  
over two days before sneaking out of the house Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the 17-year-old spotted a police officer tagging  
abandoned vehicles and fled. She told officers she had been 
kidnapped Sept. 18, brought to Detroit and raped by 10 people. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the suspects admitted having sex with the teens but said  
it was consensual, police said. Another said he had consensual sex 
twice with the older girl and claimed she was never detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press said the suspects include members of a  
gang called Bloods 116, but police and prosecutors would not 
comment on any gang involvement, or on possible motives. More 
arrests could follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old girl's brother told the Free Press that several  
Laotian girls had heard about a big party in Detroit for the Hmong 
New Year, which is celebrated here in October though the holiday is 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheboygan Deputy Police Chief David Kirk said Hmong are very  
willing to travel long distances. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see nothing in traveling from Sheboygan to St. Paul or  
California or around the state to visit friends and relatives,'' he 
said. ``It's one large family, if you want to look at it that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three younger girls are in protective custody and the oldest  
girl is staying with a Laotian family. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who identified himself as the 15-year-old's father  
described his daughter as a good student who liked to do her 
homework and rarely got into trouble, other than occasionally 
staying out late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very angry, very sad thinking about it,'' he said. ``My  
daughter (was) helping the family and doing her homework, and now 
she's missing.''

<HEADLINE> Profile of JonBenet Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Shortly after JonBenet Ramsey's body was  
found, District Attorney Alex Hunter taunted the killer, glaring 
into TV cameras and declaring: ``The list of suspect narrows. Soon 
there will be no one on the list but you. You will pay for what you 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the ensuing three years, Hunter found himself unable to  
back up the threat. Instead he became the target of criticism from 
several angles and was at odds with police as the investigation 
waxed and waned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead police investigator Steve Thomas resigned in August 1998,  
accusing Hunter of mishandling the case and trying to protect 
JonBenet's parents, millionaire businessman John Ramsey and his 
wife, Patsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas contended Hunter's staff shared physical evidence and  
reports with Ramsey attorneys and said evidence remained untested 
in a lab because police and prosecutors were arguing over how to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, consulting homicide investigator Lou Smit resigned. He  
took the opposite side, insisting there was credible evidence of an 
intruder and that the Ramseys were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and another former detective also accused Hunter of  
leaking information to a tabloid reporter and urging him to help 
discredit Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Through all the turmoil, Hunter, who has been in office since  
1973, said he was no less determined to find the killer of the 
6-year-old beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some interesting cases, some wins and some losses,  
and this case, you all know, has been a very difficult one, and my 
faith in the process has never been shaken,'' he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hunter announced that a county grand jury had  
concluded its investigation and that no charges were filed. He said 
there wasn't enough evidence to indict anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 63, was born in the New York City area. He attended the  
University of Colorado law school, where he met his chief deputy, 
Bill Wise. Hunter won top awards in moot court competitions and 
made Law Review. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, he clerked for the Colorado Supreme Court's  
chief justice before becoming a part-time deputy district attorney 
in Boulder County in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter formed a law partnership with Wise and another attorney  
two years later, but resigned in 1972 to run for district attorney. 
He defeated the incumbent and has won re-election ever since, most 
recently the month before JonBenet died. Hunter is up for 
re-election next year and has not said whether he would seek 
another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents and attorneys who know Hunter say he is timid,  
and they worried about the Ramsey case because Hunter has shown a 
reluctance to go after high-profile suspects. Others say he fits 
right in with laissez-faire attitudes in Boulder, a liberal college 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the most liberal and timid district attorney in  
Colorado,'' said former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman. ``That 
serves him well in Boulder where they like liberal politicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said Hunter is well-liked by  
many in Boulder and has a reputation for ``being a realist who is 
not afraid to cut a deal when he's getting a good deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have the reputation of someone who charges blindly  
up a hill, hoping he's going to find a judge and jury favorable to 
his case,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hunter's harshest critics is June Menger, the mother of  
University of Colorado student Sid Wells, who was killed in his 
condominium 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested a roommate, Thayne Smika, two months later, but  
Hunter and his staff concluded there wasn't enough evidence to 
press charges, so Smika was released. The case drew attention in 
part because Wells, 22, was dating the daughter of film star Robert 
Redford. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter recently sought another arrest warrant for Smika, but  
police have been unable to locate him.

mutual fund companies more power are being proposed by federal 
securities regulators, in an effort to better protect the millions 
of Americans who invest in the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission voted Wednesday, 4-0, to  
seek public comment on the proposed rules, which include a 
requirement that the boards of most mutual fund companies have a 
majority of independent directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, less than a majority -- 40 percent -- of fund  
companies' directors must be independent of the company, though 
most large fund companies voluntarily have a majority of 
independent directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent fund directors, who come from diverse backgrounds,  
are watchdogs responsible for protecting investors' interests and 
maintaining the funds' integrity. Their duties include overseeing 
mutual fund fees, monitoring financial performance and preventing 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few small fund companies would be exempt from the  
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent directors play an important role in keeping the  
mutual fund industry remarkably free of scandals, SEC officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``serve as an investor's front-line defense against  
conflicts of interest and other potential abuses,'' SEC Chairman 
Arthur Levitt said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move this summer, the SEC tightened its rules  
governing personal trading by mutual fund managers and employees. 
The stricter rules are designed to avoid conflicts of interest that 
can arise when fund managers and employees buy and sell securities 
for their own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes by the market watchdog agency came in the wake of  
several cases of mutual fund managers being accused of improperly 
enriching themselves with investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Levitt has pushed the mutual fund industry for  
improved disclosure of fund fees and investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 83 million Americans now invest in mutual funds, whose  
total assets are estimated at $6 trillion, up from around $1 
trillion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the  
industry's trade group, welcomed the latest SEC proposals, saying 
they ``are directed at further strengthening the effectiveness of 
independent mutual fund directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the group endorsed a series of voluntary  
``best practices'' for the mutual fund industry, which it said went 
beyond what is required by law and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other new rules proposed Wednesday by the SEC, which  
were opened to a 90-day public comment period: 
</P>
<P>
	--New independent directors of mutual fund companies must be  
nominated by current independent directors rather than fund company 
managers or investment advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Attorneys for independent directors must themselves be  
independent, not representing fund company management or close 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fund companies must disclose basic information about directors,  
as well as information that may raise conflict-of-interest 
concerns. They also must disclose directors' ownership of shares in 
the company's group of funds, to help investors assess whether the 
directors' interests are aligned with their own.

<HEADLINE> Schwab Issues $10M Challenge Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- A foundation set up by financier  
Charles R. Schwab has made a $10 million matching challenge to a 
group that helps learning disabled students. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift to All Kinds of Minds, a non-profit organization  
affiliated with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
requires the group to raise $20 million over five years. A prorated 
amount will be given if less is raised by the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schwab Foundation for Learning was formed by Charles and  
Helen O'Neill Schwab after their son was diagnosed with dyslexia in 
the late 1980s. Schwab also recognized he had a similar, 
undiagnosed condition in his youth.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Coach in E-Mail Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Butch Carter, coach of the NBA Toronto  
Raptors, wants his ex-wife to keep out of his personal e-mail 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Carter said in court that his ex-wife, Jill Carter,  
is reading and then distributing her ex-husband's e-mail messages 
from an account he has with LoveAOL, an America Online personal 
advertising service. She and his lawyers are at odds over whether 
she has a right to see his e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ann Marie Tracey granted Carter a temporary order Tuesday  
in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court. The order forbids Jill 
Carter to distribute the e-mails for at least 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach's lawyers asked for the order to prevent Carter's  
ex-wife from gaining access to his e-mail account, reading it, 
printing the messages, disseminating them or contacting those who 
sent him e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter loaned his laptop computer to a son who was going to  
Mexico and wanted to check his e-mail. When the son returned home 
in July, Jill Carter somehow learned her ex-husband's AOL password 
and gained access to his LoveAOL account, the coach's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's lawyers suggested that his ex-wife was being vindictive  
and using the e-mails to embarrass and harass Carter and those with 
whom he exchanges e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Bossin, Jill Carter's lawyer, did not return a telephone  
call to her office Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carters were married from 1981 to 1988 and had three sons --  
now ages 17, 14 and 8 -- before divorcing. They then lived together 
in the mid-1990s when Carter was an assistant with the Milwaukee 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Carter lives in Cincinnati. Butch Carter, a former high  
school basketball star in Middletown, Ohio, now lives in Toronto. 
He has been the Raptors' coach since February 1998.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Wins Nobel for Economics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Robert A. Mundell of Columbia  
University in New York won the Nobel Prize for economic sciences 
today for his analysis of exchange rates and how they affect 
monetary policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-born economist ``has established the foundation for  
the theory that dominates practical policy considerations of 
monetary and fiscal policy in open economies,'' the Royal Swedish 
Academy of Sciences said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His work on monetary dynamics and optimum currency areas has  
inspired generations of researchers. Mundell's contributions remain 
outstanding and constitute the core of teaching in international 
macroeconomics,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mundell's most important work was done in the 1960s, the academy  
said. He served in the research department of the International 
Monetary Fund from 1961 to 1963, which ``apparently stimulated 
Mundell's choice of research problems; it also gave his research 
additional leverage among economic policy makers,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said Mundell's research has made important  
contributions far outside esoteric academic circles by clarifying 
how exchange rates fluctuate when a government shifts from a 
flexible to a fixed monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``His work has provided a helpful guide to policy implications  
in the real world,'' said Roger Alford, a senior research assistant 
with the Financial Markets Group at the London School of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	His theory showed how exchange rates are affected when a  
government allows its fiscal policy to adapt to the whims of supply 
and demand generated by foreign exchange traders, or, 
alternatively, intervenes by manipulating its currency supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very important clarification,'' said Alford.  
</P>
<P>
	Mundell published a pioneering article in 1963 on the short-term  
effects of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy, the 
citation said. ``The analysis is simple, but the conclusions are 
numerous, robust and clear.'' His first book, ``Man and 
Economics,'' was published in the United States in 1968. Since 
then, he has authored, co-authored and edited dozens of books, 
articles and papers. In addition, he has served as an international 
monetary adviser for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mundell's considerations, several decades ago, seem highly  
relevant today,'' the academy said. It added that Mundell's 
analysis has important implications for the single European 
currency launched by 11 members of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mundell has also made lasting contributions to international  
trade theory. He has clarified how the international mobility of 
labor and capital tends to equalize commodity prices among 
countries, even if foreign trade is limited by trade barriers,'' 
the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's award went to Amartya Sen, a scholar from India who  
developed a new understanding of the economic mechanisms underlying 
famines and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	His work challenged the common view that a shortage of food is  
the most important explanation of famine. He said instead that high 
food prices and declining wages are in some cases responsible for 
widespread starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for  
their work on valuing risky ``derivatives'' investments such as 
stock options. That award was tarnished by the near-collapse last 
year of a giant hedge fund in which Merton and Scholes were 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the  
will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. 
It was created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature Nobel was awarded Sept. 30 to German novelist  
Guenter Grass. The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr. Guenter 
Blobel, 63, a German native and U.S. citizen, who discovered how 
proteins find their rightful places in cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus J.G. Veltman, both of the  
Netherlands, won the physics prize Tuesday for developing more 
precise calculations used to predict and confirm the existence of 
subatomic particles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian-American, won the chemistry prize  
Tuesday for pioneering the use of rapid-fire laser flashes that 
illuminate the motion of atoms in a molecule. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Nobel -- the peace prize -- is to be announced Friday in  
Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, worth $960,000, are presented on Dec. 10, the  
anniversary of Nobel's death.

<HEADLINE> Nokia Picks Palm Operating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Nokia announced today it is  
licensing the software used in 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm organizers 
to help run a new generation of portable phones that let people 
browse the Internet and organize information. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement gives a major boost to 3Com's ambitions to expand  
its Palm software business beyond hand-held computers. 
Finland-based Nokia, for its part, gets an operating system for its 
mobile phones that already is widely accepted by developers of 
applications and by millions of users of the Palm gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia said the Palm operating system will provide the ``user  
interface,'' or the arrangement of text and graphics that let 
people operate the mobile phone. The phone includes a pen-like 
stylus for manipulating information, just like the Palm electronic 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm OS will be integrated with another software program  
Nokia already is developing, called Epoc, that will run the phone's 
underlying functions. 
</P>
<P>
	While only a tiny fraction of the world's 300 million mobile  
phones currently give users Web access, the market is expected to 
quickly grow as companies forge alliances and develop new 
technology. By 2005, a whopping 1 billion people are expected to 
use mobile phones, letting more and more users get the latest news, 
trade stocks and even pay for purchases no matter where they are. 
</P>
<P>
	By licensing the Palm OS, Nokia appears to be hedging its bets.  
Nokia already has invested in a venture with two other mobile phone 
makers, Ericsson and Motorola, to develop the Epoc operating system 
for smart phones. The wireless group, Symbian, is adapting Epoc 
from an OS created by Psion PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	But few software developers have written applications for Epoc,  
in contrast to the scores of applications that have been written to 
enable users of 3Com's Palm to organize information and notes and 
even play games. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. also is vigorously pushing its Windows CE  
operating system to mobile phone makers and is a formidable rival, 
but Microsoft's program has attracted fewer applications than Palm, 
though more than Symbian. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracting new applications is seen as crucial to drawing people  
to a new generation of mobile phones that let people perform a 
variety of Internet-based functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Epoc has been a poor performer in the application area, and  
applications are critical for success,'' said Kenneth Dulaney, an 
industry analyst with the Gartner Group research and consulting 
firm, which is holding its annual gathering of technology managers 
here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Palm OS has a rich set of application developers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Palm is aggressively trying to shift its business to become more  
of an operating program developer, much as Microsoft licenses its 
Windows operating system to makers of personal computers and 
hand-held gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm already licenses its software to Qualcomm, a mobile phone  
company, as well to Handspring Inc., which sells a $149 personal 
digital assistant that is a less expensive rival to the Palm 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million Palms have been sold since they were  
introduced in 1996, becoming a sort of mobile badge for on-the-go 
professionals seeking a convenient way to store contacts, 
appointments and notes. 3Com plans to launch an initial public 
offering of the Palm unit early next year in a deal that could 
value the new company anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Warned on Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANDAN, N.D. (AP) -- Bill Haag is getting a new computer system  
at his grain elevator, but ask him about Y2K and his answer is 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of hype, he says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they just blow it out worse than it is,'' Haag said.  
He doesn't think any of his equipment will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are not as confident. Those who have studied how the  
millennium bug could affect farm equipment are urging pork, dairy 
and grain operations to make contingency plans. And last-minute 
workshops in the Upper Midwest are planned to spread the word about 
how to prepare for equipment problems in case the bug bites worse 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Meier, executive director of the North Dakota Pork  
Producers, said she has received no calls about Y2K worries from 
the state's 750 pork operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I would say there isn't that much concern,''  
she said. ``I think if they know the electricity is going to be 
running that's all they're concerned about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Adelaine, an extension specialist from South Dakota State  
University, thinks farmers should be concerned about more than 
that. He has put together an Internet list of Y2K-compliant 
software commonly used in farm operations and is planning a 
workshop in November for those who get a late start on 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, what we're going to do is say: `Hey, folks, be  
aware of this issue, make some contingency plans and let's see if 
we can get you through this time period,''' Adelaine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K problems could arise from malfunctions in computers that  
read only the last two digits in a year and mistake 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, owners of pork, poultry and dairy operations are  
being urged to make sure their climate-control devices will not 
collapse suddenly on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers with livestock feeding or milking systems are  
encouraged to contact manufacturers to find out how they might be 
affected. The same goes for producers with any kind of 
environmental control mechanisms in barns or confined feeding 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers also should prepare to do farm work manually if  
automated machinery doesn't work, said Wayne Hansen, who has 
studied the issue for the University of Minnesota Extension 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic scales, moisture testers, grain drying equipment and  
crop storage ventilation systems used in grain elevators could be 
affected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug also could hamper farmers and ranchers who use  
computers to keep their books. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing the medium-size smaller operations that do have  
the older machines that would need to get up to speed,'' Adelaine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said earlier workshops on Y2K have not drawn many  
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if it's because they don't think it's a problem  
or if it's because they feel like they've fixed everything 
already,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He does not believe Y2K will cause the devastating problems, but  
said there's reason to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be some problems,'' he said. ``We know that for a  
fact. It's just a matter of how severe they are.'' 
</P>
<P>

can be found at www.abs.sdstate.edu/ecs/home/y2k.html.

<HEADLINE> Bad Luck Injury for Bears' Matthews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Just as his dream became reality, just  
as he started convincing the doubters he really did belong, Shane 
Matthews is back on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really been hurt,'' the Chicago Bears quarterback  
said Wednesday. ``I never thought I would miss a game or two 
because of a muscle pull. Maybe I'd break a collarbone or have 
broken ribs, but I've been fortunate to take those shots and not 
get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have something like this happen with nobody around you, it  
was a freak accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews pulled his right hamstring as he scrambled out of  
bounds early in the fourth quarter last weekend. He'll miss 
Chicago's game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, and 
there's no telling when he'll return. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bears running back James Allen suffered a similar injury, a  
Grade Two strain, he was out four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he's a fast healer,'' coach Dick Jauron said. ``It's  
a little less severe than what we thought, but I'm not sure what 
that means in terms of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when Matthews is healthy, there's no guarantee he'll get  
his job back. If Cade McNown plays well and the Bears keep winning, 
Matthews knows he might not get on the field again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is, if you're a starter and you get hurt and  
somebody steps up and plays phenomenally well, the odds are that 
you will end up losing your job,'' Jauron said. ``It's our 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews has been on the endangered list since training camp. A  
journeyman who was cut four times by the Bears alone in his first 
five seasons, he was only supposed to baby-sit the starter's job 
until McNown was ready to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown is the Bears' future, the 12th overall pick in the draft  
with a contract that could pay him as much as $22 million over five 
years. Matthews was a guy whose best days were supposedly behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	But Matthews surprised everyone. With a quarterback rating of  
86.9, he's the top passer in the NFC Central and third in the NFC. 
His 62.7 percent completion rate (111-of-177) is better than Brett 
Favre, Randall Cunningham, Troy Aikman and Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw two touchdown passes in the last 1:48 for a 14-10  
victory over New Orleans two weeks ago, and he led the Bears to 
last week's 24-22 stunner at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears (3-2) are off to their best start in four years. One  
more victory and they match their total from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited a long time for this opportunity, and we're 3-2,  
right in the thick of things, and we're starting to play well 
offensively,'' Matthews said. ``It's just an unfortunate situation, 
and we have to live with it. Injuries happen in this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully Cade will play well this week because it's a big  
game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury spoiled what should have been a great week for  
Matthews. Not only did Chicago beat the defending NFC Central 
champions at the Metrodome, but his wife, Stephanie, gave birth to 
their second child, Michael Luke, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the trainer's room while his teammates celebrated  
last weekend was tough, Matthews admitted, and it's disappointing 
to miss this weekend's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can heal pretty quick,'' he said. ``I'm just doing  
everything they tell me to do to try to get back as quickly as 
possible.''

<HEADLINE> 'NYPD Blue' Producer Angry at ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Detective Andy Sipowicz may be moving.  
</P>
<P>
	ABC may keep its new drama, ``Once and Again,'' on Tuesdays at  
10 p.m. and find a new home for ``NYPD Blue,'' which has occupied 
that slot since its premiere in 1993 with Sipowicz and company. 
</P>
<P>
	The producer of ``NYPD Blue'' is spitting mad at ABC because the  
network is considering moving the popular police drama. Steven 
Bochco said he has asked ABC to cancel the show so he could offer 
it to another network. 
</P>
<P>
	``It galls me on every level,'' he said. ``First, in its  
cynicism. It galls me in its disrespect. We have given the network 
a hit show in that time slot for six uninterrupted years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokesman declined comment on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	But a network executive, who asked not to be identified,  
stressed that ABC has made no decision about the time slot and 
informed Bochco what was being considered out of courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	``NYPD Blue'' has been a consistently strong ratings performer.  
Dennis Franz, who plays Sipowicz, last month won his fourth Emmy 
Award for best actor in a drama and the show has thrived despite 
the recent departure of actor Jimmy Smits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco said he believed a move was ``a done deal.'' He said the  
network hadn't told him where the show would move, but said ``NYPD 
Blue'' would not make its scheduled season premiere date of Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``NYPD Blue'' sat on the bench this fall, ABC has used the  
time slot to establish ``Once and Again,'' about a recently 
divorced man and woman trying to start a new romance amidst family 
complications. ``Once and Again'' had no permanent slot on the 
schedule after Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco said ABC executives are concerned that if ``Once and  
Again'' leaves the time slot, female viewers would flock to the new 
CBS drama, ``Judging Amy,'' which has also been successful Tuesday 
nights at 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The producer said he believed ABC's ownership of ``Once and  
Again'' and its deal to show reruns of the drama on the Lifetime 
cable network drove the decision. ABC has the potential to make 
much more money on ``Once and Again'' since it doesn't own ``NYPD 
Blue,'' he said.

	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Nokia announced today it is  
licensing the software used in 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm organizers 
to help run a new generation of portable phones that let people 
browse the Internet and organize information. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement gives a major boost to 3Com's ambitions to expand  
its Palm software business beyond hand-held computers. 
Finland-based Nokia, for its part, gets an operating system for its 
mobile phones that already is widely accepted by developers of 
applications and by millions of users of the Palm gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia said the Palm operating system will provide the ``user  
interface,'' or the arrangement of text and graphics that let 
people operate the mobile phone. The phone includes a pen-like 
stylus for manipulating information, just like the Palm electronic 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm OS will be integrated with another software program  
Nokia already is developing, called Epoc, that will run the phone's 
underlying functions. 
</P>
<P>
	While only a tiny fraction of the world's 300 million mobile  
phones currently give users Web access, the market is expected to 
quickly grow as companies forge alliances and develop new 
technology. By 2005, a whopping 1 billion people are expected to 
use mobile phones, letting more and more users get the latest news, 
trade stocks and even pay for purchases no matter where they are. 
</P>
<P>
	By licensing the Palm OS, Nokia appears to be hedging its bets.  
Nokia already has invested in a venture with two other mobile phone 
makers, Ericsson and Motorola, to develop the Epoc operating system 
for smart phones. The wireless group, Symbian, is adapting Epoc 
from an OS created by Psion PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	But few software developers have written applications for Epoc,  
in contrast to the scores of applications that have been written to 
enable users of 3Com's Palm to organize information and notes and 
even play games. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. also is vigorously pushing its Windows CE  
operating system to mobile phone makers and is a formidable rival, 
but Microsoft's program has attracted fewer applications than Palm, 
though more than Symbian. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracting new applications is seen as crucial to drawing people  
to a new generation of mobile phones that let people perform a 
variety of Internet-based functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Epoc has been a poor performer in the application area, and  
applications are critical for success,'' said Kenneth Dulaney, an 
industry analyst with the Gartner Group research and consulting 
firm, which is holding its annual gathering of technology managers 
here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Palm OS has a rich set of application developers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Palm is aggressively trying to shift its business to become more  
of an operating program developer, much as Microsoft licenses its 
Windows operating system to makers of personal computers and 
hand-held gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm already licenses its software to Qualcomm, a mobile phone  
company, as well to Handspring Inc., which sells a $149 personal 
digital assistant that is a less expensive rival to the Palm 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million Palms have been sold since they were  
introduced in 1996, becoming a sort of mobile badge for on-the-go 
professionals seeking a convenient way to store contacts, 
appointments and notes. 3Com plans to launch an initial public 
offering of the Palm unit early next year in a deal that could 
value the new company anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Con Ed May Buy Northeast Utilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Inc. has agreed to buy  
Northeast Utilities for $3.3 billion in cash and stock, The New 
York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will give Con Edison access to cheaper electricity and  
raise its base of 3 million customers to 4.7 million, the Times 
reported, citing sources familiar with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Con Edison's biggest move to retain customers and make  
itself more competitive as New York and other states deregulate 
their utility markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast, based in Berlin, Conn., is the largest electric  
utility in New England, serving customers in Connecticut, 
Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal approved by the boards of both companies  
Tuesday, Con Edison would pay $25 a share in cash and stock for the 
outstanding shares of Northeast, and would pay an additional $1 a 
share if units 2 and 3 of the Millstone nuclear plant in 
Connecticut are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene McGrath, chairman and chief executive of the New York  
City-based Con Edison, would hold those positions in the new 
company. Michael Morris, the president and chief executive of 
Northeast, would become president of the new company, the Times 
said.

<HEADLINE> Young Fending Off Retirement Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- His agent, family and friends have  
all told Steve Young he's taken enough hits to the head and should 
retire. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback still wants to play, 
unless he hears the same thing from his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a possibility and it could happen this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Young, fighting the effects of the worst in a series of  
concussions the last three years, was expected to meet with his 
neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, and team physician Dr. James 
Klint, sometime today or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, who is not related to the  
neurologist, said Tuesday the medical meeting might result in Young 
being given clearance to resume playing, or it could signal the end 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Young still has every intention of rejoining the 49ers and hopes  
to get medical clearance to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Leigh Steinberg said the upcoming meeting also might  
produce a recommendation that Young, a two-time league MVP and the 
highest-rated passer in NFL history, should quit because of the 
potential health risks from another concussion. Repeated 
concussions can cause premature senility and other brain 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who turned 38 Monday and is in his 15th NFL season,  
suffered his fourth concussion in three years Sept. 27 against 
Arizona. He was leveled by blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams, and 
his head struck tackle Dave Fiore's knee before slamming into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of the blow left him unconscious for several seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Garcia has started two games in place of the injured Young,  
and coach Steve Mariucci said Monday that Young likely would miss a 
third straight start Sunday, when the 49ers play Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Young receives medical clearance to resume playing,  
Mariucci said he would probably rest him for an additional period 
of time to make sure he's all right. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco plays at Minnesota on Oct. 24, and it's unlikely  
Young would return for that game, which will be played on an 
unforgiving artificial surface. The 49ers then have a bye, meaning 
the earliest Young would return to play, provided he receives 
clearance, would be Nov. 7, when San Francisco plays host to 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Young conceded he was bothered by headaches and  
grogginess after trying to resume practice with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest concussion now appears to be the most serious one  
suffered by Young, who endured two in 1996 and another in the 1997 
season-opener at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg said he, along with Young's family and some of  
his friends, have been urging Young to retire for the last two 
years, and they renewed their calls in the aftermath of the latest 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has said he still has a passion for football, and whether  
he leaves the sport or not is a matter he wants left primarily 
between him and his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent said in all probability, it would take a persuasive  
recommendation from his doctors to convince Young he should retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the doctor is going to say, and I don't  
think this is an exact science, which is why I think you should 
retire if you take a couple of hits like that to the head,'' Leigh 
Steinberg said. ``But if a doctor told him he risked serious future 
ramifications imperiling his ability to think long term or he 
risked possible brain damage, I think that would have an impact on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously had a couple of weeks to start thinking about  
the possibilities. And even if we do get a thumbs down from the 
doctors, we're not going to do anything precipitous. This is not 
John Elway leaving after a Super Bowl. Steve has been to training 
camp and he's been playing this season. He may need more time.''

<HEADLINE> Book: Clinton Rejected Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Torricelli, a close ally of  
President Clinton, includes in a new book the text of an 
apology-laced speech that he says Clinton considered but rejected 
before addressing the nation last year on his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech Clinton ultimately delivered to the nation on Aug.  
17, 1998, hours after testifying to a grand jury, was more critical 
than contrite. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and Clinton advisor Paul Begala denied Wednesday  
that Clinton ever actually reviewed the apologetic speech that 
Torricelli presents in his book entitled, ``In Our Own Words: 
Extraordinary Speeches of the American Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the rejected speech  
``appears to be a draft that was volunteered by someone outside the 
White House, and my understanding is it is not one that the 
president saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, stuck by his book's  
contention that the apologetic speech was a real option considered 
and rejected by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyzing why Clinton chose the speech he did, Torricelli writes  
that ``unbeknownst to even many of his closest advisors,'' Clinton 
was planning a military strike against Osama bin Laden and ``did 
not want either the United States or himself to appear weak before 
conducting the attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, the United States fired cruise missiles at  
eastern Afghanistan in an attempt to knock out suspected terrorist 
camps in retaliation for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East 
Africa two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli said Clinton also chose the second speech out of  
anger at questions he was asked hours earlier by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr and his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two versions are strikingly different.  
</P>
<P>
	The second version is no secret; it's the one he delivered to a  
television audience estimated at 67 million people. In it, Clinton 
said Starr's investigation ``has gone on too long, cost too much 
and hurt too many innocent people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begala said Democratic consultant Robert Shrum wrote and faxed  
to the White House what Torricelli describes as ``the original 
draft.'' A Shrum assistant said he was in meetings and not 
available for comment Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	That draft begins, ``No one who is not in my position can  
understand the remorse I feel today,'' and it includes an 
acknowledgment of responsibility ``for hurting my wife and 
daughter, for hurting Monica Lewinsky and her family, for hurting 
friends and staff, and for hurting the country I love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also contains the line, ``I never should have had any sexual  
contact with Monica Lewinsky, but I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech he delivered, Clinton did not mention ``sexual  
contact,'' admitting only to ``a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky 
that was not appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Farm Bailout Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate headed toward final approval of an  
$8.7 billion package of emergency farm assistance after turning 
aside protests from eastern senators who said their farmers were 
being shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 79-20 Tuesday to limit debate on the $69  
billion agricultural spending bill that includes the aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner we pass this legislation, the sooner we can assist  
the family farmer,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote on the legislation, which would send it to  
President Clinton for his signature, was expected this afternoon. 
The first checks could be going to farmers within a few weeks after 
the president signs the bill, said Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made no threat to veto the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	Senators from the Northeast are unhappy that it doesn't provide  
more money for growers hit by drought this year and allow New 
England states to continue fixing milk prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We in the East ... have always been there to vote for disaster  
assistance for other parts of the country even though it has not 
affected us,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the second big government bailout of the farm  
economy in as many years, and Democrats say that's evidence that 
the market-oriented farm policy that the Republican-controlled 
Congress enacted in 1996 isn't working. Commodity prices collapsed 
last year because of a worldwide glut of grain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is getting more and more expensive with fewer and  
fewer satisfied customers,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's aid package includes $5.5 billion to double the  
annual ``market transition'' payments that farmers were to have 
gotten this year and $1.4 billion in disaster relief, including 
$200 million earmarked for livestock producers. Additional money is 
targeted for tobacco, soybean and peanut growers and to reduce 
premiums that farmers pay for crop insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The market transition payments would go out first. Claims for  
disaster assistance would take much longer to process and may be 
paid in two installments, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders are considering providing additional  
assistance later for North Carolina producers whose land was 
flooded by Hurricane Floyd last month, said John Czwartacki, a 
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $1 billion in disaster relief will be needed by  
the end of the year, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
said today. ``We're going to be pushing for that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd destroyed $1 billion worth of crop and livestock in North  
Carolina alone, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the bill has been delayed several times, starting in  
late June when Senate Democrats tried to attach controls on HMOs. 
Last month, the bill was held up in a House-Senate conference for 
more than a week because Republican leaders refused to include 
provisions to allow sales of food and medicine to Cuba and overhaul 
the Agriculture Department's new milk-pricing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that the time is late, we need to get some  
assistance out to rural America,'' said Tom Buis, a lobbyist for 
the National Farmers Union.

<HEADLINE> Southern Miss Player Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Southern Mississippi baseball player  
Michael Artman, who set a school record with 106 hits this year, 
will miss the 2000 season while battling testicular cancer, 
according to baseball coach Corky Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Artman was diagnosed with testicular cancer in July and has  
undergone four sessions of chemotherapy. Palmer said Wednesday that 
doctors found a spot remaining in his abdomen that must be removed 
surgically. 
</P>
<P>
	Artman, a first baseman and center fielder, is scheduled for  
November surgery in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors say the treatment has gone pretty well,'' Palmer  
said in a statement. ``His (hormone) count had gone down to a much 
lower level from when the doctors first picked up that he had 
cancer. They say it's not unusual to have to go back and remove a 
couple of spots after chemotherapy. We just want Michael to beat 
this thing and apparently he is doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testicular cancer is treatable when detected in the early  
stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclist Lance Armstrong, the 1993 world road race champion, won  
Tour de France this month after learning in October 1996 that he 
had testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Artman, who batted .408 and finished the 1999 season with a  
20-game hitting streak, was diagnosed with cancer when he came home 
to Jackson on a break from playing summer baseball in Missouri. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clintons Discuss Science and Morals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking ahead to a day when one's health  
future could be known at birth and an interplanetary Internet 
system may orbit the heavens, President Clinton and the first lady 
hosted a discussion of the moral and practical questions raised by 
emerging sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions raised during the eighth Millennium Evening at  
the White House, which focused on genetic research and information 
technology, were more puzzling than others: 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I really want a mouse smart enough to go to Princeton?''  
Clinton quipped. ``Won't it be sad to have an Internet connection 
with Mars if there's no Martians to write to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday night event in the East Room, one of a series  
tackling weighty issues for the new millennium, dealt mostly with 
more serious matters, including how scientific advances have 
stimulated progress in the fields of health care, commerce and 
education while raising questions about privacy and intellectual 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the discussion were Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton and guests Vinton Cerf, a creator of the Internet, 
and Eric Lander, a professor of biomedical research and director of 
the Whitehead Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Center for Genome Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the evening to renew his calls for closing the  
technology gap between rich and poor Americans and public 
investment in scientific research. He also spoke in favor of 
protecting privacy at a time when science is looking ever deeper 
into human traits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on this,'' he said. ``It's very important  
to me.''

<HEADLINE> Profile of JonBenet's Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- When they met, she was a beauty queen and  
he was a pilot turned entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
	Patsy Paugh and John Ramsey fell in love, married and began a  
family. Business flourished and their family life blossomed amid a 
close circle of friends. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade of personal and professional prosperity, tragedy  
struck in 1992, when one of Ramsey's daughters from his first 
marriage, Elizabeth, was killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Tragedy struck a second time the next year, when Mrs. Ramsey was  
diagnosed with an advanced stage of ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys persevered, armed with their religious faith.  
</P>
<P>
	Then in 1996, a third tragedy thrust the family into a spotlight  
that has yet to fade. Their 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, was 
beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	While the parents have been under suspicion ever since, there  
was also evidence to back the theory that an intruder had killed 
the child beauty queen. On Wednesday, a county grand jury finished 
its 13-month investigation and a prosecutor said there was 
insufficient evidence to issue any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer  
remains free and undetected,'' the Ramseys said in a statement 
Wednesday. ``The Ramsey family lives in a nightmare. There has been 
no end to the public lynching and speculation which marred this 
case from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	The family asked that the investigation continue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Ramseys were the kindest, most loving parents that I've  
ever met,'' former family nanny Shirley Brady said shortly after 
JonBenet was killed. ``They never hit their children. I never heard 
them even speak a harsh word to their children. It's insane to 
think that the family could do anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Dec. 29, 1956, Mrs. Ramsey is the oldest of Donald and  
Nedra Paugh's three daughters. The family was active in both church 
and school in Parkersburg, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young girl, Mrs. Ramsey developed a reputation as a  
straight-arrow leader, who studied hard, enjoyed performing and 
frequently thought of others first. 
</P>
<P>
	In high school, Mrs. Ramsey discovered her love of beauty  
pageants, becoming first runner-up in the Miss Teen-Age West 
Virginia. She began competing for the ultimate crown of Miss 
America a few years later at West Virginia University. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a runner-up in two preliminary competitions before  
winning the Miss West Virginia title as a sophomore. At the 
national pageant, she took home a talent award and a $2,000 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her younger sister, Pamela, was crowned Miss West Virginia in  
1980, marking the first time a set of sisters has won the state 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ramsey graduated with a degree in journalism and  
advertising and moved to Atlanta, where she met Ramsey through 
mutual friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Nebraska in 1943, Ramsey moved with his family to  
Okemos, Mich., at age 14. His father, Jay, was a decorated World 
War II pilot before becoming director of the Michigan Aeronautics 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen-ager, Ramsey competed in cross-country and played in  
the band, and nurtured a love of aviation he inherited from his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined ROTC at Michigan State University, where he also met  
his first wife, Lucinda ``Cindy'' Lou Pasch. They were married in 
1966 and moved to the Philippines, where Ramsey spent two years as 
a Navy pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After they returned to Michigan, Ramsey earned a master's degree  
in marketing from Michigan State in 1971. He accepted an Atlanta 
sales job with an electronics engineering company in 1973, before 
eventually striking out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife had three children, Elizabeth, Melinda and John,  
before divorcing in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 15, 1980, he married Patricia Ann Paugh, 14 years his  
junior. Their first child was Burke, and then came the little girl 
Mrs. Ramsey had dreamed of, JonBenet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Ramsey founded Access Graphics in Boulder, which was  
later acquired by Lockheed Martin. Access Graphics grossed more 
than $1 billion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After the killing, the Ramseys moved to the Atlanta area to be  
near relatives. Ramsey quit Access Graphics, while Mrs. Ramsey 
remains a stay-at-home mother who is active in her son's life.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in JonBenet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A grand jury decided there was  
insufficient evidence to indict anyone in the JonBenet Ramsey 
slaying, ending a 13-month investigation into the case, District 
Attorney Alex Hunter announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Boulder County grand jury has completed its work and will  
not return,'' Hunter said. ``No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must report to you that I and my prosecutorial team believe  
we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges 
against anyone who has been investigated at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 jurors, who have met for more than 13 months, left the  
Boulder County Justice Center without comment about two hours 
before Hunter issued a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter declined to answer questions and said he would meet with  
the news media Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutal crime set off a drawn-out, controversial search for  
her killer. 
</P>
<P>
	The prominence of the family -- the father, John Ramsey, the  
millionaire president of Access Graphics, the mother, Patsy Ramsey, 
a former Miss West Virginia -- and the beauty of the little blond 
victim guaranteed worldwide attention for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was before dawn on the day after Christmas in 1996 when Patsy  
Ramsey says she found a 2 1/2-page ransom note on the back staircase 
in the family's upscale home that demanded $118,000 for the safe 
return of JonBenet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen Carefully!'' the note begins. ``We are a group of  
individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We respect your 
business but not the country that it serves. At this time we have 
your daughter in our possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight hours later, Ramsey says he found his daughter's body in a  
basement room, wrapped in a white blanket. A rope was wrapped 
around her neck and a wrist and tied to a stick. 
</P>
<P>
	A red-ink heart was drawn on her left palm, and Ramsey told  
police he removed duct tape from the child's mouth before carrying 
her body upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy concluded JonBenet suffered a skull fracture, was  
strangled and beaten, and may have been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics claimed the investigation was compromised early when  
detectives, believing they were dealing with a kidnapping, allowed 
friends and family to roam through the Ramsey mansion. They also 
asked Ramsey to conduct a search, which led to the discovery of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation also was fractured by infighting between  
police and prosecutors over the best way to proceed. Two 
investigators resigned; one accused prosecutors of protecting the 
Ramseys and blocking police efforts to solve the case, while the 
other contended his fellow officers were improperly targeting 
innocent people, including the Ramseys. 
</P>
<P>
	The two investigators embody the two theories about JonBenet's  
killer: one focused on the parents; the other on an intruder. The 
Ramseys, who now live in suburban Atlanta, have repeatedly denied 
any involvement in the crime. They offered a $100,000 reward and 
mounted a newspaper campaign seeking JonBenet's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities amassed evidence that supported both theories.  
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests concluded the ransom note was written with a pen and  
pad that belonged to the Ramseys. Handwriting experts ruled Ramsey 
out as the author, but said Mrs. Ramsey's writing samples were 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents concluded four fibers on  
the duct tape allegedly taken from JonBenet's mouth were consistent 
with a jacket her mother wore Christmas night, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence pointing to an intruder includes a broken basement  
window and an apparent pry mark found on a kitchen doorjamb, but 
there were no signs of forced entry into the home or footprints in 
the snow outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Other evidence of an intruder: Investigators have been unable to  
identify DNA material found in JonBenet's underwear, a pubic hair 
found on the blanket or a palm print pulled from the wine cellar 
door, published reports have stated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boulder County grand jury of eight women and four men began  
hearing evidence in the case in September 1998, listening to 
testimony from family, friends and police detectives. Its term was 
set to expire Oct. 20.

<HEADLINE> Morning News Shows Disappoint NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When ``The Early Show'' debuts on CBS on Nov. 1,  
the top three networks will have morning news shows that look 
remarkably alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually a terrible indictment of television that we've  
ended up with three programs now that look so much like each 
other,'' NBC News President Andrew Lack said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he was disappointed in ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
which last month debuted an audience-participation studio in Times 
Square modeled after the success of the NBC ``Today'' show window 
in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ``The Early Show'' starts in less than three weeks with  
former ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel from another Manhattan studio 
that allows passers-by to peer in. The three shows will have 
similar mixes of news and features, with local news cut-ins at the 
same times each morning. 
</P>
<P>
	With the morning TV market increasingly lucrative, ABC and CBS  
are bearing down hard against ``Today,'' which last week celebrated 
its 200th consecutive week atop the ratings. Television producers 
are notorious imitators of what's been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he could understand why third-place CBS, given its  
longtime struggles in the time slot, would want to try a show with 
Gumbel, who left ``Today'' in the midst of its run at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he wishes viewers had a dramatically different choice  
in the morning, although he acknowledged he's not sure what that 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	```GMA,' oddly for me, is not easy to understand,'' he said.  
``I'm a little disappointed that they have chosen to go the route 
they have gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokeswoman said ``Good Morning America'' has been doing  
several innovative things in the past few weeks, including 
launching a series of town meetings with presidential candidates 
and a two-hour program on happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps Mr. Lack isn't watching our program as closely as our  
viewers,'' said ABC's Eileen Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``Today'' will be moving into battle temporarily  
without its leader. Executive producer Jeff Zucker is undergoing 
surgery Friday for a pre-cancerous growth on his colon, and will be 
absent four to six weeks. Zucker was treated for colon cancer two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 1, former ``Today'' host and author Deborah Norville  
returns to the show for the first time as a guest. Her replacement 
of Jane Pauley at ``Today'' precipitated a ratings slide a decade 
ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- San Franciscans can now hail a cab -- and a  
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet company Yahoo! has brokered a deal with Luxor Cab Co.  
to bring online cabs to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The cabs come equipped with a two-and-a-half-pound laptop  
nestled between two armrests in the front seat and a modem attached 
to the dash. The computer plugs into the cab's cigarette lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement with the cab company lasts four months, and Yahoo  
hopes that's long enough for riders to get hooked on the 
technology.

after the four-month trial, or expanding the technology to another

<HEADLINE>  Chamberlain: Fame Transcended Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain dominated basketball for  
decades, setting records that will probably stand forever and even 
forcing the sport to change its rules to make it harder for him to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, the 7-foot-1 center who once scored 100 points in a  
game and whose grace and power made him one of the elite athletes 
in any sport, died at his Bel-Air home Tuesday. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt was the greatest offensive player I have ever seen,''  
said Bill Russell, Chamberlain's greatest rival and the center for 
the championship Boston Celtics of the '60s. ``Because his talent 
and skills were so super human, his play forced me to play at my 
highest level. If I didn't, I'd risk embarrassment and our team 
would likely lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was found dead in his bed at his Bel-Air home at  
about 12:30 p.m. PDT, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs he might have had a heart attack, authorities  
said. Chamberlain was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat in 
1992, and his agent, Sy Goldberg, said the Hall of Famer was on 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired in 1973, Chamberlain had more points and more  
rebounds than any NBA player, and he will always be remembered for 
epic battles against Russell and the Celtics. Chamberlain, 4 inches 
taller than Russell, often seemed to be viewed as the villain in 
his classic matchups against the Celtics' center. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Lakers' teammate Jerry West said he once told  
Chamberlain, ``Nobody roots for Goliath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Auerbach, coach of those great Boston teams, admired  
Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain had a great deal to do with the success of  
the NBA,'' Auerbach said. ``His dominance, power, demeanor and the 
rivalry with Bill Russell says it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain starred in the NBA from 1959 through 1973, when he  
played for the Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, 
76ers and Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 31,419 points during his career, a record until Kareem  
Abdul-Jabbar broke it in 1984. Chamberlain never fouled out in 
1,205 regular-season and playoff games and he holds the record for 
career rebounding with 23,924. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see  
another one like him,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, an NBA rookie 11 years after Chamberlain  
retired, said: ``His legacy as one of the NBA's greatest players 
and his achievements will stand for all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who began his professional career with the Harlem  
Globetrotters in 1958, was one of only two men to win the MVP and 
rookie of the year awards in the same season (1959-60). He was also 
MVP in 1966 through 1968. He led the NBA in scoring seven straight 
seasons, 1960-66, and led the league in rebounding 11 of his 14 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We truly lost one of the icons of professional basketball and,  
more importantly for myself, someone who I've known for almost 40 
years,'' said a teary-eyed West, now the Lakers vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chamberlain retired, he made news of a different sort,  
stirring controversy -- and a litany of jokes -- by claiming in his 
1991 biography that he had had sex with 20,000 women, averaging 1.2 
a day from the time he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	His boast sparked wide reaction and became a sort of standard  
for extreme sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic Johnson, who revealed shortly after the book was published  
that he had contracted the AIDS virus. Johnson commented, ``I'm no 
Wilt Chamberlain, but as I traveled around NBA cities, I was never 
at a loss for female companionship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was such a force that the NBA changed some of its  
rules, including widening the lane to try to keep him and his 
finger-roll farther away from the goal. He also prompted the sport 
to institute offensive goaltending and revise rules governing 
inbounding the ball and shooting free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	His most famous record is the 100 points he scored in the  
Philadelphia Warriors' 169-147 defeat of the New York Knicks on 
March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 12 years in his armpits, and I always carried that  
100-point game on my shoulders,'' Darrall Imhoff, the former Knicks 
center, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I got my third foul, I said to one of the officials,  
Willy Smith, 'Why don't you just give him 100 points and we'll all 
go home?' Well, we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain also holds the single-game record for rebounds, 55,  
against the Russell-led Celtics in 1960. He averaged 30.1 points in 
his career, including a record 50.4 in the 1961-62 season with 
Philadelphia. He also was one of the most versatile big men ever, 
with an NBA-high 702 assists in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain led his team into the NBA playoffs 13 times, but won  
just two championships. The first came in 1966-67 with the 
Philadelphia 76ers, the second in 1971-72 with the Lakers, who won 
a record 33 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams lost in the finals four other times and were beaten in  
the conference final six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell and the Celtics almost always seemed to be the stoppers  
for Chamberlain-led teams, beating them twice in the championship 
series and five times in the conference finals. Three times, a 
series was decided by a seventh game that Boston won by either one 
or two points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many have called our competition the greatest rivalry in the  
history of sports,'' Russell said. ``We didn't have a rivalry; we 
had a genuinely fierce competition that was based on friendship and 
respect. We just loved playing against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fierceness of the competition bonded us as friends for  
eternity. We loved competition. Wilt loved competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born Aug. 21, 1936, in  
Philadelphia and didn't play basketball until he was in seventh 
grade. He grew 4 inches in three months when he was 15 and was 6-11 
when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading Overbrook to three public school championships and  
two all-city titles, Chamberlain became one of the most recruited 
players ever as more than 200 colleges expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the University of Kansas and Hall of Fame coach Phog  
Allen. In his first game against the Kansas varsity -- freshmen 
weren't allowed to compete against other teams then -- he scored 50 
points before a packed Allen Fieldhouse crowd of more than 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Chamberlain scored 52 points against Northwestern  
in his first game, a total he never surpassed in college, partly 
because of zone defenses designed to keep him from getting the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sophomore, he led the 1957 Jayhawks to the NCAA tournament  
finals, where Kansas lost to unbeaten North Carolina in triple 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by the smothering zone defenses, Chamberlain left  
Kansas after his junior year and went barnstorming with the 
Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, extremely agile for his size, ran cross-country in  
high school and was an outstanding high jumper and shot-putter at 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained active after his NBA career and was considered an  
outstanding volleyball player. He also ran in the Honolulu marathon 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Chamberlain made his first official visit to  
Kansas since his college career ended 40 years earlier. His jersey 
was raised to the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned in life that you have to take the bitter with the  
sweet, and how sweet this is,'' Chamberlain said at the ceremony, 
obviously touched. 
</P>
<P>
	West knew that side of him.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a smart guy, he was well-read. He was an authority on  
everything. He had this bluster about him,'' West said. ``And on 
the inside, he was a soft guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain is survived by sisters Barbara Lewis, Margaret Lane,  
Selina Gross and Yvonne Chamberlain, and brothers Wilbert and 
Oliver Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are pending.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Bluegrass Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- They call their annual industry summit a  
family reunion and celebrate old-timers as much as or more than the 
hottest new acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bluegrass music community is a uniquely gentle animal in a  
largely dog-eat-dog industry. And the laid-back, music-first 
attitude has been attracting homesick stars from its increasingly 
pop-orientated cousin, country music. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolly Parton recently released a bluegrass album. And Jim  
Lauderdale, Steve Earle and Tom T. Hall have all done bluegrass 
albums in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 bluegrass devotees will converge on Louisville,  
Ky., from Oct. 18-24 for a week of events highlighted by the 
International Bluegrass Music Awards Show on Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	To mark the 10th anniversary of the awards, every former host  
was invited back. Hall, Ricky Skaggs, John McEuen, Mac Wiseman, Tim 
O'Brien, Joe Diffie, Laurie Lewis, John Hartford and Rhonda Vincent 
will share master of ceremonies duties this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not about glitz. In fact, the bluegrass awards are not even  
televised, which is the reason many awards shows exist at all. A 
radio show syndicated after-the-fact to about 300 stations gives 
the bluegrass awards its primary national exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of glamour is fine with the fans who pay $55 to immerse  
themselves in bluegrass for a week. Many are musicians themselves, 
and are more interested in participating than watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should see the hotel (The Galt House) during that week,''  
said Skaggs, a country star who has returned to the bluegrass fold. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's people playing in the hallways, people playing in the  
elevators. Every floor you stop on, there's a jam going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bluegrass got its name from Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys,  
who invented the form in the 1930s. Fast, intricate and dominated 
by acoustic strings and tight vocal harmonies, bluegrass became 
marginalized in the 1950s when country music artists reacted to the 
rise of rock 'n' roll by putting more emphasis on drums and 
electric guitars. 
</P>
<P>
	Still primarily acoustic and drumless, bluegrass benefited from  
the folk music revival of the 1960s and has developed separately 
from the rest of country music ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	It is popular enough today to support more than 500 music  
festivals each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	This year at the IBMA Awards, Skaggs and his band, Kentucky  
Thunder, are up for the entertainer of the year award, along with 
Blue Highway, Lonesome River Band, The Del McCoury Band and IIIrd 
Time Out. 
</P>
<P>
	Best male vocalist nominees are McCoury, Skaggs, Ronnie Bowman,  
Dudley Connell, James King and Russell Moore. The best female 
vocalist finalists are Lewis, Vincent, Alison Krauss, Claire Lynch 
and Lynn Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	The influx of well-known country singers has helped boost  
bluegrass sales, which are at near record levels, according to Dan 
Hays, executive director of the IBMA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bluegrass tends to be what you call an 'evergreen' music,''  
Hays said. ``You don't ever see a huge spike in sales. It just 
sails along in its own little niche. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the past five or six years, it's done better than ever,  
except for that short time in the 1960s when there was the folk 
music revival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs, named best entertainer by the Country Music Association  
in 1985, rededicated himself to bluegrass after Monroe's death in 
1996. He has since started a bluegrass record label called Skaggs 
Family Records. His most recent release is a gospel album, 
``Soldier of the Cross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs said there is less competition among bluegrass artists  
than country music singers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something here in Nashville where everybody's kind of  
on-the-spot all the time,'' Skaggs said. ``They feel like they have 
to be on performance mode, that light switch turned on all the 
time. ... There's a lot of the newer acts that really don't have a 
relationship with some of the older guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs said the controversy that surrounded this year's Country  
Music Association Awards -- singer George Jones boycotted the show 
after being asked to shorten his performance -- could never happen 
at the bluegrass awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that country music doesn't honor its elders, and is  
willing to put them out to pasture,'' Skaggs said. ``In bluegrass 
music, the elders are honored.''

<HEADLINE> Survey Studies Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Today's small business is profitable and  
optimistic about staying that way, though it usually operates 
without any formal business plan, provides little or no benefits to 
employees and still primarily depends upon word of mouth to sell 
products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	At least that's the general profile that emerges from a  
comprehensive new survey conducted over the summer by The Willard &AMP; 
Shullman Group (WSG) in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The market research firm questioned 525 small business owners --  
each of whom employs fewer than 500 workers -- on everything from 
profits and financing to what concerns keep them burning the 
midnight oil. 
</P>
<P>
	WSG said it conducted the survey to help its large-business  
clients, including many Fortune 500 companies, increase their sales 
to small businesses by better understanding them. The result: a 
more intimate look at one of the most important, and least 
understood, sectors of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Small business as an aggregate employs half of the workers in  
the United States and produces half of the GDP (Gross Domestic 
Product), yet for some reason none of us knows anything about 
them,'' Robert Shullman, president of the WSG, said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole small business market in America is just materially  
misunderstood,'' he added. ``The small company is probably more 
successful in figuring out how to sell to the big company than the 
other way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there's a good explanation for this lack of  
knowledge: There are roughly 10 million small businesses operating 
in this country, and their attitudes and behaviors are just as 
diverse as the products and services they sell and the regions 
where they sell them. And trying to learn more about them can be 
difficult since many of them are far from technologically savvy, a 
fact born out in the WSG survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Case and point: Only one in seven of those surveyed considered  
their firms to be technologically advanced, while one in four saw 
themselves as behind the times. Twenty-eight percent reported that 
they currently weren't using the Internet in their business, while 
14 percent said they still had no immediate plans to go online in 
the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology most widely used by small businesses was the fax  
machine, with 82 percent saying they regularly depended on it in 
their operations. Seventy-one percent routinely used cell phones 
and personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-four percent said they used the Internet for obtaining  
business information, while 45 percent reported that they used the 
Internet to communicate with others. By the year 2001, however, 54 
percent planned to use Internet applications for advertising and 
promotion, 41 percent to sell products or services, and 38 percent 
to find suppliers and make purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what's the primary sales and marketing channel used by most  
of them right now? Word of mouth and referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-one percent reported conducting business that way, and 61  
percent said it was their most successful channel. Nineteen percent 
said the Web was their most successful sales and marketing channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the sophisticated technology today, the fact that  
'word of mouth' is still the most significant way of marketing, 
that blew me away,'' said Shullman. 
</P>
<P>
	Shullman says other results of the survey were equally as  
surprising. Less than half, or 41 percent, actually had an annual 
business plan, annual budget or long-range business plan in 
writing. The rest approached business planning by the ``seat of 
their pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some results were more predictable.  
</P>
<P>
	Small business owners primarily looked to their own personal  
resources for capital. The predominant sources of their financing 
are: themselves, 41 percent; cash advances from personal credit 
cards, 36 percent; and personal lines of credit, 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-two percent of all business owners reported being  
profitable in 1998, while 26 percent lost money. Sixty-four percent 
anticipated growth and expansion in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter of those surveyed said they offered no benefits to  
their employees. 
</P>
<P>
	So what keeps small business owners up late at night? The top  
eight concerns were: operating expenses, cash flow, profitability, 
revenue, government regulations, pricing of products or services, 
hiring qualified staff, and size of their customer or client base. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage  
points.

<HEADLINE> Agent Reveals How Chamberlain Died </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain, who lived life on a scale  
that befitted his size, realized he had a heart problem. He didn't 
let that slow him down. 
</P>
<P>
	After towering above his basketball teammates and foes for two  
decades, Chamberlain continued to run marathons, play volleyball 
and pump iron until his heart finally gave out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about a physical giant of a man. He was still  
that until recently,'' Chamberlain's lawyer and longtime friend, Sy 
Goldberg, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always involved in a lot of things, and he kept going  
like he always had, almost until the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, an overpowering, 7-foot-1 center whose dominance  
changed the game of basketball, died Tuesday in his Bel-Air home at 
age 63. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had congestive heart failure,'' Goldberg said. ``He had  
deteriorated relatively quickly over the last month or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are scheduled Saturday at 10 a.m. at City of  
Angels Church of Religious Science. There will be limited seating 
for the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain lost 30 or 40 pounds the past few weeks as doctors  
drained his legs of fluid that accumulated because of his heart 
trouble, Goldberg said after speaking with his friend's 
cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was hospitalized seven years ago with an irregular  
heartbeat and was said to have complained of arrhythmia since he 
was in his early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most likely, with a man of his age group dying suddenly, it  
would be from blockage in the blood vessels, causing an irregular 
heartbeat, regardless of his past medical history,'' said Dr. 
Michele Hamilton, associate clinical professor of cardiology at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's sister, Barbara Lewis, said her brother underwent  
dental surgery last week and looked worse than she had ever seen 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cardiac situation was the main thing,'' Goldberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Chamberlain had a heart problem surfaced in the  
early 1960s, but he denied them. Then he was hospitalized for three 
days in 1992 for the mild arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those closest to Chamberlain didn't know how bad the  
problem was. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it had been a little trouble for him, but we weren't  
aware that it could be serious. We did hear something about it a 
few years back,'' Chamberlain's sister, Selina Gross, said from her 
Philadelphia home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe all the playing and activity caused some wear on his  
heart. But he took care of himself and went to the doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Wilt the Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper,'' Chamberlain  
played 14 NBA seasons, with the Philadelphia (later San Francisco) 
Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He won championship rings with the 76ers in 1967 and the Lakers  
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 2, 1962, in one of the most spectacular performances  
ever in any sport, he scored a record 100 points in a game against 
the New York Knicks at Hershey, Pa. He also grabbed a record 55 
rebounds against the Boston Celtics on Nov. 24, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 31,419 points, a record broken by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  
in 1984, and grabbed a record 23,924 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA eventually widened the lane under the basket to keep  
Chamberlain and other big men out from camping out under the hoop. 
The league also changed its rules to prohibit running starts from 
the line on missed free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain prompted that by sometimes running up to the line  
and soaring into the lane after one of his many missed free throws 
to grab the rebound and dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	That option gone, he continued to try to improve his miserable  
free-throw shooting, at times attempting jump shots from the line, 
at others throwing up two-handed underhands. He shot a miserable 
46.5 percent from the line for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was that one memorable night from the line 37 years  
ago -- he hit 28 of 32 on his way to 100 points.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Set for Reunion With Jaguars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Mark Brunell credits Chris Palmer with fixing  
his mechanics and making him a better quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer shaped Jacksonville's high-scoring offense and kept the  
Jaguars loose with practical jokes in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	And now that he's gone, the Jaguars must miss their former  
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Not the case, Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was easy to replace,'' Palmer said. ``They didn't even hire  
a guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, of course, was talking about himself. Following last  
season, his second as an assistant in Jacksonville, Palmer left for 
Cleveland and his first head coaching job with the expansion 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	And this week, Palmer, who has kept his dry sense of humor as  
the losses have piled up in Cleveland, returns to Jacksonville as 
the winless Browns play the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second time this year Palmer will face an  
opponent he knows firsthand. Last month, when the Browns played New 
England, Palmer was torn as he coached against players he worked 
with for four years as an assistant with the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer is looking forward to the challenge, but says these  
reunion games take an emotional toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough when you play against someone you know,''  
Palmer said. ``It's hard because you know the coaches and you know 
the players. The New England game was very difficult for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a relationship with players, it's tough to  
go back and compete against them. You spent two years with a team 
where you put your heart and soul and everything into it, and now 
you're trying to tear it down. It's always difficult to go back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And after reviewing game film of the Jaguars (4-1), Palmer said  
there is another disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can also make you not sleep all week, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville has been a coaching pipeline the past few years as  
first Kevin Gilbride, then Palmer and defensive coordinator Dick 
Jauron left Tom Coughlin's staff for top jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jauron departed for Chicago, he was replaced by Dom Capers.  
Under Capers, the Jaguars' defense has flourished and enters this 
Sunday as the top-ranked unit in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	After interviewing several candidates, Coughlin decided not  
replace Palmer, electing instead to run the offense himself this 
year, calling the plays for the first time since he was at Boston 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville's offense may be suffering for it. Brunell's stats  
are way down -- three TDs and four interceptions -- and the Jaguars' 
are ranked just 14th in the league in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Palmer's loss have had something to do with the dropoff?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' Coughlin said. ``I don't think that's been  
the circumstance. You have to move forward. It had always been in 
the back of my mind to see if I could go back and assume a little 
more responsibility. When Chris left I did interview some people 
but I did not feel like that was the direction we were going to go 
in. I just thought that this was best for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell, whose strained relationship with Coughlin has been a  
hot topic in Jacksonville this season, said he misses Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Palmer was one of the best quarterback coaches I ever  
had,'' Brunell said. ``He helped me with every aspect of my game. 
My mechanics, my reads. He worked on my fundamentals. He's just a 
great guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We miss him like we'd miss any great coach that has gone on.  
He was great to have, not only as a coach, but as a person. And we 
certainly have a lot less practical jokes going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell and Palmer are good friends, who occasionally like to  
have some fun at the other's expense. 
</P>
<P>
	During summer training camp, Brunell had a special note shipped  
overnight to Palmer, the contents of which the Browns coach said 
were personal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got me good,'' Palmer said. ``He knows when he can take his  
shots. I owe him one.''

<HEADLINE>  No-Go Again for Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young still believes he has a  
football future. The San Francisco 49ers are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, still troubled by side effects from his fourth concussion  
in three years, underwent a series of neurological tests Wednesday. 
Again, he failed to gain medical clearance to rejoin the 49ers on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	While Young viewed Dr. Gary Steinberg's ruling as a temporary  
setback, it comes amid signs that his family, friends and some team 
officials want him to consider retirement rather than resume 
playing and expose himself to another damaging hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people are suggesting the `R' word to him,'' a somber  
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``He doesn't like hearing it, but sooner 
or later he's going to need to admit it to himself, say it and 
believe that it's right. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't come to that just yet, but eventually that will  
occur. I can't tell you when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, a two-time NFL MVP who led the 49ers to their last  
Super Bowl championship in 1994, said he is taking the concerns 
about his health to heart, but doesn't think his viewpoint is that 
different from anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my family and friends are saying what I'm saying: If  
there's concern, then we shouldn't do it,'' Young said. ``If there 
isn't and you can work through it and the doctor feels good about 
it, there's nothing mysterious about it. It's pretty cut and dried. 
I really want to play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers remain wary, and they are in no hurry to see Young  
back on the field. Even if he eventually receives medical 
clearance, the 49ers likely would hold him out for several more 
weeks to make sure he's all right. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Young is still dealing with postconcussion  
symptoms of fatigue and wooziness 2 1/2 weeks after the head blow. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who endured two concussions in 1996 and another in the  
1997 season opener, suffered the latest one when he was leveled by 
blitzing Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams and struck his head on 
tackle Dave Fiore's knee before slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the symptoms are lasting a little bit longer than they  
did before,'' Mariucci said. ``In previous concussions, he has 
recovered sooner. That in itself is the concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medical team led by Steinberg, the chief of neurosurgery at  
Stanford Medical School, will eventually either clear Young to 
resume playing or determine there are too many health risks and 
recommend he retire. Repeated concussions can lead to premature 
senility and other kinds of brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand about concussions,'' Young said. ``I'm a resident  
expert. I know I can't risk the future and I have a full life ahead 
of me. I don't want to miss any of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's confident he'll receive clearance at some point,  
but refused to put a timetable on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no D-Day to it. It's an ongoing process,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci raised the possibility that he and general manager Bill  
Walsh might take a more active role in deciding Young's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not there today, but there will come a point where a  
decision has to be made,'' Mariucci said. `If it were ever to fall 
in our laps, we would make a very conservative decision. Steve's 
health is more important than anything, where we play, who's the 
backup, our Super Bowl chances, the whole thing. Steve's health is 
A-No. 1 in our decision, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, in his 15th NFL season, has so far resisted the calls to  
quit, saying he still has a passion to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing close attention, and I'm concerned about it  
just like everybody else,'' said Carolina fullback William Floyd, a 
teammate of Young on San Francisco's 1994 Super Bowl team. ``This 
is like the fourth or fifth time in as many years, and it's scary 
to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as Young wants to play, he won't ignore a recommendation  
from his doctors to quit if that's what it comes to, said his 
agent, Leigh Steinberg, who is not related to the neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Jerry Rice added he believes Young is at the point  
where he needs a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's dealing with the situation pretty well under the  
circumstances,'' Rice said. ``I don't know exactly which direction 
he's going to go, but I think he's ready to make a decision.''

<HEADLINE> Cable Gains Boost Time Warner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. reported third-quarter net  
income of $360 million, bouncing back from a loss a year ago as big 
gains from cable TV offset weaker results in its music and 
television studios. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest media and entertainment company reported  
Wednesday its earnings were equivalent to 27 cents per share and 
compared to a loss of $37 million, or 3 cents a share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 2 percent to $6.72 billion from $6.59 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's third-quarter profits were lifted by one-time  
gains from the sale and exchange of cable systems, a process cable 
providers use to concentrate their subscribers in specific 
geographic areas. But even without those gains, the company's 
pre-tax cash flow -- a measurement widely used by financial analysts 
-- rose by 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. Time  
Warner's stock started higher but fell $1.25 to $62.06 1/4 as 
prices fell overall on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's stock has been sliding from about $77 since  
mid-July, when the co-chairmen of the Warner Bros. music and movie 
studio resigned abruptly. The stock took another hit this summer 
after a prominent analyst cautioned that Time Warner's music 
earnings would be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from its cable systems, Time Warner also posted stronger  
results in its large magazine publishing division, Time Inc., and 
its cable networks division, which includes CNN, HBO and Cinemax. 
Time Inc. has been reaping benefits from two successful magazine 
launches, Teen People and InStyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The main signs of weakness during the quarter were in the music  
division, where results were off at Time Warner's half-owned 
Columbia House direct sales business, and in movie and TV 
production, where earnings a year ago were pumped up by syndicated 
sales of ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an overall decline in its filmed entertainment division,  
Time Warner well at the box office this summer with the ``Austin 
Powers'' sequel in the United States and with the releases of ``The 
Matrix'' and ``Wild Wild West'' overseas. ``The Matrix'' also had 
big sales in the new DVD format in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin said that despite the decline  
in music earnings this quarter he expected profits to turn up 
modestly next year, when the company plans new releases from 
Madonna, Tracy Chapman and others. ``This year, we didn't have a 
lot of the major acts we had before,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner also posted a wider loss at its growing WB network,  
which is entering its sixth season. The network is doing well with 
young viewers with shows like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' but 
Time Warner blamed the larger loss on steeper costs for programming 
and expanding the number of stations that carry WB. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Time Warner earned $1.06  
billion, or 81 cents a share, compared to a loss of $158 million, 
or 13 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenues 
rose 2 percent to $19.35 billion from $18.98 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-month figures for this year were inflated by the cable  
deals as well as a one-time gain from the early termination of a 
long-term video distribution agreement with MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
	With 13 million subscribers, Time Warner is the nation's  
second-largest cable provider after AT&AMP;T Corp. In September, Time 
Warner launched its jointly owned Road Runner hi-speed cable 
Internet access service in New York City and eight other markets, 
bringing its subscriber base to 420,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Time Warner floated shares in its year-old phone service  
subsidiary, Time Warner Telecom. Like other major cable companies, 
Time Warner is hoping to use its cable TV lines to deliver phone 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first quarter that Time Warner reported fully  
consolidated results from its Time Warner Entertainment subsidiary, 
which holds many of its movie, TV and cable assets. The cable 
provider MediaOne, which holds a 25 percent stake in the 
subsidiary, ceded management rights over its interest to Time 
Warner in August. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which is in the process of acquiring MediaOne, has been  
negotiating with Time Warner over how to restructure the ownership 
of the TWE unit. Time Warner and AT&AMP;T have already agreed to 
cooperate on providing phone service over Time Warner's cable 
lines, a process AT&AMP;T has undertaken with its many new cable 
properties.

<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Bantamweight boxer Carlos Barreto died  
from head injuries Tuesday, four days after he was knocked out 
during a bout, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreto, 23, an interim World Boxing Association champion, fell  
into a coma Saturday after he was hit by fellow Venezuelan Jose 
Luis Valbuena in the 10th round of a match for the Latin American 
super bantamweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Tuesday night, his mother, Nora de Barreto told The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreto was ranked No. 5 by the WBA. He had a 9-3-1 record with  
nine knockouts as a professional boxer since 1996.

<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- David A. Huffman, who turned his  
college term paper into a computer coding procedure still in use 
four decades later, died of cancer Thursday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman developed the Huffman Coding Procedure, a mathematical  
technique still vital to data storage and transmission. The 
procedure assigns strings of 0's and 1's to each character in a 
file. 
</P>
<P>
	The codes are used to manage files in large computer systems;  
compress text, image and audio files; and compress data for 
transmission by fax machines, modems and high-definition television 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffman created the system while a graduate student in the 1950s  
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

glass-making method made the fiber-optics revolution possible, died 
Monday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's pioneering work with ultra-pure glass at Corning Glass  
Works in 1934 was used in radar during World War II. It didn't gain 
wide use until the 1960s when it led to durable spaceship windows, 
galaxy-gazing telescopes, precision lenses to build computer chips 
and signal-carrying optical fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	Optical fiber is now Corning Inc.'s biggest business.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised at some of the things it has gone into, but I'm  
not surprised at the versatility of such a beautiful and useful

	Nichols, a 1926 University of Kansas graduate, joined the  
university staff in 1929. He worked for the university for 44

</P>
<P>
	Williams, a 20-year Navy veteran, earned three Purple Hearts,  
three Bronze Stars, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, the Navy and

<P>
	He retired from the Navy in 1967 as a Petty Officer 1st Class  
and was appointed U.S. marshal for South Carolina, his home state. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> CBS Airs Columbine Chaos Snippets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A grainy, jerky piece of videotape culled from a  
surveillance camera in the Columbine High School cafeteria shows a 
gunman kneeling in a rifleman's pose and firing across the 
scattered tables and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``CBS Evening News'' and some of the network's affiliates  
Tuesday aired choppy snippets of the tape that documented a few 
terrifying seconds of the April 20 rampage that left 15 people 
dead, including the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	The footage was videotaped off a large projection screen at a  
training seminar for law enforcement and emergency workers by 
KRQE-TV, a CBS affiliate in Albuquerque, N.M. No bodies are seen on 
the tape; there were no fatalities in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The film had been released by Jefferson County sheriff's  
department to law enforcement and emergency response agencies to be 
used for training purposes, Sgt. Phil Domenico said. 
</P>
<P>
	But other county officials and some parents of students who were  
gunned down during the rampage were outraged that the footage was 
aired nationally. They asked local stations not to show it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe that it should be shown, that people need to  
see it, that it's going to help in any way, shape or form,'' said 
Rick Kaufman, a spokesman for the Jefferson County schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The silent tape begins with a scene of bustling students around  
lunchtime, then shows a bomb exploding. Students scatter and 
collide as they duck under tables in a frantic effort to evade 
bombs and gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials tried unsuccessfully to stop the tape from  
being broadcast, said Barbara Monseu, the school district 
administrator in Jefferson County. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels, whose son, Isaiah, was killed at Columbine,  
didn't see the tape but said he hopes the dramatic footage will 
open people's eyes to the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's good that America can see the heinous crimes that  
went on up at that school,'' Shoels said. ``People need to see what 
happened. Maybe if people saw it we could all learn from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Salamone, news director for the Albuquerque affiliate, said  
the tape was in the public domain and said pulling it off the air 
would be unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	KRQE aired about 40 seconds of the nearly two minute tape on  
Monday newscasts. CBS ran a shorter version nationally Tuesday, as 
did other CBS affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was certainly our editorial judgment to run it. We think it  
has news value,'' said Kim Akhtar, spokeswoman for ``CBS Evening 
News.'' She said the tape was carefully edited and didn't show 
graphic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grand Junction, KREX-TV news director Ellen Miller said the  
station will talk to school and law enforcement officials before 
making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to talk to school people and police people to see  
if they believe there is value for them to plan for school 
safety,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But from a blood and guts standpoint, there is really no  
reason not to (show it),'' Miller said. ``You can't see anyone shot 
and there are no bodies lying on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others chose not to broadcast the footage.  
</P>
<P>
	``After weighing the journalistic merits of the tape, we have  
decided not to air it on our local broadcasts,'' anchorman Bill 
Stuart of KCNC-TV told viewers of Tuesday's 5 p.m. newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Sean Graves, who was shot just outside the cafeteria and  
is partially paralyzed, decided against viewing the tape. He did 
homework in his room while the program aired. 
</P>
<P>
	But his mother, Natalie Graves, said she cried as she watched it  
in their Littleton home and felt ``great sadness and horror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to hear or read about it, and another thing to  
see it,'' she said. ``I have to say, I wish it wasn't out. But I 
knew that it was going to come out. It was just a matter of time.''

<HEADLINE> Apple Turns Profit on Strong Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. closed out its fiscal  
year with an eighth straight quarterly profit, topping Wall Street 
forecasts that were trimmed after last month's warning about a chip 
shortage for the Power Mac G4. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported net income of $111 million, or 63 cents a  
share, for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding a gain of $37 million from an investment and other  
one-time factors, Apple earned $90 million, or 51 cents a share -- a 
drop of 15 percent from last year's net profit of $106 million, or 
68 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the computer maker skated past analysts' deflated  
forecasts for a fourth-quarter operating profit of 45 cents a 
share, according to a survey by First Call/Thompson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's stock had fallen $3.65 5/8 to $64.03 1/4 in advance of  
Wednesday's report, which was released after the close of regular 
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. But in after-hours trading, the 
shares rebounded to about $67. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenue fell 14 percent to $1.34 billion -- down  
from $1.56 billion in the year-ago period -- after Apple could not 
fill orders for its new high-end line of G4 computers due to delays 
in chip supplies from Motorola. The company had warned in late 
September that the shortage would put a drag on sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	To help address the order backlog, Apple announced Wednesday  
that it would delay the launch of the fastest G4 model until early 
next year so it can better match demand with chip availability from 
Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a contract with IBM to produce chips  
for the G4, although the new supplies will not be available until 
the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand for all of our products has been incredibly strong. We  
feel confident we'll be caught up on meeting the demand for the G4 
this quarter,'' said Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's cofounder and interim chief executive,  
stressed the strong demand for the recently retooled iMac computer 
line and the new iBook laptop. Apple has received 250,000 orders 
for the new iMac, announced just a week ago, and 300,000 orders for 
its iBook, introduced last month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company likely will not be able to fill all of the  
iBook orders until sometime next year, Anderson said, citing the 
earthquake in Taiwan and unexpected production problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, Apple posted a net profit of $601  
million, or $3.61 a share, nearly double the prior year's income of 
$309 million, or $2.10 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the just-ended year totaled $6.1 billion, up from  
$5.9 billion in the prior 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it expects gross profit  
margins to shrink in the current quarter, but that income should 
rise.

<HEADLINE>  Packers Fans Stake Claims to Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- They came to Lambeau Field in pickup  
trucks, bearing scythes, hacksaws, machetes, even steak knives. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay Packers fans weren't staging a coup. They came to  
carve a chunk of Lambeau Field history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans descended on the field's parking lot Tuesday and Wednesday  
to take home pieces of the high-tech, low-effectiveness SportGrass 
field the Packers are throwing out. The scavenging ended Wednesday 
morning when the turf was resold to a local gun club. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers began removing the field shortly after Green Bay's  
26-23 victory over Tampa Bay last Sunday. Workers lumped the sod in 
a giant pile in the southwest parking lot, and the removal job was 
completed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Word soon got out that the half-natural, half-synthetic turf was  
free game, and dozens of fans decided to get a piece. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a part of being a Packers supporter,'' Donna Stiggis  
of Ashwaubenon said. ``People want anything to do with the team, 
and this is their field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SportGrass will be replaced with bluegrass. The Packers'  
next home game is Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to plant it in our backyard,'' said Jim Braun, who  
loaded three small rolls of turf into his pickup. ``It'll just be a 
conversation piece or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Packers sold $10 boxes of the sod ripped out of the  
field after Green Bay beat the Carolina Panthers in the NFC 
championship game. The $300,000 in proceeds were given to several 
Green Bay charities. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers spokesman Lee Remmel said the current turf wouldn't be  
sold for charity. Instead, since the Packers must foot the bill for 
replacing the turf, it was resold to defray costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Security guards were stationed on the pile on Wednesday morning  
to prevent would-be landscape architects from taking the turf, and 
five trucks began hauling the grass away to its new owner, the 
Shawano County Gun Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to replace the turf was made when team officials  
decided the surface wasn't regenerating sufficiently. Before Green 
Bay's last two games, groundskeepers painted the field to cover 
many brown spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The field has been a problem since the Packers installed the  
SportGrass before the 1997 season. Though it is designed 
specifically to handle wet weather because of its sand base, the 
club had a hard time getting the grass to grow in the Wisconsin 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the grass performed well, but it didn't grow back in  
some places during the spring of '98 and had to be re-sodded in the 
middle of the field. The following fall, the grass stopped growing 
in November and December, reducing the surface to a bald, sandy 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers allowed the SportGrass makers to re-sod the entire  
field last spring, but the troubles continued when there was 
considerable slipping during a scrimmage in August. 
</P>
<P>
	When the problems didn't go away, the team decided to start  
over, even though grass has also been problematic at Lambeau in 
years past. The impetus for acquiring the SportGrass was a 
rain-soaked playoff game against San Francisco in 1996, after which 
the entire grass field had to be replaced.

	The decision to replace the turf was made when team officials  
decided the surface wasn't regenerating sufficiently. Before Green 
Bay's last two games, groundskeepers painted the field to cover 
many brown spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The field has been a problem since the Packers installed the  
SportGrass before the 1997 season. Though it is designed 
specifically to handle wet weather because of its sand base, the 
club had a hard time getting the grass to grow in the Wisconsin 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the grass performed well, but it didn't grow back in  
some places during the spring of '98 and had to be re-sodded in the 
middle of the field. The following fall, the grass stopped growing 
in November and December, reducing the surface to a bald, sandy 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers allowed the SportGrass makers to re-sod the entire  
field last spring, but the troubles continued when there was 
considerable slipping during a scrimmage in August. 
</P>
<P>
	When the problems didn't go away, the team decided to start  
over, even though grass has also been problematic at Lambeau in 
years past. The impetus for acquiring the SportGrass was a 
rain-soaked playoff game against San Francisco in 1996, after which 
the entire grass field had to be replaced.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain Aura Lives in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Julius Erving knew he'd be playing in Wilt  
Chamberlain's shadow when he arrived in Philadelphia in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone played in Wilt Chamberlain's shadow.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was the native son, Erving the outsider who had to  
earn the city's praise. Dr. J didn't gain a true appreciation for 
the city's basketball giant until they went out to dinner years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was his presence,'' Erving said. ``Going to dinner with  
him, he orders two complete dinners. There's entree one, and entree 
two; dessert one, and dessert two. I'd say, `Are you taking 
advantage of me because I'm buying?' And he'd say, `No, man, this 
is how I eat.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	It was some legacy to live up to. Philadelphia basketball,  
already rich in history before Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born 
in West Philly on Aug. 21, 1936, was never, ever the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming into Philadelphia,'' Erving said, ``the aura of  
Chamberlain was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still is.  
</P>
<P>
	They have been telling stories about Chamberlain in Philly since  
he first picked up a basketball at Shoemaker Junior High School at 
age 15. Erving heard them all when he soared into town, with his 
Afro and slam dunks no one had seen before. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he and Pat Williams, then the 76ers general manager,  
``had this very specific conversation about kind of blending in, 
that the era of a dominant guy like Chamberlain was over. That 
doesn't work in Philadelphia anymore. Chamberlain had the 
individual honors, and the Celtics had the championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's teams lost four seventh games to Bill Russell's  
Boston Celtics, winning two championships during his prolific 
14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chamberlain had the individual honors,'' Erving said, ``and  
the Celtics had the championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His path paved by Chamberlain, the lessons there to be learned,  
Erving's 76ers ended up with just as many titles as Chamberlain's -- 
one. They beat the Lakers in 1983, but lost to them in the finals 
in 1980 and '82. 
</P>
<P>
	``So in the end, we actually accomplished the same thing Wilt  
did,'' Erving said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain became part of Philadelphia basketball lore when he  
starred at Overbrook High School in the early '50s. He earned 
enough respect to leave his hometown -- for the University of Kansas 
and Harlem Globetrotters -- and come home again to play for the 
Philadelphia Warriors, and later the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come in as a kid who grew up Philadelphia, as a kid  
who was born and raised, who left and came back,'' said Erving, a 
native New Yorker. ``I didn't have as much to prove as Chamberlain 
had to prove. My transition was easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Erving played his entire NBA career in Philadelphia. By  
and large, he didn't hear the same criticism Chamberlain did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone was really treated quite like Dr. J,''  
said Dick Jerardi of the Philadelphia Daily News. ``He couldn't do 
anything wrong. Even to Wilt, he was a Philly guy, but there was a 
reaction to him because he was so big. It was sort of, `Why didn't 
he win all the time?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley followed Erving as Philadelphia's next pro  
basketball icon, but never won and never gained the stature or 
acceptance that Dr. J or Chamberlain did. Allen Iverson, who last 
year became the first Sixers player since Chamberlain to win the 
NBA scoring title, is next. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain,'' Iverson said Wednesday, pausing for a long  
time. ``Words can't even describe the type of player he was. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not from my era, not even close,'' said Iverson, born in  
1974, a year after Chamberlain retired. ``I've heard so many 
stories about him, I feel like I knew him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Erving, Chamberlain's days in Philadelphia were not  
always smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after leading the Sixers to a 68-13 record and the NBA  
title in 1966-67, Chamberlain's team lost again to Russell's 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one version, Chamberlain, who made $180,000 in  
1967-68, asked for a $1 million, three-year contract. The legend 
also has it that he wanted to be named player-coach to replace Alex 
Hannum and wanted a share in ownership of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain disputed this in one of his final interviews,  
produced by the Sixers in May. He said he turned down an offer to 
become the team's player-coach, then nearly quit basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out here and I just told my family, `Well, I've had  
just about enough basketball. I'm going to give it up,' '' 
Chamberlain said. ``I was gone. Totally gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was traded to the Lakers and led them to the NBA  
title in 1972. The Sixers were 9-73 the following season, the worst 
record in NBA history. The Dr. J era began three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving, now executive vice president of the Orlando Magic,  
wishes he had one more chance to thank Chamberlain for paving the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had nowhere to hide,'' Erving said. ``At 6-6, I could hide.  
I could have some sense of normalcy. I don't think Wilt was allowed 
that.''

<HEADLINE> As Vote Fails, Ala. Gov. Rebuilds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Gov. Don Siegelman, who got elected by  
proposing a lottery to benefit education, only to see voters reject 
the idea, began rebuilding his political career Wednesday with 
other schoolhouse issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not giving up,'' Siegelman said. ``I didn't get my  
black belt in karate -- some years ago, I might add -- by being a 
wuss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a state that ranks last in per capita spending on elementary  
and secondary schools, Siegelman spent the last two years talking 
about copying Georgia's lottery and using the proceeds for college 
scholarships, school computers and a new pre-kindergarten program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat billed himself as ``Alabama's education governor''  
when he ousted Republican Fob James last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But when his lottery went before the voters Tuesday, they  
defeated it 55 percent to 45 percent. Religious groups and other 
anti-gambling forces had lined up in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	So on Wednesday, Siegelman laid out plans to raise teachers'  
salaries to the national average, institute testing for new 
teachers, improve evaluations of teachers, and push ahead with a 
$600 million school construction plan using borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to keep fighting for a change in education that will  
make a difference in our children's lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman will have to work with taxpayers who have consistently  
refused to approve new local taxes for schools, and he will be 
doing it from a weakened political position in light of the 
lottery's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely less powerful. He put everything he had on the  
line for this,'' said William Stewart, political science chairman 
at the University of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Hubbert, a lobbyist for teachers, said Siegelman shouldn't  
forsake the education programs tied to the lottery because even 
lottery opponents liked them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were him, I'd invite the opponents and proponents to talk  
and see how these programs could be funded,'' Hubbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Siegelman said he sees no way to pay for the programs other  
than a lottery. ``I'm willing to listen to alternatives as long as 
they don't raise taxes and they don't cut existing programs,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman declined Wednesday to analyze why his lottery went  
from a 20-point lead in the polls last month to a resounding defeat 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican state Sen. Bill Armistead, a conservative Christian,  
said recent revelations that well-connected Alabama drivers often 
got their traffic tickets dismissed with the help of state 
officials made voters suspicious about how a lottery would be run. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the main blow came from a last-minute, highly  
effective campaign by churches of many denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never in my life seen churches come together like they  
did,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in JonBenet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A grand jury decided there was  
insufficient evidence to indict anyone in the JonBenet Ramsey 
slaying, ending a 13-month investigation into the case, District 
Attorney Alex Hunter announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Boulder County grand jury has completed its work and will  
not return,'' Hunter said. ``No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must report to you that I and my prosecutorial team believe  
we do not have sufficient evidence to warrent the filing of charges 
against anyone who has been investigated at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 jurors, who have met for more than 13 months, left the  
Boulder County Justice Center without comment about two hours 
before Hunter issued a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter declined to answer questions and said he would meet with  
the news media Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutal crime set off a drawn-out, controversial search for  
her killer. 
</P>
<P>
	The prominence of the family -- the father the millionaire  
president of Access Graphics, the mother a former Miss West 
Virginia -- and the beauty of the little blond victim guaranteed 
worldwide attention for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was before dawn on the day after Christmas in 1996 when Patsy  
Ramsey says she found a 2 1/2-page ransom note on the back staircase 
in the family's upscale home that demanded $118,000 for the safe 
return of JonBenet.

</P>
<P>
	Internet company Yahoo! has brokered a deal with Luxor Cab Co.  
to bring online cabs to the streets.

</P>
<P>
	The agreement with the cab company lasts four months, and Yahoo  
hopes that's long enough for riders to get hooked on the

<HEADLINE> Fendi Sells To Prada, Louis Vuitton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a consolidation of luxury goods makers, the  
Fendi family is selling control in the fashion house known for 
``baguette'' handbags and extravagent fur coats by designer Karl 
Lagerfeld to a joint venture of Prada SpA and LVMH Moet Hennessy 
Louis Vuitton SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed in the announcement  
Tuesday, but a person familiar with the deal said the 51 percent 
interest in Fendi was sold for about $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ended a bidding contest for the Italian company.  
The Fendi family rejected lower bids by Gucci and Texas Pacific 
Group, a U.S. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see Fendi as, if you wish, a company that was like Prada or  
Gucci five years ago,'' said Bernard Arnault, chairman of 
French-based LVMH. ``There is a very high potential for growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH plans to expand the number of Fendi stores worldwide, while  
Italy's Prada will focus on improving Fendi's purchasing and 
manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfect fit,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of  
Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an industry newsletter. ``They 
apparently are planning to put money into this venture; it's going 
to go great guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rome-based design house was founded in 1925 by Edoardo and  
Adele Fendi, and has been owned by their five daughters since the 
1980s. Today, Fendi is one of the most chic names on the catwalks, 
and sales of its eyeglasses, perfume, clothing, shoes and watches 
are expected to hit $490 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fendi sisters will retain a 49 percent interest, and the  
family will continue to hold key executive positions, president, 
general manager, and head of product development. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of Fendi is just the latest in a frenzy of deals that  
are realigning the trendsetters in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Prada purchased Jil Sander and Helmut Lang.  
Gucci was acquired by Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, and Valentino was 
snapped up by HdP. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Calvin Klein put himself on the sale rack. The New  
York designer hired an investment bank to look for a buyer or 
strategic partner to expand his product line and open new stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``People revere the name Fendi, Calvin Klein, Moet &AMP; Chandon,  
but while they revere it they seem to be buying less of it,'' 
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, increased competition is forcing luxury  
companies to become more efficient. And that often means finding a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH has been an aggressive buyer. The company makes Hennessy  
cognac, Moet &AMP; Chandon champagnes, and the Louis Vuitton luggage. 
In the fashion world, LVMH owns the Celine, Givenchy and Kenzo 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnault, the chairman, recently lost a bidding war for Gucci,  
but came back to beat Gucci in the contest for Fendi -- which may be 
his last for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not need to buy any brands, we have a plan to double our  
size in five years with our existing properties,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Is Armed for Fenway Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When he set his pitching rotation for the  
American League championship series, Yankees manager Joe Torre knew 
immediately what that meant: 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens pitching Game 3 against Pedro Martinez in Fenway  
Park -- the hero of Fenway past facing the hero of Fenway present. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a lot of fun,'' said Torre, who appreciates  
such moments. ``Obviously -- what Roger has meant to that 
organization and that ballpark for a number of years and, of 
course, what Pedro has done this year. Pitching in the shadows, if 
the sun is out, it ought to be interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was the cornerstone of the Red Sox staff for 11 years,  
winning 192 games and three Cy Young Awards, twice striking out a 
record 20 batters in a game. When he left Boston as a free agent, 
he scooped some dirt from the Fenway mound, a keepsake for the 
power pitcher who had become a New England icon. 
</P>
<P>
	After two more Cy Young awards in Toronto, he was traded to New  
York this season. With his longtime uniform No. 21 already being 
worn by right fielder Paul O'Neill, Clemens reversed the digits and 
wore No. 12. Then in July, he switched to No. 22, the number his 
son, Koby, wore in Little League. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of all the emotional baggage, Torre avoided exposing  
Clemens to the Red Sox at Fenway on the Yankees' first visit to 
Boston in May. He did start there on July 31, allowing four runs in 
five innings and getting no decision in a 6-5 Yankees loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox beat him 4-1 on Sept. 12 at Yankee Stadium, part of  
a three-game Boston sweep and a so-so 14-10 season for his first 
year in New York. The loss left him with a 3-1 lifetime record 
against his old team. 
</P>
<P>
	If there were any demons left, he said they've been exorcised.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been removed from that situation for so many years,''  
Clemens said. ``If it was one year later, the situation would be 
different. But I've faced them so many times and I've been back at 
Fenway so many times. I know the mound, the wall. I'm familiar with 
the territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens saw nothing out of the ordinary about the Yankees'  
rotation in which Orlando Hernandez started the opener against the 
Red Sox on Wednesday night with David Cone working Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever my slot is, I'll be there,'' he said. ``We've all got  
to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said the rotation fell into place after Clemens pitched  
the final game of the Yankees' first-round playoff sweep in Texas. 
He worked seven innings, allowing just three hits in a 3-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger couldn't pitch Game 1 because he just pitched,'' the  
manager said. ``David has to pitch Game 2. So that pretty much fell 
into place for us the way we needed it to fall into place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger never hesitated when he found out he was the Game 3  
starter. I think after the last outing, he is anxious to get the 
ball again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Clemens' part, pitching in the playoffs in Texas, where he  
grew up, was every bit as emotional as will be Saturday's game in 
Boston, where he became a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``You catch your wind from the situation in Texas, and here you  
go again,'' he said. ``You collect your thoughts and here you go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it will be as loud as Texas. I don't expect any  
difference. There will be as much action in the stands as on the 
field. It should be fun for everyone involved.''

<HEADLINE> Pianist Rubinstein Has Box Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Look for music from the late pianist Artur  
Rubinstein in a big way next week. 
</P>
<P>
	RCA has remastered his recordings and packaged them in a 94-CD  
box set -- more than 106 hours of music he made between 1928 and 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Titled ``The Rubinstein Collection,'' the set will sell for  
about $1,400 when it hits stores next week. Eventually, the CDs 
probably will be sold separately. 
</P>
<P>
	``His personality shows in his piano playing,'' one of his sons,

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Holds World Sporting Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the first international sports  
event since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Fita Bayissa of 
Ethiopia won the Belgrade Race Through History on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayissa finished the 6-kilometer race in 17 minutes, 8 seconds,  
for a one-second victory over Kenya's Paul Tergat, the five-time 
cross-country world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``My race with Tergat was a matter of mental battle and I was  
stronger,'' said Bayissa, third in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks as if this is one race I will never win, but I would  
love to run it again,'' Tergat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Abderrahim Gourni was third in 17:12.  
</P>
<P>
	Because of the international isolation of Yugoslavia, which is  
trying to recover from NATO's air strikes, only 19 athletes from 15 
countries, including three Yugoslavs, negotiated the steep tracks 
inside Belgrade's ancient Kalemegdan fortress. Dragoslav Prpa was 
the top Yugoslav runner, finishing 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers had to resolve numerous transportation problems  
because all participants had to be bused from neighboring Hungary. 
Bayissa also had difficulties with Hungarian immigration 
authorities, but the organizers ironed them out. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the international pressure on autocratic President  
Slobodan Milosevic, the European Union imposed a ban on air traffic 
with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should the runners suffer, why should the organizers  
suffer,'' Tergat said. ``I've always thought that athletics and 
sport should be about bringing people together.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief Senate sponsors of campaign finance  
legislation signaled grudging willingness Tuesday to accept an 
increase in Watergate-era contribution limits as part of a broader 
effort to reduce the influence of money in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would support an increase as  
``part of a package that would assure that other fundamental 
changes were made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said he would be ``rather  
conservative in raising the limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Feingold are co-sponsors of legislation to ban ``soft  
money'' contributions, the large, unregulated donations by 
corporations, unions and others to political parties. ``Hard 
money'' contributions are limited in amount by federal regulations 
and are given directly to individual candidates for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard money limits have been unchanged since they were enacted  
into law in the 1970s, and Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., is expected to 
propose an increase when campaign finance legislation reaches the 
Senate floor as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagel's proposal would raise limits to adjust for inflation over  
the last quarter-century. That would allow an individual to donate 
$3,000 to a candidate per election, up from the current $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to defeat a threatened filibuster, McCain and Feingold  
have introduced a pared-back campaign finance bill for debate that 
includes the soft money ban and a provision to give nonunion 
workers the ability to prevent unions from using their compulsory 
dues money for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not include restrictions on advertisements that attack  
candidates but escape regulation because they are presented as 
``issue ads'' not covered by existing election law. Nor will it 
include a requirement for disclosure of campaign finance reports on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for passage are uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	In an indication of the complicated crosscurrents surrounding  
the bill, Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., announced his support for the 
bill during the day, but made clear he would oppose any effort to 
reattach the limits on ``issue ads.'' He also said he wanted a more 
stringent provision relating to nonunion workers and dues money.

<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, no friend of federal minimum  
wage legislation, conceded Tuesday that legislation for an increase 
is likely to reach the House floor either this year or next. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey, R-Texas, said Republicans will draft accompanying  
legislation designed to offset the damage he said an increase would 
inflict on low-wage earners, a reference to a package of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of those cuts will be aimed at small businesses, GOP  
leaders are also looking at a reduction in the estate tax. Asked 
how that could help a worker at minimum wage, Armey replied, ``I am 
not sure I can make that connection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``But again, that doesn't bother me a whole lot,  
since, you know, I mean we're talking here whose demagoguery trumps 
whose demagoguery. ... Let us throw mine in here, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did I say that? Hey, I've been here for 15 years. It's taken  
me 15 years to understand that in this racket you should demagogue 
without shame.''

	After testing the waters for a Senate campaign, Rep. David  
Minge, D-Minn., has decided to seek re-election to his House seat. 
Minge made his announcement over the weekend in Minnesota, where he 
became the latest Democrat to pass up a run for another office in 
hopes his party could gain a House majority in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Minge will be favored for re-election to a fifth House term. His  
retirement could have opened the doors to a major GOP effort to win 
the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Minge's decision comes at a time when Democrats are still  
recruiting candidates to oppose Minnesota's first-term GOP Sen. Rod 
Grams, viewed by party strategists as vulnerable to a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis physician Steven Miles, former U.S. Attorney David  
Lillehaug and former Minneapolis alderman Dick Franson are in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cerisi, a trial lawyer, is expected to announce his  
decision to enter the race on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, former Rep. Tim Penny has indicated renewed  
interest in challenging Grams as a Democrat. Penny has close ties 
with Gov. Jesse Ventura, who is a member of the Reform Party, and 
had recently flirted with running for the Senate on that party's 
ticket.

<HEADLINE> Myplay.com Helps Store Music Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Digital music fans whose hard drives are  
becoming clogged with MP3 music files just got a new way to store 
their favorite tunes -- a Web site that stores private music 
collections and can play it on any computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Myplay.com, based in Redwood City, launched the Web site on  
Wednesday. It offers registered users 250 megabytes of free storage 
space -- enough to keep about 60 digital songs in MP3 format. Once 
the music is loaded into the user's ``virtual locker,'' it can be 
played instantly on any computer with speakers and Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Myplay will also store and play music in Liquid Audio and  
Windows Media Player formats. As an incentive to sign up users, the 
company is offering free songs from popular artists such as Kid 
Rock and Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Myplay cofounder David Pakman said his company doesn't care  
where the user files come from -- whether they are created from 
personal CDs or downloaded as bootlegged tracks from the Internet. 
If it is a digital audio file, Myplay will store it and play it 
back for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're format-agnostic. We'll let consumers decide what they  
want to use,'' Pakman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Myplay is not a member of the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a  
powerful consortium of music industry and technology companies 
formed last year to map out future hardware standards for digital 
audio players and software. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay Ryder, chief analyst for Zona Research, was concerned with  
Myplay's indiscriminate storage option, which could allow users to 
store ill-gotten copyrighted music from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like the Mafia. They're not breaking the law,  
they're just providing a service,'' Ryder said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are other ways to store MP3 files that people may find  
easier to use, such as recordable CDs, each of which can hold about 
150 songs, more than twice the capacity of Myplay's offer, Ryder 
said.

<HEADLINE> Intel, AMA Develop MD Verification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. is touting its new online  
verification system for doctors as a way to welcome the next wave 
of Internet health care applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, developed with the American Medical Association, can  
help verify that Web users who dispense medical advice are indeed 
doctors. That check is crucial as doctors turn to the Internet to 
share lab results and diagnose patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel unveiled the project Tuesday at a daylong conference on  
Internet health care. The system is expected to be in place early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making the Web a more trusted place is key to helping the  
health care industry move to the Internet,'' said Ronald J. 
Whittier, general manager of Intel Content Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers designed the system to verify doctors' credentials and  
prevent pranksters from impersonating a physician. The system will 
also be able to verify patients' identities to protect sensitive 
medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, there's no effective way for online services to know  
Dr. Jones is in fact Dr. Jones,'' said Charles E. Saunders, medical 
director for Healtheon, a Web health company that signed up for the 
new services. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Greene, a pediatrician who runs the Web site drgreene.com,  
said he has heard of a few pranks. A visitor to an online chat room 
once gave a cancer patient advice on alternative treatment options, 
only to say afterward that the exchange was a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	The system verifies only an individual's identity, not the  
site's content. Richard Corlin, speaker of the House of Delegates 
of the American Medical Association, acknowledged that a separate 
system must be developed to sort out good and bad medical 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of online medical impostors is believed to be small,  
but the potential for fraud increases as more patients turn to Web 
sites, chat rooms and e-mail. And risks grow with newer services 
that access private records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel system will require doctors using a participating Web  
site to register for a digital certificate, akin to an online 
health card. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel computers will check the registration information against  
the AMA's database of 900,000 doctors. Patients ultimately will 
have to register as well to get private records. 
</P>
<P>
	The level of verification required will depend on the  
sensitivity of the online material. Some doctors and patients, for 
instance, will be given permission to obtain only lower-level 
information until direct verification is made by phone or mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical group plans a campaign to encourage individual  
physicians to participate, as the system will work well only if 
many doctors register. The system also requires sites to join.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Issues Side Air Bag Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency today warned consumers  
that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children too close 
to the devices when they inflate. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongly worded consumer advisory from the National Highway  
Traffic Safety Administration comes as an increasing number of 
automakers are installing side air bags as either standard or 
optional equipment to protect passengers in side-impact crashes. 
Each year, there are some 7,500 deaths from those crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety agency also is asking all automakers with side air  
bags in rear seats to ship the vehicles to dealers with the bags 
deactivated. Dealers can then turn the side air bags on for 
consumers who want them after customers are advised of the 
potential risk to children, according to a letter being sent to 
manufacturers by the agency's administrator, Dr. Ricardo Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no deaths or serious injuries reported from side  
air bags, unlike front air bags, which have been blamed for at 
least 145 deaths since 1990 and have caused a public outcry. The 
vast majority of deaths from front air bags were to children who 
were unrestrained. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory and letter to automakers puts pressure on  
manufacturers to make sure their consumers understand the risks 
from side air bags to children, especially those who are 
unrestrained. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say testing done by the agency or provided by  
manufacturers shows that side air bags could deploy with enough 
power to seriously harm or kill children resting near the door or 
window or leaning out the window. In all those tests, the crash 
dummies representing children were not wearing seatbelts or 
restrained in child seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer advisory says that side air bags can enhance  
passenger safety in side-impact crashes. ``However, children who 
are seated in close proximity to a side air bag may be at risk of 
serious or fatal injury, especially if the child's head, neck, or 
chest is in close proximity to the air bag at the time of 
deployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory says manufacturers have an obligation to notify  
consumers ``whether it is safe'' for children to sit next to their 
side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter to automakers, the agency especially targeted side  
air bags in the rear seats of cars because for years federal safety 
officials have been telling parents to put children age 12 or under 
in the back seats, away from front passenger air bags that could 
kill or injure them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Rolls-Royce offer side air bags as  
standard equipment in the rear seats of some of their models. They 
deploy either from the door or the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Side air bags also are standard or optional in the front or  
front and back seats of other models for those automakers, along 
with many other manufacturers including General Motors, Ford, 
Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, BMW already began shipping its cars to  
dealers with the rear air bags turned off. An Audi spokesman, Doug 
Clark, said the company could not comment on the agency's proposal 
until company executives had received it. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have put warnings about side air bags in owners  
manuals, and provided warnings on stickers or safety cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes is sending a letter to vehicle owners later this year  
stressing they should properly restrain children and there ``is a 
potential for them to be injured if they are out of position or not 
wearing their seat belts,'' spokesman Fred Heiler said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Heiler said Mercedes was concerned that the warning  
being issued by NHTSA would scare parents away from using side air 
bags that ``provide significant protection to adults and 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez told automakers he expected them to come up with a  
voluntary common approach to testing side air bags by the end of 
the year to make sure they are safe for children. He also said the 
agency would test the side air bags when children are properly 
restrained in child seats or seat belts because ``it is not clear 
whether properly seated and restrained children incur any benefit'' 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety officials have said all but one of the nine side air bags  
tested in a joint research program by NHTSA and Transport Canada 
could cause injury to children leaning or kneeling against a window 
or turned backward on a seat. The 1998 General Motors Pontiac 
Transport was the only vehicle that passed all the tests, officials 
said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Wins Nobel for Economics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Robert A. Mundell of Columbia  
University in New York won the Nobel Prize for economic sciences 
today for his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under 
different exchange-rate regimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-born economist ``has established the foundation for  
the theory that dominates practical policy considerations of 
monetary and fiscal policy in open economies,'' the Royal Swedish 
Academy of Sciences said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His work on monetary dynamics and optimum currency areas has  
inspired generations of researchers. Mundell's contributions remain 
outstanding and constitute the core of teaching in international 
macroeconomics,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mundell's considerations, several decades ago, seem highly  
relevant today,'' the academy said. ``Due to increasingly higher 
capital mobility in the world economy, regimes with a temporarily 
fixed, but adjustable, exchange rate have become more fragile; such 
regimes are also being called into question,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	It added that Mundell's analysis has important implications for  
the single European currency launched by 11 members of the European 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy noted that Mundell has also demonstrated that higher  
inflation can induce investors to lower cash balances in favor of 
increased real capital formation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mundell has also made lasting contributions to international  
trade theory. He has clarified how the international mobility of 
labor and capital tends to equalize commodity prices among 
countries, even if foreign trade is limited by trade barriers,'' 
the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's award went to Amartya Sen, a scholar from India who  
developed a new understanding of the economic mechanisms underlying 
famines and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	His work challenged the common view that a shortage of food is  
the most important explanation of famine. He said instead that high 
food prices and declining wages are in some cases responsible for 
widespread starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for  
their work on valuing risky ``derivatives'' investments such as 
stock options. That award was tarnished by the near-collapse last 
year of a giant hedge fund in which Merton and Scholes were 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the  
will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. 
It was created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature Nobel was awarded Sept. 30 to German novelist  
Guenter Grass. The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr. Guenter 
Blobel, 63, a German native and U.S. citizen, who discovered how 
proteins find their rightful places in cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus J.G. Veltman, both of the  
Netherlands, won the physics prize Tuesday for developing more 
precise calculations used to predict and confirm the existence of 
subatomic particles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian-American, won the chemistry prize  
Tuesday for pioneering the use of rapid-fire laser flashes that 
illuminate the motion of atoms in a molecule. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Nobel -- the peace prize -- is to be announced Friday in  
Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, worth $960,000, are presented on Dec. 10, the  
anniversary of Nobel's death.

<HEADLINE> Pure-Glass Pioneer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNING, N.Y. (AP) -- J. Franklin Hyde, an organic chemist who  
unlocked a method for making ultra-pure glass that eventually set 
in motion the fiber-optic revolution in telecommunications, is dead 
at age 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's pioneering work in a Corning Glass Works laboratory in  
1934 lay mostly dormant until he was closing in on retirement in 
the 1960s. His discovery found myriad uses -- in durable spaceship 
windows, galaxy-gazing telescopes, precision lenses to build 
computer chips and signal-carrying optical fiber. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised at some of the things it has gone into, but I'm  
not surprised at the versatility of such a beautiful and useful 
material,'' Hyde said in an interview with The Associated Press in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde died Monday at his home on Marco Island, off Florida's  
southwest coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The impurity-free glass he found a practical way of making in  
bulk is called fused silica. It remains the most immaculate 
commercial glass available. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 19th century, scientists had tried melting quartz  
crystals to make fused silica, but that required heat in excess of 
1,725 degrees Centigrade, which was prohibitive. Besides, the 
molten glass couldn't easily be cooled into shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde attacked the puzzle from an unconventional angle: He heated  
the basic raw materials -- sources of silicon and oxygen -- by 
running a volatile gas called silicon tetrachloride through an 
oxygen flame. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultra-pure vapors formed a fine, glassy powder of silicon  
dioxide that, he said, ``could be pressed into a shape just like 
clay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's vapor-to-solid method is known as frame hydrolysis. That  
concept has since been broadened to build all kinds of 
high-performance materials an atom and a molecule at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who grew up in Solvay near Syracuse, earned a doctorate in  
chemistry at the University of Illinois, completed a two-year 
fellowship at Harvard and was hired in 1930 by the materials 
supplier in western New York now known as Corning Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent more than two years working on the fused-silica  
project. But after winning his patent, he moved on to other 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	His method found its first real-life use in a type of radar for  
detecting Japanese warships during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the glass serves as a key conduit in the semiconductor  
industry. Microlithographic ``stepper'' lenses made of fused silica 
provide the high transmission critical to miniaturizing computer 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiber optics, laser beams can travel for miles through  
fused-silica glass fibers without dissipating or scattering. Three 
Corning scientists invented optical fiber in the early 1970s, and 
fiber-optics technology is rapidly replacing copper as the backbone 
of America's telephone, cable television and computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Optical fiber is now Corning Inc.'s biggest business -- the  
company produces more than a third of the world's supply. But fused 
silica is manufactured by many companies worldwide, its sales 
running into billions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's wife of 61 years, Hildegard, died in 1991. He is survived  
by his three children, James, Ann and Sylvia.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Irvin Ponders Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- A somber Michael Irvin, still haunted by  
the memory of being temporarily paralyzed after injuring his neck, 
is considering giving up football. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never used the word ``retire,'' the Dallas Cowboys  
receiver paused, swallowed hard, clenched his teeth and said: 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go through something like this, there's no way you  
can say that you won't think, `Hey, that's it. I'm not playing 
again.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the initial reaction. Then, after you calm down, you  
kind of weigh it to yourself and see what happens, see what the 
doctor says and see what everyone else says. That's kind of where 
I'm at right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Irvin, who is in his 12th season, said he's in  
no hurry to assess is future this soon after the injury. He spoke 
softly, slowly and without his usual verve. There was redness in 
his eyes and cracking in his voice as he described how he felt 
being dazed. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who is wearing a neck brace, understands he's lucky to  
have only a swollen spinal cord and a herniated disc. He's also 
wondered whether he would be as lucky next time -- if there is a 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in the hospital, I thought, `What if it was worse?'  
But, you know, it kind of goes back to that's the risk you take 
every time you step on the field,'' Irvin said. ``I'm not trying to 
make light of it -- especially not now -- but it's quite a risk. I 
know that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin spent the morning with Dr. Andrew Dossett, a spinal injury  
specialist. He described the session as more confusing than 
reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't know what's going on until we sit down and he gives me  
some layman's terms,'' Irvin said. ``Right now, all I know is not 
to move it much and that's what I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Jim Maurer, who also was at Dossett's office, said the  
visit may have shaken up Irvin because it was the first time he 
learned the details of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Dossett decided to wait at least two weeks before ordering an  
MRI, which will show whether the swelling has gone down. Late next 
week, X-rays will be taken to examine the alignment of Irvin's 
spine, one of the factors that will determine when he can return to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurer said the good news was that Irvin has been cleared to  
ride a bicycle and do other conditioning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was injured in Sunday's 13-10 loss to the Philadelphia  
Eagles when his helmet twisted awkwardly as it slammed to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the raucous fans at Veterans Stadium cheered when it was  
obvious he was seriously hurt. They hollered again when a gurney 
was brought on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin didn't notice.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I was trying to focus on was trying to put my hands down  
so I could get up,'' he said. ``I couldn't control my arms and I 
couldn't control my legs. I was more focused on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember looking up, not being able to move and all you see  
is sky, then getting in the ambulance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said movement returned to his hands when he was on the  
gurney. He regained control of his legs in the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just scared,'' he said. ``I thought about not playing  
with my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since spraining an ankle as a rookie and tearing a knee ligament  
the next year, Irvin has played 139 of 144 games. The five he 
missed were due to a suspension for a no-contest plea to felony 
drug possession charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Over his career, Irvin has 750 receptions, tied for ninth  
all-time, and he's helped Dallas win three Super Bowls. He holds 
every significant record in Cowboys history. 
</P>
<P>
	Before speaking to the media for about 10 minutes Wednesday,  
Irvin spoke twice as long to teammate Daryl Johnston, whose second 
neck injury in three years has ended his season and possibly his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston has said his best advice for Irvin is not to rush back  
into action. That's also the sentiment of close friends Deion 
Sanders and Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just praying for his healing, for his mind to stay  
stable and focused on what he has to do to get ready for life -- not 
just football,'' Sanders said. ``It could be the end of a wonderful 
career. I don't believe it is, but if it is, I'm going to support 
him in every way.''

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A Dec. 6 trial was scheduled for heavyweight  
boxer Ike Ibeabuchi on charges that he attacked a corrections

	Dec. 6 was also the date Ibeabuchi was scheduled to stand trial  
in another courtroom on charges he sexually assaulted an outcall 
entertainer in his Strip hotel room. Lawyers agreed Tuesday to 
postpone that case. A new trial date will be set Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The jail charges of battery by a prisoner and assault on an  
officer allege Ibeabuchi pushed a corrections officer during a 
confrontation shortly before a scheduled court appearance on the 
sex charges.

<P>
	In the sexual assault case, Ibeabuchi is alleged to have lured  
the 21-year-old victim to his Mirage hotel room in the early 
morning hours of July 22 but wouldn't pay the $150 minimum fee for 
an erotic dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the woman from Oceanside, Calif., testified during a  
preliminary hearing, the boxer grabbed her and dragged her into a 
closet where he pulled down her pants and began to sexually assault 
her.

	She was rescued when hotel security came into the room,  
apparently alerted by her screams for help.

<HEADLINE> Hidden Fault Behind Near-Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two jumbo jets almost collided over China this  
year because of malfunctions in a system designed to prevent such 
airborne accidents. The near-collision prompted manufacturers to 
warn airlines around the world to make safety checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The alerts came from the leading aircraft makers, Boeing and  
Airbus Industrie, and are about to be followed with another from 
Allied Signal, which owns the company that made the faulty device. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Signal said it never heard of the problem before and  
knows of no other aircraft at risk, although it is awaiting results 
of the safety checks it will recommend in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, which reported the problem Tuesday  
after reviewing an internal British Airways report, said as many as 
3,000 Boeing 747s, 727s, 737s and Airbus A300s could be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers working on the problem believe it is probably rare,  
``but what if one, two or five other planes out there have this 
problem?'' asked British Airways technician James O'Sullivan during 
an interview with the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration minimized the risk to the  
traveling public in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one event, the only documented event, and it happened  
in uncontrolled airspace,'' FAA spokeswoman Kathryn Creedy said. 
``In the United States, we have air traffic control that is based 
on constant supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred June 28 as a British Airways Boeing  
747-400 flew east from London to Hong Kong as an older Korean Air 
Boeing 747-200 flew west from Seoul to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The 
planes converged in cloudy skies over northwest China's 
uncontrolled airspace, but neither flight crew was worried because 
each of their Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance systems showed 
the other plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Such systems are required on all U.S. airliners, and most  
foreign authorities require them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the TCAS system in the Korean Air plane called out  
``Climb! Climb!'' As the warning repeated and the pilot pulled his 
aircraft up ever steeper, he brought it up to the altitude of the 
British Air plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The two jets, which should have passed 2,000 feet apart, flashed  
by with just 600 feet between their wing tips. The co-pilot of the 
British Airways plane said the Korean jet seemed to fill his left 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	A collision would have been one of the worst on record. The  
Korean plane was a cargo jet with a crew of just three. But the 
British jumbo jet was filled with 419 passengers and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Signal said Tuesday that it believes two rare problems  
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers who analyzed the Korean plane's air data computer, a  
unit built by Bendix, which Allied acquired in 1983, found the 
computer was reading incorrect altitude information. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Allied engineers believe that a pin on a connector that  
allows the air data computer to compare information with a second 
air data computer was bent or pushed back too far, preventing a 
backup check. That problem likely occurred during its installation 
or subsequent maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The net result of both malfunctions is that the Korean Air TCAS  
system thought the airplane was at 33,900 feet, when in reality it 
was 2,400 feet below at 31,500 feet. The British Air jet was 
cruising along at 33,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Its TCAS system had been getting acceptable readings from the  
Korean Air plane, but as the airplanes converged, the altitude 
information sent out by the Korean Air planed jumped 2,400 feet in 
an instant -- an amount computers aboard the British jet ignored 
initially because such large jumps are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	When both systems realized the impending collision, the Korean  
Air plane was told to climb, since its computer thought it was 
already above the British Airways plane. In reality, that nearly 
brought it into the path of the British plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts preliminarily are suggesting this is a particular  
unit failure and in short order we are going to be issuing this 
bulletin to make sure everybody is checked,'' said Allied Signal 
spokesman Dennis Signorovitch.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Intel, which is often considered a  
bellwether stock for the technology sector, fell 4 9/16 to 72 1/8 
today after its earnings report late yesterday. The world's largest 
manufacturer of semiconductors, said it earned 55 cents a share in 
the third quarter, 2 cents below analysts' expectations. The 
results surprised many investors who have come to expect Intel to 
meet or beat Wall Street forecasts. Several other technology 
leaders also fell, including Microsoft, which was down 1 1/2 at 91

	Philip Morris: Tobacco Isn't Safe  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's biggest cigarette company's  
acknowledgment that smoking is dangerous and addictive is spurring 
renewed calls for federal regulation of tobacco and greater efforts 
to keep children from taking their first puff. Philip Morris Cos. 
Inc., which owns the tobacco company that makes best-selling 
Marlboro and other cigarettes, publicly acknowledged with the debut 
of its corporate Internet site that smokers face serious health 
risks. The declarations by Philip Morris follow years in which it 
fiercely argued with government and medical authorities over the 
risks of smoking. President Clinton said Philip Morris' 
acknowledgment that tobacco isn't safe ``comes far too late but 
still we must all welcome it. It can be the beginning of clearing 
the air.''

	UAW Ratifies GM Pacts  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers said today that members  
at General Motors Corp. and its former parts plant have ratified a 
four-year contract. Union leaders at Ford Motor Co. approved a new 
contract that guarantees jobs for about 23,500 workers at Ford 
parts plants even if Ford turns its parts division into a separate 
company. The UAW's Ford executive council unanimously recommended 
the four-year deal. Voting by about 100,000 workers is scheduled to 
end Oct. 24. Most of the terms mirror those agreed to by GM and 
DaimlerChrysler AG -- 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350 signing 
bonus and improvements in pensions.

<P>
	Auto Sales Up, Except for Ford  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Consumers snapped up cars, trucks, minivans and  
sport utility vehicles at a blistering pace last month, pushing the 
auto industry one step closer to a record year for sales. 
Automakers sold about 1.4 million cars and light trucks in the 
United States last month, an increase of about 9.5 percent over 
last year. Ford Motor Co. was the exception to the sales advance. 
Its sales were off 2 percent last month. The No. 2 automaker said 
sales of its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars were down 5 percent, 
mostly because of fewer sales to rental and business fleets. 

</P>
<P>
	Delphi Automotive Earnings Rise  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems said today its earnings  
improved in the third quarter, partly because of increased sales to 
customers besides its former parent, General Motors Corp. The 
world's largest auto parts maker said it earned $136 million, or 24 
cents a share, compared to a loss of $214 million, or 38 cents a 
share, in the same period last year that was due to a strike at GM 
plants in Flint. The results were a penny a share higher than Wall 
Street predictions. 

</P>
<P>
	Hughes Electronics Posts Loss  
</P>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. lost $29.6  
million in the third quarter, mainly because of expenses from its 
acquisition of two satellite-TV rivals and higher satellite costs. 
The loss for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 amounted to 13 cents a 
share, and compared with a $42.9 million profit, or 11 cents a 
share, in the same period a year ago, Hughes reported today. The 
General Motors subsidiary, whose operations include the nation's 
biggest satellite-television service, had revenues of $1.99 
billion, up from $1.51 billion in the same quarter of 1998. 

</P>
<P>
	Cable Gains Boost Time Warner  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. reported third-quarter net  
income of $360 million, bouncing back from a loss a year ago as big 
gains from cable TV offset weaker results in its music and 
television studios. The world's largest media and entertainment 
company reported its earnings were equivalent to 27 cents per share 
and compared to a loss of $37 million, or 3 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. Revenues rose 2 percent to $6.72 billion 
from $6.59 billion.

	Y2K Repercussions Could Linger

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Repercussions from Y2K-related computer  
problems could extend well beyond Jan. 1 in many countries and 
involve the United States in humanitarian and environmental crisis 
relief, a CIA official said today. Lawrence Gershwin, the CIA's 
national intelligence officer for science and technology, listed 
Russia, Ukraine, China and Indonesia as among the countries most 
vulnerable to serious millennium bug disruptions. He told the 
Senate's special Y2K panel, that the risks vary from country to 
country: Russia and Ukraine face dangers in their nuclear power, 
gas and electric power industries. Latin America is likely to see 
some disruptions in telecommunications, public health and social 
welfare. Some Asian countries could see problems in railroads, 
ports and medical services.

	Con Ed To Buy Northeast Utilities  
</P>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Inc. today announced  
it was buying Northeast Utilities for about $3.5 billion in cash 
and stock. The merger will create one of the largest electric 
companies in the United States. The deal -- which was preceded by 
several days of Wall Street speculation and a flurry of trading in 
both companies' stocks -- creates a company with more than 6.4 
million electric and gas customers from New York City through New 
England. Company officials said today that merging the two 
utilities could save $1.5 billion in operating expenses over 10 
years.

	SEC Proposes New Mutual Fund Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators, seeking to  
better protect the millions of Americans who invest in mutual 
funds, are proposing new rules that would expand the power of 
independent directors of mutual fund companies. The purpose would 
be to better protect the millions of Americans who invest in them. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission voted today 4-0, to seek 
public comment on the proposed rules, which include a requirement 
that the boards of most mutual fund companies have a majority of 
independent directors. Under current rules, 40 percent of fund 
companies' directors must be independent of the company, though 
most large fund companies voluntarily have a majority of 
independent directors.

	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- ETrade Group Inc. reported a  
smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss today as it added 310,000 
customers in three months. For the period ending Sept. 30, the 
nation's second-largest Internet brokerage behind Charles Schwab 
reported a loss of $26.7 million, or 11 cents a share, compared to 
a loss of $15.2 million, or 8 cents a share for the same period a 
year ago. Analyses had expected ETrade to lose 13 cents a share,

<HEADLINE> CBO Sees $1 Billion Surplus for '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials and top congressional  
Republicans are vying for credit after the Congressional Budget 
Office said it thinks fiscal 1999 ended with a $1 billion federal 
surplus, excluding Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	If accurate, Tuesday's estimate by Congress' nonpartisan fiscal  
scorekeeper would mark the first time since 1960 that the 
government had balanced its books after discounting Social 
Security's big surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The projection came amid a budget fight in which President  
Clinton and Republicans are both claiming they don't want to use 
Social Security's surpluses to help pay for fiscal 2000's spending 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because Republicans held the line on spending, we were able to  
stop President Clinton from spending Social Security and were able 
to put the needs of seniors ahead of the needs of bureaucrats,'' 
said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 surplus would have been even larger had congressional  
Republicans and Clinton not agreed to $21 billion in ``emergency'' 
spending for dozens of domestic and defense programs last autumn, 
and $15 billion for Kosovo, aid to U.S. farmers and other items 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling credited Clinton's  
repeated calls to protect Social Security and deficit-cutting 
packages of 1993 and 1997 for the development. He also said GOP tax 
cut plans, vetoed by Clinton, would have eroded the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actions speak louder than words, and their actions are they're  
choosing to drain billions from the Social Security surplus, rather 
than join the president in making tough choices'' to find other 
ways to save money, Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said that extra spending for education and other  
administration priorities should be paid for by raising tobacco 
taxes and other tax and fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans said little about the projections, reflecting  
a belief by some that a year-end compromise with Clinton might 
involve using some Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 1999 ended Sept. 30. A final figure should be available  
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction between cash the government raises from Social  
Security's payroll tax and from income and other taxes is little 
more than an accounting device. Funds the government collects from 
almost all sources is used to pay for the full range of federal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending some of Social Security's surpluses has no effect on  
the program's benefits. That is because the pension system converts 
its cash surpluses into Treasury bills before the Treasury 
Department uses the cash for spending, reducing the national debt 
or other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, in a bid to cast themselves as protecting Social  
Security, politicians have promised to not touch its surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget office did not change its projection for a $161  
billion overall surplus for fiscal 2000, including a $14 billion 
non-Social Security surplus. As they struggle to find ways to pay 
for spending bills, many Republicans hope the strong economy will 
provide money for them to use by producing a bigger 2000 non-Social 
Security surplus than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan, official  
fiscal analyst, warned that when the final figures are in, the 
actual non-Social Security surplus could differ from the $1 billion 
estimate by up to $3 billion. Those final figures should be 
available later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Including Social Security, the budget office projected a $125  
billion overall federal surplus for fiscal 1999. The 1998 overall 
surplus was $69 billion, the first since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The new figures assure that 1998 and 1999 are the first time  
since 1956 and 1957 that the government ran two consecutive overall 
federal surpluses.

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Centers To Face Old Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- To say Larry Centers is fired up about his  
first game against Arizona since he left the Cardinals is a massive 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old fullback, the heart and soul of the Cardinals  
for nearly a decade, remains bitter that the team released him in a 
salary-cutting move in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make his first appearance against his former team Sunday  
night when the Washington Redskins come to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt about it,'' Centers said when asked if he had  
something to prove to the Cardinals' front office. ``The way I 
figure it, I need to do about $1 million worth of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's roughly the amount of salary cap room the Cardinals saved  
by cutting him. 
</P>
<P>
	Centers said part of the reason he signed with the Redskins was  
that he knew he'd be playing the Cardinals twice each season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of trying to visualize and play it through my mind  
what's going to happen,'' he said Wednesday in a telephone 
conference call. ``And I'm visualizing a lot of good things 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Centers still finds it hard to believe that, after all his years  
of work for Arizona when the franchise was losing, he'd be cut 
loose after the Cardinals finally made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never visualized myself leaving the organization with a  
bitter taste in my mouth,'' he said. ``Having put so much into it, 
I always envisioned myself going out gracefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he still talks regularly with Cardinals players. He said  
they've told him many things about this year's Arizona team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say too much,'' he said, ``but just that it's  
different around there now than it was last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Centers said the Cardinals ruined a good thing with their  
offseason moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think their reaction to a little bit of success was not the  
right reaction, but they've proven that in the first five weeks of 
the season,'' Centers said, referring to Arizona's staggering 2-3 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Aeneas Williams, a teammate of Centers for all but  
the first of his years in Arizona, said the Cardinals should be 
forever indebted to Centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did was contagious,'' Williams said. ``The hustle that  
the fans saw on Sunday, we saw every day in practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback J.J. McClesky knows Centers is looking forward to  
this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know he's going to be lights out,'' McClesky said, ``but  
the thing about LC is he can't turn it up a notch. There's no way 
he can play harder than he always does anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Centers expects a warm welcome back from the crowd at Sun Devil  
Stadium, maybe even the old ``Lar-ry! Lar-ry!'' chant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll welcome me back. But I don't think they'll do it at a  
time where it will hurt their team,'' he said. ``I don't think 
they'll do it at a time that will take momentum away from the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take away the organization and all that stuff, the people  
there have been real nice to me and real cool with me,'' he said. 
``I came there a few weeks ago and I was at the grocery store and a 
lady approached me and said, `I'm really going to miss seeing you 
play.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of stuff is special to me and always will be. What  
really gives me the best feeling is to know that somebody out there 
appreciates the suffering and the dedication and the commitment on 
my part to try to make us a good team, and try to give them their 
money's worth and not short them in any way.''

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Rent-A-Car Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Enterprise Rent-A-Car quietly rose to No. 1 in  
the industry by catering to people with cars in the shop. Now, just 
as quietly, Enterprise is going after the airport rental car 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fanfare, the privately-held St. Louis company has more  
than doubled its number of airport offices over the past year, and 
officials say more growth is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	With something less than 2 percent of the current airport  
market, Enterprise has a long way to go before seriously competing 
with the likes of Hertz, Avis and National. But company officials 
believe Enterprise can reach an untapped customer -- the leisure 
traveler, what they call the infrequent flyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a segment of the traveling public which isn't being  
properly served by our competitors,'' said Rob Hibbard, vice 
president of rental development for Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people we're going after are the infrequent travelers and  
the value-conscious travelers,'' said Pam Nicholson, senior vice 
president of North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise was founded in 1957. The company has grown rapidly  
since the mid-1980s, when insurance companies began providing their 
clients with rental cars while their vehicles were being repaired. 
In the last four years alone, Enterprise's annual revenues have 
grown from $3.1 billion to $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Enterprise had for the most part stayed away  
from the airport market, which specializes in providing rental cars 
to business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in recent years, more and more of our local customers have  
continued to ask us to bring our same high level of customer 
service and value pricing to the airport market,'' said Andrew C. 
Taylor, president and chief executive for Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Hertz has 29 percent of the $9 billion airport market. Avis is  
No. 2 with 23 percent, followed by National with 16 percent and 
Budget with 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise officials said they've set no specific goals for  
market share. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate at which we expand will depend on how we do in  
servicing our customers,'' Hibbard said. ``Our goal is to be the 
best and not necessarily the biggest.''

	Right now, Enterprise has offices at just 38 of the nation's top  
100 airports, though Hibbard said they serve 95 of the top 100 
airports, with shuttle buses transporting customers from airports 
to the off-site Enterprise offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise also claims to have the price advantage. On average,  
Enterprise claims its rates are 20 percent lower than many of the 
other rental car companies. For a weekly rental, the Enterprise 
customer pays about $75 less than the typical airport car rental 
customer, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hibbard said Enterprise can undercut the cost of competitors  
because of its size. ``We have the advantage of having the 
purchasing power of being the largest rental company in the 
nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, experts said Enterprise's growing presence shouldn't lead  
to a price war. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about a company that won't have the volume to  
drag down the rates,'' said Jon LeSage, vice president of Abrams 
Travel Data Services in Long Beach, Calif. ``They (Enterprise) are 
not going to be able to service that guy that travels 20 times a 
year on business -- these people have corporate accounts with Hertz, 
Avis, Budget.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley have  
agreed to participate in a nationally televised debate less than a 
week before the March 7 primaries in California, New York, and 12 
other states, the Los Angeles Times said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper and CNN are co-sponsoring the debate, which will  
be broadcast by CNN from the Times' downtown office on March 1. The 
voting six days later marks the single biggest day on the primary 
calendar.

<HEADLINE> Gregg Popovich Is in Midseason Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- In only the first practice since arriving  
for the McDonald's Championship, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg 
Popovich was in midseason form. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, come on! Push it, push it! Whoa, stop! Foul! Shoot  
the free throws and make 'em both!,'' he yelled at various 
junctures Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a microphone for the benefit of the hundreds of  
spectators allowed in for the public session at a small gym in the 
city center, Popovich chided and cajoled the NBA champions, who 
will be expected to extend the league's 16-game undefeated streak 
in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want to be the first NBA team to lose over here,''  
guard Steve Kerr said. ``There's an element of pride involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio has a bye into Friday's semifinals, as does European  
champion Zalgiris Kaunas of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's first-round games at the 10,122-seat FilaForum  
arena pit South American champion Vasco da Gama of Brazil against 
Australian champion Adelaide 36ers, and Italian League champion 
Varese Roosters against Asian champion C.S. Sagesse of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The title game is Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to try to play good, solid defense and give  
ourselves a chance to win the games,'' said Spurs center David 
Robinson, among several players willing to autograph everything 
handed them -- from T-shirts to high-school textbooks -- by eager 
fans after practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to get the attention that we're getting overseas.  
You can just feel the excitement in the whole building,'' said 
guard Avery Johnson, whom the crowd serenaded with chants of ``A-V, 
A-V.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were cheering for everything,'' Johnson said. ``Passes,  
jump shots, dunks, everything. The excitement is different over 
here. You can feel it on every single play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't likely to be a lot of excitement for those rooting  
against the Spurs at the tournament, even if there is some 
NBA-level talent on Zalgiris Kaunas. 
</P>
<P>
	While the team lost two players with NBA experience, Tyus Edney  
and Anthony Bowie, in the offseason, it still can rely on the 
inside presence provided by 6-foot-11 George Zidek, a member of 
UCLA's 1995 NCAA champions, and 7-1 Eurelijus Zukauskas, whose NBA 
rights are owned by the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lithuanian club also has Corey Beck, who helped Arkansas win  
the 1994 NCAA title and has seen NBA action with the Charlotte 
Hornets and Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich, treating these games as preseason, is likely to  
shuttle in all 15 players he brought. 
</P>
<P>
	``On any given night, one person could definitely have an  
off-night,'' finals MVP Tim Duncan said, ``but not all of us are 
going to.''

<HEADLINE> Uganda Wants Holyfield-Lewis Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rumble in the Jungle II?  
</P>
<P>
	That's what an African king has in mind with his wildly  
improbable bid to hold the heavyweight title rematch between 
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is scheduled for Las Vegas on Nov. 13, with all  
parties under contract. But Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II -- monarch of 
Buganda, a kingdom of Uganda -- offered Wednesday to put the bout in 
Kampala, capital of the east African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's missed the boat,'' said Panos Eliades, Lewis' promoter.  
``Thank you, but he should get his order in beforehand. The fight 
is only four weeks away and the tickets have all been sold. And he 
wants to come in with a deal now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The king has lined up more than $15 million for the fight from  
commercial sponsors in Uganda, London-based spokesman Kizzi Nkwocha 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious bid,'' he said. ``Las Vegas has made a  
strong offer, but Uganda is willing to match anything that has 
already been put on the table. We're hoping to appeal not just on 
the financial side but the historical side. It's time for a 
heavyweight title fight to go back to Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been 25 years since Muhammad Ali knocked out George Foreman  
in Zaire, a fight billed as the ``Rumble in the Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nkwocha said the king's associates would lobby promoter Don King  
to move the fight to Uganda's Nelson Mandela Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don King has always been regarded as a maverick,'' he said.  
``We're hoping that his sense of history wins the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nkwocha described the 45-year-old king as a ``passionate boxing  
fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buganda is the largest and most politically influential of  
Uganda's traditional kingdoms. The king lived in exile in Britain 
but returned after Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni restored the 
Buganda monarchy six years ago.

<HEADLINE> NFL Tells Titans They Were Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans have learned that  
one problem with instant replay can be playing in a regional game 
where only two camera angles are available to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Fisher said Wednesday that the NFL informed him he  
was correct in challenging a catch by Baltimore's Patrick Johnson 
Sunday in the Titans' 14-11 victory over Baltimore. The catch for 
14 yards came on third-and-8 and kept a drive alive for a field 
goal in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Dick Hantak only got two views, the second coming 80  
seconds into the review. Both were inconclusive, so Hantak upheld 
the ruling of a completed pass. Fisher said another view in New 
York clearly showed that Johnson failed to hold onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams are going have many more feeds in some games than  
other teams based on the national TV and the number of cameras,'' 
Fisher said. ``I almost have to take that into consideration when 
we challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Flood of Stamps Planned for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Navy submarines to deep-sea creatures,  
from the Stars and Stripes to stars in the sky, from the Year of 
the Dragon to Wile E. Coyote, next year's postage stamps explore a 
wide range of people and issues. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be stamps for author Thomas Wolfe, war heroes Audie  
Murphy, and Alvin York, and political leaders Claude Pepper and 
Patricia Roberts Harris, the Postal Service announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Postmaster General William Henderson said the new stamps ``will  
help bring pride and a little passion to that unique moment in 
everyone's day when we go through our mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the year will be the Year of the Dragon, celebrating the  
lunar new year, continuing the annual series of animals featured in 
the Chinese calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the second holiday stamp won't arrive until fall, when  
Thanksgiving will be marked with a cornucopia stamp. The stamp also 
will commemorate the United Nations' designation of 2000 as an 
International Year of Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional Christmas stamp will be a Madonna by artist Jan  
Gossaert, now hanging in the Art Institute of Chicago. Santa will 
appear on the contemporary stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars and Stripes will get plenty of attention in 2000, with  
a panel of 20 different flags charting the evolution of the U.S. 
flag from colonial times. The 200th anniversary of the executive 
mansion will be marked with a White House stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	An adoption stamp will continue the tradition of using stamps to  
raise awareness of social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Roberts Harris, the first black woman to serve in the  
Cabinet and the first black woman to be a U.S. ambassador, will 
appear on the Black Heritage stamp in 2000. Harris was ambassador 
to Luxembourg under President Johnson and held two Cabinet posts 
under President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Other individuals honored on stamps will include sculptor Louise  
Nevelson, author Thomas Wolfe and Claude Pepper, a congressman 
known for his advocacy on behalf of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The military will be honored with a five-stamp series depicting  
Navy submarines and four stamps honoring distinguished soldiers 
Alvin C. York, John L. Hines, Audie L. Murphy and Omar N. Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble and the Hubble Space Telescope --  
named for him -- will be honored in a series of five stamps 
featuring images of stars, galaxies and nebulas. A separate 
four-stamp set will look at the achievements of the U.S. space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	One stamp set will feature the Pacific Coast rain forest, and  
five other stamps will look at deep-sea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports fans will find track featured on a summer sports stamp  
and a set of stamps will feature youth sports programs, including 
basketball, football, soccer and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	For folks with a sense of humor, the cartoon characters series  
continues, this year honoring the ever-frustrated Wile E. Coyote 
and his nemesis, the Road Runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The centennial of U.S. sovereignty over American Samoa will be  
recalled in a stamp, as will the 150th anniversary of California 
statehood.

<HEADLINE> GOP Committee Polling Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The Republican National Committee is  
polling members on whether New Hampshire and Iowa should keep their 
first-in-the-nation ritual when it comes to picking presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson mailed the survey to the RNC's  
165 members on Oct. 5. The results are nonbinding, but could be 
used to propose a new nominating process at an RNC meeting in San 
Jose, Calif., in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey asks whether members believe there are problems with  
the Republican nominating system, and if so, what. It also asks, 
``If the process is reformed, should Iowa and New Hampshire retain 
their first-in-the-nation status?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa and New Hampshire currently are haggling over dates for  
their contests, traditionally held eight days apart. Iowa has 
scheduled its caucuses for Jan. 31, and New Hampshire delivered a 
shocker by scheduling its primary for Feb. 1 -- a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a perfect world, I think Iowa and New Hampshire would both  
tell you we would prefer not to have that question in there,'' 
Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican party, said 
Tuesday. ``We've gotten used to this primary and think of it as our 
right. That view is not shared around the country. ... I think 
frankly we are an underdog in this effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is part of an attempt to stop states from holding  
increasingly earlier presidential primaries. About 25 states will 
hold primaries and caucuses between the end of January and March 14 
-- turning the nominating season from a marathon into a dash before 
many voters typically start paying attention to the election. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey requests comments on four alternatives, including  
establishment of rotating, regional primaries -- a proposal already 
embraced by the National Association of Secretaries of State. 
</P>
<P>
	The surveys are due Oct. 25; the results will be reviewed Oct.  
27, Duprey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duprey and the national committee members from New Hampshire,  
Ruth Griffin and Tom Rath, have mailed letters to other RNC members 
to try to convince them of the importance of New Hampshire's 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that the first primary is an enormous political  
privilege, but we believe we have earned it over the last 50 years 
with voter turnouts in excess of 75 percent, with a large and 
involved core of activists, and with a statewide attention and 
focus on the event that is total,'' the letter reads. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, several states, including Washington, Michigan and  
Louisiana, unsuccessfully have challenged Iowa's leadoff caucuses 
and New Hampshire's leadoff primary.

<HEADLINE> Judge Delays Newspaper Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A federal judge has blocked the scheduled  
shutdown of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin until the state's antitrust 
lawsuit against the newspaper's owner and its only competitor is 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The state argued that newspaper giant Gannett Co. Inc. -- which  
owns the morning Honolulu Advertiser -- in effect paid off the owner 
of the afternoon Star-Bulletin to create its own monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both Gannett and the Star-Bulletin's owner said  
the agreement was a business decision beneficial to both and 
violates no federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the temporary injunction Wednesday, U.S. District  
Judge Alan Kay said the public interest to preserve separate 
editorial voices in the community is great enough to keep the 
Star-Bulletin running until the lawsuit is settled. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered that no further actions be taken to impede the  
continued operation of the 117-year-old Star-Bulletin -- including 
ending its joint operating agreement with the Advertiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advertiser said Gannett would appeal the injunction.  
</P>
<P>
	Some Star-Bulletin newspaper boxes had already been removed and  
Star-Bulletin subscribers had been notified that their 
subscriptions would be converted to Advertiser subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the joint operating agreement, the two share advertising,  
circulation and business operations, but maintain separate 
newsrooms and editorial staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Star-Bulletin general partner Rupert Phillips and Gannett  
announced last month that the joint operating agreement would be 
terminated Oct. 30 and the Star-Bulletin would close. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Phillips' Liberty Newspapers Limited Partnership  
would receive a payment -- $26.5 million, according to court records 
-- based on the savings Gannett could expect from ending the joint 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Rodney Kimura said that $26.5 million  
was Gannett's assurance that Liberty Newspapers does not put the 
Star-Bulletin up for sale, and he equated it to a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering an agreement that eliminates the Star-Bulletin as a  
competitor to the Advertiser is a violation of federal antitrust 
law, Kimura said. He urged Liberty Newspapers to sell the 
Star-Bulletin rather than closing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're back in business, but we're not out of the woods yet,''  
Star-Bulletin Publisher John Flanagan said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Marx, representing Liberty Newspapers, said the agreement  
with Gannett was based on profitability. Phillips has said the 
paper earns a 12 percent return while mainland papers are earning 
double that, so his investors want to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws of economics can't be repealed by the Newspaper  
Preservation Act,'' Marx said.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Sues Lead Paint Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island is suing manufacturers of  
lead paint for allegedly conspiring to market a dangerous product 
that poisons children, the first suit by a state over lead paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by the multi-state tobacco settlement, state Attorney  
General Sheldon Whitehouse sued eight paint manufacturers and 
called upon the industry to ``take responsibility and clean up its 
mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Superior Court, seeks damages from  
big paint companies like Glidden Co. and Sherwin Williams Co. for 
treatment of children with lead paint poisoning and abatement of 
lead paint from homes and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know now that this industry knew lead paint was toxic  
dating back as early as 1904, yet it promoted its uses and profited 
by that use,'' Whitehouse said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen other states are also considering lawsuits  
against makers of lead paint, said John J. McConnell, a lawyer for 
Rhode Island who is also pursuing a class-action lawsuit on behalf 
of 30,000 lead-poisoned children in Cleveland, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island has one of the highest lead-poisoning rates in the  
nation. Nearly 20 percent of children entering kindergarten last 
month showed high levels of lead paint poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials say dust and flakes from the old paints  
have poisoned one of three children in Providence and cost Rhode 
Islanders millions of dollars for health care, special education 
programs and building repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses paint and pigment makers and the Lead  
Industries Association, their trade group, of conspiring from the 
1920s to downplay the danger and keep selling their products. 
European countries began banning lead in residential paint in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This litigation tries to make a scapegoat of companies,'' said  
Donald E. Scott, an industry attorney. ``It substitutes legal 
wrangling for serious efforts to reduce childhood lead poisoning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles; DuPont  
Co. of Wilmington, Del.; Sherwin-Williams Co. of Cleveland; and NL 
Industries Inc. of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	NL Industries lawyer Timothy S. Hardy said the paint industry  
shouldn't be held responsible, and it is up to landowners, 
landlords and the government to remove lead paint from buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government agencies around the country have recognized that  
for 50 years,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named were Glidden Co., a unit of Imperial Chemical  
Industries PLC in England; O'Brien Corp., which was bought by ICI; 
and SCM Chemicals Inc. and American Cyanamid Co., whose paint 
liabilities were assumed by Cytec Industries Inc. of West Paterson, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead has been banned from paint since 1978. But children in  
older buildings are still at risk of learning disabilities and 
behavioral problems if they eat or inhale the paint as it flakes 
off door jams and window sills. 
</P>
<P>
	At high levels, lead can cause kidney damage, seizures, coma and  
even death.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Remember Chamberlain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Practically everyone has heard of Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point  
game, and lots of folks know that he once averaged more than 50 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, however, are aware of Wilt Chamberlain's most unbreakable  
record of all -- he averaged 48.5 minutes per game in 1961-62. It 
was a mark that Chamberlain himself said would never be broken and 
the record many of his contemporaries pointed to Tuesday as an 
example of his incomparability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Lou Gehrig's record would never be broken,'' said  
Johnny ``Red'' Kerr, who played part of one season in Philadelphia 
with Chamberlain and against him for six more, ``but there is a 
record in sports that will never be broken -- and that's Wilt's 48.5 
minutes a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain set that record by playing almost every minute of  
every game -- including overtime -- for an entire season. He sat for 
only six minutes all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was something that probably will never be reached again.  
That was some kind of an accomplishment,'' said Don Chaney, who 
played against Chamberlain in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other marveled at how Chamberlain, who died Tuesday at age 63,  
so dominated the game that he made the NBA change its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Years ago, teams could pass the ball over the backboard or take  
a running start when attempting a foul shot. The former was 
outlawed because Chamberlain would use the backboard as a screen, 
cherry-picking passes and converting them into layups; the latter 
was banned after Chamberlain took a running start, leaped from the 
foul line and dunked the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Chamberlain dunked foul shots.  
</P>
<P>
	And that was long before Julius Erving or Brent Barry did it  
(while stepping on the line in the process) in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair to compare players in different eras,  
but he was about as dominant as any one player could be in any 
sport,'' Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown said. ``I looked at 
him like he was invincible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When word came that Chamberlain had died, Brown passed along the  
news to his team and told them a story that tried to put one of 
Chamberlain's greatest accomplishments -- averaging more than 50 
points in a season -- into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a night when someone, Bernard King or Adrian Dantley,  
scored 50 points,'' said Brown, who played at Kansas and coached at 
North Carolina -- the two schools that took part in one of the 
greatest college games ever, the 1957 triple-overtime NCAA 
championship game won by the Tar Heels against Chamberlain's 
Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the 257th time a player other than Wilt had scored 50  
or more, but all that did was tie the number of times Wilt did 
it,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also told another story about a summer day in the early  
1980s at the Men's Gym on the UCLA campus. Chamberlain used to show 
regularly up to take part in one of the high-octane pickup games 
that the arena constantly attracted. Brown was the coach of the 
Bruins back then, and Chamberlain often drove to UCLA from his home 
in Bel Air, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Magic Johnson used to run the games,'' Brown recalled, ``and  
he called a couple of chintzy fouls and a goaltending on Wilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``So Wilt said: `There will be no more layups in this gym,' and  
he blocked every shot after that. That's the truth, I saw it. He 
didn't let one (of Johnson's) shots get to the rim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain would have been in his mid-40s at the time, a decade  
removed from one of the greatest careers any basketball player ever 
produced. But the advancing years meant little to Chamberlain in 
terms of physical conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Into his 50s and his 60s, Chamberlain remained an incredible  
specimen -- a mountain of a man who was as coordinated and talented 
athletically as he was imposing physically. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Cavaliers called him in the early '80s and asked  
him if he'd still be interested in playing. Five or six years 
later, when Chamberlain was 50, the New Jersey Nets had the same 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of those potential comebacks ever came to pass, but the  
very idea of signing a player so old shows just how well 
Chamberlain kept himself in shape -- and how shocked people were 
when they heard he had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guy in that kind of shape, you can't live forever, but you  
don't expect him to clock in early,'' Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain scored 31,419 points during his career, a record  
until Kareem Abdul-Jabbar broke it in 1984. Chamberlain, who never 
fouled out in 1,205 regular-season and playoff games, holds the 
record for career rebounds with 23,924. 
</P>
<P>
	He led his team into the playoffs 13 times, winning two world  
championships. The first came in 1966-67 with the Philadelphia 
76ers, the second in 1971-72 with the Lakers, which won a record 33 
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams lost in the finals four other times and were beaten in  
the conference finals six times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might be able to argue with him being the greatest player  
in NBA history, but I don't think there is any question that he was 
the most dominant player ever,'' Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said. 
``Michael Jordan might be the greatest, because of all his rings, 
but he wasn't as dominant as Wilt. He averaged 50 points a game, 
and that same year, he averaged about 30 rebounds. One year, he 
decided that he wanted to lead the league in assists, and he did 
it. He's the only center who ever did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who knew Chamberlain well remembered him fondly as  
a nice guy, a friend with even his fiercest competitor, Russell, 
and an outspoken man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people didn't like that, but if he had something on his  
mind, something he had to tell you, he did not hide anything,'' 
said Elgin Baylor, a former teammate with the Lakers. ``He was just 
so open about how he felt about things. He was a very loyal person. 
Deep down, he was just a good guy. He was a lot of fun to be 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never uncomfortable with his fame, Chamberlain enjoyed being  
recognized on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never saw him upset or mean. His demeanor was such,'' Kerr  
said. ``Some of the guys who play today are nasty. Michael (Jordan) 
was nasty. He was the most vicious offensive player. Wilt did his 
stuff, but I never saw him play angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of those guys who was a nomad,'' said Lakers vice  
president Jerry West, a former teammate of Chamberlain's. ``One of 
the things I admired about him, you see the players of today, they 
have the entourages, but he was the common man. He had no problem 
going places, no problem being recognized as Wilt Chamberlain. He 
handled things very well.''

<HEADLINE> Cone vs. Ramon Martinez in Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The opposing starters for Game 2 of the American  
League playoffs share a common background -- that terrible moment 
when a pitcher's arm no longer responds. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone of the New York Yankees, who went through it a couple  
of years ago, knows just what's going through the mind of Boston's 
Ramon Martinez, who experienced it more recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like it,'' Cone said. ``The expectation levels  
you have for yourself are confusing. You don't know what to 
expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone has seen his share of surgeons. He had an aneurism in his  
right arm during the 1996 season, when he was limited to 11 starts. 
Then there was surgery on his right shoulder following the 1997 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez had rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder last  
year and was released by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He signed on with 
Boston, where his brother, Pedro, was already the mainstay of the 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Martinez rebuilt his career with 10 rehabilitation  
starts in the minors and a 3-1 record in four starts with the Red 
Sox. Meanwhile, Cone punctuated his career with the 14th perfect 
game in modern major league history in a 12-9 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone admired the Red Sox pitcher's progress.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a remarkable comeback,'' he said. ``It's very emotional,  
sort of a tough thing to deal with to contain the emotion that your 
arm is back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's rehab itinerary was right out of a travel agent's  
dream -- Fort Meyers, Fla., Sarasota, Fla., Lowell, Mass., 
Pawtucket, R.I. and finally Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put a lot of air miles on this year, maybe bus miles,  
too,'' manager Jimy Williams said. ``The kid kept working and he 
never stopped one day from doing whatever he felt was helping him 
come back and helping our team win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a game in Oakland, an afternoon game. It was the eighth  
inning and I see this kid go down to the bullpen and throwing. I am 
saying why is he going down there and throwing. He still felt in 
his mind he could pitch and help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is matter of fact about his comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	``They give me the chance, and here I am,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rejected a landmark treaty to ban  
nuclear testing Wednesday by a vote of 48-51, a defeat for 
President Clinton. The final vote closely followed party lines, 
with only four Republicans voting for the treaty. Democrats vowed 
to make the rejection a prime 2000 campaign issue, claiming polls 
show most Americans favor a global test ban. Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the pact ``fatally flawed.''

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's new military leader came  
under pressure to restore democracy Wednesday after his troops 
swept away the elected government, raising fears around the world 
at the prospect of army rule in a nuclear-armed nation. Pakistan's 
nuclear rival, India, put its troops on alert and watched warily 
for the next step by Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, a man Indians blame 
for months of bloody fighting this summer in disputed Kashmir. 
Musharraf, head of Pakistan's army, gave no hint about his plans 
Wednesday, maintaining silence after announcing before dawn that 
his troops had ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

<HEADLINE> AL Playoffs Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scott Brosius was the World Series MVP last  
year, so postseason heroics are nothing new to him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came within a double of doing something he's never done --  
and nobody else has, either. 
</P>
<P>
	With a home run, a triple and a single, Brosius had a chance to  
be the first person ever to hit for the cycle. He came up in the 
ninth inning needing a double, but struck out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the triple out of the way and I just don't get too many  
of those,'' he said. ``I was just trying to get on base and if it 
happened with a double, it would have just been that much more 
fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius batted .471 with two homers and six RBIs in New York's  
four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres in last year's series. 
Against Texas in the first round this year, he was 1-for-10 with 
one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the postseason,'' he said. ``It's something as a player  
that you hope you have the opportunity to do. ... I just treat 
every game as a must-win game and just feel like I have a lot of 
intensity in every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``LONG LIVE THE KING?:@ Jim Leyritz is called ``The King'' --  
mostly by himself -- but the king won't rule in the AL championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees utilityman was dropped from the playoff  
roster on Wednesday so the team could add Shane Spencer as 
insurance for Paul O'Neill's broken rib. Both O'Neill and Spencer 
were in the starting lineup for Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult, no question,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``Jimmy struggled near the end of the season. It didn't 
keep me from going to him in Games 1 and 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer starred in the 1998 playoff series against Texas, going  
3-for-6 with two homers and six RBIs. But he was 1-for-10 against 
Cleveland in the next round and got just three at-bats in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer hit .234 with eight homers and 20 RBIs during the 1999  
season but was cut for the roster for the first round of the 
playoffs against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz was acquired from San Diego on July 31 and hit .227 with  
five RBIs in 66 at-bats for the Yankees during the regular season. 
He was 0-for-2 in the first round against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of Leyritz's 12 postseason hits have been home runs,  
including a three-run shot for the Yankees in Game 4 of the 1996 
World Series against Atlanta to tie the it 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll get through this round and see what happens  
next round,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill hurt himself Oct. 2 running into a fence trying to catch  
a foul ball at Tampa Bay. Torre wasn't sure O'Neill could play 
until talking with the right fielder on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't put up a lineup until after he got here today,''  
Torre said. ``We talked about it. I saw how anxious he was to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another alternative would have been to cut rookie Clay  
Bellinger, one of the few Yankees with speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little more secure having a pinch runner, especially  
Clay, who can play all around, too,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PERFECT ROTATION:* The first three pitchers in the Boston Red  
Sox rotation have pitched no-hitters, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's Game 1 starter, Kent Mercker, threw a no-hitter in  
1994 when he was with the Atlanta Braves, striking out 10 to beat 
the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-0. He also pitched an unofficial 
no-hitter, combining with Mark Wohlers and Alejandro Pena to beat 
San Diego 1-0 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez, who starts Game 2, pitched his no-hitter against  
the Florida Marlins in 1995, striking out eight in a 7-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez was with Montreal when he was perfect through  
nine innings against San Diego. But Bip Roberts led off the 10th 
inning with a double to cost Martinez his gem, and Mel Rojas 
finished the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect the Yankees to be intimidated, though: Game 2  
starter David Cone pitched a perfect game against Montreal on July 
18 this year. And Game 3 starter Roger Clemens has a nice little 
record of his own, twice striking out a major-league record 20 
batters while he was with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REVENGE:* Add Red Sox infielder Lou Merloni to the list of New  
Englanders scarred by Bucky Dent's home run in the 1978 playoff 
game to decide the AL East champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at home crying. There's a lot of moments, like Righetti  
throwing a no-hitter'' against Boston in 1983, Merloni said. 
``Hopefully there'll be some kind of memory etched into some kid's 
stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox and Yankees finished tied at the end of the '78  
season, then played one game at Fenway Park on Oct. 2 to decide who 
would play Kansas City for the AL pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston led 2-0 after six innings before the light-hitting Dent  
hit a three-run homer in the top of the seventh to give New York 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
	That's considered a regular-season game. The Yankees and Red Sox  
have never met in the playoffs; until the advent of the wild card, 
it was impossible because they have always been in the same league 
and division. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXTRA BASES:* Rivera only threw two innings once in the regular  
season. ... The Red Sox have dropped nine consecutive AL 
championship series games -- the longest in either league. ... The 
Yankees' 11 consecutive postseason wins is the second-longest in 
baseball history. The longest was 12 when they swept the 1927, '28 
and '32 World Series.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Moore To Play Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions finally got some good  
news Wednesday when it was announced that wide receiver Herman 
Moore is expected to play Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit offense, already reeling from the sudden retirement  
of Barry Sanders, lost Moore to a sprained knee in the season 
opener in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who has averaged more than 100 catches and 1,300 yards in  
the past four years, has missed the last three games. He had hoped 
to return last Sunday against San Diego, a game the Lions lost 
20-10, but was forced to wait until this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he's going to be ready,'' Lions coach Bobby Ross  
said after his team's practice Wednesday. ``He worked well today, 
and took his turn with everyone else. That's going to be a big lift 
for us, because he's one of the best receivers out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's return should allow Detroit to be more effective in  
three-receiver offenses, as he teams with Johnnie Morton and 
Germane Crowell. Brian Stablein caught just one pass in three-plus 
games as the Lions last three games.

<HEADLINE> Fired Coach Expected To Turn Self In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Former Texas-Pan American basketball  
coach Delray Brooks is expected to turn himself in to law 
enforcement authorities Thursday morning, according to the Hidalgo 
County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	An arrest warrant for Brooks was issued last Thursday after an  
Hidalgo County grand jury returned an indictment of theft by a 
public servant of between $20,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge is a second-degree felony and carries possible  
punishment of up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Although District Attorney Rene Guerra gave Brooks until Tuesday  
to turn himself in, a family situation took Brooks out of the 
state, Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra said he would recommend a personal recognizance bond for  
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks is accused of depositing a check from Southwest Missouri  
State for $25,000 into his personal account and then making 
withdrawals from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks has denied any wrongdoing, although he acknowledged that  
the check was deposited into his account. He said that neither he 
nor anyone else under his direction made the deposit.

<HEADLINE> Yanks-Sox Ump Admits To Blowing Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Second base umpire Rick Reed admitted he blew a  
call in the 10th inning of the New York Yankees' 4-3 victory over 
the Boston Red Sox in the AL championship series opener Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an umpire, it was my job to get it right. I didn't,'' Reed  
said. ``You feel bad about it. I feel awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Jose Offerman singled to lead off the 10th inning, John  
Valentin hit a ground ball to third. Scott Brosius threw to second 
attempting to force the runner, but second baseman Chuck Knoblauch 
dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed signaled that Offerman was out. Replays clearly showed that  
the ball hit the inside of Knoblauch's glove and immediately 
bounced out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had possession before he dropped the ball,'' Reed  
said. ``After we went in and looked at the tape, we decided that 
wasn't the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of having runners on first and second with nobody out,  
the Red Sox had a runner on first and one out. The next batter, 
Brian Daubach, hit into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams led off the bottom of the 10th with a  
game-winning home run off Rod Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed the whole format of the game,'' Boston outfielder  
Darren Lewis said. ``On that type of play, you need that call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams went out to argue the call, to no  
avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go out that often,'' he said. ``Seems like the rule is  
that if it hits the glove, he is out. But, in my mind, he didn't 
have any possession at all of that ball. You've got to have some 
kind of possession of the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's player survey on the quality of umpires in the  
major leagues, Reed was ranked 14th out of 32 AL umpires. He was 
rated 12th for the accuracy of his calls on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The umpires are doing their jobs the best they can,'' Red Sox  
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said. ``That didn't make the difference 
in the game.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken Expects Busy Offseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It figures to be a strange offseason for Cal  
Ripken, who said Wednesday that he feels ``uncomfortable'' being 
thrust into the middle of last week's dismissal of Baltimore 
Orioles general manager Frank Wren. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's involuntary involvement in Wren's firing was merely a  
prelude for what should be a one-of-a-kind winter for the perennial 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles third baseman will soon begin an intensive  
rehabilitation program as a followup to the Sept. 23 surgery on his 
lower back. He won't be able to stay in shape playing basketball, 
as is his custom, but will be closely involved in the sport as a 
minority partner of the Baltimore BayRunners of the new 
International Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an uncertain time for me,'' Ripken said Wednesday  
morning, shortly after the news conference to announce his 
involvement in the IBL. ``I've got a lot of work to do to get my 
back ready. I'm smart enough to know that only time will tell how 
well I recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken proved this season that he can still hit for average and  
with power, compiling a .340 batting average with a career-high 
.581 slugging percentage. But surgery ended his year after he 
pulled within nine hits of 3,000 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last Thursday, Ripken became an unwitting accomplice to  
Wren's firing. Among the reasons for the dismissal, cited in a 
press release, was the fact that Wren ordered the team plane to 
leave for a Sept. 17 game in Anaheim after Ripken called to say he 
was running late. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles management cannot and will not abide having a  
general manager operate in such an unreasonable, authoritarian 
manner and treat anyone in this way, especially someone such as Cal 
who has done so much for the Orioles and for baseball,'' vice 
chairman and chief operating officer Joe Foss said in a press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm uncomfortable and feel I shouldn't be in the middle of  
it,'' Ripken said, one week after the fact. ``It's a situation 
where I don't feel I belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 39, won the World Series with the Orioles in 1983 but  
has not been back since. He doesn't have much time left, and his 
chances of returning probably were not enhanced by the firing of 
Wren and manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to go through changes and instability, but those  
decisions are made my someone else,'' Ripken said. ``There will be 
time for me to examine this. I have a much more individual view of 
the offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of his time will be spent working on getting his back in  
shape and helping promote the BayRunners, who launch their first 
season Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``My secret wish is that I could have been a basketball player  
instead of a baseball player,'' Ripken said. ``I won't get to play 
it much this offseason, so I figure I can watch it close to home. 
It's mostly about fun, but it's an interesting and creative 
opportunity to see the business side of sports on a little bit 
smaller scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken would not reveal the percentage of the team that he  
purchased, nor the price he paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a partner. That's all you get out of me,'' Ripken said.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Trophy Is Up for Grabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hours before Florida State risked its No. 1 ranking against  
Miami, a car pulled out of the parking lot of a Tallahassee hotel 
with a message painted on the rear window: 
</P>
<P>
	``Hilfiger or Heisman? U make the call.''  
</P>
<P>
	Less than a week ago, the call was simple: Peter Warrick, the  
Seminoles' sensational wide receiver, was the clear favorite to win 
the Heisman Trophy, college football's grandest individual prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice is not so easy anymore. Warrick was suspended  
indefinitely last week following his arrest for felony theft -- 
underpaying for designer clothes at a Tallahassee department store. 
He missed Florida State's 31-21 win over Miami, and will sit out 
Saturday's game against Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	And as he waits for his lawyer to sort out his legal mess,  
Warrick's Heisman chances have all but slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	A sampling of several dozen Heisman voters nationwide indicate  
Warrick has little or no chance to win the award presented by New 
York's Downtown Athletic Club on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter Warrick is out of it, in my mind,'' voter Steve Kirk of  
the Birmingham News said. ``And not because of the moral issues. He 
missed a big game and there's only 11 of them. You can't miss a big 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Bracken, sports editor of the Centre (Pa.) Daily Times, said  
he would have a tough time voting for Warrick because, ``you want 
that guy standing up there getting that trophy to be somebody that 
can be looked up at and admired and a youngster can say, `I want to 
be like him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick may be the nation's best player whether he misses one,  
two or more games, but Heisman voter Bruce Hooley of The 
(Cleveland) Plain Dealer adds, ``I also think the Heisman stands 
for something more than what he stood for at Dillard's (department 
store).'' 
</P>
<P>
	By winning the Heisman, a player is guaranteed lifelong  
recognition by football fans everywhere. Now, Warrick is likely to 
be remembered as the first player to lose it because of his 
misadventures in a mall. 
</P>
<P>
	With Warrick on the sideline, the leading Heisman contender  
looks to be Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton, the nation's top-rated 
passer with 1,347 yards and 12 touchdowns. He's also run for 321 
yards and six TDs for the eighth-ranked Yellow Jackets, whose only 
loss came against Warrick and the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also moving up on voters' ballots is Alabama's Shaun Alexander,  
who averages 203.6 all-purpose yards -- second in the nation -- and 
has 14 TDs. Others still being considered by the 921 Heisman voters 
are Purdue quarterback Drew Brees, Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne 
and Warrick's teammate, quarterback Chris Weinke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone seems to think Warrick being out has automatically  
given the award to Joe Hamilton,'' Heisman voter Andrew Bagnato of 
The Chicago Tribune said, ``but I don't think that's a given just 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde, the 1986 Heisman winner from Miami now with  
the New York Jets, has reserved judgment on Warrick, but said, ``if 
it's true, I'm sure it will hurt him, but if it's not true he's 
right up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick may be the first to lose the Heisman because of felony  
theft -- Florida State policy calls for an automatic suspension if 
an athlete is charged with a felony -- but at least one player has 
won the award without playing every game. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Texas A&AMP;M's John David Crow missed three games with an  
injury and won by playing in just seven games. He ran for 562 yards 
and six TDs, threw for five scores, caught two TD passes and had 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Warrick's out of it, but he's got to come back  
and miss only two games.'' Tony Barnhart of the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution said. ``I think that's the magic number. The 
fact that he's apologized, and if he plays well, I think enough 
Heisman voters will give him a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lee Barfknecht of the Omaha World-Herald: ``I've suspended  
Warrick from my ballot.''	   So has Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: ``I will not 
vote for Peter Warrick, even if he is cleared of criminal charges 
and returns to play. I thought what they did last week by putting 
him on TV, having him address the team and be on the sidelines, 
they were trying to make a celebrity of him, and I thought it was 
an outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Heisman rules, Warrick remains a candidate, but William J.  
Dockery, president of the award, said the receiver would become 
ineligible if convicted of a felony. Should he win the Heisman and 
then be convicted, the award can be taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a day after the Seminoles held off the Hurricanes,  
Bowden said he doubts Warrick has a Heisman hope left. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he comes back I would tell him to take a very back seat,  
a very back seat,'' Bowden said. ``You go out and play the best you 
can play, and don't even think about the Heisman. That's probably 
blown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week before the Heisman winner is announced, the Downtown  
Athletic Club invites the top four or five vote-getters at the time 
to attend the ceremony. Warrick may or may not be among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that now that he finally has his ensemble to  
wear to the Heisman announcement,'' Tom Luicci, a Heisman voter 
from The (Newark) Star Ledger said, ``that he may not be invited.''

<HEADLINE> Wilt Transformed Game of Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wilt Chamberlain's transformation from Big Dipper to defensive  
demon might have been his most amazing achievement in a career 
filled with gargantuan records. 
</P>
<P>
	During the time he stalked NBA courts, ladling in baskets as if  
he were pouring cream into a cup, he made opposing centers fear his 
shadow. Chamberlain himself lived in the shadow of another, smaller 
center -- Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Dipper scored 100 points in a single game, scored 50 or  
more a record 118 times. He caused rules to be changed, defenses to 
be modified and coaches to be fired. He had a fadeaway bank shot, a 
turnaround stuff shot, a finger-rolling flip shot, and a most 
dreadful two-handed underhand foul shot. He used them all to become 
the most prolific scorer in NBA history with 31,419 points until 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar surpassed him more than a decade after he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
	But throughout most of his incredible career, the 7-foot-1,  
280-pound Chamberlain was pegged a loser. A great scorer, 
certainly, but no team man, critics said. Russell, at 6-foot-9, was 
the center everyone talked about when they talked about the best 
because the Celtics almost always won the title. Four times, 
Chamberlain won the Most Valuable Player award, but Russell won it 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's 76ers broke through the infallibility of Russell's  
Celtics only once -- during the 1966-67 season when they ran off 68 
victories in 82 games and walked away with the NBA title. 
Chamberlain averaged 24.3 points that year, only the second time in 
his career at that stage that he averaged less than 33.5. He didn't 
lead the league in scoring, but he led it in rebounding and was 
third in assists. Chamberlain always could do pretty much anything 
he wanted on the court, and that season he made up his mind to 
outrebound, outpass and out-Russell Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Dipper faded away and Wilt the winner appeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain never again averaged more than 27.3 points. After  
his 1968 trade to Los Angeles, he scored a career low 20.5 points, 
but led the Lakers into the finals, where they lost -- to Boston 
again -- in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1969-70 season was a washout for Chamberlain, who injured  
his knee early and appeared in only 12 regular-season games. Still, 
the Lakers pulled themselves into the finals, where they were 
defeated by New York -- once more in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's transformation became complete in the 1971-72  
season as his third Lakers coach, Bill Sharman, entered the scene. 
Sharman came from the school of Boston's Red Auerbach, which, of 
course, was the same school Russell came from. Sharman hired 
another former Celtic, guard K.C. Jones, as an assistant. Together, 
Sharman and Jones molded the potential of the Lakers' superstars 
into a unit that won 33 games in a row, 69 out of 82 during the 
regular season, beat the tough Chicago Bulls four straight in the 
first playoff series, whipped the 1970-71 champion Milwaukee Bucks 
in six games for the Western Conference title, and beat the Knicks 
for the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Sharman's tutelage, Chamberlain developed the art of  
setting up the fast break in much the same way Russell did it under 
Auerbach. Instead of handing the ball off to a guard after a 
rebound as he had been doing, Chamberlain began flinging passes 
half the length of the court to breaking guards and forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was that the Lakers now scored before opponents could  
get back on defense. Rather than working the ball around for shots, 
they raced in for uncontested layups. Sharman taught the Lakers to 
begin their offense on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain dominated games with his shot blocking, rebounding  
and passing, just as Russell always had. West, always a great 
shooter, allowed his style to blend into Sharman's system and also 
found the transition appealing. West began passing more, Gail 
Goodrich began shooting more, and Jim McMillian started running 
more, while Chamberlain and Happy Hairston cleared the boards. 
Chamberlain's towering presence in the pivot on defense forced 
opponents to shoot from the outside and take poor percentage shots. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, Chamberlain finally gained the recognition he always  
craved as the complete ballplayer when his need to score no longer 
exceeded his desire to win.

<HEADLINE> Senators Push Pesticide Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two senators and several environmental groups  
sought federal legislation Wednesday to ensure parents are told 
when pesticides are sprayed in and around their children's' 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are vulnerable to potentially damaging effects of  
chemical pesticides because their immune systems and nervous 
systems are still developing,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite federal restrictions in some states, pesticides  
frequently are used at schools in ways where children are exposed, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said they will try to  
push legislation that would require schools to notify parents 72 
hours in advance of pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
	If given advanced notification ``people will be able to  
prepare'' their children, said Murray, whose son inadvertently was 
sprayed with a pesticide during an application in a residential 
area when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
	As federal regulators and lawmakers begin to pay closer  
attention to the effect of pesticides on children's health, the 
issue of pesticide use in schools has attracted growing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 30 states provide some level of protection from  
pesticides used in and around schools, students still often are 
``bombarded with chemicals that cause adverse health effects,'' 
says Jay Feldman, executive director of the National Coalition for 
the Misuse of Pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	States including Maryland and Connecticut have passed laws  
requiring parental notification. But Feldman said state 
requirements on pesticide use in schools varies widely. Twenty 
states have no statewide regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides  
estimates that there are some 50 insecticides, herbicides and 
fungicides commonly used in and around schools and some can cause 
reproductive problems, neurological problems, kidney and liver 
damage and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most often, the symptoms found in students are dizziness,  
nausea, headaches, disorientation and an inability to concentrate, 
said Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical manufacturers and distributors were critical of the  
proposed legislation, although some industry spokesmen said they 
were not opposed to parents being notified in advance of pesticide 
use in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Engel, president of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers  
Association, said parents should be notified, but he opposed any 
suggestions that pesticides should not be used at schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pesticides are safe and have a proven track record for  
protecting the public from dangerous pests,'' said Allen James, 
executive director of a group called RISE, which represents 
pesticide manufactures and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other industry spokesmen said children would face health  
threats from cockroaches, fire ants, wasps, mosquitoes, poison oak, 
rats, mice and a variety of other vermin if pesticide use in 
schools were banned or curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Landrigan, director of the Center for Children's Health  
and the Environment at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who also 
attended the news conference, said children are at risk from 
pesticide exposure even when symptoms are not readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many pesticides may be more harmful to children, and at lower  
doses, than they are to adults,'' said Landrigan. Even without 
obvious symptoms, he continued, ``substantial scientific evidence 
indicates that children are at risk for disease as a result of 
these exposures.''

<HEADLINE> Analysts Chime in on Raytheon Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Until Raytheon Co. first indicated to investors  
last month that its earnings would be lower than expected, it was 
considered one of the best managed defense contractors in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, despite Pentagon assurances that Raytheon is not in  
trouble, analysts and investors are trying to figure out what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's chief executive and chief financial officers were  
sticking to their story Wednesday as they hit the road to meet with 
key investors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they said earnings would be worse than had been  
previously indicated: tough competition and delayed orders were 
responsible for projected earnings per share of $2.70 to $2.80 -- 
without special charges -- well below Wall Street expectations of 
$3.56 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they were surprised by the continuing bad news, as  
Raytheon had so far seemingly managed to stay away from the 
troubles that have beset the rest of the defense industry, which 
has been hurt by declining military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense procurement peaked in 1985 at $97 billion and bottomed  
out in 1996 at $42.4 billion -- ``a long, long starving trend,'' 
said Charles Gabriel, senior vice president at Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Big defense contractors boosted revenues by acquiring other  
companies and cutting costs. In four years, Raytheon bought defense 
businesses from Texas Instruments, General Motors and Chrysler 
Corp., as well as E-Systems, a defense electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, however, defense contractors began to run into  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin Corp. lost $128 million  
during the first half of 1999 after four satellite launch failures, 
then announced a major restructuring in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Co. struggled with production line snarls, delayed  
deliveries and the Asian financial crisis during the past two 
years. The Seattle-based company reported losing $178 million in 
1997 and had relatively low earnings of $1.1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman, a major supplier of components for the 747,  
suffered a blow when Boeing cut commercial airplane production. 
Northrop, based in Los Angeles, announced last year it would lay 
off more than 10,000 workers to reduce its operating expenses by 
$300 million because of dwindling military work and competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The water was poisoned by prior blowups at Lockheed, Boeing  
and Northrop Grumman,'' said Pierre Chao, senior aerospace defense 
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Raytheon first announced in September that its quarterly  
earnings would be lower than predicted, its shares began to slide. 
Trading at around $61 when the Lexington, Mass.-based company 
issued its first warning last month, shares have fallen nearly 63 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Class B stock, which plunged more than 43 percent  
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange on news of the second 
earnings warning, fell $1.62 1/2 Wednesday to $22.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the outlook is improving for defense contractors,  
however. The Pentagon will spend between $55 billion to $56 billion 
this fiscal year on procurement, and is expected to spend $61 
billion next year, Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're heading toward the first upturn in defense spending in  
13 years,'' Chao said. ``That's a powerful, positive event for the 
defense industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts said they are less concerned about external  
problems than they were about the strength of Raytheon's management 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing if someone down the street tries to kamikaze  
underbid them,'' said Martin Knoblowitz, an analyst at Standard &AMP; 
Poor's. But it's quite another if a defense contractor can't 
restructure itself internally after making major acquisitions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always the answer (from Raytheon) has been 'Yes, yes, yes we  
have strong internal controls, a rigorous budget and planning 
process,' '' Knoblowitz said. ``Clearly that's going to be part of 
the line of questioning: How could things have gotten to that 
state?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon chairman and chief executive officer Daniel Burnham  
acknowledged Tuesday its acquisition spree may have been too much 
for its managers, and that the company should have been aware of 
the lowered expectations for margins and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a lot of change,'' he said, noting the acquired  
companies were restructured around products. ``That created an 
opportunity to lose perspective on what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced James Schuster has been named general  
manager of aircraft integration systems, succeeding the retiring 
Glen Hood. Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti would not comment on 
whether the change had anything to do with the earnings warning.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Markets Fall With Wall St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices retreated around the world today  
following a selloff Tuesday on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was off about 87  
points at the 10,329 level in midday trading, adding to its 231.12 
point, or 2.2. percent, decline of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader U.S. market indicators also fell today as investors,  
already worried about higher interest rates, were rattled by a 
disappointing earnings report from chip maker Intel. The market had 
looked forward to strong third-quarter earnings; the unpleasant 
surprise from Intel and an earnings warning from defense contractor 
Raytheon punctured that optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 0.99 percent  
today, on top of Tuesday's 60-point loss. Frankfurt, Germany's 
Xetra Dax was down 1.18 percent and the CAC-40 index in Paris was 
off 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average  
fell 1.9 percent, and Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 
2.2 percent. The Straits Times Index in Singapore slipped 1.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jitters about a possible rise in interest rates added to  
wariness in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4.9 percent increase in average earnings in Britain, along  
with a continued rise in house prices, stoked fears that the Bank 
of England would raise interest rates next month to keep the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese traders were cautious in advance of a Bank of Japan  
meeting and expectations that the central bank would probably not 
act decisively to blunt the advance of the yen against the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Japan are worried that the strengthening yen could choke  
off a delicate economic recovery by making Japanese exports too 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan later decided to leave its easy-money policy  
unchanged, and to start outright purchases of short-term government 
bonds, putting more yen in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar got a lift from the decision. In New York trading  
this morning, the dollar had climbed to 107.78 yen from 106.31 yen 
late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tattoo-Like Jewelry a Teen Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The latest fashion trend for girls doesn't  
involve piercing, dyeing or Britney Spears. But it still has shock 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Tattoo jewelry -- stretchy bands of woven plastic that from a  
distance look remarkably like tattoos -- is all the rage among the 
6-to-16 set, adorning necks, fingers, ankles and bellies of girls 
who want to appear just a bit wicked. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first my parents were freaked,'' says 15-year-old Melissa  
Colon, who takes any opportunity to make her school uniform look 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
	The lacy jewelry stretches to fit over a person's head, foot or  
hand. It also fits a teen-ager's budget: A necklace sells for about 
$3. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're so hot it's unbelievable,'' says David Wolfe, a  
fashion forecaster at New York's Donegar Group. ``I think people 
like them because they give the impression you're cool enough to 
have a tattoo, but you don't have to be brave enough to endure the 
pain of a one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Sutton, director of marketing for Claire's Stores, which  
operates more than 2,000 teen boutiques nationwide, says tattoo 
jewelry has been a top seller since it appeared on shelves last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton says Claire's buyers picked them up when they appeared in  
Austria and Germany last year. Karen Ngo, of the teen Web site 
Alloy, says a company in the Netherlands claims to have designed 
them first. Some teens trace them to the Philippines and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Louie, 16, says she enjoys the double-takes she gets from  
grown-ups who think otherwise innocent-looking girls have done 
permanent damage to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought, `Oh my God, people are tattooing their  
necks!''' says Eneida Merlos, whose 11-year-old daughter Tiffany 
wears one of the necklaces. ``But as long as it wasn't permanent, 
it was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, young people have decorated their bodies with  
stick-on tattoos and the painted-on henna tattoos popularized by 
Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is very excited over body art, especially ethnic  
body art,'' Ms. Ngo says.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pledges To Fight Tobacco Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are discussing a plan to  
hold a vote next week on President Clinton's proposals to raise 
tobacco and other taxes, an attempt to force Democrats to choose 
between higher taxes and increased spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put pressure on Democrats who are on the  
bubble,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Wednesday came as the GOP leadership was struggling to  
pass routine spending bills without dipping into the Social 
Security trust fund. Clinton, too, says he wants to keep those 
funds safe. But unlike Republicans, he has proposed 75 tax 
increases totaling a net $89.7 billion over 10 years to generate 
the revenue needed for more spending on health, education and other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget includes a 55-cents-a-pack cigarette tax  
increase, a measure closing corporate tax shelters, and a $6.6 
billion reinstatement of a corporate environmental cleanup tax, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican officials said the GOP leadership was  
confident Clinton's tax increases would be voted down on the House 
floor. House leaders have decided to hold the vote but have yet to 
determine the mechanics of bringing it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican and tobacco-state lawmakers pledged  
Wednesday to head off the proposed cigarette tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, released an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee 
on Taxation showing that people earning less than $10,000 would see 
an effective 15 percent federal tax increase, compared with a 5 
percent average increase for all U.S. taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising taxes to afford the extra spending the president wants  
is not the appropriate thing to do,'' Archer, R-Texas, told 
reporters. ``It hits the hardest on the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, a bipartisan group of tobacco-state House  
members said they would fight any effort by Clinton or Democratic 
congressional leaders to use the cigarette tax to finance 
government spending or new programs such as Medicare prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough. That's the message the administration needs  
to hear,'' said Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton included the 55-cent tax increase in his budget proposal  
for fiscal 2000. It lay dormant for many months, until Democrats on 
Capitol Hill began touting it as a way to raise $7.8 billion next 
year to pay for adequate levels of government spending and 
simultaneously reduce unhealthy smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton frequently citing the tax increase as an option in  
budget negotiations, opponents fear it could be included in a 
year-end deal. There is also a bipartisan bill in the Senate 
proposing higher tobacco taxes to pay for a new Medicare 
prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like tobacco products. I don't have tobacco growers or  
producers in my district,'' said Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa. ``I do have 
taxpayers in my district, and they're already paying too much in 
taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv, noting that a new Philip  
Morris Internet site finally acknowledges the health hazards of 
smoking, said Clinton will ``absolutely'' continue to push for the 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising the price of tobacco is good health policy that will  
discourage young people from smoking,'' Toiv said. ``On a day that 
Philip Morris is admitting that smoking causes cancer, it's hard to 
believe that Chairman Archer still wants to protect this 
industry.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Defends His Party Loyalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, accused  
by rival Al Gore of being a disloyal Democrat, said Wednesday that 
he toyed with the idea of leaving the party in 1995 and mounting an 
independent White House bid ``to revitalize democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, in an interview with The Associated Press, Bradley said he  
never seriously considered it. ``I took no real steps toward it 
all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's flirtation with a third-party bid -- along with several  
of his Senate votes -- have become ammunition for Gore since primary 
polling established Bradley as a major threat to the vice 
president's nomination quest. Suggesting that Gore's strategy has 
irked him, the former New Jersey senator said he is fighting the 
urge to retaliate with attacks of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one word that comes to mind is discipline,'' the Hall of  
Fame basketball player said by telephone from his New Jersey 
headquarters. ``It's part of the discipline of competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has criticized Bradley for:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Casting a vote in favor of President Reagan's 1981 spending  
cuts, which slashed Democratic-favored programs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Voting against ethanol subsidies. Ethanol is very popular in  
Iowa, the initial presidential caucus state, because it's distilled 
from corn and blended with gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Leaving the Senate after his third term ended in 1997, two  
years after Republican took over Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's new ``Stay and Fight'' slogan is a thinly veiled device  
to label Bradley a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not walk away from the fight when (former Speaker) Newt  
Gingrich took over the Congress. I did not walk away from the fight 
when Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I did not walk 
away from the fight when farmers needed farm credit,'' Gore said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter asked the vice president: What kind of Democrat is  
Bradley? ``Maybe the kind that would announce he was considering 
running as an independent against Bill Clinton,'' the vice 
president replied. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing in the summer of 1995 that he would not seek a  
fourth term, Bradley fueled speculation about a challenge to 
Clinton by refusing to rule out an independent campaign for the 
White House. Clinton, though privately agitated that Bradley might 
challenge him, publicly praised the New Jersey lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he talked to ``a few people, close friends and  
advisers'' about the possibility of running as an independent. ``I 
said basically, `What do you think of this?'' Bradley said, adding 
that he didn't ask the question for long. 
</P>
<P>
	He participated in two telephone calls with the so-called  
``Group of Eight,'' a handful of politicians reportedly plotting an 
independent run for the White House. The conversations fed the 
Bradley boomlet, though he and other participants said the 
discussions were more about issues than candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was apparent very quickly that my feeling is: I'm a  
Democrat. I've always been a Democrat. You've got to make a change 
in the Democratic Party. You've got to move the party back to where 
you see it should be,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't rule it out immediately when people asked me because  
I was concerned at the time -- as I am now -- that democracy for a 
lot of people is like a broken thermometer. You turn the dial and 
nothing happens. And I thought that might be a way to revitalize 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending himself on another front, Bradley said he was chosen  
by Democratic leaders to lead the fight against ``Reaganomics'' in 
1981 -- a point never mentioned by Gore. When the tax cuts passed 
over Bradley's objection, he said he voted for the Reagan budget 
reductions to avoid a massive deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everybody in Congress has voted as I voted, there would  
have been no deficits throughout the 1980s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokeswoman Kiki Moore said the criticism is fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``It takes discipline to stand up to Reaganomics,'' she said,  
echoing Bradley's line about Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	On the farm issue, Bradley has said he opposed ethanol subsidies  
when he represented New Jersey, but has learned as a presidential 
candidate that farmers need help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said it is unfair to accuse him of quitting on Democrats  
after the 1994 Republican landslide, especially in light of the 
fact that seven of the party's senators left office in 1996 -- 
including four who are now Gore backers. Gore aides say the 
difference is none of those ex-senators called the political system 
broken, as Bradley did when he left the Senate, and none are 
seeking the White House.

<HEADLINE> Everything in Wilt's Life Was XXL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You hear the news -- Wilt Chamberlain dead at age 63 -- apparently  
from a heart attack, and the first thought is that it must have 
been a massive one. If only because everything else in his life was 
XXL. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's body, his boasts, his talent, his clothes, his NBA  
records and struggles at the free-throw line -- even the door jams 
in the house he had custom built were oversized. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why the greatest player of his era had to go  
through life as the least sympathetic. There was nobody else to 
cast, no way around it; Wilt always got stuck playing Goliath. 
``And I once told him,'' recalled Jerry West, a former teammate and 
now the Lakers vice president, ``that nobody roots for Goliath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody indeed. During his playing days, Bill Russell stood  
6-foot-9 and weighed 220 pounds. But standing next to Chamberlain -- 
7-1 and 275 -- made him look almost normal. That was the strange 
thing about what was probably the greatest rivalry ever in sports. 
The Boston Celtics always surrounded Russell with better players. 
They had better coaches and the best organization and they won all 
the time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, rooting for Russell to beat Chamberlain time and again  
felt like rooting against Microsoft and for the underdog. Always. 
Because deep down, it never seemed fair that anybody had to play 
Wilt, especially by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you, if you could give me 10 points in all those  
seventh games against the Boston Celtics, instead of Bill Russell 
having 11 rings, I could've at least had nine or eight,'' 
Chamberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA changed its rules to force him farther away from the  
basket. Before the hack-a-Shaq defense came into vogue, opponents 
fouled Wilt all the time to put the ball in his hands at the one 
spot where he could do the least damage. It made you wonder what he 
might have accomplished with some help. 
</P>
<P>
	In one game against Russell, Chamberlain pulled down 55  
rebounds. In another, against the Knicks, he put up 100 points. He 
led the NBA in scoring seven straight years, in rebounding 11 of 
the 14 he played, and even once in assists. He averaged 50 points 
per game over the course of an entire season. In the middle of 
another season, he entertained fighting Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	And all the while he entertained women, so many women that if  
Chamberlain is to be believed he would have had sex, on average, 
with 1.2 women a day every day since he was fifteen years old. The 
boast won him no more fans than any of his other scoring records 
had. It was one of the few marks he came to regret. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all fascinated by the numbers, as we were about the 100  
points,'' Chamberlain said. ``... So I thought of a number that was 
a round number that may be close and may be whatever, and I used 
that number. Now according to the average person, that number is so 
preposterous that I can understand them not believing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the point of using the number was to show that sex was as  
great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True or not, his appetite for the rest of life seemed just as  
voracious. 
</P>
<P>
	He excelled at math as a kid growing up in Philadelphia, at  
music as a college student at Kansas, and while moonlighting on the

<HEADLINE> Wilt Transformed Game of Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wilt Chamberlain's transformation from Big Dipper to defensive  
demon might have been his most amazing achievement in a career 
filled with gargantuan records. 
</P>
<P>
	During the time he stalked NBA courts, ladling in baskets as if  
he were pouring cream into a cup, he made opposing centers fear his 
shadow. Chamberlain himself lived in the shadow of another, smaller 
center -- Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Dipper scored 100 points in a single game, scored 50 or  
more a record 118 times. He caused rules to be changed, defenses to 
be modified and coaches to be fired. He had a fadeaway bank shot, a 
turnaround stuff shot, a finger-rolling flip shot, and a most 
dreadful two-handed underhand foul shot. He used them all to become 
the most prolific scorer in NBA history with 31,419 points until 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar surpassed him more than a decade after he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
	But throughout most of his incredible career, the 7-foot-1,  
280-pound Chamberlain was pegged a loser. A great scorer, 
certainly, but no team man, critics said. Russell, at 6-foot-9, was 
the center everyone talked about when they talked about the best 
because the Celtics almost always won the title. Four times, 
Chamberlain won the Most Valuable Player award, but Russell won it 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's 76ers broke through the infallibility of Russell's  
Celtics only once -- during the 1966-67 season when they ran off 68 
victories in 82 games and walked away with the NBA title. 
Chamberlain averaged 24.3 points that year, only the second time in 
his career at that stage that he averaged less than 33.5. He didn't 
lead the league in scoring, but he led it in rebounding and was 
third in assists. Chamberlain always could do pretty much anything 
he wanted on the court, and that season he made up his mind to 
outrebound, outpass and out-Russell Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Dipper faded away and Wilt the winner appeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain never again averaged more than 27.3 points. After  
his 1968 trade to Los Angeles, he scored a career low 20.5 points, 
but led the Lakers into the finals, where they lost -- to Boston 
again -- in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1969-70 season was a washout for Chamberlain, who injured  
his knee early and appeared in only 12 regular-season games. Still, 
the Lakers pulled themselves into the finals, where they were 
defeated by New York -- once more in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's transformation became complete in the 1971-72  
season as his third Lakers coach, Bill Sharman, entered the scene. 
Sharman came from the school of Boston's Red Auerbach, which, of 
course, was the same school Russell came from. Sharman hired 
another former Celtic, guard K.C. Jones, as an assistant. Together, 
Sharman and Jones molded the potential of the Lakers' superstars 
into a unit that won 33 games in a row, 69 out of 82 during the 
regular season, beat the tough Chicago Bulls four straight in the 
first playoff series, whipped the 1970-71 champion Milwaukee Bucks 
in six games for the Western Conference title, and beat the Knicks 
for the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Sharman's tutelage, Chamberlain developed the art of  
setting up the fast break in much the same way Russell did it under 
Auerbach. Instead of handing the ball off to a guard after a 
rebound as he had been doing, Chamberlain began flinging passes 
half the length of the court to breaking guards and forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was that the Lakers now scored before opponents could  
get back on defense. Rather than working the ball around for shots, 
they raced in for uncontested layups. Sharman taught the Lakers to 
begin their offense on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain dominated games with his shot blocking, rebounding  
and passing, just as Russell always had. West, always a great 
shooter, allowed his style to blend into Sharman's system and also 
found the transition appealing. West began passing more, Gail 
Goodrich began shooting more, and Jim McMillian started running 
more, while Chamberlain and Happy Hairston cleared the boards. 
Chamberlain's towering presence in the pivot on defense forced 
opponents to shoot from the outside and take poor percentage shots. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, Chamberlain finally gained the recognition he always  
craved as the complete ballplayer when his need to score no longer 
exceeded his desire to win.

<HEADLINE> Harvard To Pay Millions in Back Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard University will pay millions of  
dollars in back pay and benefits to 300 to 500 misclassified 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The university announced it had reached an agreement with the  
Harvard Union of Clerical &AMP; Technical Workers on Tuesday, two 
months after the university acknowledged misclassifying the 
employees as casual workers, not full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the union contract, anyone working at the  
university for three months must be classified as a full-time 
employee. The contract defines a casual employee as someone who 
works less than 17 1/2 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation will be based on a formula assessing the number of  
hours a casual employee worked, along with length of service. 
</P>
<P>
	The violations began four years ago, said union director Bill  
Jaeger, who helped draft the agreement. The individual amounts 
range from $250 to $12,000, to be paid out over three years, Jaeger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard also will offer a large number of workers from the group  
both full-time employment and monetary compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact amount of the payout is not known, but it will be ``in  
the millions,'' said Ann Taylor, Harvard's general counsel and vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Adrienne Landeau said it was encouraging that  
Harvard was willing to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to be our usual tenacious, but highly civil,  
selves because the university recognized that this was an important 
issue,'' Landeau told The Boston Globe. ``And it knew this 
agreement was the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 3,600 members, HUCTW is the university's largest union.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Attack N. Korea Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is engaged in ``a  
one-sided love affair'' with North Korea, helping it build reactors 
that would produce enough plutonium for 100 nuclear bombs a year, a 
Republican lawmaker contended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But former Defense Secretary William Perry, special presidential  
adviser on North Korea, said a 1994 multinational pact will prevent 
North Korea from building the massive processor needed to make that 
fuel weapons-grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP House members grilled Perry and other Clinton  
administration officials on allegations that the North Koreans have 
misused heavy oil shipments and food aid from the United States and 
that North Korean diplomats have engaged in drug-running, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
	The rekindled Republican criticism of President Clinton's  
handling of North Korea was prompted by a report by Perry in which 
he largely endorsed the present approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released Tuesday, credited the 1994 agreement among  
North Korea, the United States, South Korea and Japan with 
preventing Pyongyang from producing nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry recommended sticking to the pact, a $5 billion deal in  
which North Korea agreed to freeze production of weapons-grade 
plutonium in exchange for fuel oil and construction of two 
light-water nuclear reactors for energy that would not produce 
weapons-grade nuclear materials. It has resulted in U.S. shipment 
of $200 million worth of fuel oil to North Korea. The United States 
separately has given food aid worth more than $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., part of a House GOP task force  
developing its own North Korea policy, said, ``U.S. policy is 
conducting a one-sided love affair with the regime in North 
Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox contended the light-water reactors could produce enough  
plutonium to make 100 nuclear bombs a year. But Perry said the 
agreement would prohibit that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody in this Congress or administration is in love with the  
administration of North Korea,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y. 
``They're condemnable.'' But he applauded steps taken to decrease 
dangers on the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a recent easing of some sanctions, the government in  
Pyongyang remains under other sanctions as a sponsor of terrorism, 
said Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., citing a report by the General  
Accounting Office -- Congress' investigative branch -- said a system 
to monitor the use of U.S. heavy oil sent to North Korea to meet 
its power needs until the reactors are built failed several times. 
The GAO also found that more oil appeared to be used when the 
system was down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we spend any additional taxpayer dollars on aid to  
North Korea, Congress and the American people deserve to know 
whether North Korea is living up to its end of the bargain,'' 
Knollenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has acknowledged that about 5 percent of  
the heavy fuel oil may have been used for unauthorized purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate GAO report released Tuesday, investigators found  
problems with the tracking of food aid because of reporting 
failures and access restrictions by the Pyongyang government. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Sherman, State Department counselor, said U.S. officials  
believe the bulk of food aid is getting to the children for whom it 
is intended, citing the marked improvement in children's health 
reported by relief groups working in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman also said the State Department was investigating reports  
that North Korean embassies around the world are financing 
themselves by selling illegal drugs. Rep. John Cooksey, R-La., 
provided a list of 34 North Koreans arrested on drug charges in 
various countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious issue about which we're trying to develop  
information,'' Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said U.S. officials also are closely watching activity by  
several hundred North Koreans in Congo, where uranium is mined. But 
she said there is ``no reason to believe North Korea is mining 
uranium in the Congo.''

<HEADLINE> Historic Launch Pad To Be Blown Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Like gleeful little boys, rocket  
scientists and launch pad workers could hardly wait for today's 
demolition of historic Launch Complex 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the thought of blowing up a launch pad -- on purpose -- was  
irresistible for a crowd accustomed to preventing explosions at all 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to kid you. This is a fun event for us,'' said  
Adrian Laffitte, a launch manager for rocket maker Lockheed Martin 
Corp., which wanted the pad flattened to make way for more modern 
launch facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was for 180 pounds of explosives to bring down the two  
steel launch towers at Complex 41. That's 7 million pounds of steel 
in all. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1965, Launch Complex 41 was the starting point for  
NASA's Viking missions to Mars and Voyager missions to the outer 
planets, and innumerable spy satellites. In all, 27 Titan rockets 
blasted off from the pad. 
</P>
<P>
	To rid the pad of its two launch towers, unnecessary for the  
company's new line of Atlas V rockets, Lockheed Martin opted for 
the quickest, cheapest method: explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also decided to throw a party.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, the last time a Cape Canaveral launch pad was  
deliberately blown up was back in 1976, when John Glenn's 
deteriorating pad was brought down by the Army -- hardly a festive 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of workers at Cape Canaveral Air Station planned to  
gather a safe 2,500 feet away to watch the explosion. Hundreds if 
not thousands of others at the Air Force station and NASA's 
adjoining Kennedy Space Center were expected to view the show from 
afar. 
</P>
<P>
	To raise money for needy families at Christmas, Lockheed Martin  
sold more than 300 raffle tickets, at $5 each, for the chance to 
push a make-believe detonation plunger. (The real button will be 
pushed by the pros.) An Air Force engineer won the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also sold 270 T-shirts emblazoned with ``Blasting  
out of the Past'' for $10 each. More are on order. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many others, Air Force Lt. Col. Anthony Goins, a launch  
squadron commander, had mixed feelings about watching Launch 
Complex 41 come down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been getting a lot of phone calls, especially from a lot  
of our retired workforce that have a lot of sentimental value with 
the pad. I mean, it's been in existence for 34 years,'' Goins said. 
On the other hand, ``We're excited that this is what is going to 
lead us into the future.''

<HEADLINE> Perez Has Them Saying: `Javy Who?' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Javy who?  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves fans probably won't forget two-time All-Star  
catcher Javy Lopez, but for the time being Eddie Perez will do just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Turner Field crowd of 44,624 chanting, ``Eddie!  
Eddie!'' Perez hit the first pitch from Kenny Rogers for a two-run 
home run to cap a four-run, sixth-inning rally Wednesday in a 4-3 
Braves victory over the New York Mets and a 2-0 lead in the 
best-of-7 National League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the easiest name for them to say,'' Perez said of the  
crowd's chant. ``I'm not really thinking about that. I just try to 
do a good job so they keep cheering for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't sure what he hit for the homer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a changeup,'' he said, ``but to tell you the  
truth, I was looking for a curveball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The homer into the left field seats was his second of the series  
-- he also hit one in Game 1 in Atlanta's 4-2 victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie may not hit 35-40 home runs like Javy, but him hitting  
home runs is not unusual. He's hit some big ones before,'' Braves 
manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who was 2-for-4 in the game and went 2-for-3 Tuesday  
night, is a career 7-for-11 in NLCS play. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, known primarily as the guy who catches Greg Maddux every  
fifth day during his first three years with the Braves, became 
Atlanta's starter when Lopez was lost for the season on July 25 
with a right knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, a .259 career hitter with 24 home runs and 101 RBIs,  
batted .249 with seven homers and 30 RBIs this season in 104 games, 
starting a career-high 89 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't think the fans will forget Lopez.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so. I think next year they'll forget about me  
when Javy is back playing every day,'' Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLD HAT:* Tom Glavine will be making his 25th postseason start  
and 13th NLCS appearance when he pitches Friday in New York in Game 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. It never gets old. That's what we play for every year, for  
us to be here and have a chance to go for the championship. So it's 
still a lot of fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine is 9-11 in the postseason, only 3-8 in the NLCS, but  
owns a 13-5 career mark against the Mets and was 3-0 against them 
this season. Overall, the left-hander was 14-11 during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ALCS, Glavine, a native of Massachusetts, is rooting for  
the Red Sox in the series with the New York Yankees. Boston beat 
Cleveland 12-8 Monday night to win the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the kid in me is happy for the Red Sox. I'm still a  
Red Sox fan,'' he said. ``Monday night watching that game, my 
sister, who still lives up there, must have called me 15 times 
during the course of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOONY LEITER:* Al Leiter, the Mets scheduled Game 3 pitcher, is  
considered weird and doesn't deny it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm left-handed. I guess you can go from there. I like to have  
fun. I joke around a lot,'' said Leiter, who was 13-12 during the 
regular season and has a 1-1 postseason record, including a loss to 
the Braves in the 1997 NLCS when he was with Florida, which beat 
Atlanta and won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lets face it, we're playing a baseball game. Yes, it's  
serious, yes, I want to win, but I goof around maybe a little bit 
more than most,'' said Leiter, who was 0-2 against the Braves this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REMLINGER SIGNS: The Braves announced prior to Game 2 of the  
NLCS that left-handed reliever Mike Remlinger had agreed to a 
two-year contract extension worth $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Remlinger, 33, was 10-1 with a 2.37 ERA and one save during the  
1999 regular season in which he was paid $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has done a remarkable job for us,'' Atlanta general  
manager John Schuerholz said. ``He has really been sort of a 
linchpin kind of performer for us out the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel so strongly about that we're very happy to have him  
under contract and he feels very much the same way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Remlinger will make $1.4 million in 2000, $1.6 million in 2001  
with a club option of $2 million with a $200,000 buyout for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Remlinger came to the Braves along with second baseman Bret  
Boone in November in a deal with the Cincinnati Reds for pitcher 
Denny Neagle, outfielder Michael Tucker and minor league pitcher 
Rob Bell.

<HEADLINE> Man Recalls Stealing Wilt's Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Every time Kerry Ryman recounts the night he  
watched Wilt Chamberlain score 100 points, he feels guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chamberlain hit his last shot in the game at Hersheypark  
Arena on March 2, 1962, Ryman, then 14, dashed onto the court, 
snatched the ball and ran out the door. The ball remains in a 
plastic bag in a closet at his Annville home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain died Tuesday in Los Angeles at 63.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there was some way I could put that ball in his casket, I'd  
do it,'' Ryman, 51, told the York Daily Record. ``I took something 
that didn't belong to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryman said he sneaked into the arena with friends and was  
sitting courtside for the game between the Philadelphia Warriors 
and Knicks. When Chamberlain scored with 46 seconds left, Ryman 
made his move. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the ball went through the net, a few friends and I ran  
out on the court,'' Ryman said. ``Back then, you could do stuff 
like that. I shook Wilt's hand. ... The ref threw the ball to Wilt. 
Wilt bounced it on the court, and guess what? That's the last time 
he saw it. I took it, ran up the steps and ran out the back door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gabe Basti was an arena security guard that night.  
</P>
<P>
	``Police were stationed around the arena,'' Basti recalled.  
``After Wilt scored the 100th point, somebody yelled, 'Hey, a kid 
stole the ball!' So I just took off after him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I chased the kid down through the park but never caught up  
with him,'' he said. ``Somebody told us it was Kerry, so we knew 
where he lived. We could have gone to his house, gotten the ball 
back and arrested him. But (Chamberlain) didn't want that ball 
back, so the chief said to let it go and we never went to Kerry's 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back, Ryman realizes what he did was wrong. So why  
didn't he return the ball? 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents tried. They contacted the Warriors,'' Ryman said.  
``Wilt didn't want any part of it. They finished the game with a 
ball, and that's the one Wilt had. That's the one he was presented 
with, but I have THE ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hardly in mint condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``The next morning was Sunday, and I loved to play basketball,  
so I'm the only kid on the block with a leather ball at the 
playground,'' Ryman said. ``We used it and abused it through the 
years. You can't read a thing on it now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had the chance to do it over again, I never would have  
taken the ball,'' he said. ``If I could get $1 million for it, I 
wouldn't want it. I was there and saw what `Wilt the Stilt' did. 
That's what has meaning to me.''

<HEADLINE> Millwood's Ace of Magnificent Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hey, what's wrong with Kevin Millwood?  
</P>
<P>
	After pitching a one-hitter for the Atlanta Braves in the  
opening round of the playoffs, Millwood was roughed up for five 
hits by the New York Mets in Game 2 of the NL championship series 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At this rate, the Braves might have to find someone else for  
their starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seriously, Millwood is putting together one on baseball's most  
dominating postseasons by a pitcher, with victories in his first 
two starts and even a save during his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. The most  
dominating starter in Atlanta these days is the 24-year-old 
Millwood, who allowed only two earned runs in 7 2-3 innings as the 
Braves grabbed command of the series with their second straight 
victory, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood must have gotten perturbed when the Mets had more hits  
after two innings that he allowed in Game 2 of the division series 
against Houston, because he retired 18 of the next 19 hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after an error by third baseman Chipper Jones led to an  
unearned run in the eighth, Braves manager Bobby Cox trudged to the 
mound to take the ball from Millwood's hand for the first time in 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the dugout, Millwood was given a standing ovation  
by an Atlanta crowd that has been treated to magnificent pitching 
throughout the decade. Now, it's going to be their treat to watch 
Millwood for the next decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening round, Millwood took the mound in a must-win  
situation against the Astros, who won Game 1 and threatened to 
return to Houston with a commanding advantage in the best-of-5 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood turned away the Astros with the first complete-game  
one-hitter in the postseason in 32 years. He allowed a 
second-inning homer by Ken Caminiti and faced only two hitters 
above the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood wasn't finished. When the series shifted to the  
Astrodome, he told Cox he was ready to pitch an inning or two if 
needed. In the 12th inning of a magnificent game, he was needed, 
setting down the Astros in order to save a 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Roger Cedeno's run-scoring single in the second  
gave New York a 1-0 lead. Millwood then retired the next 10 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	After Melvin Mora homered on a 2-0 pitch with two outs in the  
fifth, pushing the Mets ahead 2-0, Millwood retired eight more in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves broke through in the sixth, when Brian Jordan and  
Eddie Perez hit two-run homers to stick a dagger through the Mets. 
Millwood breezed through the seventh and got pinch-hitter Matt 
Franco on a liner leading off the eighth before Jones let Mora's 
grounder slip under his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood worked the count to 1-2 against Alfonzo, who then lined  
a pitch to the wall in left-center, bringing home Mora from first. 
</P>
<P>
	That was it for Millwood, but John Rocker preserved the lead by  
striking out John Olerud and Robin Ventura before Smoltz worked the 
ninth for the first save of his major-league career.

<HEADLINE> Close Game Wakes-Up Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three years ago, Bernie Williams won the opening  
game of the American League Championship Series with a leadoff home 
run in the bottom of the 11th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night against Boston, with Yogi Berra in the house,  
it was deja vu all over again for the New York Yankees cleanup 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams nailed reliever Rod Beck's second pitch in the bottom  
of the 10th inning, giving the Yankees a 4-3 victory over the Red 
Sox. And, he admitted that when Paul O'Neill grounded out to end 
the ninth inning, he remembered the 1996 playoff shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all I was thinking about when Paul grounded out,''  
Williams said. ``It was the same situation. I tried to keep it off 
my mind. This was a different pitcher and a different team. What 
are the chances of it happening twice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Very good, in fact.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams took a strike on a first-pitch fastball inside and Beck  
decided to go right back there with the second pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I would have been guessing, I probably would have pulled it  
foul,'' Williams said. ``The last time I faced him, he threw me a 
pitch off the plate inside and broke my bat. I think the way to 
approach it is just to stay inside and not try to pull it and 
that's what I did. I tried to stay inside the ball and hit it with 
the good part of the bat and put my hips into it and it went out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams connected and the ball headed to straightaway center  
field where Darren Lewis turned and raced to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it would be gone,'' Williams said,. ``He had  
his back to me. I figured he'd play it off the wall. When it went 
out, I was surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Williams' 11th postseason home run, and like so many long  
balls, Williams said he wasn't swinging for the fences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get on base, have a good at-bat,'' he said.  
``I was the first guy up, leading off the inning. There were so 
many good batters behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just like 1996, when Williams' leadoff at-bat ended the same  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	During the off-seasdon, it seemed Williams was headed for Boston  
as a free agent. ``I was very close,'' he said. There were a lot of 
conversations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre figured his cleanup man was gone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't pay atrtention to where he was going,'' Torre  
said. ``My concern was he wasn't going to be with us. We had to 
look and see where our production was going to come from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams signed with the Yankees at the last minute and the  
production came from the same place it had come all along -- the 
center fielder with the sweet swing and the talent for game-winning 
home runs.

<HEADLINE> Teen Tobacco Law Said Not Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 1992 law aimed at ending sales of cigarettes  
and other tobacco products to minors through rigorous state-level 
checking has not been adequately enforced, a private analysis says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that  
the report is based on old data. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the law took effect, 60 to 90 percent of teens were able  
to successfully purchase tobacco. After a year, the national 
average had fallen to 40 percent, and it's expected to be close to 
20 percent this year, said Mark Weber, an HHS spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study argues that most states and U.S. territories have  
neglected to investigate properly if their own laws prohibiting the 
sale of tobacco to minors are followed and to prosecute when the 
laws are broken. It was released Wednesday and published in The 
Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, a journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few states have implemented effective enforcement  
programs, and national surveys confirm that there has been no 
measurable reduction in the availability of tobacco to youths,'' 
said the study's author, Dr. Joseph DiFranza, a professor of family 
and community medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 Synar Amendment -- named for its sponsor, the late Rep.  
Mike Synar, D-Okla. -- Congress required states to ban tobacco sales 
to anyone under age 18. It called for aggressive enforcement 
including random, unannounced inspections using decoy buyers at 
grocery stores and other retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	States must outline how they have carried out the Synar  
Amendment in their annual applications for block grants from the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. And HHS 
must in turn withhold some funding from states that have not 
complied. 
</P>
<P>
	DiFranza argues that 19 states or territories failed to meet the  
Synar requirements because their laws on teen smoking were not 
tough enough. The states were Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, the 
District of Columbia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, 
Missouri, Montana, Tennessee, Virginia, Wyoming. The territories 
were Guam, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, 
Palau and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen states and territories did not provide evidence that  
inspections of cigarette vendors were tied to prosecutions, and 18 
states showed no evidence that merchants had been successfully 
prosecuted for selling tobacco to minors, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	``States continue to improve their laws,'' said a statement from  
Nelba Chavez, administrator of the HHS agency that administers the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	DiFranza argues that the federal government should require  
states to cut underage sales to 10 percent of teens who try to buy 
tobacco, but federal law sets the standard at 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, HHS found that several states had failed to  
adequately cut tobacco sales to teens. The government notified 
Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, Wyoming, 
and the District of Columbia that the law requires 40 percent cuts 
in block grants for substance abuse and treatment programs. Though 
they may appeal, the states could lose $37 million in drug 
treatment dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But states have complained and the Clinton administration, along  
some members of Congress, say these penalties should be 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was funded by the Substance Abuse Policy Research  
Program, which studies policies on tobacco, alcohol and illicit 
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Actress Dale Evans Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Dale Evans, the western movie star  
and widow of Roy Rogers, was hospitalized in serious condition with 
heart problems and respiratory difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 86, was listed in serious condition at Loma Linda  
University Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Jennifer 
Resch-Silvestri said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show she may have suffered a mild heart attack, said her  
grandson, Dustin Rogers. He said she is feisty and eager to leave 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing real well,'' he said. ``Her spirits are really  
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was admitted to Desert Valley Hospital on Monday and was  
transferred Tuesday to be closer to her cardiologist, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her illness may have been prompted by a diet change and  
exhaustion from a Lone Pine film festival last weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans starred in 35 movies and a 1950s television series with  
her husband and co-wrote his theme song ``Happy Trails to You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has also written dozens of inspirational books and hosts a  
cable television talk show on the Trinity Broadcast Network. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffered a stroke in 1996 and a heart attack in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Her husband died at the couple's Apple Valley home in 1998 from  
congestive heart failure. He was 86.

<HEADLINE> Woman Named Mass. Chief Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Justice Margaret Marshall was elevated to chief  
justice of Massachusetts' highest court Wednesday, becoming the 
first woman to head the nation's oldest appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marshall, a former chief counsel at Harvard University,  
overcame charges of anti-Catholic bias to win a 6-3 confirmation 
vote by the Governor's Council, which votes on nominations by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I follow in the footsteps of giants,'' Ms. Marshall said. ``I  
do so with humility, and with a deep commitment to the rule of 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marshall, 55, a native of South Africa, was appointed an  
associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court in 1996. She was at 
Harvard at the time and had previously been in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Her nomination to head the 307-year-old court was marred when  
Cardinal Bernard Law raised concerns that she harbored 
anti-Catholic bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Law, who heads the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, wrote  
last month to Gov. Paul Cellucci and said Ms. Marshall was ``open 
to serious charges of anti-Catholicism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited an incident in which Ms. Marshall, while at Harvard,  
chastised a professor who had used university stationery for a 
personal note with an anti-abortion message. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic groups also feared she could not be impartial on  
abortion cases because she once served on an abortion clinic's 
board of trustees. Ms. Marshall denied her personal views would 
affect her role as jurist. 
</P>
<P>
	Law later retracted his complaint after speaking with Ms.  
Marshall, who is Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
	``She gave me her assurance that she was not anti-Catholic,'' he  
said, ``and I have absolutely no reason to not accept her word on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Councilor Marilyn Petitto Devaney said Wednesday that Ms.  
Marshall had been misrepresented by her opponents and they had done 
a ``great injustice'' to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is almost a witchhunt,'' Devaney said. ``She does  
not legislate, she enforces legislation. She doesn't advocate 
judicial legislation.''

<HEADLINE> Model May Help Predict Hurricanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It may be easier to accurately predict the intensity of a  
hurricane than scientists believe, researchers reported today in 
suggesting meteorologists have not been considering the most 
relevant forces behind a storm's power. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's issue of the journal Nature, researchers unveiled a  
simple simulation that accurately predicted the strengthening and 
weakening of hurricanes by concentrating on the storms' interaction 
with ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The motivation is to try to understand what controls the  
intensity of hurricanes,'' said Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric 
science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
``But I hope to be able to use it for real prediction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters have been reliably determining the path of the  
dangerous storms for about 30 years. But attempts to predict 
changes in intensity beyond 12 hours have not fared so well, 
Emanuel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty can be costly in both lives and money: Small,  
non-threatening storms can strengthen without warning. Or large 
storms could lead to massive evacuations before unexpectedly fading 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel's system focuses on how the ocean responds to the storm  
and how the storm reacts to the ocean. A hurricane's power 
originates from warm water on the surface of the ocean. At the same 
time, cold water that is churned up by the storm saps its power. 
</P>
<P>
	Using historical data, the simulation accurately predicted the  
strengthening of Hurricanes Hugo, Andrew and Opal. It also 
correctly estimated changes in intensity for several storms this 
year, although the results were not shared with hurricane 
forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The system did not work so well on Hurricane Floyd, however,  
perhaps because an earlier storm churned up colder water than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone buys the model.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's too simplified,'' said William Gray, a Colorado State  
University professor who has been studying and predicting 
hurricanes for 40 years. ``If it was that simple, they would be 
forecasting intensity change much better than they are.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Arena Beams Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Arena workers stacked thousands  
of water containers in the upper deck of a new arena Wednesday to 
test the strength of its beams after safety concerns forced 
cancellation of an NBA exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-gallon jugs and buckets were intended to simulate the  
weight of a large crowd in 18,000-seat Alltel Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was suggested by engineers who on Tuesday told arena  
officials that they wanted to monitor the arena's 22 beams while 
fans watched the arena's opening event. The arena's governing board 
instead chose to cancel the Los Angeles Lakers-Washington Wizards 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	All other events -- from minor league hockey games to an Elton  
John concert and pro wrestling match -- have been put on hold until 
engineers clear the arena as safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing this so we can get this behind us and get ready to  
have the events,'' said Gus Vratsinas, chief executive officer of 
the Vratsinas Construction Co., a partner in the joint venture 
building the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a concern, you do what we're doing -- not with  
people'' in the building, Vratsinas said as about 20 workers moved 
the water jugs into rows. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday evening, workers had yet to fill even one seating  
section with the water containers. Once in place, the jugs and 
buckets were to sit there for four hours before being moved to 
another section. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simulating having a load up there for the amount of time  
that we would have people up there,'' said the arena's general 
manager, Michael Marion. ``The weight we're putting up there is 
even more than we could put there with a bunch of 300-pound people, 
so we're overcompensating.''

<HEADLINE> Air Botswana To Replace Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GABORONE, Botswana (AP) -- After a suicide pilot destroyed its  
tiny fleet, Air Botswana said Wednesday it will replace the planes 
by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Botswana officials said the company would likely stick by  
its French-made ATRs. 
</P>
<P>
	Three ATRs were destroyed on Monday when a disgruntled airline  
pilot made an unauthorized flight and crashed into the other two. 
Capt. Chris Phatswhe, 33, died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no passengers on the planes.  
</P>
<P>
	The crash crippled the carrier in this sparsely populated  
country in southern Africa, leaving it with only one other 
aircraft, which has been grounded with mechanical problems, 
government flight safety officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Botswana provides internal flights and service to other  
southern African hubs.

<HEADLINE> Wendy's Founder Pushes Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On television, Dave Thomas pushes Wendy's  
hamburgers and chili. Off camera, he pushes would-be parents to 
consider adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply want to raise awareness to help children find loving  
homes,'' the founder of the Ohio-based chain of fast-food 
restaurants told the National Press Club on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids today are in foster care much too long,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has advocated more and easier adoptions. He was the child  
of an unwed woman who gave him up for adoption during the Great 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up, Thomas said, he didn't know he'd been adopted. He  
advised parents of adoptive children to tell them ``as early as 
possible -- it's really the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke freely about his past and his efforts to find his birth  
family, but he batted away questions about interracial adoptions or 
adoptions by single people: 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever works,'' he said. ``I am a hamburger cook who was  
adopted. I don't have all the answers.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Daily Star Names Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jane Amari, executive editor of The News  
Journal in Wilmington, Del., was named publisher and executive 
editor of The Arizona Daily Star on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amari will assume the newspaper's top leadership position,  
currently held by Editor Stephen E. Auslander, and will be 
responsible for all news and editorial operations starting Nov. 1, 
Robert C. Woodworth, president and chief executive officer of 
Pulitzer Inc., said in a letter to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Auslander was named executive editor of the morning newspaper in  
1985. It was unclear what his title and new duties would be. 
</P>
<P>
	The publisher's title was previously held by Michael E.  
Pulitzer, chairman of St. Louis-based Pulitzer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Amari was managing editor and senior vice president of The  
Kansas City Star before joining The News Journal, owned by Gannett 
Co. Inc., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served as managing editor of the Los Angeles Daily News  
and the Rockford Register Star in Rockford, Ill., and worked for

<HEADLINE> Businesses Thrive on Sox-Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez's final pitch was hardly in the  
catcher's mitt when Arthur D'Angelo swung into action. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no time for the 73-year-old Boston Red Sox souvenir  
dealer to celebrate Monday's victory over Cleveland. He expects to 
sell 25,000 T-shirts and hats for a first-ever American League 
Championship Series between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Angelo spent a sleepless night at his Yawkey Way factory so  
that items could fill the shelves of The Souvenir Store by Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest thing that's ever going to hit this town  
in baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than bragging rights are at stake when the 80-year-old  
rivalry finally gets played out in the postseason. Restauranteurs, 
hotel owners and retailers will make millions on the long-awaited 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the rivalry inspires such passion that the windfall  
could be as much as 50 percent higher than it would be if the Red 
Sox were playing another team, according to local business 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a national event,'' said Patrick Moscaritolo,  
president of the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
``That leads to a higher level of spending. Everyone wants a piece 
of the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscaritolo said if three games are played in Boston -- a  
certainty if Boston wins one of the first four games in the 
seven-game series -- the local economy will get a $10 million boost, 
or about $3.3 million per game. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the region pulled in about $1.5 million per game  
for two home games in the divisional series against Cleveland, 
Moscaritolo said. Had the Texas Rangers defeated New York in their 
best-of-5 series, the bureau says the economic boost would have 
been about $2 million per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Geographic and historic factors give a Red Sox-Yankees series  
greater value, Moscaritolo said. Until the advent of the wild-card 
playoff berth in 1995, it was impossible for the teams to face off 
in a playoff series because they compete in the same division. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans want to be part of a showdown that has roots in the days of  
Babe Ruth, Moscaritolo said. New Yorkers will make the relatively 
short trip to Boston to scalp tickets or just to soak in the 
atmosphere. Others will buy a cap or T-shirt. The visitors bureau 
estimates average spending per person on souvenirs by people who go 
to the games will increase from the usual $7 to $14. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything will increase in the relativity to the fact that  
it's the Yankees,'' Moscaritolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Sheraton Boston, the phone began ringing for reservations  
after Monday's game ended. The hotel, where the Indians stayed last 
week, is booked solid, said Mary Niester, director of sales and 
marketing. Niester won't say if the Yankees will be guests this 
weekend, citing confidentiality concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Niester said the hotel would have been full this weekend anyway  
because of the fall foliage season. But she said the series will 
lengthen the stays at the hotel, meaning the hotel will be booked 
on Thursday and Monday nights, when it normally wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Moscaritolo said, the demands of the national media  
and fans have meant calls to the visitors bureau for help placing 
hundreds of people in area hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that these people have to eat somewhere, Ciobella  
restaurant executive host Brent Michael Kaufmann is preparing for 
two extra seatings a night. The Newbury Street restaurant has been 
visited by Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and Red Sox shortstop 
Nomar Garciaparra, and Kaufmann expects some players to make 
appearances this weekend along with crowds of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely the best event I could think of this  
weekend,'' he said. ``There's nothing better that could happen for 
the hotels and restaurants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees-Red Sox series continues what's been an  
extraordinary year on the national sports scene for Boston. The 
region played host to the major league All-Star Game in July, and 
golf's prestigious Ryder Cup tournament last month. Moscaritolo 
estimates the region has raked in $300 million in visitor spending 
this year on such one-time sporting events, with the Yankees-Sox 
series set to add more to the pile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect matchup,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nation Knew JonBenet Only in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- In a ruffled pink cowgirl outfit, JonBenet  
Ramsey bounced across the stage, flashing her million-dollar smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a cowboy sweetheart,'' she sang, with a white hat  
atop her moussed, golden curls. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance captured on video seemed especially poignant  
when it was played around the world after the 6-year-old child 
beauty queen was found strangled and beaten on Dec. 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This child was like a little doll,'' said a family friend, Dee  
Dee Nelson-Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	She was born Aug. 6, 1990, in Atlanta to John Bennett Ramsey, a  
successful business executive, and his second wife, Patsy, a 
onetime Miss West Virginia. JonBenet was named after her father, 
with the name pronounced in a French-inspired manner as 
zhawn-ben-AY. She spent most of her life in the liberal mountain 
town of Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet attended High Peaks Elementary School, where she made  
the honor roll in the month before she died, and was a member of 
St. John's Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends said she was an active, inquisitive, giving  
child who loved Shirley Temple movies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year of her life, JonBenet followed her mother's  
footsteps into beauty pageants. After her death, the world would 
take a closer look at the children's beauty pageant circuit, where 
youngsters parade in makeup and elaborate hairstyles, sometimes 
when they are barely out of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	She learned how to walk, gesture and perform and collected a  
wardrobe of elaborate costumes, including that of a Las Vegas 
showgirl and a cowgirl. Although JonBenet loved to perform, family 
and friends said the competitions did not rule her life. 
</P>
<P>
	In her last months, JonBenet charmed judges into awarding her  
the titles of Little Miss Colorado, Little Miss Charlevoix, Mich., 
Colorado State All-Star Kids Cover Girl, America's Royale Miss and 
National Tiny Miss Beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	As they traveled to competitions, mother and daughter would sing  
their favorite song, a tune from ``Gypsy,'' a musical and movie 
about a mother obsessed with making her daughter a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever we go, whatever we do, we're gonna get through it  
together,'' they would sing, a minister told mourners at JonBenet's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was buried in Marietta, Ga., next to the grave of her  
half sister, Elizabeth Ramsey, 22, who died in a car crash in Ohio 
in 1992. In the coffin, she was dressed in a beauty pageant dress 
and tiara, with a stuffed toy animal in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly three years later, a grand jury has completed its  
investigation and a prosecutor said there will be no indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer  
remains free and undetected,'' her family said in a statement 
issued Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Japan Keeps Money Policy Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank decided on Wednesday to leave  
its monetary policy unchanged, but said it will begin purchasing 
short-term government bonds to make sure money keeps flowing 
through the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has been under intense pressure from  
politicians at home as well as from other industrialized nations to 
ease its monetary policy in order to stem the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The move appeared to be more of an attempt to divert criticism  
than a dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BOJ is fiddling at the edges with the existing policy, but  
this isn't a quantitative easing,'' said Russell Jones, chief 
economist for the Asia Pacific region at Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendan Brown, chief economist at Bank of Tokyo, however,  
welcomed the decision as ``a fairly significant set of steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said that the move will increase liquidity, or reserves,  
in the banking system, which could lead to a rise in lending for 
investment and also help boost the economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Relaxing monetary policy usually helps bring a nation's currency  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have been worried about an overly strong yen  
because that hurts Japan's big exporters by reducing their overseas 
earnings. They believe that a soaring yen could throw off the 
nation's budding economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose above 107 yen on the news in trading in London,  
minutes after the announcement in Tokyo, up from 106.28 yen late 
Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ policy board meeting Wednesday was closely watched by  
financial markets here because it was the first since the meeting 
of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven 
major industrialized nations in Washington last month. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, the Group of Seven called on Japan to further  
ease its monetary policy to make sure economic recovery continues. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ needs to ``carefully watch'' the yen, because a rise  
could hurt the recovery in private demand, BOJ Governor Masaru 
Hayami said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that the worse was over for the Japanese economy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Compared with a month ago, I see slightly more bright signs,''  
he said after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> ConEd To Buy Northeast Utilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Inc. on Wednesday  
announced it was buying Northeast Utilities for about $3.5 billion 
in cash and stock, creating one of the largest electric companies 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal creates a company with more than 6.4 million electric  
and gas customers from New York City through New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said Wednesday that merging the two utilities  
could save $1.5 billion in operating expenses over 10 years. But 
they had no specifics on how those savings might affect the cost of 
heating and lighting homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is conditioned upon approvals from shareholders  
and state and federal regulators. Industry analysts said regulators 
weren't likely to allow the deal without some obvious benefit to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually it should mean a decrease (in rates), because what  
they're doing is creating a regional super-utility,'' said Jim 
Coyne of Navagant Consulting Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the utility  
industry as deregulation drives power distributors to seek 
competitive advantages by teaming up with neighbors. Just one day 
before, shareholders of Yankee Energy System Inc. accepted a $679 
million buyout from Northeast Utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene McGrath, chairman of Con Ed, said no layoffs were  
planned. Con Ed employs about 14,000 people in New York and 
northern New Jersey. Northeast has about 9,000 workers in 
Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City will serve as headquarters for the combined  
company, and McGrath will continue as chairman and chief executive 
officer; Northeast's corporate chief, Michael Morris, will be 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Northeast investors can exchange each of  
their shares for $25 in cash or $25 in Con Ed stock. Con Ed also 
will pay an additional $1 a share if the two working reactors at 
Northeast's troubled Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut 
are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, Northeast pleaded guilty to 25 violations of  
federal law, including falsifying the credentials of control room 
operators, and agreed to pay $10 million -- the largest penalty in 
the history of the commercial nuclear power industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast, based in Berlin, Conn., is the largest electric  
utility in New England with more than $4 billion in annual revenue 
and more than 1.7 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed, based in New York, has more than 3.3 million electric  
customers and 1.4 million natural gas customers and has generated 
more than $7 billion in annual revenues in New York, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities stock rose Wednesday 43 3/4 cents to $21.68 3/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of Con Ed dipped 6 1/4 cents 
to $36.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Move on Tax Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid estimates that the government loses at  
least $10 billion a year to abuse of corporate tax shelters, House 
Democrats are seizing every opportunity to push a bill to crack 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans are giving the measure a look, partly  
because it would raise an estimated $10.6 billion in revenue over 
10 years and help ease this year's budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Business interests are intent on quietly killing the bill,  
fearing it might interfere with legitimate business transactions 
and give the IRS too much power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all very much behind closed doors,'' said Rep. Lloyd  
Doggett, D-Texas, prime author of the bill. ``They don't want to do 
it out front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, Democrats have tried to use the money  
Doggett's bill would raise as a way to pay for a tax cut, a managed 
care reform bill and a measure extending several expiring corporate 
tax credits. They are considering it as a way to pay for a proposed 
tax cut for businesses to ease costs from a $1 increase in the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	And Republican Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, the main GOP  
sponsor of the managed care measure that passed the House, promoted 
the tax shelter crackdown to help offset its costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a large difference in what you call a tax increase  
and stopping bogus tax shelters,'' Norwood said during House Rules 
Committee debate on his bill. ``We are trying to keep them from 
cheating the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rules Committee, controlled by House GOP leaders, would  
not allow the tax shelter measure a floor vote. So far, Republicans 
have gone no further than hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer said Wednesday his  
panel will hold more hearings so Congress can ``find the right 
approach to where we don't eliminate legitimate business practices 
but we do get at any abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will aggressively pursue any abuses in the tax code,'' said  
Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Doggett bill's central point is that, to be legal, a  
transaction should have some reasonable ``economic substance'' 
other than avoidance of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, it would increase the penalty for tax  
underpayment from 20 percent to 40 percent for transactions that 
fail the test and would eliminate exceptions that protect company 
executives if a deal is OK'd by an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is aimed at eliminating arrangements such as one  
set up by United Parcel Service that the U.S. Tax Court recently 
voided. The court essentially found the company's real intent in 
setting up a Bermuda company to insure valuable packages was to 
funnel profits to the island and avoid U.S. income taxes -- a ruling 
UPS fiercely disagrees with. 
</P>
<P>
	``These schemes are really based on the assumption that they  
won't get caught,'' Doggett said. ``My proposal is a modest way of 
dealing with the problem. It may not be the final answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups, however, have quietly fought tax shelter  
crackdown proposals all year, beginning with an even tougher 
version included in President Clinton's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter this summer to congressional leaders, 17 business  
associations -- including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National 
Association of Manufacturers and American Council of Life Insurance 
-- raised concerns about increased Internal Revenue Service powers 
and urged against going too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any legislative response should not impede the ability of  
businesses and individuals to engage in legitimate business 
transactions,'' the groups wrote. ``There is a potential for IRS 
revenue agents to act as judge and jury when it comes to legitimate 
tax disputes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Kies, a former Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff  
who now lobbies for the PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, 
raised questions about vague language in the Doggett bill and said 
recent court decisions demonstrate current law is working. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people enter into risky decisions under current law, they  
can have the tax benefits taken away,'' Kies said. ``Every time one 
of these cases comes out, it illustrates further why we don't need 
to do what Doggett wants to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in a twist, the chief of the American Bar Association's tax  
section has commended Doggett's bill, which also enjoys support 
from the Clinton administration. The ABA's tax section -- 
representing many lawyers involved in tax shelter work -- has cited 
``growing alarm'' with aggressive marketing of these schemes by 
accountants and other consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proliferation of large corporate tax shelters is a serious  
question in the perceived and actual fairness of the tax code,'' 
said Paul Sax, a San Francisco attorney who chairs the ABA tax 
section. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Doggett's bill faces long odds of becoming law this  
year, it has given Democrats a potent political weapon in the tax 
and budget battles, providing a way to pay for their tax relief 
initiatives and continue criticizing Republicans for using 
non-Social Security surplus dollars to pay for theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If not this, do you want to take it out of Social Security? Do  
you want to raise some other tax?'' Doggett said.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Might Use Ahman Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren is thinking about giving  
Ricky Watters some help. 
</P>
<P>
	Watters, averaging a career-low 3.2 yards in Seattle's first  
four games, is matched against San Diego's stingy defense this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	His backup at running back, Ahman Green, has not had a carry  
this season because of fumbling problems during the Seahawks' 
exhibition games. He fumbled twice in each of the Seahawks' final 
two preseason starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would I like to get him back in there? Certainly,'' Holmgren  
said Wednesday. ``Is this the week? I don't know yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green, a third-round draft choice from Nebraska last year, had  
35 carries for 205 yards, an impressive 6.0 average, as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	At Nebraska, Green was a three-year starter who rushed for 3,880  
yards and 42 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In Holmgren's first season as coach, Green has been strictly a  
special-teams player, averaging 19.7 yards on 11 kickoff returns. 
He averaged 23 yards on 27 kickoff returns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's faster than Ricky is,'' Holmgren said during his weekly  
news conference. ``He's probably a little more of an outside threat 
than Ricky. Ricky is an outstanding pass receiver and they balance 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a nice changeup because I don't think  
they're the same type of back. Ricky is strong, big, he can carry 
the ball 30 times a game and handle that. Ahman would be more 
likely, if you blocked it correctly, to go 60, 70 yards, I would 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watters, in his ninth NFL season and second in Seattle, and the  
Seahawks' running attack could use a 60- or 70-yarder. Watters' 
longest gain this season has been 24 yards. His longest gain in 319 
carries in his first season here was 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Seahawks (3-1) have won three in a row and share the  
lead in the AFC West with the Chargers, their running attack ranks 
27th in the NFL with 296 yards, or 74 yards per game. They have no 
rushing TDs and the team is averaging 2.8 yards on 104 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	At San Diego, they'll face a defense led by linebacker Junior  
Seau that is allowing 72.5 rushing yards per game. The Chargers 
have not allowed an opposing running back to rush for more than 100 
yards in 23 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Holmgren said, obviously hoping to  
keep the Chargers coaching staff guessing this week. ``I know we're 
going to mix some people back in, but I don't know if this week 
he's (Green) going to play some more.''
