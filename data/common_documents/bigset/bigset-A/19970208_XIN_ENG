<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israel's Moving Capital to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today condemned Israel for moving its capital from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, also a holy city for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president stated in Friday prayer sermons that
the issue of Jerusalem was the issue of the whole world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Addressing worshipers at Tehran University campus, Rafsanjani
described Israel's move as "extremely dangerous."
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States was in the false belief
that by supplying Israel with the most advanced weapons it
would help the Israeli entity defend its illegitimate existence
on Palestinian soil.
</P>
<P>
He said that for about 80 years now beginning from the influx
of Jews from Europe and the west to Palestine in 1917, the
Israelis have continued their usurpation of Muslim soil.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Palestinians' struggle would bear
fruit and they would be able to regain their denied rights.

PARIS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special
representative for Africa's Great Lakes region, Algerian diplomat
Mohamed Sahnoun, began his mission here today with a series of
talks with French officials.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that his aim of the talks is to seek
advice and assistance from France on Zaire, where Tutsi rebels,
led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, are gaining ground in the southern
and central part of the African country against government troops.
</P>
<P>
France proposed to the United Nations Security Council on
Thursday a declaration of support for the mission of Sahnoun, who
also represents the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun will meet with French presidential advisor on Africa
Michel Dupuch, Director of the cabinet of the French Foreign
Ministry Denis Bauchard and French State Secretary for
Humanitarian Affairs Xavier Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
He will then travel to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa where
the headquarters of the OAU is located, and then on to the Kenyan
capital Nairobi to set up his office.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun will start a diplomatic shuttle between the capitals of
Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire, and present his report to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan by the end of February.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Charges Canadian Company on Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corp. of the
U.S., the world's software giant, is taking a Canadian computer
company to court in a copyright infringement suit, the Journal of
Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian company called Dentec Corp. is allegedly
distributing counterfeit Microsoft products, including Windows 95,
the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft conducted a six-month investigation capped by a
search of Dentec's warehouse in Scarborough, Ontario. It seized
more than 400 copies of Windows 95 and Microsoft Works 3.0,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft also said it suspects that Dentec distributed
counterfeit copies of Microsoft Encarta software.
</P>
<P>
The software giant alleged that Dentec distributed the
counterfeit products to retailers, who then sold it to consumers.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the Canadian company said the company was unable
to comment on the lawsuit while it is before the courts.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has enhanced its crackdown on counterfeit disks in
Canada. According to an official from the International
Intellectual Property Alliance in Washington, 44 out 100 business
software applications in Canada are illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
That translates into lost sales of about 270 million U.S.
dollars, according to the report.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton introduced a $1.69 trillion
spending plan for 1998 as a step to producing a balanced budget by
2002. He called it "the best chance in a generation" to balance
the budget.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that a
summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
Boris Yeltsin would be held in late March.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton sent Congress a five-year
spending plan that includes a bounty of middle-class tax cuts and
new social and education program, even as it promises to balance
the federal budget for the first time since man set foot on the
Moon.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's two senior lieutenants
warned the West this week that NATO expansion could unleash a new
military buildup.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- With a nation at peace and the economy expanding,
U.S. President Clinton's new budget gives him a chance to attack
some underlying, long-run economic problems: a disappointingly
slow rise of living standards and a widening gap between the
well-off and the poor.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. children are 12 times more likely to die by gunfire
than their counterparts in the rest of the industrialized world,
according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control. From
1950 to 1993, the murder rate tripled while suicides quadrupled.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Rebels Free Four Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Tajik rebels today released four
Russian reporters who were taken hostage Wednesday, according to
reports reaching here from Kalainav, eastern Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The four reporters were identified as Galiana Gridneva from the
Itar-Tass news agency, Suraye Sobirova from the Interfax news
agency and Odilzhon Ashurov and Bobojon Tuganov from the Russian
independent television network.
</P>
<P>
After being set free, they chose to stay on at the rebel base
in Kalainav to cover proposed talks between a governmental
delegation and representatives of the rebel leader Bakhrom
Sadirov, who used to fight for the Islamic opposition.
</P>
<P>
For the last four years the two sides have been engaged in a
civil war in this mountainous former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
But a ceasefire agreed between the government and the armed
Islamic opposition last December seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
The reporters were expected to return to the Tajik capital
Dushanbe after the talks finish, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Two International Red Cross workers seized by Sadirov's men
Wednesday were also set free on Thursday. But the rebels are
still holding four employees from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR
and four U.N. military observers.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Red Cross delegation Thomas Merkelbach told
reporters that the release of the other hostages depended on the
arrival of Dushanbe officials to Kalainav for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted Gerd Merrem, U.N. special envoy to
Tajikistan, as saying that four hostages were ill.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Three Cambodian parties,
including the ruling royalist Funcinpec party, today formed a
committee for creating a new political alliance, known as National
United Front, to compete with the CPP-led alliance in the upcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the Funcinpec Party, the unofficial Khmer Nation
Party (KNP) and the Son Sann-led faction of the Buddhist Liberal
Democratic Party (BLDP) met at a hotel and agreed on a working
program and some organizational issues concerning the operation of
the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the BLDP are partners in the ruling coalition
that also includes its main rival, the Cambodian People's Party
while the KNP is an opposition party not officially recognized.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Tol Lah, education minister from Funcinpec,
told reporters that a four-point plan was reached by the 12
delegates at the session.
</P>
<P>
He said that the delegates agreed that the committee for
creating the alliance will comprise five people from each of the
three parties.
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet every week and can convene at any time
if necessary, Tol Lah added.
</P>
<P>
"The front is set up not for fighting but for solidarity to
solve the important problems facing the country," he said, "What
we try to do here is to achieve all objectives successfully."
</P>
<P>
Tol Lah said that the front is "not against any party and is open
to all who respect the charter and have the same ideal."
</P>
<P>
The CPP has signed agreements for a political alliance with the
Liberal Democratic Party and the faction of the BLDP led by
Information Minister Ieng Mouly.

<HEADLINE> EC Escaped from Censure over Handling Mad Cow Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament on
Thursday stepped back from censuring the European Commission over
its handling of "mad cow" disease, the newspaper Herald Tribune
published in The Hague, Netherlands, reported today.
</P>
<P>
It reported that a parliamentary committee of inquiry rejected
an amendment by the Green Group calling for a motion of
no-confidence in the commission, the European Union's executive
body.
</P>
<P>
It was one of 254 amendments to a report attacking the way the
Commission had handled the 1996 mad cow crisis, which has
seriously damaged the European beef industry, and suggesting
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Green Group, which had expected support from the largest
political groups - the Socialists and Christian Democrats -
complained that the committee had changed its mind due to
political pressure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Up to 5.4 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
rose to 5.4 percent in January despite moderate economic growth,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. jobless rate last month was the highest since last
July. During the last five months of 1996, the rate drifted
between 5.3 percent and 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the small rise, the U.S. unemployment rate
remained near seven-year lows and the U.S. Labor Department
described the rate as essentially unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the increase of 271,000 in payrolls was
the best since last August although it was exaggerated by the
effect of last winter's heavy snows in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Areas of strong jobs growth in January included computer and
data processing and engineering and management services.
Transportation, real estate and financial companies added jobs as
well.
</P>
<P>
Employment at retail stores grew by 19,000, far less than the
seasonally adjusted monthly average of 50,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Construction firms added 14,000 jobs despite snow storms in the
South, Midwest and Northern Plains which held down activity.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in January was 4 percent for white men,
3.9 percent for white women, 9.2 percent for both black men and
women, 8.3 percent for Hispanics, 14.3 percent for white teens and
34.8 percent for black teens.

<HEADLINE> EC Clears Acquisition of MeesPierson by Fortis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
today that it had decided to clear the acquisition of MeesPierson,
a subsidiary of the Dutch ABN-AMRO Bank N.V., by Fortis, the
Belgian-Dutch insurance and banking group.
</P>
<P>
This will put an end to the considerable overlap of activities
which exists at present between MeesPierson and ABN-AMRO, the
Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
MeesPierson activities in Belgium are insignificant.
Geographical overlap only exists in the Netherlands, where Fortis
operates through its banking subsidiary Fortis Bank Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"From a conglomerate point of view, the acquisition of
MeesPierson will not substantially strengthen the financial
position of Fortis," the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will compete with players of the size of
ABN-AMRO, ING Bank and Rabobank.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the three banks, some fifty other banks are active
in the Dutch Market.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Stands at 9.7 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate stood
at 9.7 percent in January, unchanged from December, Statistics
Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The estimated level of employment was virtually unchanged in
the month. Only 5,100 more people had jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although the figures are disappointing, they are not expected
to have any big impact on the government budget, which will be
brought down on February 18, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
While total employment was little changed in January, the
picture was different for full- and part-time employment.
</P>
<P>
In January, the number of full-time jobs increased by 32,000,
while part-time employment fell 27,000.
</P>
<P>
Growth in self-employment has been the driving force in the
creation of 91,000 jobs since last September, and accounts for all
the gains, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Canadian youths still have great difficulties to find jobs.
Last month, their unemployment rate rose to 17 percent, up 0.6
percent in a month.
</P>
<P>
As in the previous four months, employment in the
goods-producing sector showed little change in January,
maintaining gains of 110,000 made from May to August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The estimated level of employment in construction climbed
19,000 in January. These gains were offset by losses in public
utilities, government and the commercial sectors.

BUCHAREST, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Children account for 90
percent of Romania's 4,446 Aids victims, one of the highest rates
in the world, statistics from Romania's National Anti-Aids Council
show.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, 4005 children had been registered as
suffering from the Aids virus, of which 1,403, or more than one
third, had died, the figures show. That compares with 441 adult
sufferers registered, of which 133 have died.
</P>
<P>
Romania's child Aids sufferers account for more than half of
Europe's paediatric Aids cases.
</P>
<P>
However, better medical treatment and care have led to an
improvement in their life expectancy from eight to 10 years.

Paraschiv Marcu, head of the Romanian news agency ROMPRES'
information center told Xinhua that one of the main reasons for
the high number of children with the Aids virus was the outlawing
of abortion before 1989.
</P>
<P>
Many mothers just abandoned their new-born babies. When these
babies were innoculated against diseases in orphanages, some of
the needles were contaminated with the Aids virus and led to a
number of babies infected. Many babies were also infected through
contaminated blood supplies used in transfusions.
</P>
<P>
Marcu said that those infections mainly happened between 1990
and 1991. Since then, measures have been taken to ensure safe
blood supplies and promote the use of disposable needles, leading
to a fall in the number of new cases.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Economy Grows 4.1 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Gross National
Product (GNP) rose 4.1 percent in 1996 to 109 trillion lev (36
billion U.S. dollars), Chairman of the Romania's National
Statistics Commission Pavel Wagner said today.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the overall economic situation of 1996 at a press
conference, Wagner said that the country's gross industrial output
value had increased 9.9 percent on 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sectors showing the highest increases were textiles,
furniture, machinery, automobiles. But output in the petroleum,
chemistry and metallurgical industries fell.
</P>
<P>
The total agricultural output value rose by just 1.81 percent
in 1996 over 1995 with the output of beet, vegetables and grapes
rising despite some severe natural disasters last year which hit
grain output.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports in 1996 stood at 9.97 billion dollars and
7.65 billion dollars respectively, both showing a decline of
around 3 percent on 1995.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the country in 1996 stood at 20.67 trillion
lev (6.6 billion dollars), up 4.5 percent from 1995. Foreign
investment was 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three countries that made the highest individual
investments were South Korea, Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 unemployment stood at 6.3 percent, meaning 650,000
Romanians were officially out of work, down from 9.5 percent in
1995. The inflation rate in Romania was 56.9 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Leading Credit Card Companies Face Antitrust Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department is
preparing to file an antitrust suit against Visa U.S.A. and
MasterCard International for barring member banks from issuing
American Express and Discover cards, the Wall Street Journal
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The case, under an investigation for the past six months, could
have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. credit-card industry,
as well as for antitrust law. The paper said the American Express
Company complained that Visa and MasterCard unfairly limit
competition through the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
All banks that issue credit cards in the U.S. are members of
either Visa or MasterCard, and usually both. New York-based
American Express, which has been losing market share in recent
years to bank-issued cards, has been lobbying banks since May to
issue its cards as well. The effort has been unsuccessful,
however, because the banks are reluctant to drop out of Visa and
MasterCard in order to issue American Express Cards, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Justice Department said that the
department is expected to proceed with a lawsuit as early as the
end of this month, unless Visa and MasterCard agree to change
their attitude and allow member banks to issue competing cards.
</P>
<P>
For their part, Visa and MasterCard are expected to fight a
Justice Department challenge, the paper said. They have adopted
radically different arguments in defending their prohibition.
</P>
<P>
Visa said allowing banks to issue American Express would hurt
competition even further because banks would have less interest in
going after American Express's market. MasterCard said allowing
banks to also issue American Express cards is unnecessary and
would give American Express a "free ride."
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say the case could have enormous significance.
</P>
<P>
Last year, American Express's market share was 15.8 percent,
down from 24.5 percent a decade ago. Over the same period, Visa's
market share swelled to nearly 50 percent from 44.5 percent, while
MasterCard's share slipped to 28.3 percent from 30 percent. Dean
Witter, Discover &AMP; Co.'s Discover card, meanwhile, surged to 6.5
percent from just 1 percent.

PARIS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean government today said
that its troops killed 800 rebels in Watsa in Upper Zaire, which
is some 100 kilometers from the Ugandan border, during fierce
fighting Thursday night and Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a communique of the

<HEADLINE> 3,800 Child Soldiers Disarmed in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,800 child fighters, many
as young as six, have been demobilized in Liberia since last
November, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The official deadline of January 31 for disarmament and
demobilization has been extended for another seven days until
February 7, UNICEF said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament process, which began on November 22, 1996, has
so far resulted in 18,313 factional fighters handing in their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
But thousands of combatants have yet to disarm and demobilize
so the disarmament process has been extended in an effort to
ensure that the fighters of all factions are completely disarmed
and ready for national elections.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord signed last August, elections are scheduled to
be held on May 31, 1997 in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF quoted West African Peace-Keeping Force (ECOMOG) and
United Nations Military Observer Mission in Liberia statistics as
saying that about 5,000 or 15 percent of the 33,000 combatants in
Liberia are child soldiers carrying arms.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has warned that all soldiers who have not voluntarily
disarmed after the current deadline of February 7 will be treated
as criminals.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is said to be working with other partners to develop
programs allowing the disarmed children to go to school or do
vocational training.
</P>
<P>
It is also implementing a number of medium- and long- term
activities to facilitate the reintegration of not just child
soldiers but all disadvantaged children in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Children as young as six and seven have been recruited to fight
in the armed factions in Liberia," said UNICEF. "They have been
manipulated, given stimulants such as marijuana and gun powder to
make them brave and fight, and forced to loot and vandalize."
</P>
<P>
"These children share common psychological trauma, uncertainty
about their future, insecurity and above all, a desire either to
go back to school or to learn some kind of trade that would allow
them to fend for themselves in society," said UNICEF.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Arrests 26 Ex-combatants with Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG today announced the arrest of 26
ex-combatants of defunct Liberian warring factions who were found
in possession of arms.
</P>
<P>
In a raid on three villages in western Liberia early Tuesday,
the ECOMOG recovered from the criminals "a substantial quantity
of arms, including FN rifles, AK-47 assault rifles, M16 rifles,
rocket propelled grenades, bombs and several rounds of
ammunition".
</P>
<P>
"Some of the criminals were caught manning illegal checkpoints
and terrorizing villagers in Teh, Mani and Bomi towns," the
ECOMOG said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Villagers accused those arrested of subjecting them to
"inhuman treatment" and stealing metal sheets from their roofs to
sell.
</P>
<P>
The 75,000-troop ECOMOG has achieved "success" in the
voluntary disarmament and demobilization of Liberia's former
warring factions, which ended on January 31 this year in
accordance with the peace accord signed last August.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECOMOG statistics, nearly 300,000 out of the
estimated 33,000 fighters participating in the fratricidal war
that claimed more than 150,000 lives had put down their weapons
by that date.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu has repeated the
warning that any Liberian found in possession of weapons after
the deadline will be treated as a criminal.
</P>
<P>
Today's statement did not specify the factional allegiance of
those arrested, but this area has traditionally been contested by
the two wings of the United Liberation Movement.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Concerned over Safety of British Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is to call
in British ambassador to Ireland today to express its growing
concern over safety of Britain's Sellafield nuclear plant in
Cumbria, northern England following two incidents at the nuclear
complex.
</P>
<P>
Irish Energy Minister Emmet Stagg said that he will hold talks
with British ambassador Veronica Sutherland in Dublin later today
to convey Irish government's grave concern over the issue,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Stagg said that he would tell the British envoy if Sellafield
continued "in its present mode, the only solution is to shut it
down."
</P>
<P>
It was reported six workers at the Sellafield nuclear
reprocessing plant were contaminated by radioactive dust in an
accident on Sunday night and some radioactive liquid leaked from a
storage tank building of the same plant on the following night.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister stressed that if such accidents could occur
worse ones could also happen in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable for Ireland to get reassurances that will
prevent pollution from the nuclear industry in Britain affecting
Ireland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government is also likely to urge the British
government to abandon plans to build an underground nuclear waste
dump near Sellafield, which could lead to leaking of radiation
from such a dump into the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
Stagg made it clear that Ireland had "the absolute right to
insist that the UK bear the cost of keeping this hazardous waste
totally contained and isolated from our shared environment."

<HEADLINE> Britain's Growth to Speed Up, Say LBS Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's rate of economic
growth is likely to accelerate this year and next with consumer
spending and business investment fueling the recovery, according
to the latest forecast from the London Business School (LBS).
</P>
<P>
The LBS expects the economy to grow 3.3 percent this year and
2.7 percent next year. But, while the pound will not
significantly dent growth, it will push the underlying rate of
inflation below the 2.5 percent limit targeted by the Government.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is predicted to continue falling this year,
dropping to below 1.7 million, or 6 percent of the labor force, by
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is expected to rise by more than 4 percent
this year, with business investment rising 8.5 percent this year
and 6.5 percent next.
</P>
<P>
Exports are also likely to strengthen, with growth of more than
2 percent in Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
The LBS expects underlying inflation to fall below 2.5 percent
within the first six months of 1997 and stay there for the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast bases its optimism on growth partly on the
assumption that sterling's strength will prove temporary.
</P>
<P>
The LBS predicts an average on the pound's effective index
against a basket of currencies of 95 in the first half of this
year, falling to just over 90 by the end of 1997.

<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's economic performance
improved in January with the inflation rate dropped by 0.3
percentage points to 5.4 percent from the previous month, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly report of the Cabinet's Data Center quoted by the
agency said that the Egyptian pound was stable before most
international principal currencies in January.
</P>
<P>
Exports of raw material and cotton rose in value to 47 million
pounds (13.8 million U.S. dollars) in January from 30 million (8.8
million dollars) in December 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Exports of both semi-manufactured and manufactured commodities
rose to 437 million pounds (128.5 million dollars) last month from
337 million (99.1 million dollars) a month earlier, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
As for the capital market, shares circulated in January reached
21.08 million, involving the value of 451.47 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, oil production reached 3.592 million tonnes
against the consumption of 2 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from the Suez Canal rose by one million dollars to
158.2 million over November while income from tourism amounted to
225 million, the report said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Britain to Face Possible Legal Action over BSE Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government could
face action in the European Court over its Agriculture Minister's
refusal to give evidence before the European Parliament's special
inquiry into the BSE or mad cow disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
In its final report due to be published later, the 19-strong
inquiry committee voted on Thursday to demand the European Union's
(EU) executive Commission to take action against the British
government, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The report said the EU Commission "must, in its role as
guardian of the EU treaties, be invited to take action in the
Court of Justice against the British government" for its breach of
EU rules.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg has reportedly
insisted that national ministers are not obliged to appear before
the European assembly and he offered to send civil servants in his
place.
</P>
<P>
The report also made it clear that Britain could also be forced
to reimburse billions of pounds of EU funds spent on eradicating
the mad cow disease if it refused to cooperate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef products exports
last March when the British government admitted possible links
between mad cow disease to its human equivalent Creudzfeldt Jacob
Disease.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections to Be Held After 30 Years in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freetown, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Local Government
Minister David Quee said Friday local elections will be held in
six months time if the necessary funds are available.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first democratic local government elections to
take place in the west African state for over three decades.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, Quee said the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), ''will be encouraged to take part.''
</P>
<P>
''Our fledgling democracy can only be meaningful if elections
are conducted at local level,'' Quee added.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that ''the elections will be based on a direct
vote and not the proportional representation'' under which the
February 1996 parliamentary elections were held.
</P>
<P>
West african diplomats here said despite Quee's statement,
the electoral commission, which supervises elections, is currently
strapped for cash. the elections will need about 8 million
dollars, one diplomat told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Presidential and parliamentary elections were funded by the
European Union at the cost of 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A move by the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party asking other
political parties to nominate officials for the 12 district
councils and the Freetown City Council was ''outrightly
rejected'' last week by other parties.
</P>
<P>
''The arrangement is an attempt to derail democracy,'' one
party leader said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin to Meet in Helsinki in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will hold their summit meeting
in Helsinki, Finland, on March 20-21, it was officially announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and
visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"We expect, among other things, that the presidents will
address bilateral arms control, European security and a number of
economic issues of importance to our peoples," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents have asked us to express their deep
appreciation for the invitation of President Ahtisaari of
Finland," Gore told reporters. "This will of course be an
important meeting."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also emphasized the importance of the summit. "And
the agenda will include most topical issues for our two nations
and for our bilateral relations, including various international
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later this afternoon, the Russian prime minister is expected to
meet with Clinton. They would give another press conference at
about 3:50 pm EST.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Russian summit had been scheduled to take place in
Washington but the two sides agreed to change the venue because of
Yeltsin's health conditions.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the summit will be the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into the central
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Washington firmly insisted that NATO's expansion will start by
1999 and the issue will be focused at a NATO special summit in
July in Madrid despite the strong opposition from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed leaders of the four major NATO powers,
France, the U.S., Britain and Germany, and Russia should hold a
separate summit in April to discuss NATO's relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Moscow demands NATO allies sign a binding treaty with Russia on
their relations to ensure that NATO be changed into a political
organization from a military alliance.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Chernomyrdin and Gore also focused on the
economic and trade relations between the U.S. and Russia.
</P>
<P>
They told reporters that the eighth session of the U.S.-Russia
Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation closed.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that this work has been productive as we have
prepared more than 40 documents for signature on the most
important issues for our two countries," Chernomyrdin said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in Liberia Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- There appear encouraging signs
that a last peace may at last be in sight in Liberia, as
disarmament in the warring country has progressed as planned
after initial setbacks.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the west African
peacekeeping force operating in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, and
authenticated by the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia
(UNOMIL), a total of 28,819 fighters have been disarmed out of an
estimated 33,000 participants in the fratricidal war that claimed
more than 150,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
What is of particular significance is the readiness of the
various factions to repose confidence in the members of the peace
force and surrender their weapons.
</P>
<P>
So far, tons of arms, including bombs, machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenade launchers, have been voluntarily
transferred to the ECOMOG's custody.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed by Liberia's warlords
last August in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, voluntary disarmament
was due to end on January 31 this year to pave the way for
general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
However, to collect more weapons, the ECOMOG announced a week
of grace upon the January 31 deadline so that fighters in remote
areas where communication is not convenient can surrender their
arms.
</P>
<P>
A peace summit between faction leaders Charles Taylor and
George Boley in the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia on Tuesday is also "a sign of good things to come to
Liberia", said the ECOMOG Commander, Nigeria's Major-General
Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also regarded by the two former factional
leaders as a very important and positive development to promote
the Liberian peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the United Nations recommended measures aimed at
establishing a credible political framework for elections in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations will probably serve as a provisional
mechanism for the installation of a government of national unity
and pave the way for a return to a constitutional order.

HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- About 97 percent children of

</P>
<P>
This enables Zimbabwe to be ahead of most African countries in
terms of the universal primary education, said Chigwedere.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a good partnership between the government and

<HEADLINE> EU Confident in Security Situation in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
expressed confidence in the current state of security in Liberia
as provided by the West African peacekeeping force, known as
ECOMOG, a military statement said today.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was made in the Liberian capital of Monrovia by
Brian O'Neill, an EU official, who travelled to Monrovia by road
on Wednesday from neighboring Guinea in the north.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECOMOG statement, the EU official commended
ECOMOG for the drastic improvement in Liberia's security
situation, and noted that there was also a major reduction in the
level of harassment of the civil populace by the armed fighters.
</P>
<P>
The return of normalcy to the security situation in the
country was also an indication that refugees could start
returning home now through repatriation by various agencies and
bodies willing to help in that respect, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the success ECOMOG has achieved so far in
Liberia's peace process, the EU official emphasized the need for
ECOMOG and EU to continue to work together for the total
restoration of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
In response, ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu
expressed the force's gratitude to EU and the rest of the
international community for their assistance to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
He however appealed for a massive creation of jobs by
international agencies to help absorb the thousands of young men
and women, who were recently disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Such a measure will help combat crime in the war-ravaged
country, Malu said.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary disarmament of Liberia's estimated 33,000 former
factional fighters was completed at the end of last month, with
nearly 30,000 of them surrendering their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Now the ECOMOG mobile disarmament teams with about 46 trucks
are already out, busy collecting weapons from several points
around the country, Malu said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticultural Production Set to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticultural
exports this year are likely to be reduced following a high
disease and pest attack on the crops, the Horticultural Promotion
Council (HPC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
HPC Chief Executive Stanley Heri said vegetables, flowers and
fruits are under pressure from disease and pests because the
ecological balance has been upset by incessant rains which began
in December.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the volume of the yield might not be affected, but
the exportable volumes will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
Horticulture is one of the country's most buoyant and fastest
growing industries, registering a growth in earnings from 30,000
U.S. Dollars some 10 years ago to almost 100 million U.S. Dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
Heri stressed, ''we will only be able to assess the level of
damage at the end of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Rediscount Rate Cut Again in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Central Bank today
cut further the rediscount rate by a massive four percentage
points, putting pressure on commercial banks to cut lending
rates.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to boost private sector activity and support
economic recovery efforts during 1997, when GDP growth is
expected to reach seven percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the
rediscount rate would be cut from the current level of 27 percent
to 23.5 percent amid indications that inflation, now pegged at
16.4 percent, will not exceed 20 percent by June.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in less than a year the Central Bank
has adjusted the rediscount rate, a prime indicator used by banks
to adjust lending rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank said, ''it is expected that, with this reduction of
the rediscount rate, banks will lower lending rates and provide
the much-needed relief to the productive sectors and thus
underpin the strong growth the economy is currently
experiencing.''

<HEADLINE> Greece, Russia Sign Protocol on Possible Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Russia today signed a
cooperation protocol to examine the possibility of Moscow
supplying Athens with defense material and joint production in the
defense sector.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed during a visit to Greece of a
delegation from the international military cooperation directorate
of the Russian Defense Ministry which met with Greek Defense
Undersecretary Dimitris Apostolakis today.
</P>
<P>
Apostolakis told the press after the signing of the protocol
that Russia had a well developed industry in the fields of
missiles and anti-aircraft systems "but today's agreement is of a
more general nature and nothing has yet been agreed".
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's military leadership was at the
stage of inviting offers.
</P>
<P>
On the possible supply of Russian aircraft to Greece,
Apostolakis said that "this is a very long and complex process
which has not yet reached the level of talks."
</P>
<P>
"Russian aircraft are good, but Greece's system of maintenance
and spare parts is American and the shift to another system is a
long process," Apostolakis said.
</P>
<P>
He noted however that a squadron of Russian aircraft may come
to Greece in the spring to take part in a joint exercise with
Greek aircraft.
</P>
<P>
On the reactions to the fact that Greece is the first NATO
member to consider purchasing Russian weapons systems, Apostolakis
acknowledged that "displeasure" had been expressed and pressure
exerted at a diplomatic level.
</P>
<P>
He clarified however that the pressure being exerted was not of
the kind "don't buy from them" but rather "buy from us".

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Drops in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in Greece dropped
to 6.8 percent in January to reach the lowest point in 25 years,
according to figures released today by the National Statistics
Service (NSS).
</P>
<P>
In January 1996 inflation stood at 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the result of a 0.5 percent reduction in the
consumer price index (CPI) in January, compared to 0.1 percent in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
NSS said the CPI decrease was due to reductions in the prices
of clothing and footwear, durable consumer goods and household
items.
</P>
<P>
National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
described the drop in inflation as a significant development for
the economy "since it affords protection for low incomes while at
the same time interest rates are falling".

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- One of the top priorities of
the government is to eliminate child labor by means of bringing
all the children to schools, Education Minister Burity Da Silva
said today.
</P>
<P>
Silva made the remarks while speaking at a ceremony here in
which the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) presented its report on
the situation of the world children.
</P>
<P>
He said Angola should work out new economic policies and pass
relevant laws to enable the public to realize the serious problem
of child labor in Angola in a bid to wipe it out once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is widespread in the country because their
situation has been worsened, Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The annual report by UNICEF put Angola's children's mortality
rate at 10 per 1,000, the second largest in the world. Forty
percent of the war-affected Angolans of 3.6 million are children
and most of them cannot go to school, nor can they enjoy medical
treatment or get clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Silva said the government is trying hard to change the
situation by setting up children's associations and formulating
laws on children to protect their rights.

LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new car market started
the year on a strong note, with sales up almost 8 percent in
January, the second-highest total for the month on record,
according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
(SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Total sales last month amounted to 206,800, which represented a
7.8 percent increase on the same month last year, figures released
by the SMMT showed.
</P>
<P>
However, imports reached one of the highest totals on record,
accounting for 65.4 percent of the month's total sales, compared
with 60.9 percent in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that the increased import penetration was led
mainly by manufacturers based on the European Continent, with
Renault sales up almost 29 percent to 15,000, Citroen's by 16
percent to 11,300 and Volkswagen's by 14 percent to 10,550.

Japanese makers also made substantial sales gains in January,
with Nissan sales up 19.4 percent to 8,900 and Toyota's rising
almost 31 percent to 6,700.

However, market leader Ford felt the pressure of competition,
with its market share dipping to just under 20 percent and sales
slipping 3.3 percent to 40,500. Rover sales also fell 10.7 percent
to 18,500.

<HEADLINE> Moi Warns Against Involvement in Zairean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today urged outsiders to refrain from involvement in the
Zairean conflict.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement was quoted by the official Kenya News
Agency as saying that continued fueling of the conflict would
definitely lead to destabilization of Zaire and the entire
central African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has repeatedly accused Uganda, Rwanda
and Burundi of supporting the Banyamulenge troops in their
rebellion against Zaire's central government and intense fighting
is now going on in eastern Zaire after Kinshasa launched a
counter-offensive recently.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that the situation in eastern Zaire had
deteriorated despite the call of immediate cease-fire by the two
African regional summits held in Nairobi last year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader noted that there were reports of foreign
countries supporting east Zaire's Banyamulenge rebels to fight
against the Kinshasa government.
</P>
<P>
Moi also urged the Banyamulenge to immediately observe the
cease-fire they had earlier agree upon and stop from creating new
fronts as their resort to armed conflict had greatly complicated
the situation.
</P>
<P>
President Moi is currently leading an African mediating team
formed by four heads of state including Zimbabwean President

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Steps up Campaign to Eradicate Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM MALAI, Cambodia, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A new round of
national immunization days to combat childhood polio were launched
in Cambodia today as part of a nationwide vaccination campaign to
wipe out the disease.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and United Nations
representatives attended a ceremony marking the National
Immunization Days (NIDs) at Malai, in western Cambodia's Banteay
Meanchey Province, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Health ministry officials hope that the new round of NIDs, to
last until March 11, will be the final stage of the campaign to
eradicate polio and that no children will catch the disease after
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia had the highest rate of child polio sufferers in the
Western Pacific region in 1994. But some 1.8 million children were
vaccinated last year as part of the campaign to wipe out the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the World Health Organization estimate that the
number of new confirmed cases of polio fell to 50 last year.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Hun Sen called on the health ministry and
local authorities to step up their commitment to the campaign to
eradicate polio and appealed to other countries, international
bodies and non-governmental organizations around the world to
continue their assistance to Cambodia's project.
</P>
<P>
Some 461 mobile inoculation teams will travel the country by
boat and motor bike, targeting former war zones in the Battambang
and Banteay Meanchey Provinces.
</P>
<P>
The first round of NIDs was launched in late January in four
districts of Battambang Province: Pailin, Kamreang, Phnom Prek and
Sampov Lung.
</P>
<P>
Significant progress in wiping out polio has been made in the
past two years with joint efforts by the Cambodian health ministry
and the World Health Organization (WHO), officials said.

<HEADLINE>   German Central Banker Says Mark Decline Should Be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The decline of the German mark
against the U.S. dollar should now be over, Germany's central bank
president Hans Tietmeyer said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Berliner Zeitung newspaper Tietmeyer
that the mark had been overvalued against the dollar during the
past two years and that therefore the recent rise of the dollar
against the mark was a corrective process.
</P>
<P>
But he believed that "the corrective process has now, for the
most part, come to an end".
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer made the remarks ahead of a Group of Seven (G-7)
finance ministers meeting in Berlin Saturday. The one-day routine
meeting also brings together central bankers from Germany, the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy to discuss
world economic and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing before the meeting, German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel stressed that the current strength of the dollar could
not be attributed to negative German or European developments.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the mark's decline had nothing to do with the
planned 1999 European single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears that the mark could decline in value if
financial markets decide the euro will be weaker than the
mark due to the inclusion of countries like Spain, Portugal and
Italy in monetary union at its start.
</P>
<P>
It had been reported that the European Union had a secret plan
to delay Italy's membership in the single currency until 2000 or
2001. But the reports were strongly denied by Bonn, Brussels and
Rome.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Expanding in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Fortytwo-year-old Ma
Zhanchang, formerly a poor farmer of Xihaigu Prefecture, which was
once cited as the poorest area in China, is presently the owner of
one of the largest private enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ma of the Hui ethnic group first tried to get rid of poverty by
selling cashmere. With the money he earned he started a cashmere
workshop in the High-tech Development Zone in Yinchuan, capital of
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
To date, his workshop has been turned into a large cashmere
company with two subcompanies, two processing factories and three
domestic offices, which generates an annual output of over 100
million yuan (12 million US dollars) and a profit of 2.5 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The example of Ma is a case in point that epitomizes the
stories of the private businesspeople in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Ningxia, with a population of more than
five million, had set up over 78,400 private businesses with
annual sales amounting to some 2.18 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, around 11,000 private businesses were added in
Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
The private sector of the autonomous region is engaged in a
wide range of businesses, including goods processing, production
and farming. Many of them gear their products to the international
market.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector has already become a new focus of economic
growth," some officials in Ningxia said.

MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos will soon announce a presidential candidate he will support
from the ruling Lakas-NUCD as the campaign season for the 1998
elections is getting closer, a close aide to Ramos said today.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Radio Mindanao Network, Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres said the issue on Ramos' appointment of the
presidential candidate is creating a commotion in the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
But Torres, who is the Lakas-NUCD vice president for Luzon
region, said the party's leadership is exerting efforts to
minimize the adverse effect of the issue on the party.
</P>
<P>
Strongly considered to compete for Ramos' appointment in a
party convention are Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose
de Venecia, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa and may be Finance
Secretary Roberto de Ocampo.
</P>
<P>
Torres gave hints of strengths between De Venecia and De Villa.
</P>
<P>
Speaker De Venecia has a political base among congressmen and
other local officials, while De Villa has the support from the
military, police and veterans.

<HEADLINE> Report: Palestinians in East Jerusalem Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Interior Ministry
is stepping up a drive to revoke Israeli residency rights from
Palestinians who have lived abroad for more than seven years,
according to English bi-weekly the Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians charged that the crackdown was initiated by
Interior Minister Eli Suissa so as to hold down the number of
Palestinians in East Jerusalem in preparation for the start of
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the Palestinians who have recently returned to
Jerusalem from years living overseas or in the West Bank say
that they have learned their residency rights were canceled
only when they applied for some government service.
</P>
<P>
Others say the ministry has taken their ID cards for routine
processing, and subsequently refused to return them. "The
ministry," says Palestinian human rights activist Bassam Eid,
"tells them it needs the ID cards, and they never get them back."
</P>
<P>
Later, these Palestinians sometimes get a form letter from the
ministry, telling them and members of their families "to leave
Israel."
</P>
<P>
In addition, some Palestinians claim the ministry has canceled
residency rights of people who were not absent for seven years, or
who maintained a permanent residence in the city during their
absence.
</P>
<P>
Tovah Elinson, spokeswoman for the ministry, confirmed there
has been increase in ID cards revoked, and says it is perfectly
legal, according to the bi-weekly.
</P>
<P>
A permanent resident who does not hold citizenship and has
lived outside Israel for more than seven years automatically
loses residency rights, she noted. She attributed the increase
in revoked ID cards to a rise in Palestinians returning to
East Jerusalem since the signing of the Oslo Accords. "Before
that," she said, "they didn't want to be here."

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province reported success in price control last year, cutting the
retail price index to one digit for the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Gansu's retail price index,
China's measurement of inflation, dropped by nine percentage
points in 1996 to be below seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the achievement, which was scored along with
an economic growth rate of 10.95 percent, was remarkable because
it was the first time for Gansu, a less-developed province in
China to achieve a rapid economic growth while effectively
controlling the price rise at a comparatively low level.
</P>
<P>
China's national retail price index was up 6.1 percent last
year while its economy grew 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that new price-control rules and
reinforced price checks were two major factors behind Gansu's
success in bringing prices down significantly.
</P>
<P>
Gansu investigated a total of 3,242 violations of price rules
in 1996, which involved a combined illegal income of more than 31
million yuan (about 3.7 million US dollars), the official said.

HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 22,000 fireworks
shells rocketed into the sky over the Victoria Harbor this

Staged the day after the Chinese Lunar New Year's Day, the
23-minute spectacle attracted some 400,000 Hong Kong residents and
tourists from overseas. As night fell, spectators flooded into the
 waterfront areas in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon in order to get

</P>
<P>
At 8:00 PM sharp, a magnificent cascade of fireworks
accompanied by pleasant music raised the curtain for the night
show, and then an auspicious message flashed across the sky,
wishing Hong Kong a prosperous year in 1997 -- the Year of Ox.
</P>
<P>
The beginning act was followed by other four parts, entitled
Homely Festivity, New Luster of the Oriental Pearl, Out of This
World and Fancy Fantasy. In between the acts, there were two
interludes called Blessings of Deities and Cosmopolitan Charms.
</P>
<P>
Baskets of fireworks resembling spring blossoms, rainbow,
rubies and emeralds flourished in the night sky. Laser beams,
which appeared for the first time in fireworks show in Hong Kong,
created various images and added much color to the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
Waves of cheers surged in the crowd each time fireworks flew
into the sky. Snapshooters seized the moment to press shutters
while video camera holders enjoyed the leisure to record the
festivity.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks display bore a great significance this year for
Hong Kong people, who will witness the return of Hong Kong to
China in less than 150 days. As the extravaganza signified an
auspicious beginning for the Year of Ox, they all hoped that Hong
Kong would continue to be stable and prosperous.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Mark 50th Anniversary of Multilateral Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Cuba have both
proposed events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the world's
multilateral trading system next year.
</P>
<P>
At the General Council meeting of the World Trade Organization
on Friday, Canada proposed a ministerial meeting be held in the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and Morocco, where the last ministerial gathering
of the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which
gave way to the WTO, was held in 1994, both supported the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Cuba proposed an international seminar on the world trading
system be held in late 1997 in Havana, where some 53 countires
signed the final act authenticating the text of the Havana Charter
in March 1948. The Charter was one of the founding documents of
the system.
</P>
<P>
During the WTO ministerial conference last December in
Singapore, participants agreed that there should be some
recognition of the 50th anniversary of the multilateral trading
system, but the precise details such as the date and structure of
the celebrations were not worked out.

<TEXT>
<P>

160,000 new telephone users and 100,000 mobile phones users.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, Guangzhou's telephone numbers were geared to

<P>
FREETOWN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone President Tejan
Kabbah today ordered the "immediate release" of a former senior
battalion commander in the army Lt Colonel Chernor Deen from the
Maximum Security Prison in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Deen was originally sentenced to death after a martial court
two years ago accused him of "collaborating with the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF)."
</P>
<P>
The charges stemmed from a rebel attack near Makeni in the
north of Sierra Leone, in which an anti-aircraft tank was
captured by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Deen's sentence was later commutated to life imprisonment but
he had always protested his innocence.
</P>
<P>
In his broadcast marking the feast of Ramadan, Kabbah
described Deen's release as a "confidence building measure."

<HEADLINE> Tibetan People Shoo Away Poverty on Eve of Tibetan New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Gyaisang found a wisp of fleece
while eating dough drop soup and people around suddenly burst into
cheers.
</P>
<P>
The scene, which symbolizes the kindness and good luck,
happened in the house of Awang Cering, a farmer living in Langzong
village of Tibet Autonomous Region, on the eve of Tibetan new year
which falls on today. People were gathering at Awang's house in
celebration of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Gyaisang is now the owner of a flour and fodder processing
plant set up with bank loans. The plant has already made 19,000
yuan (nearly 2,300 U.S. dollars) in profit for him.
</P>
<P>
With the money earned, Gyaisang has helped four households
shake off poverty after he himself became rich. The wisp of fleece
in the dough drop soup is a symbol of kindness in Tibetan
tradition. Awang and his neighbors believed that Gyaisang deserved
the fleece.
</P>
<P>
About 122,000 people in Tibet escaped the poverty last
year. Farmers and herdsmen celebrated Tibetan New Year Day by
firing crackers and waving goodbye to poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Out, out," shouted Awang with a sheaf of burning straws in
hand. He was trying to drive ghosts and monsters away from his
house.
</P>
<P>
"Go away, Poverty; go away, starvation; go away, illness,"
Awang kept shouting.
</P>
<P>
"And go away drunkards," added Awang's children.
</P>
<P>
Awang used to be indulged in drinking. "Aid-the-poor" project
launched by the local government helped Awang get rid of the bad
habit. Awang became hard working and the life of his family has
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
The children's words brought a shy smile onto Awang's face.

<HEADLINE> British Prince to Visit Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prince of Wales
Charles will pay an official visit to Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar
this month to help promote traditional relations, official Kuwait
News Agency (KUNA) reported from London today.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat at the British Embassy in Kuwait, who declined to
be named, confirmed that the first leg of Charles' tour
will be Kuwait, but he did not reveal the exact timetable of the
trip.
</P>
<P>
The visit was arranged at the request of the British
government, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Britain reportedly considers it beneficial to have the tour
of Prince Charles arranged because of the strategic and economic
importance of the three Arab Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Charles' visit is aimed mainly at promoting bilateral friendly
relations and trade ties between Britain and the Gulf countries
while the prince of Wales will renew his close and strong
personal friendship with the ruling families in the Gulf region,
the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Kuwait, Prince Charles will be received by
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and Prime
Minister Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah,
according to the British diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to open a seminar on "Economic
Liberalization" on board the British Queen Elizabeth's Royal
Yacht Britannia, which will be attended by a number of leading
Kuwaiti businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Britain was one of the main allies in the U.S.-led military
strike in 1991 to drive the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait to end its
seven-month occupation of the oil-rich emirate.
</P>
<P>
Ties between both countries are traditional and unique and
Britain has repeatedly pledged to be committed to the
independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Britain have maintained strong economic and
military relations. Most of the Kuwaiti military equipment for
ground forces are supplied by Britain under a joint defense
cooperation agreement signed following the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Qatar and Bahrain, Prince Charles will meet
with leaders of the two states.

LUSAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight refugees who arrived from
Zaire and Burundi have been detained for possession of seven AK47
rifles and ammunition at Mpulungu, a harbor of Zambia at Lake
Tanganyika, according to a news dispatch reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mpulungu Constituency Chairman Rebertson
Nthala as saying that the refugees are suspected to have more
arms as they were seen tossing some of them when they saw
immigration and police officers approaching the ship after it had
docked.
</P>
<P>
The refugees resisted violently when the Red Cross and police
personnel tried to ferry them to Mbala Prison where other
refugees who arrived there earlier are being kept.
</P>
<P>
Nthala said that the local people, particularly fishermen, are
now living in fear as they are being threatened by the refugees
who are said to be violent.
</P>
<P>
The situation may soon prove disastrous if the refugees are
left at the harbor as they are armed and can sneak into the
surrounding compounds.

<HEADLINE> Four Shi'ite Moslems Killed in North Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- At least four Shi'ite Moslem
fundamentalists were shot dead by the police in north Nigeria on
Friday, when Moslems across the country were holding a special
prayer to celebrate the end of their fasting month Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports today, the skirmish ensued when
members of the sect attempted to prevent the observance of this
year's Eld-el-Fitri prayer at the Kofar Mate Eid praying ground
in Kano state.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group who came in their hundreds stationed
themselves at the entrance to the praying ground and were making
provocative statements, accusing religious and traditional
leaders in the country of misguiding Moslems and distorting the
concept of the religion.
</P>
<P>
The police, drafting to the area to ensure a hitch-free
prayer, advised the Shi'ites to either join in the prayer or
leave the scene to avoid disturbing the peace.
</P>
<P>
The Shi'ites then shifted their attention to the police,
describing them as agents of coercion and infidelity, and started
throwing stones and pieces of broken bottles at the police.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the police opened fire on the Shi'ites, which
resulted in the death of at least four fundamentalists, with many
injured.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports saying that the crisis was triggered
off by the hoisting of the fundamentalists' flag at the scene
which other Moslem brothers protested against.
</P>
<P>
The State Commissioner of Police Alhaji Lawal Mashi has
confirmed the incident and disclosed that several arrests have
been made.
</P>
<P>
Islam is one of the major religions in Nigeria and most of the
Moslems live in the north of the country.

<HEADLINE> Western Donors Withhold Contributions to UNEP (by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Major western donors last
night withheld their contributions to the U.N. Environmental
Program (UNEP) as the 19th session of its Governing Council
failed to adopt structure reform resolution.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement issued at the UNEP
headquarters, British Environment Minister John Gummer announced
that he would withhold the pledged 7 million U.S. Dollars for the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
He said that "until this organization (UNEP) reforms itself
and not left to be reformed by others, the United Kingdom will
withhold its contributions to it."
</P>
<P>
The U.K. position was supported by the United States'
representative Evelyn Wheeler who said that her country will also
withhold its contributions to the UNEP until the issue of
governance is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Wheeler told reporters that the decision by major donors
including Spain to withhold contributions has left UNEP broken
and with no money to continue its programs.
</P>
<P>
The new developments at the 19th session of the UNEP Governing
Council prompted the U.N. agency to suspend proceedings of
deliberation to a future date and venue to be decided by the
Governing Council in a move proposed by Mexico to save the UNEP
from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Following the withholding action by major donors, UNEP
Executive Director Elizabeth Dowsdwell said that she remains
optimistic that the only unresolved issue on governance will be
resolved very soon.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the suspended 19th session will take place very
soon probably in Nairobi, adding that top UNEP managers and the
member states will continue consultations.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the proceedings of the two-week 19th session, few
western countries led by the United States and United Kingdom
pushed for an establishment of a committee as an inter-session
body and another ad hoc committee to guide UNEP's administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Group of 77 and China objected to the set-up of
the committees, saying that the creation of the committees would
confuse the organization further and expressed their support for
the strengthening of UNEP's Committee for Permanent
Representatives which will be given a broad mandate to manage the
agency's program.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar is considering
appealing for international assistance to ease food shortage
caused by prolonged drought, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Natural Resources Adam
Mwakanjuki said in the town of Zanzibar on Friday that people are
reported to be surviving on mangoes in the worst hit parts of
both Unguja and Pemba.
</P>
<P>
"We may have to appeal for external aid to ease the shortage
of food," he said, adding that his ministry is assessing the
impact of the drought to determine the amount of food required.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that sweet potato, cassava and
banana farms are reported to have been left with stunted or
withered crops because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
The food shortage forced prices up, especially during the
Month of Ramadhan.
</P>
<P>
The government was last year forced to appeal for
international support to feed 50,000 people affected by drought
in Pemba.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the minister urged businessmen to continue
importing maize and maize flour from the mainland of Tanzania and
elsewhere.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- India has expressed its desire
to invest in agriculture and tourism in Luapula, a remote
province of Zambia, according to a news dispatch received here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian intention was made by its high commissioner to
Zambia Rinzing Wangdi when he paid a courtesy call on the
province's minister Norman Chibamba on Friday in the provincial
capital town Mansa.
</P>
<P>
Wangdi said that his government is willing to initiate
investment projects in agriculture and tourism because the
potential for Zambia's development lay in these areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that your province is blessed with abundant
water and land. We have identified two broad areas where we would
like to invest," the Indian high commissioner said, adding that
investment in agriculture and tourism will begin soon in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Minister Chibamba said that despite the fact that
the province is endowed with abundant water and land, the
government is handicapped to do anything because of financial
constraints and lack of skilled manpower in the area.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to India to assist people in the area with clean
water through the sinking of boreholes because they have for a
long time been drinking unclean water collected from nearby
streams and rivers.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Israeli Occupation in Lebanon Follows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua)-- Barely had dust of the
helicopters collision tragedy settled down, a debate on value of
the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon began to emerge among
Israeli leaders on television Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said on an Israel Television
Hebrew program that Israel's goal in the "security zone" of south
Lebanon was to prevent what he termed as pro-Iranian Hezbollah
extremists from reaching the Galilee area in north Israel.
</P>
<P>
"If I thought there was a high probability doing so I would
willingly withdraw the Israeli forces from the security zone," he
argued.
</P>
<P>
Israel has set up a self-styled "security zone" in south
Lebanon to curb cross-border guerrilla attacks against the north
of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 Israeli soldiers and airmen were killed Tuesday
night when two Yasur 2000 helicopters collided in northern Israel
while transporting forces to the buffer strip in south
Lebanon, making it the worst air disaster in the Israeli air
force history.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a question of any implications of the helicopter
disaster, Netanyahu said that it will not influence him when he
comes to make future military decisions.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that he does not need any constraints against
launching any sort of military adventure, but needs any catalyst
for peace. He said he is convinced that it is possible to achieve
peace with Syria though it is not be easy.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, an advocator of
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon, said he does not
regret by saying that soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
were sitting ducks in south Lebanon. He said that Israel must
adopt different minds of thinking and there is no doubt that
Lebanon has been turned into a trap for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, who is also a former army general, said that the
question is whether stationing Israeli troops in fixed positions
is militarily correct.
</P>
<P>
The IDF Chief of General Staff, Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
said that it was impossible to compare Lebanon with Vietnam
because, after the U.S. troop withdrawal, none of its cities was
under threat of attack.
</P>
<P>
Shahak said that Israel's presence in south Lebanon is
vital and any unilateral withdrawal will place northern Israeli
civilians in danger.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no better idea to protect Israeli towns
and villages in the north.

launched the phase two of the Strengthening Primary Education
(SPRED) project in a bid to increase enrollment rate in primary
schools.
</P>
<P>
The Project was jointly developed by the Kenyan and British
governments, and the Overseas Development Authority (ODA) of
Britain is scheduled to provide about 30 million U.S. Dollars to
support the project.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony held on Friday, Kenyan Education
Minister Joseph Kamotho said that the enrollment rate in primary
schools standing at 95 percent in 1989 declined to about 87
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the decline to ineffective teaching
methods, wide-spread poverty and poor management of schools.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, British Minister for Overseas
Development Lynda Chalker noted that the situation in Kenya's
education sector is so critical that only 35 percent of the
current seven million school-age children can expect to complete
primary education.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that "this is a tragic waste of the tremendous
potential which every girl and boy has within them."
</P>
<P>
The project is one of the largest projects ever undertaken by
the ODA in the primary education sub-sector throughout the world,
the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
During the phase one already completed, the ODA provided more
than seven million Dollars to buy textbooks and science equipment
for primary schools in arid and semi-arid areas.
</P>
<P>
The phase two is aimed at improving the quality of primary
education including the training of primary school head teachers
throughout the east African country.
</P>
<P>
According to Kamotho, the training program has already begun
and about 800 head masters are undergoing management training
courses in various teacher-training colleges.

<P>
PYONGYANG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today accused the United States of
interfering with Cuba's internal affairs and trying to instigate
subversion of the country's state system.
</P>
<P>
The action came after the recent issue of an article in the
U.S., which said that the U.S. supported Cuba changing direction
from the socialist road to a democratic one.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in the DPRK's official newspaper, the Rodong
Sinmun, said that the U.S. article was a gross violation of the
U.N. Charter and international practice.
</P>
<P>
That was "a flagrant manifestation of the arbitrary thinking
mode of some U.S. politicians," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It added that every sovereign state has the right to choose its
own political conviction and state system and no encroachment on
the right was allowed.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also pointed out that stopping powers
interfering in other countries' internal affairs was crucial for
helping realize democracy in the international community.

<HEADLINE> Qinhuangdao Becomes China's Largest Coal Export Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- North China's coastal city
of Qinhuangdao has built up China's largest coal export port.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the volume of freight handled in the
Qinhuangdao Port last year reached 83 million tons, including 65
million tons of coal and 11 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1996, the first-stage project of the coal
wharf, completed 13 years ago, transported 420 million tons of
coal, accounting for 70 percent of China's total volume of coal
transported by sea for export.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in coal resources, but they are unevenly
distributed, with the economically developed southeast regions
short of coal.
</P>
<P>
To transport more coal from the producing bases in the north to
the south, China has invested a total of 1.4 billion yuan (175
million US dollars) in the construction of two modern coal wharves
in Qinhuangdao Port.
</P>
<P>
According to the port administration, after the completion of
a new coal wharf in July this year, the volume of freight to be
handled in Qinhuangdao Port is expected to exceed 100 million
tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The oilfields in South China
Sea yielded almost 1.2 million tons of crude oil in the first
month of 1997, keeping a daily output of nearly 40,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the company in charge of the South China
Sea oilfields set a record of over 11.84 million tons of crude oil
last year, doubling that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea Eastern Company, one of the regional
companies of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC),
has discovered geological crude oil reserves of 500 million tons
since it was founded in 1983. China has so far proven geological
offshore oil reserves of 1.3 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Nine oilfields were proved to be commercially worthy
exploitation. Eight of them have been put into operation with the
only one still under construction.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Company has forged cooperative relations with 38
foreign counterparts from 11 countries and regions, including the
United States, Britain and Italy. It has signed 43 contracts with
foreign companies in recovering oil.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC source said that China's offshore oil industry has
greatly benefited from large-scale Sino-foreign cooperation. China
has signed 126 oil contracts with 65 oil companies from 18
countries and regions, absorbing direct foreign investment of
nearly six billion US dollars, which accounted for 60 percent of
the country's total investment in the offshore oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology was applied in developing oilfields. Liuhua
11-1 oilfield which went into operation in March last year adopted
seven techniques that were used for the first time in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Company planned to tap oil potential this year and
tried to increase reserves.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the CNOOC said that CNOOC has entered
the best development period since it was established in 1982. All
of its 19 operational offshore oil fields have had rich outputs.
</P>
<P>
China's crude oil output was estimated to hit between 165-167
million tons this year, an increase of 4.2 to 4.5 percent over the
1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
Last year China pumped 156.45 million tons of crude oil, eight
million tons more than in the previous year. About one tenth of
the product came from offshore oilfields.

<HEADLINE> b d c 3059 C-China-Beijing-Centenarians Centenarians in Beijing Celebrates Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua --Qi Xin, now at 108 years old, has
her three-room apartment full early in the morning of the first
day of Spring Festival or Chinese Lunar New Year, which lasts
from February 7 to 9.
</P>
<P>
All comers are her children, grand children and great grand
children.
</P>
<P>
"We are only a small group of our four-generation family," said
Yang Xuezhong, the second son of Qi Xin's seven children.
</P>
<P>
Qi, sitting beside a dinner table, was busy giving money to her
grand children and great grand children as a Lunar New Year gift.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth year of Ox for Qi since she was born in
1888. Chinese ancestors selected 12 symbolic animals to mark a
12-year circle, often used to denote the year of a person's birth.
</P>
<P>
The centenarian moved to Beijing from neighboring Hebei
province in the 1950s. She is a vegetarian and never smokes or drinks
wine.
</P>
<P>
Amid greetings from children, grand children and great grand
children, Qi beamed with joy to welcome another new year of Ox.
</P>
<P>
To 102-year-old Wang Zhongran, New Year calls from his
offsprings on the mainland and a phone call from one of his
grandsons living in Taiwan were enough to cheer him up for a cup
of wine.
</P>
<P>
Wang received visitors amid sounds of cracklings. Once the door
was open, electric firecrackers hanging above the door started to
make sounds to the delight of the centenarian.
</P>
<P>
"Dad is very much fond of hearing sounds of firecrackers,"
explained Wang Jun, the third daughter of Wang.
</P>
<P>
Big red lanterns were hanging in Wang's house. Several pieces
of Chinese calligraph on the wall were inscribed with the Chinese
character of "Longevity," showing the wish of Wang's children.
</P>
<P>
Wang, wearing a new cotton-padded clothes of traditional
Chinese style, was sitting in an armchair and greeted by his
children and children's children.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guizhen, 106, is different from Qi and Wang. She lives in a
home for the aged after her husband Wu Tunan died at the age of
105 several years ago. Wu was a well-known archaeologist in China
who also created a set of Chinese boxing, or Taijiquan in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Liu, however, is not lonely. Staff workers came to make
dumplings for her to celebrate the Spring Festival following the
tradition. A group of young students from Beijing Police School
joined the Granny again for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairwoman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, greeted Liu, saying that Liu looks much
younger than before.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a former staff of the Beijing Research Institute of
Culture and History, is still quick-minded. The news program on TV
is one of the programs she has never missed. Liu loves smoking
tobacco. Workers at the home for the aged will always buy her some
tobacco when they return from trips on business.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has more than 80 centenarians by the end of
1996. Another 89,00 people are at the age of 90 or above, and over
90,000 people are above the age of 80.

According to him, about 40,000 people die a premature death

"Without participation from all sides -- the people, the
government and various agencies, the complex problem of air
pollution is not going to be solved," Chawla said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force today
suspended military flight operations in the training areas off the
East Coast after two incidents in the last three days in which
F-16 fighters brushed past civilian planes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration asked its
controllers at Jacksonville, Washington and New York air traffic
control centers, and military controllers at the Virginia Capes
station to review procedures for handling traffic in busy flying
areas.
</P>
<P>
An American Eagle pilot reported that four national guard F-16
jets flew "too close" to his passenger plane off the coast of
Maryland this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
FAA officials confirmed that the American Eagle commercial
plane, flying from Raleigh, North Carolina, to John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York, reported that the military jets
came too close.
</P>
<P>
But the commander of the U.S. Air National Guard said there was
no imminent collision and that the four fighters from the District
of Columbia Air National Guard did not come dangerously close to
the twin-engine plane.

<HEADLINE> Electricity, Coal Prices to Soar in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The prices of electricity and
coal will rise by 350 percent in Bulgaria after February 15, the
Energy Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Minister of Energy, Rumen Ovcharov, told a press
conference the reason for the increase was that international
financial institutions, in recent years, had persistently asked
Bulgaria to raise its electricity price from the equivalent of one
U.S. cent per kilowatt, at present, to 3.5 cents per kilowatt.
</P>
<P>
He said that even after the increase, it would remain 10 levs
(0.58 cents) below the standard.
</P>
<P>
The governmental news center said the price raise was
originally scheduled to start on February 1. This was postponed
because the 100 percent general rise of pay and 50 percent rise in
pensions, promised in the 1997 budget, had yet to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Reports said residents in the country complained a lot about
the high energy prices, which had already increased 400 percent
after rising three times last year.
</P>
<P>
Though the government granted electricity subsidies to
impoverished families, the constant rises of energy prices still
worried many households.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian Minister Blames Rao for Babri Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian home minister
S.B. Chavan has revealed that he could not save the Babri mosque
because the then prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao did not allow
him to dismiss the Kalyan Singh government in Uttar Pradesh even
four days before the Babri mosque demolition.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview to a private television channel, Chavan,
one time close associate of Rao, made one more revelation that all
important and sensitive documents relating to former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991 were not shown to
him by the Intelligence Bureau and those were being directly sent
to Rao.
</P>
<P>
The documents included a sensitive message in Tamil intercepted
by Indian authorities 15 days before the assassination.
</P>
<P>
"This message was not given to the Jain Commission (in charge
of investigating the assassination case) because it was never
shown to the Intelligence Bureau and it had been directly given to
the then prime minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation was such at that point of time that I was not
the ultimate decision-making authority," he further said.
</P>
<P>
The former home minister was at one time the focus of the
opposition's attack for the government's failure to protect the
Babri mosque in Uttar Pradesh, which was demolished by Hindu
militants on December 6, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Babri incident caused nation-wide violence, killing several
thousand of people.
</P>
<P>
Chavan's remarks are a major blow to Rao, who had always
defended the government's inability to protect the mosque.

<HEADLINE> India Raises Investment Limits for Small-scale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of India has
effected a five-fold increase in investment limits in all
categories of the small-scale industries (SSIS) in the country in
a bid to strengthen and sharpen the competitive edge of the SSIS.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, which met here on
Friday, decided to enhance the investment limits.
</P>
<P>
There was a need to raise investment limits in order to offset
the erosion in the value of rupee on account of domestic inflation
and due to increase in the international price goods, said
Industry Minister M. Maran.
</P>
<P>
The government has also reduced by 25 percent the export
obligation in case of manufacture of reserved items by big
companies.
</P>
<P>
The big companies' units have to export 75 percent of their
total production if they manufacture items reserved by the
government for the small-scale industries.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the reduction in the export obligation for big
investment in the SSIS sector, the industry minister said that the
government had already reduced it in 1995 for agro-based
industries.
</P>
<P>
There was a need to reduce the same for other segments as well
so that they could also access to the domestic market.

WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis captured his
second WBC heavyweight title after stopping Oliver McCall in the
fifth round at Las Vegas on Friday.
</P>
<P>
McCall refused to fight in the fourth and fifth rounds,
throwing only 75 punches in the fight, and two in the fourth and
one jab in the fifth, before referee Mills Lane stopped the fight
in the fifth.

Lewis lost the title when he was stopped in the second round by
McCall at Wembley, England on Sept. 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
McCall then lost the title to Frank Bruno, who lost it to Mike
Tyson. It became vacant when Tyson relinquished it.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old McCall has been in and out of drug
rehabilitation for the past 18 months and he was accompanied to
Las Vegas by a drug counselor.
</P>
<P>
After the fight ended, McCall stormed out of the ring and
walked to his dressing room without saying a word to anyone.
</P>
<P>
Lewis lifted his record to 30-1 with 24 knockouts. McCall is

<HEADLINE> Bonded Labor System in Nepal Urged to Be Eradicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMADNU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior democratic leader in
Nepal has called on all political parties in the country to
initiate a campaign to eradicate the notorious system of bonded
labor with a national consensus.
</P>
<P>
Ganesh Man Singh, leader of the 1990 Popular Movement in Nepal
which led to an end of the partyless legislature of Panchayat,
said Friday that any drives meant for the freedom of bonded
laborers should be undertaken by rising above from the narrow
confines of politics.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Backward Society Education project
(BASE) in west Nepal's Dang district, Singh regretted that the
system of Kamaiya, or bonded labor, still exists in Nepal even
many years after democracy was introduced in the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, being attended by some 20,000 people, will
conclude today before holding a series of discussions and seminars
on the themes of women political participation, youths and
development and the problems of bonded laborers.
</P>
<P>
The BASE is a non-governmental social organization based in the
Dang district, nearly 300 km southwest of Kathmandu, with a
membership of about 150,000.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Agrees on Chechnya Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Duma (lower house of
parliament) today passed in principle a draft resolution on
amnesty for war criminals involved in the 21-month Chechnya war,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move was passed by 263 votes to 27 against, with seven
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty would cover Russian citizens who broke the law
between December 9, 1994 and September 1, 1996 when the war was
officially ended, in the border regions of Chechnya, Ingushetia,
Dagestan and Stavropol.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty does not cover criminals who took part in the mass
hostage-taking raids on Budennovsk in June 1995 and Pervomaiskaya
in Dagestan in January, 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also excludes criminals unconnected with Chechnya war, very
dangerous repeat offenders and foreign mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
The Duma has asked its security committee to amend the amnesty
document which, in seven to 10 days, will be put to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, amnesty decisions are made
finally by the Duma and need not to be approved by the president
or the upper house of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Deregulation of Oil Industry Starts in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Full deregulation of the
Philippine oil industry started today, ending more than two
decades of state control and launching what Manila promised as a
regime of lower fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Friday, President Fidel Ramos said
that the government is standing firm on its decision to deregulate
the oil industry despite an opposing petition in the Supreme Court
and brewing protests in several sectors.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has ordered authorities to exert maximum tolerance in the
face of the opposition, stressing that the public should be
allowed to move and commerce should not be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
Under full deregulation, oil companies are free to adjust
prices at any time. During the partial deregulation, the
government's Energy Regulatory Board adjusted prices monthly based
on price movements in Singapore Posted Prices.
</P>
<P>
Local oil companies released almost similar prices listings
that took effect early this morning.
</P>
<P>
While prices of petroleum products remained stable, housewives
and restaurants are expected to be hit the worst by the hefty
increases in the prices of premium gasoline and liquefied
petroleum gas.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta to Expand Incentives to Boost Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will expand its
export tax incentives to cover more products and companies in a
bid to boost non-oil exports, a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo said here Friday
after meeting President Soeharto that the facilities currently
provided to exports of textiles and textile-related products,
shoes, electronics, wood and rattan products and leather goods had
helped bolster their exports.
</P>
<P>
The government currently gives special tax and customs reliefs
and loan facilities to exporters of those five categories of
products.
</P>
<P>
Tunky said his office had listed 334 exporters which were
eligible for the facilities, including the Central Bank's
rediscount facilities. Most of the listed companies are textile
exporters, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The government not only gives the certificates to producer
exporters, but also to trader exporters," Tunky said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's non-oil exports grew from 27.1 billion US dollars
in 1993 to 34.9 billion dollars in 1995 while its non-oil imports
rose from 26.2 billion dollars in 1993 to 37.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months of last year, Indonesia's total
exports increased by 10.4 percent to 40.6 billion dollars,
consisting of 9.3 billion dollars oil and gas exports and 31.2
billion dollars non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total imports increased by 5.1 percent to 31.9
billion dollars, comprising 2.4 billion dollars oil and gas
imports and 29.4 billion dollars for non-oil imports.
</P>
<P>
Tunky said earlier exports of electronics, wood and rattan
products performed well last year, for instance, textile exports,
which fluctuated in the previous years, increased by 10.5 percent
last year to 6.85 billion dollars from 6.2 billion dollars in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Falling Baht Spurs Hope for Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency baht fell to
its lowest level against the US dollar on Friday since January
1987, raising hopes that Thailand's exports could improve.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded at as high as 26.13 per dollar, although
the exchange equalization fund of the central bank of Thailand set
the mid-rate to the dollar at 25.92 baht, up by two satang from
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand on Friday moved to ease the tight money
market by lowering its bond repurchase interest rate.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the interbank rate, which reflects liquidity
in the money market, rose to 25 percent in the morning, as
compared with an average interbank rate of 22 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank lowered the interest rate on one-day-maturity
bonds traded on the repurchase market from 16 percent to 13
percent and that on bonds carrying a seven-day maturity period
from 16 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although central bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond has said
the central bank will not let the money market remain tight for
long, some bankers predict that interest rates are unlikely to
fall at least for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The baht's value is determined by a basket of currencies said
to reflect Thailand's foreign trade. The central bank has never
released the composition of the formula, and thus has some
flexibility to adjust the basket, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the basket was about 80 percent comprised by
the US dollar, 12 percent by the Japanese yen and 8 percent by the
German mark.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the baht against the surging us dollar, is
believed to be helpful for Thai exports, as the high exchange rate
make Thai goods cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's exports fell by 0.1 percent to 1,380
billion baht (55.2 billion dollars), compared with the 1995 level.
The 1996 export performance was the poorest in a decade.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Rule as Clashes Erupt in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, Ecuador, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency was
declared in Ecuador on Friday as police and protesters clashed in
the country's capital a day after Congress voted to oust President
Abdala Bucaram for "mental incompetence."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read on national television, Defense Minister
Victor Manuel Bayas announced a decree signed by Bucaram to
declare the state of emergency, which suspends the right to stage
public demonstrations and other constitutional guarantees for
individuals.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is necessary to declare a state of national
emergency to preserve the country's peace," Bayas said.
</P>
<P>
General Bayas also warned that the country must not continue
waiting for a dialogue between the parties involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Bayas's statement came shortly after hundreds of riot police
fired tear gas into a crowd of about 4,000 demonstrators in
Quito's city center to prevent them getting close to the
presidential palace, where Bucaram has been holed up for three
days.
</P>
<P>
Early on Friday, Congress President Fabian Alarcon, who was
named "acting president" by the congress after it voted to oust
Bucaram Thursday night, urged military leaders to join civilians
in a march through the capital and in demanding that Bucaram step
down.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Alarcon declared a state of emergency for the
Congress, saying he had received calls from the presidency warning
that there were plans to dissolve the National Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said he had received a call early Friday morning from the
presidency threatening to arrest him on a charge of conspiring
against the government.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon immediately called all heads of the legislative groups
to an urgent session to discuss the threat against the Congress.
</P>
<P>
No deputies of the government group attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The deputies who did agreed to reject Bucaram's decree on
Thursday to mobilize the armed forces for support.
</P>
<P>
So far, the armed forces of Ecuador have remained neutral over
the worst political crisis in the country, which now sees three
claiming to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
While Bucaram reiterated his earlier pledges to defy the
Congress vote to remove him from office, Vice President Rosalia
Artenga issued a statement asserting that she was the legitimate
successor to Bucaram.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at a pre-dawn news conference on Friday,
the military urged a speedy end to the political crisis and said
it was prepared to mediate in the crisis.

that Ecuador would overcome its current political crisis in a
democratic and peaceful way, respecting the constitution and the
laws, Chile's Acting Foreign Relations Minister Mariano Fernandez
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the role of the Organization of American States
(OAS), the Chilean minister said it had no right to intervene as
long as there were no violations of the democratic order in
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
"The OAS council decided not to issue any statement, but
resolved to observe the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Ecuadoran Congress dismissed President Abdala
Bucaram on the grounds of "mental incompetence" and appointed its
leader, Fabian Alarcon, as interim president.
</P>
<P>
However, President Bucaram defied the decision, vowing to stay
in office until his term was completed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice-President Rosalia Arteaga also claimed the
presidency, saying this was laid down in the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Supports Ecuadoran Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem today expressed concern for the political crisis in Ecuador,
and said he supported his Ecuadoran counterpart, Abdala Bucaram,
ousted by Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Menem was following with concern the development of
the Ecuadoran situation and was confident the country would solve
its problems, the Ministry of Foreign Relations said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "President Menem declares his firm support
for the constitutionally elected president of Ecuador, Abdala
Bucaram, and has complete confidence in the prompt solution to the
challenges being faced by that country, with which Argentina has
links of fraternal friendship."
</P>
<P>
Bucaram was dismissed by Congress on the grounds of "mental
incompetence" following a two-day general strike. The strike was
in protest against a tough austerity plan, including an increase
of 300 percent in public fares, introduced by Bucaram.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Ecuador has worsened since the president's
ousting. A state of emergency was declared on Friday as
protesters outside the presidential palace came into conflict with
police guarding the building.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram has defied his dismissal, saying he intended to serve a
full term in office.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The hostage standoff in
Philadelphia ended this afternoon after police took into custody
at least two men who held dozens of people hostage inside a check
cashing agency in the city's northeast district after a failed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
The police rushed to the Financial Exchange Co. of Pa. building
about noon and held negotiations with the hostage takers for
several hours before more than 100 hostages were released one by
one, according to local TV reports from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were then taken by bus to a neighborhood police
station for debriefing before being reunited with their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects were taken into custody and no money was taken,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Zappille said the hostage
taking was the culmination of a chain of events that started
Thursday night, when a group of men broke into the home of a
manager of the check cashing store.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen held the woman overnight, and accompanied her to the
store this morning, where they planned to hold up a Brink's
truck scheduled to arrive in front of the store at 9 a.m. (1400
GMT).
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 a.m., police got a report of a robbery at the
Financial Exchange, located in a business district in northeastern
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Police cordoned streets and special police officers aimed
rifles at the first-floor store during the negotiations and the
hostage takers released the hostages.
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m., the building had been emptied.

UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today condemned the attacks on and kidnapping of
international personnel and demanded the immediate release of all
those taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest U.N. information, as a result of the
extensive efforts, an armed group released in the morning two
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross it
held hostage since February 5.
</P>
<P>
But 10 other international personnel from the U.N. Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan and the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees are still being held by the armed group.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council stressed the
"inadmissibility" of kidnapping and any other mistreatment of
United Nations personnel and supported the efforts of the
secretary-general to ensure that the essential security
requirements of the U.N. Mission of Observers in Tajikistan are
met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council welcomed the signing in
Moscow on 23 December 1996 by the President of Tajikistan and the
leader of the United Tajik Opposition of the Protocol on
National Reconciliation and the Protocol on Refugees.
</P>
<P>
It believed that these agreements, provided they are carried
out as written, represent a qualitative change for the better
and give a new impetus to efforts aimed at achieving national
reconciliation.
</P>

The council said that it was necessary for the United
Nations to continue vigorous support for the political process
in Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> US Panel Rules Black-Majority District Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. panel of federal
judges today declared the district, which elected Virginia's first
black member of Congress since Reconstruction, unconstitutional
because it was drawn too heavily along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
Unless the ruling is overturned on appeal, Democratic Rep.
Robert C. Scott will have to run in a redrawn district in 1998.
Scott was elected from the 3rd District with 79 percent of the
vote in 1992. He remains the only black among Virginia's 11 House
members.
</P>
<P>
The panel of three judges said Virginia, in drawing the
majority-black district in 1991, "subordinated traditional
districting principles, such as compactness, communities of
interest, and respect for cities and counties, to accomplish its
goal of a safe black district."

It called upon all the states in the region to refrain from
any act, including cross-border incursions, which would threaten

<HEADLINE> Environmental Ministers' Meeting Adjourns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The top level plenary meeting
of the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP), which had been
scheduled to end today, adjourned tonight at a deadlock over
power structural reforms in the sole U.N. body of this kind.
</P>
<P>
The two-week 19th session of the UNEP Governing Council, which
opened on January 27, has so far passed neither agreement on the
issue nor any resolutions concerned, UNEP sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, resolutions on other topics of the session have been
approved by the environmental ministers and heads of delegations
from over 100 countries, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows when the meeting will be reopened.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the session adopted the Nairobi Declaration on
the Role and Mandate of UNEP, which called for an enhanced UNEP
role and took note of the need to reform the UNEP governance
system.
</P>
<P>
The declaration urged the Special Session of the U.N. General
Assembly scheduled for June to boost the role of UNEP as "the
leading global environmental authority" and expressed deep
concern about the continuous degradation of global environment.
</P>
<P>
UNEP has been apparently weakened during recent years
following a sharp cut of contributions by its western donors,
which has resulted in the most serious financial crisis in its 25
years of existence.
</P>
<P>
At the session, some of the developed countries charged that
UNEP is wasteful, inefficient and outdated, and sought to set up
a small intersessional body to rule UNEP during the adjournment
of the biennial UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many developing countries suggested forming a
relatively big-sized intersessional body or broadening the power
of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, an international
subsidiary body of the UNEP Governing Council.

NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose to record
levels today, as interest rates sank in the bond market amid news
that wage inflation was almost negligible last month.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 82.74 points to
6,855.80. The barometer of 30 big U.S. companies is now less than

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on
the NYSE, with its volume reaching 538.61 million shares, higher
than 519.39 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also bounced back from an afternoon stumble
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list and the New York Stock
Exchange composite index marching to new highs. The Nasdaq market
also posted strong gains, with bellwether technology shares
starting to rebound from a two-day wave of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 rose 9.41 to 789.56, and the NYSE composite index

<HEADLINE> IRA End Hopes of New Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republic Army (IRA)
today dashed any hopes of a new cease-fire before the next general
election, which must be called by May.
</P>
<P>
February 8 is the first anniversary of the IRA's devastating
attack on London's South Quay signaling an end of their 17-month
truce.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the IRA's leadership told correspondents from
BBC and Ireland's RTE network that a new truce was "most
unlikely." "Our cessation of violence is off," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the remarks, Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick
Mayhew told BBC, "It implies that after the election it may be
kind enough to announce another cease-fire. But by those works,
they surely show themselves to be the blackmailers they are."
</P>
<P>
"In a democracy that will never wash and will never be allowed
to wash," Mayhew added.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has claimed time and again that a resolution of the
27-year Northern Ireland conflict required talks which included
its political wing, Sinn Fein, without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Britain says it will not permit the IRA to bomb its way into
peace talks and insists the IRA must call a genuine cessation of
violence before Sinn Fein is allowed to the peace talks table.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic and Labor Party leader John Hume, a leading
nationalist go-between, made an impassioned plea to the IRA to
abandon violence and put trust in peace talks today at a public
gathering in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"My appeal to you now is -- have faith in all of us. Lay down
your weapons and let the British and Irish governments and the
representatives of the Irish people come together to bring about
agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Chernomyrdin, Optimistic on US-Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today said that he was very optimistic about his summit meeting
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin scheduled in Helsinki,
Finland, on March 20-21.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a photo opportunity at the White
House before talking with visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Clinton said, "I'm looking forward to it."
</P>
<P>
"What I think that the summit in Helsinki can do is to make it
clear that no one has any intention of providing any increased
threat to the security of Russia," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite optimistic about it because of the good
relationship I've always had with President Yeltsin and because of
the work that the prime minister and the vice president have
done," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sitting beside Clinton in the oval office, Chernomyrdin said,
"It is extremely important for the meeting between the presidents
of the U.S. and Russia, and it will be one of the critical stages
in terms of the developments in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming summit and questions which we will discuss have a
wide range and decisions will be extremely important for the
relationship between our two countries and for the European
security as well as for the arms control, for economic questions,"
Chernomyrdin added.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference earlier today, U.S. Vice President
Al Gore and Chernomyrdin announced the venue and the date for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"We expect, among other things, that the presidents will
address bilateral arms control, European security and a number of
economic issues of importance to our peoples," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Russian summit had been scheduled to take place in
Washington but the two sides agreed to change the venue because of
Yeltsin's health conditions.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the summit will be the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into the central
European countries, and the issue of the START II treaty, which
has not been ratified by neither of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Washington firmly insisted that NATO's expansion will start by
1999 and the issue will be focused at a NATO special summit in
July in Madrid despite strong opposition from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed leaders of the four major NATO powers,
France, the U.S., Britain and Germany, and Russia should hold a
separate summit in April to discuss NATO's relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Moscow demands that NATO allies sign a binding treaty with
Russia on their relations to ensure that NATO be changed into a
political organization from a military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Asked if such a treaty would be signed with Russia, Clinton
said, "I believe that we ought to work out an agreement between
NATO and Russia involving the United States, which ensures that
Russia will have a leading role in European security affairs."
</P>
<P>
"We want a meaningful agreement that is signed in public and
that is -- that the parties feel bound to, but that actually means
something," he added.
</P>
<P>
About the French proposal for a summit of five major powers,
Clinton said he has to meet with Yeltsin first.
</P>
<P>
He said, "First of all, I want to have my meeting with
President Yeltsin. I think that's the most important thing. We
have to meet first."
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen him in several months and I'm anxious to see
him," Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> Conversion to Euro to Be Smooth: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The implementation costs of
converting to the euro, the single European currency, for banks
and financial institutions are negligible, according to a survey
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 900 banks surveyed by the International Securities
Market Association, the trade body of the securities industry,
were confident that conversion to the euro, the European currency
expected to be introduced in January 1999, could occur smoothly at
the relatively short notice of two to six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial institutions on average were spending
0.058 percent of total operating costs to convert to the euro,
instead of the 2 percent costs which were suggested by a European
Banking Federation study in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fact that most financial institutions are already equipped
with information technology allowing them to operate in a
multi-currency environment party explains the low cost of
conversion, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, introducing the euro is as simple as importing
a new currency into the system," said Professor Hannah Scobie, the
report's author.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Rally to New Record Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all surged sharply and ended in record high territories today,
boosted by a strong Wall Street and benign U.S. economic data.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London closed the week at another record
high, with the FTSE 100 index 41.9 points up at 4,307.8, breaching
the 4,300 level for the first time ever, and a rise of 32 points
on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market soared into action soon after Wall Street's bullish
response to latest U.S. jobs data which dispelled fears of an
imminent U.S. interest rates hike.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares sustained their recent gains and
closed over 1 percent higher in response to the ongoing strength
of the dollar, with the DAX-30 index finishing the session 33.87
points up at 3,138.01, up 102.86 points over the week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that as the market ended before the Dow opened,
overnight gains on Wall Street also lent the market support.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also moved sharply higher on the back of Wall
Street's reaction to U.S. job figures, with the CAC-40 index
having hit a record trading high of 2,597.85 points before ending
the session up 39.09 points at 2,597.52, a third consecutive
closing record and a gain of 75.64 points over the week.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 41.9
points at 4,307.8. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed 33.87 points
higher at 3,138.01. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished 39.09
points up at 2,597.52.

<HEADLINE> Confrontation Between Greek Gov't, Farmers Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The confrontation between the
Greek government and the striking farmers was intensified today as
police deflated the tires of about 1,500 tractors in central
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Demanding higher subsidies, cheaper fuel, tax concessions and
cancellation of debts, Greek farmers in Thessaly, central Greece,
embarked last week on a new protest campaign which wields the
threat of severing road and rail links between northern and
southern Greece with tractors as its main lever of pressure on the
government.
</P>
<P>
The protesting farmers held a rally late this afternoon to
protest the stance of the government and police. The farmers'
coordinating committee is expected to decide soon the next step of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis told parliament today that
the government will not allow protesting farmers to block roads
and will never give in to blackmail.
</P>
<P>
He said all necessary measures have been taken along the entire
length of the Athens-Salonika national road and traffic is moving
normally.
</P>
<P>
Greece entered a new wave of strikes this week in protest over
the government's 1997 austerity budget and cutbacks, which have
been imposed in an uphill attempt to meet the European Union's
convergence criteria for monetary union.
</P>
<P>
On other strike fronts, school teachers for the third week
running decided to hold another week of strike and the government
said it is considering making up for lost time by keeping schools
open during the Easter holidays and part of the summer. Private
school teachers also joined the strike Tuesday, and were followed
quickly by civil servants and doctors.

<HEADLINE> US Expresses Concern Over Ecuador's Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expressed its concern over a constitutional crisis in Ecuador and
urged the nation's political leadership to resolve its disputes
peacefully and within the bounds of Ecuadorean laws.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is concerned by the events in Ecuador and
expresses its hope that the current constitutional impasse will
end as quickly as possible," the State Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued before Ecuador's defense minister
declared a nationwide state of emergency to help quell protests
against ousted President Abdala Bucaram. Bucaram was ousted by
Ecuador's Congress Thursday but defiantly refused to stand down.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorean Congress said the president was mentally unfit
and replaced him with Speaker Fabio Alarcon as interim president
until new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement issued by the armed forces earlier today
said Vice President Rosalia Arteaga was taking over as president,
thus rejecting Congress' choice.
</P>
<P>
That means that there are now three people claiming to be
president.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram has appealed to the armed forces for support. But the
military has declared it would not take sides in the political
battle.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of this climate of uncertainty can only
damage Ecuador's national interests and its standing in the
community of democratic nations," the U.S. State Department
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, who is traveling with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said earlier in Houston
that Washington would not take sides in the Ecuadorean crisis.
