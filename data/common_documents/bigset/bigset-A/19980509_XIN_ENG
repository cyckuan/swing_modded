<HEADLINE> Khamenei Blasts U.S. Anti-Iran Propaganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei here Friday lashed out at the United States for its
anti-Iran propaganda, saying that Tehran will never surrender to
Washington's "bullying policies."
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian nation will never surrender to the U.S bullying
policies and its support for the oppressive attitudes of the
Israeli regime," Khamenei told a large crowd of prayers on the
campus of Tehran University at the center of the capital.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the propaganda machine of "the arrogant world"
against Iran, saying that the accusations and insults will prove
to be fruitless and the arrogance will achieve nothing in its
enmity against Iran, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. State Department listed Iran as the top
supporter of international terrorism in 1997 and condemned Tehran
for sponsoring terrorist actions against its political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejected the accusation, counter-attacking the U.S. as the
biggest supporter of world terrorism because of its "desperate
support" for the Israeli "state terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said the real terrorism is the fact that the Israeli
regime expels the Palestinians from their homes and engaged in
kidnaping its opponents from other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is a brave and steadfast nation against
oppressive enemies, and assured the people that this stance has
been adopted not only by the leader, but also by the president,
the government and the Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
This is seen here as an attempt to cover the differences
between the country's moderates and hardliners in dealing with the
U.S.. President Mohammed Khatami, after taking office last August,
called for "people-to-people" exchanges with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
In his summon, Khamenei praised the founder and spiritual
leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who visited Iran last week, reiterating
Tehran's support for Hamas and the Palestinian struggles against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We support the Palestinian fighters to achieve their
legitimate rights, we are proud of the support and deem it as our
duty," he added.

<HEADLINE> New System of Appointments Introduced in Banks in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Jianqing, president of the
Shanghai Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China,
issued letters of appointment with a two-year term to 200 section
chiefs at a ceremony here today.
</P>
<P>
The new system of appointments will help to foster an
atmosphere in which capable men will be promoted while those of
limited ability will step down, said Jiang at today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that two mediocre section chiefs failed to be
reappointed.
</P>
<P>
A sub-branch chief said, "The appointment is a great pressure
for me because if I failed to manage bank sub-branch well in the
coming two years, I would be dismissed."
</P>
<P>
Previously, all cadres including the section chiefs were
appointed by the higher authority for a life-long term no matter
whether they made achievements or not.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Shanghai Branch of the Telecommunications Bank
began to sign contracts with all its staff. Unqualified members
will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists held that the new system of appointment will
benefit the building of a high efficient, unified and coordinated
mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Western Powers Approve Investment Ban On Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Saturday that all the members of the Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia except Russia had agreed on an international investment
ban on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going Group of Eight foreign ministers conference,
Cook said that all the ministers expressed their "grave concern"
over the situation in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav
leaders remain unable to bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that all the western members of the Contact Group --
the U.S., France, Germany, Britain and Italy -- have decided to
implement the international investment ban on Yugoslavia
immediately as the Yugoslav government failed to comply with
Contact Group requirements.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which had been opposed to all sanctions against
Yugoslavia, had made it clear that it would not join the
investment ban, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Canada promised to join the Contact Group initiative, but Japan
said that it would review its position on the investment ban later,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On the deadlocked Middle East peace talks, Cook said that the
G8 ministers voiced full support for an American effort to broker
a new agreement between Israeli and Palestinian leaders in a bid
to revive the process.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that the ministers all agreed that the Washington
peace talks, which U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
termed a last chance to save the Oslo peace agreement, should go
ahead next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from G8 which is made up of the U.S. Britain,
Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia, are expected to
discuss Iraq, landmines and other issues of common concern later
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Election Campaign Period Ends in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The campaign period will officially
end at midnight Saturday for more than 100,000 candidates for
national and local positions in the Philippine elections on Monday
as well as for sectoral organizations contending under the
party-list system.
</P>
<P>
Candidates running for president, vice president and senators
as well as sectoral organizations have a 90-day campaign period
starting on February 10.
</P>
<P>
Those running for members of the House of Representatives by
district, and local elective posts have a 45-day campaign period
starting on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Bernado Pardo, chairman of the Commission on Elections
(Comelec), was quoted Saturday by local television reports as
saying campaigning is strictly prohibited on Sunday and on the
election day itself under the election law.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning after the end of the campaign period is an election
offensive for which the offender could be punished with
imprisonment of not less than one year but not more than six years
and shall not be subject to probation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Pardo, a two-day liquor ban will also take effect
nationwide at midnight Saturday. The ban means the selling,
furnishing, offering, buying, serving or taking of intoxicating
liquor are strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Like the liquor ban, Pardo said, giving, accepting free
transportation, food, drinks and things of value are also
prohibited on Sunday and Monday, according to the election code.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, most of the country's 34 million registered voters
are expected to go to the polls to vote for a new president, as
well as a new vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 256
members of the House of Representatives and thousands of local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Of the 256 members of the lower chamber, 206 will be directly
elected by district, while the remaining 51 (or 20 percent) will
be elected under the party-list system.

<HEADLINE> G7 To Tackle International Financial Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The leading industrial nations' Group
of Seven (G7) bloc agreed Saturday to improve cooperation between
regulators and law enforcement authorities to tackle international
financial crime.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting of the finance ministers
of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United
States here ahead of their annual summit in Birmingham, central
England, next weekend, which Russia will also attend.
</P>
<P>
The G7 Ministers agreed that as both financial services and
crime become increasingly globalized, the challenge could only be
met if all partners work together.
</P>
<P>
Effective cooperation between financial regulators and law
enforcement authorities at international level was essential to
deal with the problem, they stressed.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the agreement, British Chancellor Gordon Brown
said: "Financial crime exists worldwide and affects all
economies. It is one of the major challenges of our time.
</P>
<P>
"We can only tackle it successfully if Governments work
together to combat it as effectively as increasingly sophisticated
criminals work together to commit it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to review their national laws and
procedures to see where concrete improvements could be made.
</P>
<P>
G7 members will report back on their findings by October and
come forward with recommendations at next year's Cologne Summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations plans to
eliminate the cultivation of opium poppies in the "Golden
Triangle" area covering the northern parts of Myanmar, Thailand
and Laos over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made today by UN Deputy Secretary-General and
Executive Director of the UN Drug Control Program Pino Arlacchi,
who is visiting Yunnan Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The Drug Control Program will raise 250 million US dollars to
help local villagers in the "Golden Triangle" area grow grain and
cash crops instead of opium poppies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN official praised China for being "particularly
successful in fighting the illegal narcotics trade, in eliminating
the cultivation of narcotic plants and in combating the trade in
illegal drugs". He said he would introduce China's experience
at the upcoming UN special conference on drug control.
</P>
<P>
In recent years local governments in Yunnan have invested tens
of millions of yuan to help farmers in northern Myanmar cultivate
20,000 ha of grain and cash crops, according to official
figures.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Minister Calls for Cooperation Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria on Saturday asked bankers and businessmen to
cooperate for the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two communities should be of friends,
not of the adversaries, the finance minister said at a discussion
here on problems, especially banking problems, faced by different
economic sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was organized by the Federation of Chambers and
Commerce and Industries.
</P>
<P>
The government was committed to helping flourish the trade and
industries in the country, and would give honest businessmen
all-out help and cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the businessmen to pay tax properly and repay their
loans. Without getting the loans back, the banks would get sick,
and thus could not help build a healthy economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money due from the defaulters in Bangladesh is as
high as about 140 billion taka (about 3.04 billion U.S. dollars),
and its non-payment has been disrupting the country's banking
system, according to reports here.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 loan defaulters have loans each of over 10 million
taka (about 2.2 million dollars), which reportedly has posed
threat to the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister proposed the setting up of an investment
advisory council, comprising the Board of Investment, the Finance
and Commerce Ministries, and the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for specific recommendations from the banking
reform committee to solve problems such as definition of
defaulters and the settlement of overdue loans.

<P>
TIRANA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Parliament Speaker Skender
Gjinushi is to urge European states to consider using military
force against Yugoslavia to stop the violence in Kosovo, the
Albanian Telegraphic Agency (ATA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gjinushi will head for Strasbourg, France, on Sunday to meet
the president of the European Parliament, chairmen of political
groups and other senior officials, to whom he will present a
briefing on the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The main themes of talks will be the situation in
Albania and the work of the Parliament for the improvement of the
legislation, as well as a more specific information on Kosovo,
because in some cases there has been misinformation regarding the
position of the Albanian state."
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Kosovo would not be resolved only
through diplomatic means, and the European community could also
consider military intervention.
</P>
<P>
"One thing should be made clear to Serbia -- as long as it will
use violence, it will receive the same answer. In this direction,
Europe has been a little bit divided in such situations," he said,
referring to the stand of Europe in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"If Milosevic uses military means, the response must be
military. If he is ready to use diplomatic means, the response
must be diplomatic," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Hold First Party-list Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Filipino voters will go to the polls
Monday to elect a new president, a new vice president, 12 out of
24 senators, all 255 members of the House of Representatives, and
thousands of local government officials.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the president is elected by direct
popular vote for a single term of six years. The vice president is
elected for a six-year term in a separate election at the same
time as the president. He can serve a maximum of two terms.
</P>
<P>
The canvass of the votes for president and vice president is
conducted by a joint committee of the bicameral Congress. The
candidates obtaining the highest number of votes for president and
for vice president shall be declared elected.
</P>
<P>
But in case two or more shall have an equal and the highest
number of votes, one of them shall be chosen president or vice
president by a majority vote of all the members of the joint
committee.
</P>
<P>
All 24 Senators are directly elected for six years by national
vote. But one half of the membership of the Senate shall be
elected every three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution adopted in 1987, there are a
maximum of 250 members of the House of Representatives. But on
Monday, there will be 255 seats of the lower house at stake,
according to a primer issued earlier by the Commission on
Elections (Comelec).
</P>
<P>
Among the 255 representatives, 80 percent or 204 shall be
elected by district, while the remaining 20 percent shall be
elected under the party-list system which will used Monday for the
first time in the country, the primer said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two Congress, the remaining 20-percent seats of the
lower house were appointed by the president from lists of nominees
proposed by indigenous, but non-religious, minority groups.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, voters will cast two votes for the Lower House, one
for the district representative and the other for the party he
wants represented in the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 parties accredited by the Comelec will
participate in Monday's party-list election.
</P>
<P>
Under the Party-list Law, the party-list system is a mechanism
of proportional representation in the election of members to the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to enable small political parties and
marginalized and under-represented sectors to obtain possible
representation in the lower chamber, which traditionally, is
dominated by parties with big political machinery.
</P>
<P>
Instead of individual candidates, only registered organized
minority groups such as the peasantry, urban poor, youth,
indigenous cultural communities and veterans can participate in
the party-list elections.
</P>
<P>
A party shall submit to the Comelec a list of at least five
nominees to represent it. Once the party obtains the required
number of votes, the Comelec shall proclaim the party-list
representatives according to their ranking in the list of
nominees.
</P>
<P>
A party should obtain at least 2 percent of the total votes
cast for the party-list system nationwide in order to be allocated
with one seat.
</P>
<P>
Only a maximum of three seats may be allowed per party. Seats
are allocated at the rate of one seat per 2 percent of votes
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Five major political parties, which have largest party
representation in the lower house at the start of the current
Congress, are disqualified from participating in Monday's
party-list election.
</P>
<P>
The five parties are the ruling Lakas-NUCD (Peoples'
Power-National Union of Christian Democrats), the Liberal Party
(LP), the LDP (Power of Democratic Filipinos), the National
People's Coalition (NPC), and the KBL (New Society Movement).
</P>
<P>
Party-list representatives are entitled to the same
deliberative rights as the regular members of the lower chamber.
They shall serve for a term of three years with a maximum of three
consecutive terms.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Speed up Economic Indigenization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Saturday
urged the newly launched indigenous pressure group, the Zimbabwe
Indigenous Economic Empowerment Organization (ZIEEO), to come up
with concrete and practical ideas on indigenization.
</P>
<P>
Launching ZIEEO in Harare, Minister of State Responsible for
Indigenization, Cephas Msipa said the group is coming at a time
when there is need for more communication between the government
and the indigenous business sector.
</P>
<P>
He hopes the new body will contribute to the sucess of the
indigenization process.
</P>
<P>
"With the government having now adopted a policy framework for
indigenization, this new organization should see that the
framework is implemented successfully by your contribution,"
Msipa said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, cautioned the executive that by launching ZIEEO
it had entered the limelight of business leaders and therefore
their behavior had to be exemplary.
</P>
<P>
"You have committed yourselves to be the constituency of your
members and you should serve it, restore dignity to the
indigenization of this country, and not be greedy by enriching
yourselves and forgetting your objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile ZIEEO President Paddington Japajapa said that the
organization will help the government to identify those in need
of land, encourage formation of cooperatives to be able to raise
deposits required by banks to start projects and above all to
economically liberalize black Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He said the organization was already registered with the
Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare and would
have a patron at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 80 percent of the country's economy was
owned by foreign companies and local whites. The economic
indigenization is a policy target of the Zimbabwean government in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: G-15 Countries Should Learn From Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Saturday that developing
countries should draw lessons from the current Asian financial
crisis instead of pointing accusing fingers at each other.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa made the remarks in his inaugural
address to the G-15 foreign ministers meetings, which convened to
endorse the agenda for the summit meeting slated here for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the G-15 summit will focus on three main
developments, namely, the financial crisis in southeast Asia,
South-South cooperation and South-North dialog.
</P>
<P>
"The aim behind analyzing the Asian financial crisis is to
upgrade understanding of world financial developments, especially
the emerging economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis that some G-15 states are facing could
threaten all developing countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the review is designed to come up with lessons drawn from
the financial crisis, rather than "go into confrontations or get
entangled in trade accusations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a group of developing countries from Latin America, Africa
and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989. Indonesia and Malaysia,
the two Asian countries in the center of financial turmoil, are
among the 16 members states which also include Egypt, India,
Algeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Nigeria, Argentina, Jamaica,
Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural session, Moussa stressed the
importance of cooperation and coordination among member states,
pointing out that the eighth G-15 Summit will be held at a
critical phase of development of the world economic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said G-15 foreign ministers have showed solidarity on topics
tabled on the agenda of the second ministerial conference of the
World Trade Organization to be held in Geneva on May 18.
</P>
<P>
Moussa urged the multi-lateral trade system, which will
celebrate its 50th anniversary this year, to take into account the
difficulties facing the developing countries that undergo the
liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
"Economic concerns should not take our attention away from the
social dimension of development. And liberalization of trade
itself should not be a goal in itself but a mechanism towards
promotion of the development process," he said, warning that a
fast-track liberalization might lead to negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 trade ministers had a meeting Friday to discuss ways
of promoting trade exchange among the group's member states and
tackling the impact of the financial crisis facing southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Inter-trade exchange among G-15 countries amounted to 56
billion U.S. dollars, representing about 11 percent of their
overall trade volume which amounted to about 500 billion
dollars in 1996, according to the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members, accounting for 30 percent of the world's
population and 27 percent of the land area of the third world,
represent the emerging economies of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Their total gross domestic product reaches 2 trillion
dollars, making up 43 percent of the third world and 25 percent of
their exports.

<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf left here on Saturday for Amman to pay a visit to
Jordan, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf, special envoy of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
will brief Jordanian King Hussein on the latest developments in
the ties between Iraq and the United Nations Security Council
following Iraq's call for lifting economic sanctions, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it has complied with all the international
obligations, so the sanctions that the U.N. Security Council
imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that al-Sahhaf will also discuss with the
Jordanian side means of enhancing bilateral relations and Arab and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
After his visit in Jordan, al-Sahhaf will travel to a number of
African countries to brief their leaders on the Iraq-U.N.
relations, according to the INA.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Iraqi foreign minister attended the U.N.
Security Council's discussion on a report about arms inspections
submitted by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Only when the UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed the
banned weapons, will the U.N. Security Council lift the crippling
economic sanctions on Iraq.

NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Health services in Indian capital
New Delhi have been severely affected in the past five days as
over 11,000 nurses in 28 government hospitals continued to strike
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strike, organized by the Delhi Nurses Union (DNU), started
from Tuesday in protest against the government which backtracked
on the agreement signed with the DNU last September on pay scales.
The government has held talks with the DNU representatives but the
talks failed as the government ruled out any hike in the pay
scales.
</P>
<P>
The striking nurses have been emboldened as they received more
and more support from nurses of other units and States.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Health Minister Harsh Vardhan Friday asked the striking
nurses to resume duty by Saturday morning or face severe action.
The Union government has also hardened its stand on the issue, yet
the nurses turned a deaf ear to them and refused to go back to
work unless their demands are met.

relations with all countries throughout the world, Tehran radio

"Iran believes that friendly and rational relations among
nations are necessary for peace in the world," he told new
Portuguese ambassador to Tehran Jose Mauyel Sosta Arsenio.
</P>
<P>
Khatami did not mention any exception in his remarks.

willing to establish relations with all countries except Israel,
which Iran refuses to recognize and labels as "usurper of
the Muslim's lands."

The Iranian president underlined the need for dialog among
different civilizations in order to improve the living conditions
of all nations.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, it is very important for us to establish
relations with the European countries," he noted, terming Europe
as an appropriate place for dialog between various cultures and
civilizations.
</P>

Meanwhile, Arsenio said that regarding Iran's great religious

NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian industrialist Ram Gandhi
said Saturday that economic reforms will not succeed unless
appropriate administrative reforms are accompanied in the country.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 90th annual general meeting of the Indian
Merchants' Chamber (IMC) in Mumbai, the biggest commercial center
in India, IMC outgoing President Ram Gandhi said: "India will find
it impossible to deliver economic reforms unless the
administration is reformed."
</P>
<P>
It is a paradox that no framework had been drawn up so far to
implement decisions taken by the political leadership to give
effect to the reforms drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Coordination Committee comprising leaders of
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allied partners was held
here Saturday to discuss ways of ensuring smooth running of the
Vajpayee coalition government in the wake of charges and
counter-charges involving some Union ministers and leaders of
allied partners.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting of its kind held since the BJP-led
government came to power on March 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Focus of all right thinking people must shift to the sorry
plight of governance in the country," Ram Gandhi said, adding that
there should be a code of coalition governance to sort out all
contentious problems.

<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Second Chief of Turkey's General
Staff Cevik Bir arrived in Nicosia on Saturday to pay a visit to
Turkish Cypriot side of the island, according to a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Bir as saying at the Ercan Airport that
Cyprus has become more important after the Cold War, adding that
"for this reason, the Turkish Armed Forces are conscious about
this."
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is easier than before to understand that who
destroyed the peace in the region. The Turkish Armed Forces will
do their best to protect the peace and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
In his part, Turkish Cypriot "Prime Minister" Dervis Eroglu
said the visit of the high-ranking officer of the Turkish Armed
Forces will give spiritual force and morale to the Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots are living in a "happy way" under the
guarantee of Turkey, said Eroglu.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
Mediterranean island after a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek
Cypriots. Nicosia was also divided into two parts.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only
by Turkey, against the internationally recognized Republic of
Cyprus predominated by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying to reunify the
island under the bizonal and bicommunal formula proposed by the
United Nations. But so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in the
northern part of Cyprus to secure the security of the Turkish
Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicine Used to Produce Anti-Cancer Injection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an injection
form of anti-cancer treatment based on the principles of
traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
It is said to kill cancer cells and fight metastasis while
regulating and enhancing the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
Previously, traditional Chinese medicine tonics used to fight
cancer could only be taken orally, and it was thought that
traditional Chinese medicine could only play an auxiliary role in
treating cancer.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine
announced here today that this research achievement leads the way
to producing medicine for 50,000 cancer patients annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Zhejiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine
spent 20 years developing the injection, known as "Kang Lai
Te". It is extracted from the herb semen coicis and applied in the
form of intravenous drip or arterial perfusion.
</P>
<P>
Clinical experiments have shown that the new drug is effective
in treating cancers of the lungs, liver and stomach, and causes
fewer side-effects than chemotherapeutic drugs.
</P>
<P>
The anti-cancer injection, which was put into serial production
in August 1997, has been granted patents in China, the US. Russia
and the Philippines..
</P>
<P>
The Kang Lai Special Medicines Company, the producer of the
drug, is located in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province. It has an annual turnover of 300 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Ross Hold Talks on U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast Peace Envoy Dennis
Ross held talks in Ramallah Saturday afternoon with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat on the
U.S. proposal for breaking the impasse of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The central issue of the U.S. proposal is to ask Israel to
carry out a 13.1 percent troop redeployment in the next stage in
the West Bank, but Israel has not yet made its final decision
whether to accept it.
</P>
<P>
If Israel accepts the U.S. proposal, then U.S. President Bill
Clinton would possibly meet Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next Monday to launch the
final-status Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu Communication Advisor David Bar-Illan told the Israel
Radio Saturday that it is impossible for Netanyahu to travel to
Washington next Monday because the time is too short for Israel to
make final decisions on troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Ross during their meeting that now it is up to
Israel to make political decisions on this issue because the PNA
has stated that it accepted the U.S. proposal, according to a
senior PNA official close to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also said that the Washington meeting should be for
signing agreement, not for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The PNA cabinet met in Ramallah Friday evening and discussed
the recent development in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said in a statement that the PNA supports the
U.S. initiative for the Washington meeting, and if the stalemate
of the peace process continues, the region will be turned into
conflicts that could be out of control.
</P>
<P>
Ross will hold talks again here Saturday evening with
Netanyahu to further discuss the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region Friday and held talks with
Netanyahu after his arrival, but no progress was made on the
issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, two members of Netanyahu's inner
cabinet, also participated in the Friday talks.
</P>
<P>
The Washington meeting is scheduled for next Monday and before
that, Israel has to make its final decision whether it would
accept the U.S. proposal concerning Israel's troop redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said here Friday that Israel
could only have a 9 percent redeployment based on Israel's
security needs.
</P>
<P>
Because Israel's decision-making process must take sometime,
Netanyahu said on Thursday that he is not sure that he will get
to Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will call a whole cabinet meeting on Sunday to make
a final decision on the U.S. proposal.

MOGADISHU, May 9 (Xinhua)-- Fighting for the control of the
Southern port town of Kismaio continues Saturday between General
Morgan's Majerten militiamen and those of the Marehan subclan of
the Somali National Front (SNF) forces with high number of
fatalities on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Bitter face-face armed clashes once again erupted outside
Kismaio with the Majerten militiamen taking the offensive late
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, General Morgan's militiamen
have made a considerable advance forcing the Marehan militiamen
to continue retreating back to the territories controlled by
Hussein Mohamed Aidid's faction in Lower Jubba Region.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching Mogadishu Saturday morning said the Majerten
militiamen have captured the bridge of Wirkoy, 28 km North of
Kismaio, in their last counter-attack operation. Three of General
Morgan's men were killed and five others have suffered gunshot
wounds, while the SNF men have lost four of their men and 11
others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Since the fighting began early Friday morning, two battle
wagons belonging to the Marehan and another one from General
Morgan's men were destroyed. The latest reports over the
fatalities indicate that 24 of General Morgan's men and 15 from
the SNF were killed.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the number of fatalities has reached
nearly 200 while the wounded are getting very close to 300 since
the fighting began between these two sides mid last month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warning by the SNF militia officials against the
use of the air and seaport of Kismaio, there are reports from the
town which indicate that two small planes carrying weapons and
ammunition have landed at the airport of the town Friday
afternoon. The planes flew from the Northeastern town of Bosasso
with more than 300 assault rifles, anti-aircraft heavy machine
guns and ammunition to General Morgan's fighters, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that more preparations continue Saturday
in the town of Kismaio for a possible further attack on bases of
Hussein Aidid who is suspected of supporting the SNF militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the two Darod subclans of Majerten and
Marehan, mainly based on economical disputes over the control of
the air and seaports of Kismaio, is now irritating Hussein
Aidid's faction whose militia camps in Lower Jubba Region have
now fallen to General Morgan's men for the second time in less 10
days.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- To improve its capability to reduce
losses caused by earthquakes, China has begun to use the Global
Positioning System (GPS) to monitor seismological disturbances,
and is planning to use satellite remote-sensing technology as well.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 China's interior area has entered the fifth active
period for strong earthquakes in the 20th century. Experts predict
that a series of quakes measuring above seven degrees on the
Richter scale will take place within the next 10 to 15 years in
the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Space technologies, which can be used to study and forecast
earthquakes, are especially helpful for reducing deaths, injuries
and economic losses from earthquakes, said Prof. Chen Xinlian, an
expert at the Seismological Society of China.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences have spent more than 100 million yuan (about 12 million
US dollars) building a nationwide crustal movement monitoring
network, which mainly depends on the use of GPS, Prof. Chen told a
national symposium on reducing natural disasters, which closed
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC),
which is composed of 25 major round-the-clock stations, 56 regular
GPS monitoring stations and 1,000 GPS sub-stations, will provide
scientific data for the prediction of earthquakes in both the medium
and long terms, and explore methods of forecasting quakes in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Chinese experts have started using satellite
thermal infra-red images to predict earthquakes over the short
term.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 280,000 people in China have been killed
in earthquakes since 1949, or more than 50 percent of the total
number of deaths from natural disasters. About 46 percent of
cities, and many big mines, items of industrial infrastructure and
water-control projects in China are under the threat of
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
China is now able to monitor earthquakes measuring above
seven degrees on the Richter scale worldwide, and quakes above
five degrees nationwide, within half an hour.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Get $200m From Donors for Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- International donors have agreed,
after several days of discussion, to aid 202 million U.S. Dollars
for Mozambique's national agrarian development program.
</P>
<P>
Carlos do Rosario, Agriculture and Fishery Minister of
Mozambique, said that the donors, which mostly came from European
countries, set some conditions for the aid, like the involvement
of private sectors, the function of the farmland development, and
the ownership of the land by household, Noticias reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will give full consideration to the
conditions as long as the country's interests are not hurt, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for the farmland development, Rosario said, is
an indication of the concerns for Mozambique's development by the
international society.
</P>
<P>
The five-year agrarian development program would help develop
farmland in central, northern and southern Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Ready for Elections: Comelec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Commission on
Elections (Comelec) said Saturday that everything is in place for
Monday's general elections and voting paraphernalia such as
ballots and boxes have been dispatched to the most far-flung of
places.
</P>
<P>
At a forum on Monday's elections, Comelec Commissioner Evalyn
Fetalino appealed to the country's more than 34 million registered
voters to actively participate in the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
Fetalino urged the voters to use the weekend to verify their
names against the voters' list in their assigned precincts.
</P>
<P>
"There will be confusion, but this can be minimized if you stop
the eleventh-hour habit. Check your name, know where your
precincts are, prepare your sample ballots now and save time on
Monday," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec, the government agency overseeing the elections,
said earlier that about 82 percent of the 34 million eligible
voters will troop to the more than 170,000 precincts to vote.
</P>
<P>
They will vote a new president, as well as a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 256 members of the House of
Representatives, 78 provincial governors and 1,608 mayors.
</P>
<P>
According to Fetalino, more than 30 cities, provinces and
municipalities have been placed by the Comelec under its control
"in order to pre-empt election-related violence and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Fetalino added that special composite teams have been organized
to oversee the elections process down to local government units
under Comelec control.
</P>
<P>
At the same forum, Gen. Edmundo Larozza, deputy chief of
Operations of the Philippine National Police (PNP), predicted that
Monday's elections will be "more peaceful" when compared to the
1992 national and local elections and the 1995 midterm polls.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 polls, 169 people were killed in
election-related violence, while 210 election-related deaths were
recorded in the 1995 ballots.
</P>
<P>
But only 27 people were killed in election-related incidents as
of May 6 this year, according to Larozza.
</P>
<P>
Larozza emphasized that it is in the local level where massive
disturbance often occur and that some 740 policemen have been
deputized as personal security escorts of certain local
candidates.

<HEADLINE> Eminent Nigerians Urge Abacha Not to Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of 34 eminent Nigerians including
former vice-president Alex Ekwueme have urged the country's military
leader, General Sani Abacha not to contest the August 1 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The group, which identifies itself as Group of Patriotic Nigerian
Citizens, includes former speaker of the National Assembly, Chief
Edwin Ume Ezeoke, former state governors as well as lawyers,
businessmen and intellectuals of repute.
</P>
<P>
Their appeal came two months after 18 noted northern politicians
made public their letter to General Abacha appealing him not to
succeed himself.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-page memorandum forwarded to Abacha recently and released
to the press Friday, the group advised Abacha to refuse the invitation
by the country's five political parties to have him as their consensus
candidate, saying that it is illegal and immoral.
</P>
<P>
Their argument is that the amendment made to the parties'
constitutions at their national conventions in April is illegal
because it was not approved by the National Electoral Commission of
Nigeria (NECON) as required by the law.
</P>
<P>
The parties amended their constitutions in April to accommodate the
candidacy of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Another major reason advanced by the group is that the law forbids
</P>
<P>
military officers from being members of political parties while a
presidential candidate must be a member of a political party.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha took over the power in November 1993 and is expected
to hand over the power to an elected civilian government this October
by the transition program he announced in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Marcos Officially Withdraws From Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Former First Lady Imelda Marcos
announced here Saturday that she has officially withdrawn from
Monday's presidential race and will endorse and support Vice
President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the campaign office of Mrs. Marcos
said that Imelda Marcos is now "officially and categorically
withdrawn from the 1998 presidential race."
</P>
<P>
"And therefore, we now have decided to endorse and support Vice
President Joseph 'Erap' Estrada," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This decision of millions of Marcos loyalists also carried
with it our prayers to further secure, guarantee and fulfill the
ultimate victory of Erap Estrada to become the next president of
the Republic of the Philippines," the office said.
</P>
<P>
The office also published Mrs. Marcos' letter to the Commission
on Elections on her withdrawal from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"In view of present developments, I am constrained to withdraw,
as I now hereby withdraw, My 7 February 1998 Certificate of
Candidacy for President of the Republic of the Philippines in the
11 May 1998 elections..."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos announced her withdrawal from the race on April 29,
but on her way to the election commission the following day, some
supporters snatched the letter from her, thus preventing her from
filing it.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos' official withdrawal and endorsement of Estrada,
presidential candidate of Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino
(fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses), have made the vice president
one step nearer toward the presidency, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
After Mrs. Marcos' withdrawal, 10 candidates are running in the
presidential election to replace President Fidel Ramos, who is
barred from a second term by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's main rival is Speaker Jose de Venecia, candidate from
the ruling Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
But a poll by the Social Weather Station published last
Thursday put Estrada's support at 33 percent, and De Venecia
trailed in second place with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's election, the voters will also elect a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 250 members of the House of
Representatives, 78 provincial governors and 1,600 mayors.

<HEADLINE> S. African Muslims Criticize Government Bar on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Muslim leaders
slamed the government's failure to issue visa for a visit to
South Africa by Palestine's Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Reprsentatives of 11 local Muslim organizations, who invited
Yassin, Friday called on all democratic forces to urge the
government led by President Nelson Mandela to stop abusing and
exercizing its power arbitrarily by denying people access to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was due to arrive in South Africa on Friday to visit
Johannesburg and Durban.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad told a press conference
Thursday that the government had not yet acted on the visa
request because it was examining the issue in the light of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yassin is opposed to the current fragile peace accord between
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) led by Yasser
Araft. Hamas was also allegedly responsible for a series of
suicide bomb attacks in Israel in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
South Africa recognizes the PNA, and not Hamas, as the
respresentative of the Palestinian people, and was petitioned by
the PNA not to allow Yassin to visit South Africa now.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Business Conference in Hong Kong, Evidence of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An international business
conference in Hong Kong did not produce any timetable for the
recovery of the economies hit by the recent financial crisis, but
it did demonstrate continued confidence in Asia by world business
circles.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Annual Corporate Conference of Asia Society, which
concluded Friday, issued a report and stressed that it is
imperative to restore confidence and stability in currency and
financial markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Business and government leaders attending the conference were
optimistic about the recovery of crisis-hit economies and believe
such recovery should begin this year and take "a couple of years"
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
China's chief trade representative and Vice-Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Long Yongtu said the fact that some
800 business people met over the last three days in Hong Kong
showed their confidence and continued interest in Hong Kong and in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence is the key to success and we need to build up a
good atmosphere," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held that with the
support and assistance from international agencies and other
countries, a resumption of growth will take place in Asia within
this year though he confessed that it will take another two or may
be three years for the rate of progress to revert to pre-crisis
dynamic path.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for a South Asian free trade area early in the
next century will further accelerate growth and trade in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region said the financial crisis was "painful" but
the fundamentals in Asia haven't changed.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, entitled "Engines of Growth?
Asia and the Future of World Business," about 800 participants
addressed to the financial crisis with the purpose of seeking a
greater understanding of the long-term political, social and
strategic consequences of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tracing the roots of the crisis to the large inflow of
unregulated and inadequately reported private capital, the
conference participants agreed while Asia has enjoyed prosperity
over the past decades, it needs to go through institutional
reforms in its financial systems and further tap the potentials in
order to achieve continued development.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Society report said the long-term task is to reduce
the risk of crisis in Asia - or anywhere - while enabling the
international system to continue to benefit from the advantages of
an increasing globalized financial system.
</P>
<P>
Policy changes are not enough. Also needed are basic changes in
institutions, attitudes, and practices, as well as the expertise
to make the new systems effective, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mituo Sato, president of the Asian Development Bank, called for
reforms of the financial system on a broad basis.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Long Yongtu said China, learning lessons from the
crisis, will continue to implement the reforms and opening to the
outside world while carrying out reforms of its financial system
and government institutions and so on, particularly strengthening
the role of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Although a country like Vietnam is not in the center of the
regional financial cyclone, its economy is not immune, said
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem.
</P>
<P>
He said the present conditions demand the Asian countries
"completely abandon the easy-going way of growth, persistently
continue economic reforms and integration, combine domestic
strength with external assistance."
</P>
<P>
According to Pham, the Vietnamese government has set up a
special institution to help provide prompt responses to the rapid
changes and put in a tight financial and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. trade representative Carla Hills said it is most
important to put in place better supervision of the financial
institutions participating in international markets in order to
increase (financial) stability.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Asia, Prime Minister Sharif called on the
Asian countries to cooperate closely to prove equal to the
challenges of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the greatest potential for business lies in
exploiting the complementarities of energy-rich Central Asia and
rapidly industrializing South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The way China has responded to the crisis was commended at the
conference. Prime Minister Sharif said China "took a bold
decision" during the economic downturn not to devalue its currency
thereby helping stabilize the economies of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong business circles expressed the belief that the city,
which Chief Executive Tung commented has passed the test of the
crisis, will maintain its status as an entrepot in the coming
years.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Tumor Diagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China has made great progress in
tumor prevention and treatment in recent years, with some
provincial tumor hospitals catching up with developed countries in
diagnosis and treatment of the disease, according to a cancer
specialist.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing fourth national conference on tumor studies,
Dr. Chen Yunxian, from the Guangzhou-based Zhongshan Medical
Sciences University, said 50 percent of cancer patients lived more
than five years after treatment by some provincial tumor
hospitals, which also managed to cure more than 90 percent of
cancer patients in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the achievements to proper guidelines for tumor
prevention and treatment, saying that tumor hospitals have been
established in 27 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has suffered a great deal from various cancers in the
last two decades, he said, with one of every five person dying of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Chinese Cancer Research Foundation, this
year's conference had 420 papers presented, which reflect the
progress in tumor studies in China.

<HEADLINE> Toxic Tide Taints Shellfish on Cape Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Shellfish on the beaches north of
Cape Point might have been contaminated by a toxic red tide, South
African Sea Fisheries Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department warned the public not to collect any mussels from
the region as they might contain life threatening poisons, The Citizen
paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted by the Sea Fisheries Research Institute Friday
showed that small amounts of a toxic substance known to cause
paralytic shellfish poisoning was present in the red tide off the Cape
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The toxin, known as saxitoxin, disrupts normal nerve functions and
can cause paralysis and death by respiratory failure within two to 24
hours, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms include vomiting, headaches, dizziness and impaired
respiration.
</P>
<P>
Initial signs of poisoning, which become evident between 30 minutes
and three hours after eating contaminated shellfish, are a tingling in
the mouth and throat, a numb sensation in the fingers and hands, and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
"The cosumption of even a single contaminated mussel may be fatal
and cooking does not lessen the toxicity of affected shellfish," the
department said.

<HEADLINE> 137th Birth Anniversary of Tagore Marked in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The 137 birth anniversary of noted
poet Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was marked in India Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and some Union cabinet
ministers and politicians paid their tributes before Tagore's
portrait in the central hall of Parliament house here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A booklet containing the profile of Tagore brought out by the
Lower House of Parliament Secretariat was also presented to those
present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Tagore's portrait was unveiled in Parliament by the then
president Rajendra Prasad in the central hall in 1958 in
recognition of the services rendered by Tagore to the nation.
</P>
<P>
"It is realization of moments which has made Tagore immortal,
for every man irrespective of his caste, class, creed or
nationality finds a thread or a chord in one aspect of Tagore's
myriad works. Tagore perhaps represented a unique phenomenon which
endeared but made him also an enigma," an article said here
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Economy Still at Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- With roughly about two months to
go before the ending of 1997-98 fiscal year (July 30-July 1), the
state of Pakistan's economy presents mixed signals showing the
economy is still at crossroads.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Bureau of Statistics pertaining
to the first three quarters of the current fiscal year show that
despite problems faced by some major economic sectors, the
government's economic policies have started working.
</P>
<P>
Through restructuring of the economy and introduction of major
economic reform packages by the present government, there have
been visible signs of improvement in some key macro-economic
indicators during the first nine months of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging improvement, among others, is that
Pakistan has been able to achieve a 5.5 percent growth rate of GDP
in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It is highly expected that the growth rate of GDP for the whole
1997-98 fiscal year will be 5.4 percent, up from 3.1 percent in
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Although the 5.4 percent growth rate of GDP is short of the
targeted six percent, it is, however, the highest one for this
south Asian nation during the last six years, and it is especially
encouraging that the growth rate will have been achieved in the
background of the east Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in the whole economic scenario during the first
three quarters of 1997-98 fiscal year also include a significant
decline in the current account deficit and inflation rate, control
over the government's bank borrowing for budgetary support and
recovery in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, which plays a pivotal role in the
country's economy, is forecast to register a growth rate of six
percent against the target of five percent.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is believed to be the main contributor
to the improved GDP performance. Bumper crops of rise, sugarcane
and wheat have compensated for the reduced cotton crop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade deficit is down to 1.36 billion U.S.
dollars in the first nine months of 1997-98 fiscal year, compared
to 2.62 billion dollars in the previous comparable period, largely
due to a decline of 11 percent in imports, which has compensated
for the slow growth of exports by only five percent.
</P>
<P>
The chronic trade deficit is believed to be one of the major
problems inflicting Pakistan's economy. The massive drop in the
trade deficit is by no means a welcome sign for the economy.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit for the same period is down to
1.041 billion dollars from 3.222 billion dollars in the
corresponding period last fiscal year. And the government's bank
borrowing has remained within the budget ceiling of 55 billion
rupees (1.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, one worrisome problem facing Pakistan's economy is the
less than expected revenue collection. Figures provided by the
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) for the first 10 months of the
current fiscal year show that the CBR has collected only 224
billion rupees (5.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
There is still a gap of 81 billion rupees (1.8 billion dollars)
against the revised revenue target of 305 billion rupees (6.9
billion dollars). With only two months left before the outgoing
fiscal year, it is by any means a hard task for the CBR to fill
the gap.
</P>
<P>
Due to a massive revenue shortfall, it is most likely that
Pakistan is to end up with at least a six percent budget deficit
in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the less than expected revenue
growth coupled with growing losses of public sector corporations
can aggravate the macroeconomic imbalances.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Pakistan's weak spot in its economy over
the last several years has been the manufacturing sector in which
there prevailed a disturbing slowdown not only in industrial
production but also in fresh investment activity for the
establishment of new industries.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the manufacturing sector steadily fell from
5.4 percent in 1993-94 to 3.7 percent in 1994-95, 4.4 percent in
1995-96 and finally to the lowest ever at 1.8 percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the long-desired economic recovery will be
badly affected with the manufacturing sector still in depression.
And the traditional fragility of Pakistan's economy of heavy
dependence on agriculture, especially on cotton crop, will still
persist.

<TEXT>
<P>

importance of the social stability at the movement for overcoming
current economic crisis.

and peace are needed.
</P>
<P>

"If we are not concerned with political and security stability,
it will be more difficult not only in restoring the economy but
also in carrying out construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto made the statement when commented on recent riots
occurred in some cities in the country and demonstrations staged
by students.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) will not take actions if
there is no illegal activity, but if there are (illegal
activities), the ABRI have to take actions to build social and
political stability," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said, President Soeharto will deliver a
statement at the he G-15 summit, during which the leaders are
expected to discuss the current world situation, including the
international money market and monetary situation in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1989, the G-15 comprises Indonesia, Egypt,
Malaysia, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Jamaica,
Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
After attending the G-15 summit, Soeharto will make an official
visit to Egypt from May 13 to 15 and hold talks with his Egyptian
counterpart, Hosni Mubarak, to strengthen bilateral relations,
particularly in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides will sign a several agreements,
including on prevention of double taxation and a Memorandum of
Understanding between the central banks of the two countries,
official Antara News Agency reported earlier.

<HEADLINE> Hot Musical Troupe Makes Show in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Prodigy, one of the hottest
musical groups in the world, arrived here Friday night to make a
show Saturday, the first of its kind in the Middle East, Lebanon's
Daily Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The group, who roared its way to mass success in Britain with
the March 1996 aggressive, techno-dance single Firestarter, will
play to a crowd of 8,000 in the car park next in Beirut Central
district.
</P>
<P>
As the self-proclaimed "electronic punks" passed through a
crowd of fans and reporters at Beirut airport's arrival lounge,
lead singer Keith Flint said: "It's really good to be here. We
don't know anything about it but we are happy to be in Beirut."
</P>
<P>
Called the "scariest man in rock music," Flint has numerous
body tattoos and is known for his devilish double Mohican hair
style, which gives the impression that he has two horns sprouting
out of the top of the head, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Prodigy fan Rania Attieh, 20, told the paper that "This is the
greatest thing to happen in the Middle East ever. Other bands will
follow in their footsteps."
</P>
<P>
Giro Artinian, a promoter for Power Production, which brought
the troupe to Beirut, said that it will contemporarily put Beirut
on the map.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that other bands will follow them here,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi will visit United Arab Emirates (UAE) later in May for
talks on ironing out various bilateral differences, including land
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an informed source as saying, the English-language
newspaper Iran News reported Saturday that the minister will pay a
two-day official visit to the UAE starting on May 22.
</P>
<P>
The daily said Kharrazi and other officials will also discuss
bilateral and regional relations.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Tehran and Abu Dhabi were lowered
to the level of charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a
protest to Iran's full control on the islands of Abu Musa, the
Greater and the Lesser Tunbs, over which both sides claimed full
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands on November 30, 1971, one daybefore the inde
pendence of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, Iran tried to solve the
"misunderstanding" with the UAE through bilateral talks while Abu
Dhabi called for an international arbitrate over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Iranian foreign minister visited the UAE
during his first tour to the six Gulf states to invite their
leaders to attend the eighth Islamic summit held in Tehran last
December.
</P>
<P>
The UAE government was encouraged to hold talks with Iran
following the warm-up of ties between Iran and Saudi Arab and the
visit of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to Riyadh in
March and the tour of Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq
Nouri to Kuwait and Oman in April.

<HEADLINE> 4 Lebanese Wounded in Hezbollah-Amal Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were wounded in
a gun battle in a street here Friday night between Lebanon's two
leading Muslim military groups, Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The four, one seriously wounded, are members of the Amal
Movement led by House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
According to Amal sources, some gunmen of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, challenged a group of Amal partisans
driving past a prayer hall.
</P>
<P>
The argument quickly developed into a shootout before Lebanese
Internal Security Forces rushed to the site, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Hezbollah's spokesman Nayef Krayem said the
clash was provoked by a group of Amal members who tried to string
across a street in Zoqaa al-Blat district a banner reading: "Those
who oppose Amal have no Amal (hope) to live."
</P>
<P>
"We decry these fighters provoked as the local elections
approach, as if the instigators want to impose an alliance on
Hezbollah, prevent its supporters from reaching positions in
local councils or cause the polls to be canceled altogether,"
Krayem was quoted by the paper.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's first local elections since 1963 are scheduled to be
held across the country from May 24, except the villages and towns
which are under the occupation of Israeli forces in the south.
</P>
<P>
Krayem noted that in recent weeks there have been three other
confrontations between the two factions in south Beirut, south
Lebanon, and the eastern province of Bekka.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two sides, which are launching separate
guerrilla wars against Israeli occupation, soared after a ceremony
in south Lebanon on May 3 during which a speech by Berri was
interpreted as an attack on Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that political parties should not name candidates
to local elections, a declaration deemed to be an effort to keep
Hezbollah out of the race.
</P>
<P>
He also said "to those who always unite to fight Nabih Berri
and the Amal Movement, I say: when Israel withdraws, God willing,
I'm waiting for you. Today we don't want to fight anyone."
</P>
<P>
Berry's speech triggered scathing reactions from Hezbollah's
Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who said he hoped the
speaker's comments were just "a slip of the tongue."

<HEADLINE> Profile: A Likely Dark Horse in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim, the
presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, is one of the major
contenders in the Philippines' May 11 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other presidential contenders who have prepared for the
derby for years, Lim threw his hat in the ring last December, less
than three months before the start of the official campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
But the late-comer, who campaigns on peace and order, a clean
government and a free college education system, emerged as a dark
horse in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
In four opinion polls conducted between January and April this
year by the country's most respected polling group, the Social
Weather Station (SWS), Lim emerged as the closest rival to Vice
President Joseph Estrada, with a support rating of 13 to 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lim's late surge is due to his anti-crime record and the open
backing of former president Corazon Aquino, who still has a great
number of followers.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who resigned as Manila mayor in March for his presidential
bid, also has the tacit support of the influential Manila
Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, the country's leading prelate.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Dirty Harry" after the fictional Hollywood detective,
Lim was well known for his tough methods in dealing with criminals
in the 1980s when he was a police chief of a Manila district and
then the director of the National Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
After being elected Manila mayor in 1992, the retired police
general continued his aggressive pursue against criminals which
was highlighted by an unprecedented campaign of painting the doors
of suspected drug dealers with warning signs last year.
</P>
<P>
Although criticized for being a one-issue candidate with little
knowledge of economic issues, Lim enjoys high popularity among the
middle-upper class and the business community because of his
charisma and strong leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I will vote for Lim because of his tough leadership. He is a
no-nonsense leader, a disciplinarian, and that's the right man for
our country at this difficult time," said John Giburea, a Filipino
journalist.
</P>
<P>
Lim's presidential bid was further boosted Friday when the
Commission on Elections (Comelec) dismissed a petition seeking to
disqualify him from the race.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed last month by a lawyer, allegedly at the
instigation of the ruling party, saying that Lim was not a
natural-born Filipino since his parents were Chinese mestizos.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, only natural-born Filipinos may seek
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The citizenship issue made some dent on Lim's support rating,
which dipped to 10 percent in a May SWS poll from 13 percent
showed in an April SWS poll.
</P>
<P>
With the detractive citizenship issue resolved and his charisma
advantage over most of his rivals, Lim could be a real dark horse
in the presidential race.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided to
pull its 17 troop trainers from Indonesia and stop an exercise
there because of the recent unrest, a senior Pentagon official
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Defense has decided to terminate this
exercise," he said. "The decision was made because of the current
situation in Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
The exercise, dubbed "Balance Iron", started on May 1. Up to 95
U.S. troops had been sent to participate in the monthlong exercise.
</P>
<P>
The official said it was no time "to be conducting a military
exercise" as the Indonesian military has been distracted by
widespread protest rioting in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen troop trainers belonging to the 1st Special Forces
Group Airborne will return to their base at Toril Station,
Okinawa, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, U.S. Special Operations Forces have
conducted 41 training exercises with the Indonesian military at a
cost of more than 3.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth such joint military exercise this year, and
six more are scheduled. It will be determined on a case-by-case
basis whether the others will be held, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Threatens to Ban Pork Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has warned pork product
importers to adhere to Zambia's regulations or risk a complete
ban.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Enock Kavindele
issued the warning on Friday after touring the pig industry at
Kalangwa and Twikatane farms in Lusaka, Zambia Faily Mail
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that he received numerous complaints
from the producers and processors on how the local pork industry
is being significantly depressed by heavily subsidized imports,
which in most cases are of poor quality.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele agreed with the producers and processors that Zambia
has an influx of subsidized inferior pork products, especially
from Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the government will act with a couple of months
to revamp the local sector as farming in Zambia takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
He assured the farmers that the government will work promptly
with relevant ministries and bodies like the bureau of standards
to bring the industry to its feet.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele urged Zambians to support local industry by opting
for locally produced goods.
</P>
<P>
"Zambians destroy their own industries by buying imported
stuff that is mostly expired or over-processed," he complained.
</P>
<P>
Zambia National Farmers Union President Ajay Vashee who
organized the tour said Zambia's pork products could not
effectively compete with their Zimbabwean and South African
producers who enjoy reduced costs of production in almost all
aspects.
</P>
<P>
The General Manager of the Zambia Natioanl Farmers Union
complained that the heavily subsidized pork imports coupled
with expensive materials for raising pigs have depressed the
local industry.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Whoever Elected, Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- When the Filipinos go to the polls
next Monday, their foremost concern may be who is competent to
lead them out of the financial storm sweeping the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But they may find it difficult to choose among the 11
presidential candidates, especially the front runners including
Vice President Joseph Estrada of the Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses), House Speaker Jose
de Venecia of the ruling party Lakas-NUCD and former Manila mayor
Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Analysts consider none of them expert in building economy, and
this defect is fatal amid the financial crisis which has caused
peso depreciation, economic slowdown, price increases and massive
lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Partly because he never finished university and partly because
his previous career was a movie star, Estrada has never been
accepted by the moneyed class. The business sector has accused him
of lacking economic background and predicts he will be a disaster
to the country's economy if elected.
</P>
<P>
To dispel the fears, Estrada has set up a think-tank of 30
advisers and vows to continue the economic policies laid out by
President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
"Aware of my own limitations, I am impelled to choose the best
and the brightest (as aides) for me to succeed as president. I
listen to the counsel of the brightest and seek the wisdom of the
common folk," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
As the anointed candidate by Ramos, House Speaker De Venecia is
termed a traditional politician whose strength lays in building a
political coalition, but not economy. Analysts note that except
repeatedly saying he will carry on the economic reforms of the
Ramos government, De Venecia has not talked much about economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling party claimed that De Venecia was the
"worthiest successor" to Ramos. It said De Venecia helped create
the Ramos legacy in economy by ensuring the approval of dozens of
economic bills in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Former Manila mayor Lim won the support of former president
Corazon Aquino and the influential Manila archbishop, Cardinal
Jaime Sin. His ideas on economy, however, seem "worryingly
simple."
</P>
<P>
Lim's economic reform policy can best be described as the "bang
bang" theory. He believes that the best way to economic recovery
is shooting down criminals, an approach that has endeared him
during the past few years to those Filipinos weary of frequent
kidnappings and the growing menace posed by drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
"We can only improve the economy by restoring law and order,"
the former police general said, while admitting that his "weakest
link is economics." Beyond that, he has not said much. For this
reason, critics say Lim is nothing more than a policeman.
</P>
<P>
The three leading presidential candidates are all viewed
incompetent in economics, but this does not necessarily mean that
the economy will be a mess if one of them is elected to the
presidency, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, they said, there are only limited areas in which the
new president can take economic policies to new directions. There
are a number of checks and balances in the Philippine political
system that might make Estrada not quite the disaster some people
predict he will be.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the candidates each have a running mate who has
expertise in economy. Estrada's partner, Senator Edgardo Angara,
is a lawyer with an economist's bent. De Venecia's running mate,
Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, is an economist by training and
Lim's partner Sergio Osmena is an economist and businessman. They
can remedy the defect of the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, amid the global trend of liberalization, privatization
and other economic reforms, the new president can not afford to
deviate the economy from the current track, making the country
isolated in the international business community.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, analysts predict that whoever wins the presidency,
the country's economy will not be in chaos. They even proffer an
analogy with Ramos who is also not an expert in economy.
</P>
<P>
"When he came to power, there was nothing to suggest he was
going to be an economic reformer. Ramos was just a good military
man with the confidence of Aquino. Yet he turned out to be one of
the best presidents the country has ever had. So who is to say how
Estrada will be?" they said.
</P>
<P>
Even Ramos himself, who worried over the victory of Estrada,
told international investors that the economic reforms of the
government would continue no matter who wins the elections.

JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) --The South African government,
which has provided shelter for 3.3 million people since 1994, will
beef up its efforts to build more houses for the disadvantaged people,
a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The government is working out a housing policy based on
integration, densification and the broadening of individual
choices to take South Africa into the new millennium, Housing
Minister Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele told the annual conference of
the South African Residential Developers Association held at Sun City,
Northern Province Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mthembi-Mahanyele said her department had established links
and formed partnerships with countries such as the Netherlands,
Britain and the United States to exchange technical expertise and
speed up housing delivery in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To improve the delivery process, the government has harnessed
the energies of the state, the private sector and individual
families who may contribute via the People Housing Process,
whereby families are given support through capital subsidies to
build their own houses, the minister added.

<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Two explosions rocked office
buildings of two major political parties of the Philippines in
Manila Saturday, the last day of the three-month election campaign
period, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a motorcycle-riding man lobbed a grenade which
ripped through the windows of an office building of Laban ng
Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP) (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses) in Makati, Metro Manila, at 01:15.
</P>
<P>
LAMMP is the country's largest opposition party headed by Vice
President Joseph Estrada, a front runner in Monday's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The suspect immediately escaped, police said.
</P>
<P>
The second explosive planted by an unknown suspect went off at
an office building of the ruling Lakas-National Union of Christian
Democrats (Lakas-NUCD) in Pasig, Metro Manila, at 03:00, police
said.
</P>
<P>
No body was hurt in the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
Since January, at least 33 people have been killed in
election-related violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the campaign period for this election was relatively
peaceful compared with the previous ones. In the 1992 elections,
more than 100 people were killed in election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
To prevent more violence in Monday's Election, the government
has deployed thousands of policemen and soldiers at hundreds of
"hot spots," or violence-prone areas, in the capital city of
Manila and other regions.
</P>
<P>
The voters Monday will elect a new president, as well as a new
vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 250 members of the
House of Representatives, and 79 provincial governors and 1,600
mayors.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Jose de Venecia, the ruling party's presidential
candidate, is considered as the main rival of Vice President
Estrada in the race.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Indonesia
on Friday signed a one billion U.S. dollar agreement to finance
exports of U.S. products to Indonesia in an effort to help restore
confidence in the latter's battered economy.
</P>
<P>
James Harmon, chairman of the U.S. Ex-Im Bank, who signed the
export credit agreement with Indonesian Finance Minister Fuad
Bawazier, said it would permit Indonesia to buy raw materials,
spare parts and some agricultural products from the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the agreement to prompt other
industrialized countries to "take the same step so Indonesia
will get an infusion of short-term funding."
</P>
<P>
Bawazier said at an Ex-Im conference that Indonesia would
"stick to the IMF program" and "implement it with all its
consequences."
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to sign a similar one billion dollar export
credit agreement when he goes to Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier said the Indonesian government was determined to
carry out economic reforms that are part of an International
Monetary Fund rescue package.
</P>
<P>
The objective, he said, is to regain the credibility of
international investors, who pulled their money out of Indonesia
last year when its currency collapsed and the economy sank into
its worst crisis in 32 years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Business Conference in Hong Kong, Evidence of World Confidence in Asia  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An international business
conference in Hong Kong did not produce any timetable for the
recovery of the economies hit by the recent financial crisis, but
it did demonstrate continued confidence in Asia by world business
circles.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Annual Corporate Conference of Asia Society, which
concluded Friday, issued a report and stressed that it is
imperative to restore confidence and stability in currency and
financial markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Business and government leaders attending the conference were
optimistic about the recovery of crisis-hit economies and believe
such recovery should begin this year and take "a couple of years"
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
China's chief trade representative and Vice-Minister of Foreign
 Trade and Economic Cooperation Long Yongtu said the fact that
some 800 business people met over the last three days in Hong
Kong showed their confidence and continued interest in Hong Kong
and in China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence is the key to success and we need to build up a
good atmosphere," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held that with the
support and assistance from international agencies and other
countries, a resumption of growth will take place in Asia within
this year though he confessed that it will take another two or may
 be three years for the rate of progress to revert to pre-crisis
dynamic path.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for a South Asian free trade area early in the
next century will further accelerate growth and trade in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region said the financial crisis was "painful" but
the fundamentals in Asia haven't changed.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, entitled "Engines of
Growth? Asia and the Future of World Business," about 800
participants addressed to the financial crisis with the purpose
of seeking a greater understanding of the long-term political,
social and strategic consequences of the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tracing the roots of the crisis to the large inflow of
unregulated and inadequately reported private capital, the
conference participants agreed while Asia has enjoyed prosperity
over the past decades, it needs to go through institutional
reforms in its financial systems and further tap the potentials in
order to achieve continued development.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Society report said the long-term task is to reduce
the risk of crisis in Asia - or anywhere - while enabling the
international system to continue to benefit from the advantages of
an increasingly globalized financial system.
</P>
<P>
Policy changes are not enough. Also needed are basic changes in
institutions, attitudes, and practices, as well as the expertise
to make the new systems effective, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mituo Sato, president of the Asian Development Bank, called for
reforms of the financial system on a broad basis.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Long Yongtu said China, learning lessons from the
crisis, will continue to implement the reforms and opening to the
outside world while carrying out reforms of its financial system
and government institutions and so on, particularly strengthening
the role of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Although a country like Vietnam is not in the center of the
regional financial cyclone, its economy is not immune, said
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem.
</P>
<P>
He said the present conditions demand the Asian countries
"completely abandon the easy-going way of growth, persistently
continue economic reforms and integration, combine domestic
strength with external assistance."
</P>
<P>
According to Pham, the Vietnamese government has set up a
special institution to help provide prompt responses to the rapid
changes and put in a tight financial and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. trade representative Carla Hills said it is most
important to put in place better supervision of the financial
institutions participating in international markets in order to
increase (financial) stability.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Asia, Prime Minister Sharif called on the
Asian countries to cooperate closely to prove equal to the
challenges of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the greatest potential for business lies in
exploiting the complementarities of energy-rich Central Asia and
rapidly industrializing South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The way China has responded to the crisis was commended at the
conference. Prime Minister Sharif said China "took a bold
decision" during the economic downturn not to devalue its currency
thereby helping stabilize the economies of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong business circles expressed the belief that the city,
which Chief Executive Tung commented has passed the test of the
crisis, will maintain its status as an entrepot in the coming
years.

<HEADLINE> 9 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops kept shelling south
Lebanon since Friday morning, wounding nine Lebanese civilians,
Lebanon's Voice of the People Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The nine, including children and women, were wounded when
Israeli artillery pounded the villages of al Mansuri, Laglil and
Yatir, north of the western sector of the Israeli occupied zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The shelling, which also destroyed some villagers' homes and
cars, then spread to the villages of the central and eastern
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery fire came as a retaliation for early
attacks launched by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hours before, Hezbollah fighters set off a bomb planted in the
home of a senior officer of Israel's ally South Lebanese Army
(SLA) inside the SLA-controlled Jezzine, just north of the Israeli
occupied zone. The officer was instantly killed by the bomb
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah staged a similar attack on an armed Israeli patrol
who were passing by a village in the western sector of the
enclave. But there has been no report of casualties from the
roadside bomb.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war trying to dislodge the
2,000-strong Israeli occupying forces and SLA from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks

<HEADLINE> Profile: Ramos's Choice in Philippine Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia is the presidential bet picked by
President Fidel Ramos for the Philippines' ruling Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) party in the May 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
Although having lagged far behind the main opposition candidate
Vice President Joseph Estrada in many opinion polls, the
62-year-old veteran politician has not been discounted by his
rivals and many pundits.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who has been campaigning madly for De Venecia, on
Saturday even predicted a landslide victory for his endorsed
successor because of the ruling party's powerful political
machine.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia gained Ramos' support late last year after beating a
number of other contenders, including former defense secretary
Renato de Villa who later bolted the Lakas-NUCD to make his own
bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of Ramos alone, who remains a popular figure in
the country, is expected to bring one to two million extra votes
for De Venecia, which may make a lot of difference in a tight
race.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide grassroots organizations of the ruling party is
another advantage of the House speaker, which none of his nine
opponents, including Estrada of the LAMMP (Fight of Patriotic
Filipino Masses), can match.
</P>
<P>
The Lakas-NUCD was merely a paper organization when it was
founded by De Venecia and Ramos for the 1992 presidential ballots.
But after six years of expansion, it is currently the country's
largest political party with an estimated membership of 6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
As secretary general of the Lakas-NUCD, De Venecia is credited
with increasing the party's strength and has a broad following
within the party.
</P>
<P>
Being speaker of the lower house for six years, De Venecia also
has the support of many congressmen, governors and local
officials.
</P>
<P>
By making the Lakas-NUCD the majority party in the lower house,
De Venecia takes much credit for pushing through the Ramos
administration's economic reform measures.
</P>
<P>
A veteran politician, he is well known for his considerable
skills in negotiating and in consensus-and coalition-building.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, De Venecia is widely seen as a
"trapo" (Filipino parlance for the traditional politician) who is
good at backroom deals and has no ideals or interests other than
staying in power. His "trapo" image is the main cause of his low
popularity.
</P>
<P>
In his platform, De Venecia vows to complete the Ramos
administration's economic reforms and lead the country to full
modernization.
</P>
<P>
But the business community dislike him and doubt his ability to
run balanced budgets.
</P>
<P>
In the latest poll conducted by the highly reliable polling
group, the Social Weather Station (SWS), De Venecia came in second
place with a 15-percent support rating, the best showing for him
since January.
</P>
<P>
Estrada retained his commanding lead with 33 percent.

WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. DC-9 passenger plane
landed safely on Friday after hail cracked its cockpit window and
wind ripped off its nose cone.
</P>
<P>
In the air accident, the pilot could not know the flying
speed and difficult to see what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
Passengers and luggage tumbled about the cabin, and the jet
suddenly dropped more than 300 meters, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
AirTran Airlines Flight 426 was flying from Atlanta to Chicago
around 7:30 p.m. Thursday with 82 passengers and five crew members
when it hit bad weather in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
When the plane was flying above 6000 meters in a severe
thunderstorm the windshield suddenly cracked and the instruments
went haywire, apparently after the nose cone was damaged.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers directed the pilot to land the plane
on target. No one was seriously hurt, but two people were
hospitalized with minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Launch Remote Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- To make up the lack of schools, the
Angolan Ministry of Education decided to launch remote education
program to 18 provinces through its national radio station system.
</P>
<P>
Manuela Pinto, Co-odinator for the remote education program,
said here Friday that preparation is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
When all the necessary equipment, including television set,
computer, Video player are ready, students in the 18 provinces
could expect to receive education programs through the central
People's Radio Station, Pinto said.
</P>
<P>
The Eduardo dos Santos Fund, named after the president is to
offer financial help to 18 provinces, with each of which
needs at least 50,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said that some teachers have volunteered to work for the
program, though more are still needed.
</P>
<P>
Special training is to be given to the well-selected teachers
for the program so that they could master techniques for the
special education program.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the remote education program is to have more
people accessible to education in the country where the prolonged
civil war has destroyed many schools and kept many school-age
children out of schools, Pinto said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the remote education program, still in its
pioneering stage, is also conducive to the national reconciliation
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Outgoing Philippine President Fidel Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Fifty days after the May 11 elections
this year, Fidel Ramos will complete his six-year term as the 8th
president of the Republic of the Philippines after the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Ramos, who is constitutionally barred from
seeking a second term, will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
A career armyman, Ramos served successively as deputy chief of
the Armed Forces, chief of staff, director-general of the Police
and Secretary of National Defense in the 1980s' before succeeding
Corazon Aquino as president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ramos held the political spotlight when he and Defense
Secretary Juan Enrile rebelled against Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
An ensuing popular revolt forced Marcos, who had ruled the country
for more than 20 years, to flee to Hawaii, the United States, and
he died there three years later.
</P>
<P>
During the Aquino administration, Ramos' forces foiled seven
coups d'etat against the government. In the 1992 elections, he won
the presidency with 23.6 percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
On assuming power, Ramos gave priority to the restoration of
peace and order by persuading many mutinous right-wing soldiers,
communist rebels and Muslim separatists to abandon their armed
struggles.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Moro National Liberation Front, the largest
Muslim rebel group, signed a peace pact with the government in
1996 after 24 years of war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government negotiators started talks with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front.
Although little progress has been made so far at the talks, the
two "comparatively small" rebel groups no longer pose serious
threats to the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
Born in Central Luzon, the northern Philippines, Ramos attended
National University of Manila and the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, and acquired a master's degree at University of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Economic development was another main thrust of the Ramos
administration. In the past six years, the government has
implemented a series of economic reforms, including the
deregulation of foreign exchange, the entry of 10 foreign banks
and the privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, the economy, which was stagnant after
years of political turmoil and natural disasters, recovered in
1993 and grew by 5.1 percent in 1994. In 1996, it culminated with
a growth rate of 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing the economic gains and the successful hosting of the
fourth informal leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in 1996, supporters said Ramos should be allowed
a second term. They launched several campaigns trying to erase the
six-year single term limit in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ramos allegedly supported these drives, but under mounting
pressure from the masses and the Church, last September, he gave
up seeking a second term and anointed House Speaker Jose de
Venecia as the presidential candidate of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos government may take some credit for reviving the
economy, but it has also left behind hosts of problems unsolved,
including rampant crimes, massive poverty and a high employment
rate. One out of three people in the Philippines is living in
poverty and 10 percent of the Filipinos remain jobless. Kidnapping
cases are also widespread in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the financial crisis sweeping Southeast Asia
last July, the peso has depreciated about a third of its value,
and the economy is slowing down and is expected to slide further
this year. All these are also becoming part of the legacy of the
Ramos government.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Front Runner in Philippine Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada, a long-retired action movie star, is widely seen as an
odds-on contender in the Philippines' May 11 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the standard-bearer of the main opposition LAMMP
(Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) party, has held an impressive
lead in various public opinion polls since January.
</P>
<P>
But the highly popular Estrada, who turned 61 last month, is
also the most controversial one of the 11 presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who made a household name in the 1960s for playing
Robin Hood-style heroes fighting for the poor, has a broad
following among the country's middle-lower classes which account
for two-thirds of its 70 million population.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his popularity among the ordinary masses, Estrada has
never lost a single election since 1973 when he entered politics
and was elected mayor of San Juan, Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's popularity also enabled him to become a member of the
Senate in 1989 and, six years later, guaranteed his landslide
victory in the 1992 vice-presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has his own explanation of his mass support.
</P>
<P>
"As a movie star, I played the roles of poor people: a jeepney
(a kind of mini bus) driver, slum dweller, a farmer. It is the
poor who watch my movies and they identify with me," he said.
"That really has changed me, and my heart and soul has been with
the poor."
</P>
<P>
Campaigning on a populist pro-poor platform, the stout and
mustached former movie star, who usually wears blue jeans and a
sleeveless T-shirt, is trying to make himself "a real savior" for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has promised that an Estrada presidency will reduce
drastically the 35-percent national poverty rate, give priority to
agriculture and food security, and restore peace and order in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada, who dropped out of college for the movie
circle, was repugnant to the business community, the
intellectuals, and the country's influential Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
The business community have doubted Estrada's intelligence and
ability to govern the country which is still suffering from the
effects of the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
His rivals have long accused him of having a series of "vices",
which include heavy drinking, womanizing and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the influential Roman Catholic Church have also
suggested that the ex-movie star is not morally fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
Estrada admitted to drinking, womanizing and gambling, but
insisted these "vices" are all flings in the past.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also admitted he is an ignoramus in economics. But he
asked the business circle not to worry an Estrada presidency since
his running mate Senator Angara Edgardo is a lawyer and a
recognized economist.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to continue Ramos' economic reforms which have
turned the Philippines into "an emerging tiger."
</P>
<P>
But all these attacks did not make any detraction on Estrada's
popularity among the ordinary masses who account for more than
two-thirds of the country's 70 million population.
</P>
<P>
In a May opinion poll conducted by the country's most respected
polling group, the Social Weather Station (SWS), Estrada
strengthened his massive lead with a 33-percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia of the
ruling party trailed him far behind with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the massive and stalwart support from the masses, the
former movie heartthrob may be again unbeatable.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Mudslides Toll Rises, Emergency State Declared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll caused by mudslides in
southern Italy rose to 101 on Friday, and the government declared
a state of emergency to speed up relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 101 dead, including 80 in the town of Sarno, which
was worst hit by the mudslides earlier this week after two days of
incessant rain, there are still a number of people missing.
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated 1,570 were made homeless in the disaster,
considered one of the worst in Italy for years, but said they
would stop issuing numbers of missing until the situation cleared
up.
</P>
<P>
The consideration, the Italian news agency ANSA reported, was
that a number of people who were first believed missing later
returned home while efforts to search for survivors were underway.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the government declared a state of emergency in
three provinces and set aside 50 billion lire (about 30 million
U.S. dollars) to aid initial relief and reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
"All the money needed will be provided," Public Works Minister
Paolo Costa said after an emergency cabinet meeting that created a
disaster committee of six ministers to propose relief measures.
</P>
<P>
In the stricken areas, the mudslides destroyed houses, stripped
buildings of their contents and buried whole families, and left
streets and squares looking like wasteland.
</P>
<P>
A man was pulled alive from rubble on Friday after being buried
up to his neck for three days. He seems to be in good condition
but "is in shock and is dehydrated," an official was quoted as
saying at the hospital where the man was recovering.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Eduction on Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese provincial and urban
authorities and the mass media have joined hands to publicize
knowledge on how to become a wise consumer.
</P>
<P>
They tell people that as consumers, they have legitimate rights
in terms of the relationship between consumers and the soceity,
and in the relationship between consumers and the environment, it
is their due duty to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Related courses have been opened in some primary and middle
schools and enterprises throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, such a program is aimed at educating
people to live a "rational" life, fight shoddy and fake goods and
guarantee the smooth operation of commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
A series of programs including the establishment of
associations for protecting consumers' legitimate rights,
publicity of law on consumption and inspection of commodity
quality have been launched to promote the efforts in educating
people to become wise consumers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, great attention has been paid to the consumption
education in rural areas. In east China's Shandong Province,
Ruxian County has opened a night school on consumption.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that more efforts are being made to educate people
to upgrade living quality and establish a good consumption concept.
</P>
<P>
Yin Shijie, a famous Chinese economist on consumption, said
that "consumption activity is an important part of a person's
overall quality and has an important bearing on his growth and
development, as well as on social civilization and progress."
</P>
<P>
It is learned that, Dafeng County, east China's Jiangsu
Province, started consumption education in 1990. Taking in
consideration of the fact that China has a big population and
limited arable land, the county urged people to spend money just
in accordance with their urgent need and to reduce harm to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta, which enjoys developed education on
consumption, becomes an example in maintaining balance between
economic development and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that the Chinese people are spending much
money on various services and culture-related
activities. Statistics show that in 1996, there were 640 million
people travelling across the country and 50 million more
travelling abroad. The total output value in this regard exceeded
10 billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai scientists have developed
pharmaceutical combination that can prevent shrimp diseases and
raise shrimp immunity.
</P>
<P>
Trial use in shrimp farms in coastal provinces of Guangdong,
Fujian, Zhejiang and Shandong indicated that the pharmaceutical
combination can help raise shrimp output four to five times per
hectare of water surface.
</P>
<P>
Produced by the Ningbo Fast Biological Products Corporation,
the pharaceutical is China's first of the kind with state approval
for production.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical was developed by scientists at the
biochemical department of Shanghai-based Fudan University on the
theory of genetic virology and traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical extracts anti-shrimp-virus protein from
traditional herbal medicine and is easy to be absorbed by shrimps.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 130,000 hectares of shrimp farms. The
juvenile shrimp can easily contract virus that has no
cure.

<P>
Executive: The head of state and commander-in-chief of the
armed forces is the President, who is elected by direct popular
vote for a single term of six years. The President appoints a
cabinet subject to approval by the Commission of Appointments,
which is derived from both chambers of Congress. The President may
declare martial law in a national emergency but the Congress is
empowered to revoke such an order at any time. The Vice President

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Indignation Over Japanese Movie Whitewashing Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China felt shocked and indignant
over the fact that some people in Japan produced a movie to
whitewash agression and sing the praises of Hideki Tojo, the top
war criminal of the Second World War, a spokesman for the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao made these remarks when answering a question with
regard to the stand of the Chinese side on the fact that a
Japanese movie named "Pride, an Instant in a Lifetime" was
premiered yesterday and that the movie tries to whitewash Hideki
Tojo and the history of the Japanese aggression against China, and
cover up the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said: It is known to all that during the Second World War,
the war of aggression waged by the Japanese militarists inflicted
great sufferings upon Asian countries that were victimized,
including China. The crimes committed by the Japanese troops are
proved by a mass of iron-clad and irrefutable evidence, and a just
verdict was reached by the international community long
ago. Hideki Tojo was the chief criminal of that war of
aggression. We felt shocked and indignant over the fact that some
people in Japan produced such a movie to whitewash aggression and
sing the praises of Hideki Tojo. Such an act is bound to be
strongly condemned by the people who face up to the history and
love peace, including the Japanese people.

<HEADLINE> Banks in Indonesia Raise Deposit Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Almost all banks in Indonesia are
being forced to raise their deposit interest rates for fear of
being abandoned by customers in the wake of the government's move
to increase Bank Indonesia Certificate (SBI).
</P>
<P>
According to banking analysts, the average rate at sound banks
is 60 percent, or below the maximum allowable deposit interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
Most of the commercial banks have raised interest rates to as
high as 62.5 percent per annum for one month deposit.
</P>
<P>
However, those unhealthy banks put under the Indonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency's (IBRA) close supervision are inclined to
offer higher rates. Some banks have set their one-month interest
rate at 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, the
maximum allowable rate is 125 percent above the current SBI. Bank
Indonesia set its one-month SBI at 58 percent on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Governor Sjahril Sabirin said earlier that the bank has raised
rates which it offers to commercial banks for deposits to support
the national currency rupiah and because of expectations of "high
inflation".
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia had managed to absorb a total of 27.5 trillion
rupiah (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) by issuing SBIs as of April 30,
a BI director said.
</P>
<P>
The SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by
the central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the rupiah, which has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in the past ten
months, dropped again Thursday to 9,400/10,000 per dollar from
7,500/8,000 per dollar a few days ago following increasing
demonstrations staged by students in the country's big cities.

<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that in Chinese
cities, women are doing more household chores.
</P>
<P>
The survey disclosed that in urban households, it is mainly
women who are responsible for buying food and daily
necessities. In Beijing, the Chinese capital, 60 percent of local
women are engaged in such matters. There were only 20 percent of
local males doing so.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey pointed out that it is males who decide on
buying durable goods such as TV sets, refrigerators and washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing some 60 percent of local males make such
decisions. Similar situation also exists in Shanghai, east China.
</P>
<P>
The survey analyzed that the reason is that most urban
households depend on the income of males. Taking Beijing for
example, 70 percent of the income of local households come from
male members.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Croatian Leader to Abolish Separatist Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton has asked
Bosnia's Croatian leader Kresimir Zubak to abolish all his
separatist programs and disband all separatist institutions
established during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
He made the request Friday in a letter to Zubak, who is one of
the three members of the Bosnian presidency and leader of the
minority Croatians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed "grave concern" over the situation in Bosnia,
said a communique issued by Zubak's office.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said that what worried him most was the
refusal of the Croatian leaders to reorganize the police force and
to take measures to allow the refugees to return to their home
towns which are under Croatian control.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the return of refugees is now the top priority in
strengthening the federation of Muslims and Croatians, Clinton
said his country is determined to support that effort.
</P>
<P>
He demanded an immediate end to all violence and unrest caused
by the return of refugees and warned Zubak of serious consequences
if conflicts continue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also asked the Muslim sides to respect the rights
division among the federal partners, and asked all Bosnian leaders
to make efforts to fulfill the Dayton Agreement, which ended the
civil war in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Draft Aims at Helping Laid-offs in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry of Thailand has initiated a draft amendment bill to
extend the social security scheme to cover laid-off workers, the
Bangkok Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the extended coverage taking effect at the
termination of a worker's employment contract is to last for at
least six months but not exceeding one year.
</P>
<P>
The bill is aimed at assisting an increasing number of workers
who were made redundant by the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number of unemployed people may reach
two million by the end of this year. Some individuals and groups
criticized the government for paying little attention to the agony
of the unemployed and the poor and doing little to alleviate the
social impact of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
A ministry source said the bill, designed to amend a relevant
section of the Social Security Act, is to go before the Cabinet
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the proposed amendment, workers will be entitled to full
compensation and benefits in such cases as injuries, sickness,
maternity assistance and death.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cabinet Secretary-General's Office expressed
concern that the extended coverage might further deplete the
social security fund since the size of employees' contributions
has decreased sharply.
</P>
<P>
The office suggested the fund be spent prudently otherwise
government subsidization would be necessary once the fund ran out
of cash.
</P>
<P>
This would adversely affect the state's financial standing, the
office warned.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Austria for Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia and the rights of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo should
both be taken into consideration in solving the Kosovo crisis,
Romanian defense chief said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his visiting Austrian counterpart Werner
Fasslabend, Romanian Defense Minister Victor Babiuc said Kosovo is
an integral part of Serbia, a republic of the federal Yugoslavia,
"but parties concerned can discuss the autonomy of the province."
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo, have been seeking independence from
Yugoslavia since 1981 when a group of separatists attacked the
local government.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, The Serbian government abolished the autonomous status
of Kosovo after local parliamentarians attempted to pass a
resolution on the independence of the province.
</P>
<P>
Tensions were heightened this year as clashes between local
Serbian police and ethnic Albanian separatists escalated.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend said Kosovo was on the brink of a war and other
European countries must take firm action to avert further
aggravation of the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that the Kosovo problem should be
solved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend concluded his three-day visit to Romanian on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> No Case of Rabies Discovered in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- No case of rabies has been reported
in the Chinese capital since the local government adopted a
regulation strictly limiting dog-raising three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997, the number of dogs in
the Chinese capital was 85,591, a drop of 6 percent from the
previous year, and the figure presented a 60 percent drop compared
with that before the regulation went into effect on May 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing Daily quoted sources from the local sanitation
and anti-epidemic station as saying that there were some 45,000
people bite by dogs in Beijing annually before the regulation
limiting dog-raising became effective.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 110 local residents died of rabies from
1986 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since dogs are the major sources of rabies, the regulation
stipulates that dog-raisers must have their dogs examined and
receive proper treatment before given certificates for dog-raising
and they must have their dogs registered.
</P>
<P>
Disappearance of rabies is also attributed to the great efforts
made by local sanitation and anti-epidemic departments to prevent
and treat such disease.
</P>
<P>
They have opened training courses to improve local medical
workers' ability to treat dog bites and related diseases, and has
set up 379 medical units for handling such cases.

<HEADLINE> Pelican Endangers Life of 71 Airliner Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A pelican was sucked into a turbine of
a Boeing 737 airplane over the Jorge Chavez International Airport
here Thursday, endangering the life of 71 passengers aboard.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here Friday, the bizarre incident
occurred at 04:40 local time, when the Compania Panamena de
Aviacion (COPA) airliner, bound for Panama, was warming up the
engines in its lift-off run on the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
Half way through the distance necessary to take off and was
about to lift the airplane's nose, the pilot found that "something
hard" was thwarting the normal performance of the left turbine.
</P>
<P>
He immediately decided to abort the lift-off.
</P>
<P>
Later, feathers and bits of a pelican sucked by the turbine and
liquefied by the turbine blades were found. The bird caused the
plane to lose balance, and the pilot was right to end the lift-off.
</P>
<P>
"If the pelican had entered the turbine when the plane was at
the end of the airstrip ... there would have been a serious risk
of a crash," said Ernesto Durand Delgado, COPA traffic chief.
</P>
<P>
As the Jorge Chavez airport is close to the sea, marine birds
like seagulls and pelicans set every morning on the airport ramp,
so a vehicle must crisscross the area to shoo the birds away.
</P>
<P>
However, the driver of the vehicle did not perform his task at
the adequate time in the day that the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
After an examination and cleaning of the turbine, the COPA
airliner flew to Panama, where it arrived three hours late.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Rebels Agree Not to Use Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Olara Otunnu, special representative
 of the United Nation's secretary general on children and armed
conflict, has said that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) has agreed to end the use of children below the age of 18
in combat.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, who is on an official visit to Sri Lanka, met with the
head of the political section of the LTTE in the north Friday and
discussed matters concerning the protection, rights and welfare of
children affected by the ongoing conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday night, he said the LTTE has
also agreed not to recruit children below the age of 17. The U.N.
envoy also said that the LTTE has accepted that a framework to
monitor commitments made by them should be put in place.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu who returned to Colombo from Vavuniya Friday night after
visiting the uncleared parts of the Wanni area occupied by the
rebels said in the release that in talks with senior
representatives of the LTTE, he had expressed grave concern over
continuing attacks on civilian targets in the north, east and
other parts of the country by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Among those he had talks with were the LTTE's political advisor
Anton Balasingham and the head of the political wing Thamil
Selvam. The meeting took place in the region where fighting
continued between government forces and the rebels who are
fighting for a separate state in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu's visit also led the LTTE leadership to agree to the
free movement of refugees, not to obstruct the distribution of
humanitarian supplies and to observe the Convention of the Rights
of the Child.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the LTTE to stop targeting civilian populations
and sites throughout the country.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters were still unable to
control the blaze in Thailand's southernmost province of
Narathiwat when Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai inspected the area
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Bangkok Post said the prime minister conveyed the
king's deep concern over the forest fire to the people in
Narathiwat.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that locals should help one another
prevent such a fire in the future since the current blaze had been
lit by the people who wanted to clear their own land but later
could not control the fire.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 2,200 hectares of mangrove forest have been
destroyed since March.
</P>
<P>
The forest is burning in four areas, with the biggest burning
area lying over 1,800 hectares where firefighters are still unable
to control the blaze.
</P>
<P>
However, fire is almost under control in the other three areas.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, more than 400 people joined forces to fight the fire
on ground. They included firefighters, volunteers, soldiers and
border patrol police.
</P>
<P>
For airborne operation, artificial rain-making missions
conducted eight flights Friday.

MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Passenger car sales in the
Philippines continued to decelerate in April this year, dropping
to only 3,075 units or 51.3 percent compared with the same month
of last year, the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the
Philippines said Saturday.

In the January-April period, the car sales dropped to 14,160
units or 48.1 percent as compared with the previous corresponding
period, the chamber said in a report.
</P>
<P>
It said the continued slowdown in sales was due to the high
financing cost like interest rates, and slow and selective
approval of retail financing applications.
</P>
<P>
The drop is the biggest since the industry suffered a setback
following the peso depreciation last year.

BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is to relax strict measures
on issuing visas for Cambodian passport holders, according to a
report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strict measures were imposed after the fierce battle
between the Cambodian government troops and Prince Norodom
Ranaridh's troops in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul was quoted as
saying that all restrictions would be lifted after elections in
Cambodia set for July 26.

The Thai government will facilitate as much as possible
Cambodian government officials who frequently travel into or via
Thailand, the spokesman said.

<P>
After the July general elections, everything will return to
normal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the decision would give the Thai Embassy in
Cambodia the power to rule on visa applications, rather than
having to refer all decisions to Bangkok.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- "I grow older, my family grows
older, and I have become a member of what they call the 'sandwich
generation'," said Andrew S. Grove, the 61-year-old ruler of the
America's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman and chief executive officer of the world's
largest semiconductor manufacturer, Intel, has spent five days in
China as a "young preacher", busy demonstrating the latest Pentium
chips and advertising the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
Grove was named Time Magazine's "Man of the Year" in December,
1997 for his contribution to promoting knowledge-based economy,
which largely depends on the development of the information
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of PC users worldwide sat in their
comfortable homes and offices yesterday to watch and listen to the
live broadcast of Grove's speech through the Internet, which was
interpreted simultaneously in Chinese and Korean.
</P>
<P>
This was his last activity in China. The program, entitled "An
Inter-Connected World", was initiated to show how personal
computers help people of all backgrounds, nationalities and
languages get in touch through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the best results, Intel used its latest product, the
Pentium (R) II microprocessor, for the broadcast. During a meeting
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin Tuesday, Grove demonstrated the
new technique.
</P>
<P>
He showed the president how a computer equipped with a Pentium
(R) II microprocessor uses speech-recognition and voice-control
systems and other types of digital software.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang congratulated him on his achievements in the
semiconductor and computer industries, and said that he hoped that
Intel would further its co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Grove announced that Intel would spend 50
million US dollars to build a research center in Beijing, which
will explore Internet-related issues and information technology
disciplines, such as speech recognition, that have particular
relevance to Chinese applications.

The China Research Center will become part of Intel's global
2.8 billion-US-dollar research and development commitment in 1998,
which involves about 700 researchers in the United States, Israel,
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
Intel is currently looking worldwide for a director for the
center.
</P>
<P>
"China has a contingent of talented scientists and engineers,
and we think there is a great opportunity to assemble a
world-class team here to do some outstanding research," said Grove.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of Intel's China Research Center is a
far-sighted investment," said Zeng Peiyan, minister of China's
State Development Planning Commission. "It represents a new trend
for foreign investment in China."
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Shanghai Thursday, Grove officially opened
Intel's Shanghai flash memory assembly and test factory, four
months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The 198 million-US-dollar factory, which is Intel's first
production center in China, makes flash memories for PCs, digital
cameras and other consumer electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
"The factory is an important milestone of Intel in China, and
it will become a major manufacturer of flash memories in the
world, catering to the needs of the global market," said
Grove.

Analysts pointed out that Intel's marketing program investment
in China reflects the fact that China is the fastest-growing
market for PCs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Grove said he believed that China will be the world's
third-largest PC market by the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting aspect of the Chinese market is that
there is a spirit of entrepreneurialism as alive as in the United
States," Grove said. "I am amazed to find that people here
instinctively understand business opportunities, and that is why
the computer industry is developing so rapidly in China."
</P>
<P>
Grove also attended a ceremony marking the production of the
millionth computer made by the Legend Group of Beijing, where Zhou
Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress, presented the computer to him as a
gift."I will put this computer in the Intel Museum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that a small company like Legend would become
one of Intel's partners when I came here for a visit four years
ago," said Grove. "But today, Legend's computers with Pentium II
microprocessors are among the best in the world."
</P>
<P>
He invited Chinese and foreign reporters to his room in the
Shangri-la Hotel Tuesday night to watch him make a visual
telephone call to US Vice-President Al Gore. They discussed the
potential of electronic trading through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to China, Grove also invited Chinese computer

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks to Focus on Intermediate Business Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- With the deepening of China's
economic and financial reforms, various intermediate businesses
offered by commercial banks have been well received and all the
banks have listed intermediate businesses as the key in promoting
their business.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the financial sector projected that intermediate
businesses will gradually become a new growth area as well as a
competing arena for the country's commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Banking intermediate businesses refer to financial services
offered by banks when they act as an intermediary in doing
receipt, payment and other commissioning orders on behalf of their
customers.
</P>
<P>
Intermediate business enables banks to fully exploit their
advantages in reputation, technology, information and business
networks to earn non-interest profits.
</P>
<P>
China's banks began to provide intermediate business services
only in the early 1990s, which was very late compared with that of
developed countries. However, it enjoyed fast growth in the past
few years and now it covers such areas as wage commissioning,
utility service fee collection, agent insurance, petty mortgage
loans, credit card and the commissioning of individual foreign
exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
These businesses have great potentials in China. Last year the
commissioned wages through the Industrial and Commercial Bank
exceeded 210 billion yuan, up 36 percent from the previous year;
and commercial banks have so far issued more than 72 million
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that intermediate businesses can help cut money in
circulation and promote the quality of the economy, and it can
also create low-cost fund sources for banks while providing
convenience and benefit for the public.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at present banks' income from intermediate
businesses only make up some eight percent of their total income,
and the intermediate businesses of many banks are far from mature
and fall short of different social demands.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest that commercial banks should establish a
complete management system for intermediate businesses, so as to
improve their competitiveness and profitability. And the central
bank should design policies to guide the development of
intermediate businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have successfully
extracted organic iodine from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs
</P>
<P>
Experts here said it is the first time in the world that
organic iodine is taken from a natural plant.
</P>
<P>
More efficient than inorganic iodine, organic iodine is easier
to be absorbed by human body.
</P>
<P>
Inorganic iodined salt has been widely used in China as a major
way for preventing iodine-deficient diseases. Statistics from the
Ministry of Health show that more than 450 million people are
living in iodine-deficient areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that organic iodine will specially benefit
pregnant women and children who suffer from iodine-deficiency
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Yunnan Industrial Microorganism
Fermentation Lab extracted the organic iodine from a medicinal
herb according to a secret recipe of a doctor of traditional
Chinese medicine that was handed down from his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has passed appraisal of experts in southwest

<HEADLINE> First Quarter Witnesses Sound Sino-US Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
successful US visit last fall injected new vitality into the
development of Sino-US trade, which was proved by the sound growth
of bilateral trade in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months, the trade volume between the two
countries was valued at 11.1 billion US dollars, 17.3 percent more
than in the same period of last year. China's exports and imports
grew by 22 percent and eight percent, respectively, to reach over
7.2 billion and 3.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase rates of these three indices all exceed not only
the growth of China's overall foreign trade, exports and imports
during the first quarter, but also the growth of Sino-US trade in
the corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that, in addition to stable Sino-US
political ties, the great potential and complementarity existing
in bilateral trade are also driving forces behind the two-way
trade.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to the United States include machinery, toys,
furniture, shoes, textile products, medical equipment, leather
products, plastic products and motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
China mainly imports from the US machinery, chemical products,
motor vehicles, optical instruments, textile raw materials, paper
and associated products, and leather.
</P>
<P>
At present, the US is China's second-largest trading partner,
and China is the fourth-largest trading partner of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that US President Bill Clinton's upcoming
China visit, the official initiation of the Sino-US agreement on
the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as well as the progress in two
countries' negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, would further promote the development of the two-way
trade during the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, some controversial issues, such as Most Favored Nation
trading status, trade imbalance between China and the US, the
routing of China's textile products through third countries and
the US's anti-dumping investigation into Chinese products, need to
be solved to bring into full play the potential of bilateral trade
ties.

of the Asian financial crisis since last July.
</P>
<P>
Fujian approved 120 Taiwan-funded enterprises in the first
quarter of this year, with contracted Taiwan investment hitting
139 million US dollars, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Fujian and Taiwan was up 0.7 percent in the first
three months to 520 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that Fujian had approved a total
of 5,164 Taiwan-funded projects by the end of March, with
contracted and paid-in investment from Taiwan reaching 9.76
billion US dollars and 6.08 billion US dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fujian-Taiwan trade has totaled 14.7 billion US
dollars this year, including 13.4 billion US dollars in imports
from Taiwan and 1.3 billion US dollars in exports to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that Taiwan investment has become an important
driving force behind Fujian's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Last year Fujian utilized a total of 4.19 billion US dollars in
overseas investment, up 2.7 percent from the previous
year. However, paid-in investment from Taiwan rocketed 112 percent
to 1.33 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Names 28 Players for World Cup Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South African national soccer
coach Phillipe Troussier Friday announced a squad of 28 players
from which the world cup team will be selected, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
The big squad, which will play Zambia later this month in South
Africa's first international warm-up before the World Cup,
included 17 European-based players.
</P>
<P>
Troussier said he had included more overseas players because of
the competitiveness of the European game.
</P>
<P>
"While those in South Africa have great potential, they did not
really match up to the overseas players, who are ready now," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said with only six weeks to go, he had to choose the most
experienced rather than to take time and train the potential ones.
</P>
<P>
Troussier said unless something extreme happened, he was
unlikely to add any more names to the squad, virtually closing the
door for any other players dreaming of touring France in June.
</P>
<P>
The current 28 would be trimmed to 25 after the Zambian match
on May 22, and would again be cut by three for the final 22 to go
to France, he added.
</P>
<P>
The squad is:
</P>
<P>
Goalkeepers: Andre Arendse, Brian Baloyi, Hans Vonk, Paul Evans
</P>
<P>
Defenders: Lucas Radebe, Mark Fish, David Nyathi, Willem
Jackson, Themba Mnguni, Pierre Issa, Gerald Raphalela
</P>

Midfielders: John Moeti, John Moshoeu, Helman Mkhalele, Marc
Arnold, Brendan Augustine, Quinton Fortune, Alfred Phiri, Doctor
Khumalo, Lebogang Morula, Naughty Mokoena, Eric Tinkler, Delron

<HEADLINE> China To Fully Tap Geothermal Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China is paying big importance to
tapping geothermal energy resources and plans to build a group of
medium-sized geothermal power stations in the southwestern areas
of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the State Development
Planning Commission, these geothermal power stations will be built
in Tibet and the western parts of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces,
respectively, by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The official said the country will give priority to developing
geothermal resources with reservoir temperatures over 200 degrees
centigrade in Yangbajing of Tibet. By 2000, the largest unit
capacity in Yangbajing will reach 10 MWe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country will build power stations with a
capacity of 3-5 MWe in Ruili in the western part of Yunnan
province and explore the geothermal resources in Tengchong of
Yunnan and the western part of Sichuan province by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China has so far discovered 3,000 hot
spring sites, about 2,200 of which record temperatures higher than
25 degrees centigrade. The country has by now developed a total
geothermal power capacity of 28.6 MWe. The high-temperature
resources are distributed mainly in Tibet, Yunnan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China has a long history in
utilizing geothermal energy. However, large-scale exploration
began only twenty years ago, with geothermal energy utilization
totaling about 2,410 MWe.
</P>
<P>
Geothermal energy has been widely used in various sectors of
industry and agriculture, greenhouse and heating, the official
added.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Hotline Provides Timely Advice for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Just as urban dwellers think of the
110 emergency hotline when in trouble, farmers in Laizhou, a city
in Shandong Province, are likely to turn to farming hotline
service for technical help.
</P>
<P>
On duty at the hotline's central desk are five agronomists.
</P>
<P>
When Liu Guozhao, a farmer in Xinhe Village, called the hotline
complaining that the leaves on 80 percent of the cucumbers in his
four greenhouses had turned yellow, a team of four experts on
vegetables, plant preservation, fertilizers and agronomy,
respectively, was despatched for an on-the-spot investigation.
</P>
<P>
The hotline offering round-the-clock service has given
solutions to 70 percent of farmers' problems through direct
telephone conversations since it was opened in August last year.
</P>
<P>
It is gaining an increasing amount of popularity among farmers
in this province as well as in neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianguo called the phone number -- 2211111 -- when he
intended to introduce a peach strain from Japan. After experts
checked a soil sample, they concluded that Wang's fields were not
suitable for growing peaches. He took their advice and planted
pears, grapes and dates instead.
</P>
<P>
With the hotline's assistance, 65 percent of Laizhou's farmers
have grown high-profit fruits on an area of 20,000 ha. The per
capita annual income here has reached 3,216 yuan, nearly 1,000
yuan higher than the province's average.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hotline headquarters has now got access to a
computer information center hooked up to the national web on
agriculture. It also has good relations with major agricultural
institutions and research centers.
</P>
<P>
The hotline has recently extended its services to broadcast
precautionary measures as regards common problems and questions
concerning seasonal farming through television programs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Drops to 28-year Low of 4.3 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- This country's unemployment rate
fell to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in April, as the robust U.S.
economy created 262,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate
indicated that as the U.S. economy remains a strong growth which
was likely to put pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider
raising interest rates to prevent inflation from re-igniting.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believed that as the hourly earnings in the new
report are 4.4 percent higher than a year ago, a level would cause
concern at the central bank about wage pressures. Today's report
showed that average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to a record high
of 12.67 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 262,000 increase in payroll jobs was
in part a bounceback from a drop of 24,000 jobs in March. The
decline, which had been the first in more than two years, had been
blamed on weather factors.
</P>
<P>
El Nino had given the country unseasonably warm weather in
January and February and moved up the hiring of construction
workers, while an unusually wet mild and wet March cut into hiring
at service industries.
</P>
<P>
For April, construction added 35,000 jobs following the March
decline of 85,000 jobs and retail employment was up 44,000, with
most of that gain coming at restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
In all, service industries increased 139,000 jobs with much of
the gain coming at temporary help firms, indicating that
businesses faced with a shrinking poll of workers are turning more
and more to temporary help firms to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
Although the current economic crisis in Asia brings impact to
the U.S. export and some sectors, the Fed had been hoping that the
crisis would slow the economy enough this year that it would not
have to raise interest rates. But so far, only manufacturing is
showing any adverse effects from Asia.
</P>
<P>
In April, manufacturing employment declined by 10,000 jobs, its
third straight month of weakness. Since January, factories have
shed 16,000 jobs. The April job losses were concentrated at plants
making electronic goods and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate was the
biggest single-month change since an identical decrease in May
1994. The unemployment rate of 4.3 percent is the best showing
since a 4.2 percent rate in February 1970.

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge 1.25 Billion Dollars for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The international Brussels donor
conference, which concluded Friday, pledged a total of 1.25 billion
U.S. dollars for Bosnia-Herzegovina's reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
The total was more than the expected from the two-day
conference jointly held by the European Commission and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the fourth of its kind for war-ravaged Bosnia
and with a participation of 48 countries and 30 organizations,
anticipated a commitment of one billion to 1.1 billion dollars
from donors.
</P>
<P>
The sum will be used to support economic reforms and the
reconstruction program in Bosnia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The donors welcomed the improved political situation in Bosnia
and emphasized the continued need for full implementation of the
Dayton Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed a strong commitment to assisting programs
which facilitate the return of refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
In late October 1995, immediately after the ceasefire and
before the signing of the Dayton Agreement, a joint mission of the
European Commission, the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
United States Agency for International Development visited Bosnia
and identified priority reconstruction financing needs of 5.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission and the World Bank called the first
donor conference in November 1995. The previous three donor
conferences raised a total of 3.26 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Doctors Face Clinical Performance Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Medical Association (BMA)
has taken the initiative to draw up a set of new professional
standards to be used to measure UK doctors' clinical performance,
according to a national newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper reported that the aim of the move is
to strengthen self-regulation of the medical profession to avoid
cases coming before the General Medical Council (GMC) in which
doctors' clinical competence is called into question.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it is intended to be supportive rather
than punitive as pressure has been growing on the profession to
see that incompetent doctors are spotted and brought up to
scratch.
</P>
<P>
"We recognized we had to make explicit out commitment to
ensuring doctors were fit for the job. But it has to be a
supportive mechanism that complements the punitive role of the
GMC," said Sandy Macara, chairman of the BMA.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the work on developing the system has been
taken over by the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges. And hospital
specialties are being asked to supply outcome measures against
which the performance of individual doctors can be assessed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, similar moves are under way to monitor the work of
family doctors.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Prominent Jewish leaders said Thursday that anger over U.S.
pressure on Israel this week has not seriously undermined support

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- When the American special Middle East envoy arrives in
Israel Friday for last-minute talks before a Monday deadline, a
central issue will be how some of the West Bank land at issue may
be redefined to ease Israel's security concern.
</P>

-- Secretary General Kofi Annan came to Rwanda on what was to
be "a healing mission" and acknowledged in a speech to Parliament
that the United Nations had done too little to stop the 1994
massacres of Tutsi civilians.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Set World Record on Deep-Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A collaborative research
program launched Friday, Deepmine, will set a world gold mining
record when it begins mining at depths between 3,000 meters and
5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Deepmine project manager Ray Durrheim told a press conference
here that mining companies worldwide are presently mining at
depths of about 2,500 meters although evidence showed there are
equal quantities of gold reserves below these depths.
</P>
<P>
The cost of deep-level mining, the safety of workers and time
lost in transporting workers to these depths had prevented mining
companies from attempting to mine at these levels, Durrheim said.
</P>
<P>
However, Durrheim said, deep-level mining could create new job
opportunities in the mining sector, extend the life of the
industry and earn foreign exchange for the South African economy.
</P>
<P>
The Deepmine program looks at sinking a single shaft to the
mining area, rather than creating different levels.
</P>
<P>
The program was conceived two years ago by Miningtek, the
mining technology division of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research and Wits University to address the technical
and human challenges of deep-level mining.
</P>
<P>
South African departments of mineral and energy and of trade
and industry, the Chamber of Mines, and mining giants like
Anglogold and Gold Fields are involved in the program.
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of Deepmine is to acquire knowledge and
develop appropriate technology to enable safe, efficient and
profitable ultra deep-level mining to take place, as well as to
increase the general level of competence in this field," Durrheim
said.
</P>
<P>
Miningtek Director Guner Gurtunca said that apart from the
technical research, the program would look at the effect of
deep-level mining on workers.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely hot at those levels, and we need to see how
workers can cope with traveling up lift shafts at great speed,
for example."
</P>
<P>
An ideal situation will be to reduce the number of people
working underground eventually, said Gurtunca.
</P>
<P>
"We would rather deploy them above the ground, assembling
mining equipment or working mining machinery from air-conditioned
offices," he said, adding that safety would become less of a
concern.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Shares Keep Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Shares on the Zimbabwean Stock
Market, the second largest in Africa, closed the week soft on
Friday with industrial and financial stocks leading the rally in
the falls as the market awaits concrete macro-economic measures
to prop it up.
</P>
<P>
The key industrial index lost a massive 242 points to close at
an all year low of 6,837 with the frenzied sell-off in financial
stocks still haunting the market already battered by a skewed
macro-economic environment, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The index has lost 9.5 percent this week alone.
</P>
<P>
There was no trade in minings shares and the index remained
pegged at 423.
</P>
<P>
In its daily commentary, stockbroking firm Quincor James Capel
said losses continued to outweigh gains and only export-oriented
counters seem to be holding out, presenting a hedge against the

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Social Affairs and Labor
Minister Eli Yisahi decided on Friday to set up an inquiry
committee to investigate the serious construction accident in
western Israel, during which nine people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the accident took place in a power
station in the coastal city of Ashklon, west of Israel earlier
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nine building workers fell down to death when the scaffolding
around an air shaft collapsed suddenly. Several others are still
trapped in the 215-meter-high air shaft of the power station.
</P>
<P>
A rescue attempt is underway and the air rescue unit of Israeli
Air Force has sent a helicopter to the site to help extract the
entrapped men.
</P>
<P>
Most of workers involved are foreigners, employed by an
American company building the power station.
</P>
<P>
The workers were apparently inside the shaft, working at
different heights, when the scaffolding began to fall.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the accident still remained unclear.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Fund to be set for financing farming works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides to Uganda Emergency Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank decided to provide
27.6 million U.S.Dollars as emergency assistance for road repairs
in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued here Friday, the money is
earmarked for repairing and rehabilitating roads and bridges
damaged and destroyed by torrential rains and flooding associated
with the El-Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The fund will help restore 350 kilometers of roads and repair
or rebuild 30 bridges across the country.
</P>
<P>
The release said that since late last year, Uganda's rapid
economic growth has been compromised by extreme weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The severe drought in the west and torrential rains in the
east had had disastrous effect on the country's agricultural
sector, which accounts for nearly half of Uganda's gross domestic
product and employs more than 80 percent of the total work force.
</P>
<P>
Flooding washed away roads and bridges and isolated rural
areas, causing acute food shortages, surging inflation and
numerous health hazards including the outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth El-Nino emergency assistance financed by the
World Bank and the first in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Pepsico Charges Coca-Cola of Pressuring Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Pepsico Inc., the second largest
beverage producer in the U.S., sued the Coca-Cola Company
Thursday, accusing its unfairly controlling the beverages served
by restaurants and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that now restaurant chains,
sports arenas, movie theaters and other businesses are selling
Coca-Cola by the cup, rather than by the can or bottle. Coke has
about two-thirds of the market, versus about 22 percent for Pepsi.
The entire fountain business accounted for some 22 percent of the
9.6 billion cases of soda sold in the United States last year, and
has been the fastest growing part of the soft-drink industry over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Pepsico's lawsuit, filed here in New York, contended that Coke,
inviolation of the Sherman Anti-trust Act, unfairly pressured
independent food-service distributors, who supply the majority of
the fountain business, to carry only Coke products by threatening
to cut off their supply if they provided Pepsi to any of their
clients.
</P>
<P>
But a Coke spokesman indicated that Pepsi should compete on the
marketplace rather than in the courts.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi contends that as it slowly began to build more clients in
the fountain business last year, Coke aggressively tried to
curtail its competitor.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks to force Coca-Cola to halt all such
monopolistic practices and asks for an unspecified amount in
damages, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that the legal battle highlights how
important the fountain business has become for both giants.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts saw the lawsuit as part of Pepsi's effort to
assert itself in a part of the soft-drink business where it had
fallen well behind Coke.

<HEADLINE> All Countries Should Learn Lessons From Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) - British Financial Secretary Gordon
Brown said Friday "great openness and transparency" were the
lessons all countries should learn from Asian crises to avert
future financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference, Brown said: "In
Asia it is absolutely clear that if information had been provided
earlier then some of the excessive market corrections which came
later could have been avoided."
</P>
<P>
Having just come back from a shuttle tour of South Korea,
Malaysia and Indonesia and preparing to chair a two-day meeting of
G8 finance ministers, Brown said good governance and a steady
flow of economic information were the building blocks for stable
growth.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries have been hit by a financial crisis that
has sent currencies plunging and forced many banks and firms into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary said he would propose tougher powers for the IMF
at this weekend's meeting and closer co-ordination between the
Fund and the World Bank in monitoring the global financial market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF should be given the right to show "yellow cards" to
point the finger at any countries that take its money but
persistently ignore its reform proposals, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to social problems caused by the Asian crisis, Brown
pledged to discuss with World Bank President James Wolfensohn how
the Bank and the IMF could alleviate the lot of the poor and the
unemployed, who were the hardest hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
G8 finance and foreign ministers from the US, Japan, Germany,
Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Russia are meeting to prepare
next week's G8 summit in Birmingham, Britain.

UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations has agreed to lift the travel ban on Iraq, UN
spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said on Friday.
</P>

Butler said in a letter presented to the Security Council on

unrestricted access to the sites it wants to verify, including the
eight presidential sites, since the Memorandum of Understanding
was reached between the UN chief and Iraqi Government in February
1997.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Legalizes Homosexual Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A South African high court Friday
declared laws criminalizing homosexual conduct to be unconstitutional,
effectively legalizing gay and lesbian sex.
</P>
<P>
The judgment of the Johannesburg High Court said that it is time
to recognize "the dignity and innate worth of every member of
society".
</P>
<P>
The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and the South
African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) jointly applied to the
high court late last year to have the laws overturned and welcomed the
ruling, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"The manner in which individuals choose naturally to share their
most intimate expressions of affection will no longer by of interest
to the law," the gay rights group said, adding that the judgment was a
sombre indictment of South Africa's intolerant colonial past.
</P>
<P>
The human rights commission said the decision would enhance the
equality clause in the constitution and it hoped that public attitude
to homosexuals would change after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) also welcomed the
judgment, saying it represented a significant milestone in the
alignment of South Africa's laws with the basic human rights contained
in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"It stands as a challenge to all South Africans to tackle the
prejudices and misconceptions which enabled such legislation to exist
intact for so many years," a ANC spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Maneuvers of Unidentified Troops Found in Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations observer mission
in Luanda said in a statement Friday that there are maneuvers of
"unidentified troops" in four provinces of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that there are movements of unidentified
troops in six districts of the northeastern province of Lunda-Sul
and in two districts of the northern Malanje Province.
</P>
<P>
"Same troops" have been found maneuvering in coastal province
of Benguela and the southern province of Huilla, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.N. observer mission has deployed additional
troops in these districts in a bid to ease the tension there.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission said that it has enjoyed cooperation from the
Angolan government and the former rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), who signed the Lusaka Peace
Protocol in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observers confirmed that the remnants of UNITA troops
attacked Casseque Town in Benguela Province last Saturday,
killing seven police officers including the commander of the
national police based in the town, two Angolan government army
soldiers and three local residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chief of Staff of Angolan Army, Luis Facira,
who was attending a meeting held in Portugal's capital city of
Lisbon, told Portuguese reporters that some districts had been
attacked by UNITA troops.
</P>
<P>
The attackers were in new-style uniforms and armed with
advanced weapons, Facira said, adding that UNITA got lots of new
military equipments and uniforms in the years after the peace
accord was signed in Lusaka in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that these materiels had been transferred from South
Africa via Botswana and Zambia to the bases of UNITA, especially
Andulo, the UNITA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Facira said the Angolan government knew that UNITA
still has "well-organized and well-equipped" troops.
</P>
<P>
He decribed as "intolerable" the continuous military
operations of the remnants of UNITA troops, which the
organization said, are uncontrollable.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 75,000 people have been
evacuated in Paraguay as a result of serious floods caused by
torrential rains due to the El Nino phenomenon in several
provinces in the country, a UN agency said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in the Chaco region, the overflowing
of the Parana River caused floods which have now spread to the
southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The most critical situation is in the city of Pilar, Neembuch
Province, where the river's level had reached eight meters, said
OCHA, adding that this level is expected to rise further as the
rains continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
OCHA said emergency relief requirements for the affected people
include zinc and plastic sheeting, food supplies, family tents,
wooden straps, plywood, clothing, mattresses, blankets, pneumatic
boats, generators and medicines.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Banks, Customers Dispute over Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks and their customers
in Sierra Leone have gone to a local court for the settlement of
disputes over the payment of savings interest and other bank
charges.
</P>
<P>
The banks, including the big-name Barclays and Standard
Chartered, resumed business in March after a suspension of about
10 months following last May's military coup that ousted the
legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Now the customers are expecting the payment of their interest
which mounted during the 10-month period at the rate before the
coup. But the banks only want to pay it at the current interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
According to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here, some angry customers claimed the request of the
banks are unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
One customer was quoted as saying that "it is more than anger.
It needs genuine concern because what happens in Sierra Leone
demands great sacrifices which the banks are built to recognize."
</P>
<P>
Now the Sierra Leone Association of Commercial Banks is
looking into the matter with a view to making compromises to
their customers, according to a bank manager.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known when and how the court give its verdict on
the matter.

<HEADLINE> Somalia: 23 Killed in Faction Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 people have been
killed and more than 30 others wounded when heavily-armed faction
clashes erupted again Friday in Somalia's southern port town of
Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out between forces loyal to the Majerten
warlord, General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan, and those of the
Marehan militiamen.
</P>
<P>
According to information reaching here earlier, the fighting
began Friday morning at Gobwein village, 15 km north of Kismayu,
where the rival militiamen from the two sides have been in
defensive positions since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The renewed clashes came after the militiamen from the Marehan
sub-clan tried to storm into the town from where they were kicked
out last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources told Xinhua that the Majerten-dominated militiamen
were defeated and pushed back into the town in the early hours of
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
However, in a bitter street fighting inside Kismayu, the
Marehans were again forcefully driven out toward their
headquarters in Gobwein village, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the fighting is still going on outside
Kismayu and the atmosphere in the town is very tense with people
uncertain about their future.
</P>
<P>
All shops and markets were closed down again as a result of
the clashes and many of the business communities have fled with
their goods to the neighboring village of Dhobley, a stronghold
of the Ogaden sub-clan allied with the Majerten sub-clan.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Marehan militiamen accused the
Majerten-led forces of Kismayu for instigating the clashes by
attacking their defensive positions outside Gobwein village early
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the Majertens accused Hussein Aidid's faction of
siding with the Marehans in their fight against the Majertens for
control of Kismayu, 500 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Aidid strongly denied any involvement in the fighting
despite his dispatch of a few technical wagons to his militia
bases in towns of Kansuma, Jamame and Jilib, all in the Jubba
regions in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
About 25 battle wagons, some of whom mounted with
anti-aircraft heavy machine-guns and mortars have been involved
in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The fighting terrified the people of Kismayu. Many of them
were trying to return to their houses after a week-long pause
from fighting and the life in the town seemed to have returned to
normal.
</P>
<P>
The fighting over the control of the southern port is believed
to have so far left about 150 people dead and more than 200
others wounded since the hostility between the two sides who once
lived together in Kismayu turned into a series of bloodletting
armed clashes in mid-April.

<HEADLINE> Large U.S. Humanitarian Team Arrives in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A 82-member U.S. humanitarian
delegation, including former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
arrived here on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
These 82 people represent American humanitarian and human
rights organizations which are against the sanctions on Iraq,
said Clark upon arrival at the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
Clark himself was against the Gulf War, and he had been
received by President Saddam Hussein every time he visited
Baghdad before, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the delegation had brought in several
tonnes of medicine and medical appliances worth 4 million
U.S. dollars as a contribution from the American people to
alleviate sufferings of the Iraqi people under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This is so far the largest American delegation to visit Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War, which arrived at the Rasheed Hotel in
Baghdad by bus from Amman, Jordan, holding banners which read "End
Sanctions on Iraq," "Let the Iraqi Children Live," and
"U.S. Government Kills Iraqi Children."
</P>
<P>
One member of the delegation, Sola Booth, a human rights
activist, said "the sanctions (on Iraq) are criminal, they
violate the international law and should be ended immediately,
and they should have never been started in the first place."
</P>
<P>
"We have a large community of people who are opposed to the
sanctions. They are working along with us - we have
demonstrations, we write letters to our government, we call them
on the phone, or on E-mail. We are trying our best to influence
our government to give up this horrible, unlawful, criminal
sanctions," said Booth.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Flee Hutu Militias in N. Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 villagers who had been
allegedly abducted by the Interahamwe Hutu militiamen to the
volcanic mountain range have started to resettle their homes.
</P>
<P>
"These are the people from communes bordering the volcanos on
the border with the Democratic Republic Republic of Congo," a
senior government official in northwestern Gisenyi told the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA).
</P>
<P>
The communes which were seriously affected by insecurity and
where the population were forced to follow the marauding
militiamen are said to be Mutura, Kanama, Rubavu.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people were forced to flee their homes by Hutu
militiamen who coerced them to flee to the volcano forests,"
Captain Jean Baptiste Muhirwathe, prefect of Gisenyi, explained
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since Monday this week, the number of residents from those
communes breaking free from the militiamen's hold have been
swelling and reached about 2,000 by Friday.
</P>
<P>
The displaced affirm that they had discovered that the
militias would lead them nowhere, as in the volcanos people are
dying of hunger, and various diseases.
</P>
<P>
"We came to learn that all they were chanting about liberating
Hutus was fake, that they have not captured any portion of
Rwandan territory," said one lady, in her forties.
</P>
<P>
Most of these residents were told that they must flee or else
the government army would decimate all Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Although most of these people express the willingness to
resettle their homes and till land, there remain hard-core
militias who still harbor ideas of carrying on the fight.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, it has been reported that about
1,000 ex-FAR (former government soldiers) who recently ended
political re-education have started mop-up operations against the
militias in Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
Military sources in Gisenyi affirmed that on Wednesday the
ex-FAR force netted 25 militiamen, some of whom were young men in
military uniforms, in Rubavu commune.

<HEADLINE> WFP Begins to Aid S. Leone Refugees in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
begun a relief operation to help the tens of thousands of Sierra
Leonean refugees fleeing to neighboring Guinea and the remnants
of the dislodged junta in the east since March this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a WFP regional manager, the organization is
rushing relief goods, mainly food, from Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia
into Guinea to alleviate the poor situation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
In the last two and half weeks, WFP had brought in some 3,000
tons of food for this purpose, he said Friday, quoted by a
British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The official said the WFP is in a hurry because the coming of
the rainy season will make it very difficult for convoy to reach
the refugees camps which lie very isolated.
</P>
<P>
The WFP estimated that about 150,000 Sierra Leonean refugees
have crossed the border into Guinea since March. The figure is
closed to that of 148,000 registered by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Both the WFP and UNHCR agree that the situation of the
refugees is serious.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them are very sick" with malaria and other diseases,
the WFP manager said.
</P>
<P>
A number of people, including children, are now said to be
living in the bush and feeding on wild fruits to keep alive,
according to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
As the tense fighting between the west African peace-keeping
force and the remnants of the junta forces and allied rebels is
continuing in eastern Sierra Leone, the WFP is expecting more
refugees to cross the border into Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Dar es Salaam in Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Some one million thirsty
residents in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam have endured
five days without tap water after a section of water pipeline on
the western outskirts was damaged by floods Monday.
</P>
<P>
People have swarmed to wells to fetch water and their buckets
are lining up as long as hundreds of meters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unscrupulous hawkers selling water, with each
bucket priced at 300 to 600 Shillings (nearly one U.S. Dollar),
are seen everywhere in the street.
</P>
<P>
Government engineers and armed forces have been working round
the clock to repair the damaged pipeline but encountered great
difficulties. On Thursday the Tanzania People's Defense Force
(TPDF) used anti-tank mines to explode the damaged section after
earlier attempts by engineers using conventional dynamite failed.
</P>
<P>
Sanitation in public buildings and offices is severely
affected with toilets overflowing. Residents are also
complaining they have no water to take a bath or wash clothes.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA), is
optimistic that the residents will have access to water Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Boniface Kasiga, the DAWASA director of water supply, said
that repair work of the broken pipeline, located on the lower
reaches of Ruvu River some 25 km away from the city center, is
going on smoothly following the blasting of the concrete by TPDF
technicians.
</P>
<P>
"I have high hopes that tomorrow evening our customers will
start getting water supply," Kasiga said at the rehabilitation
site.
</P>
<P>
DAWASA was forced to switch off the lower Ruvu water pumps
which supply 80 percent of water consumed in the city.
</P>
<P>
The incident has been the fifth along the pipeline since 1985.
Dar es Salaam newspapers have blamed the authorities for
negligence of infrastructure development and said it is
ridiculous that people are suffering from acute shortage of water
in the long rains season.

UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Rebel forces in Sri Lanka
have promised to the United Nations that they are not going to use
children below the age of 17 years, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made during a recent meeting between the
representatives of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
and visiting Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General
for Children and Armed Conflict Olara A. Otunnu, according to a
U.N. press release here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE leadership accepted that a framework to monitor the
commitment should be put in place.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE also pledged that the movement of displaced population
who want to return to areas now under government control would not
be impeded.
</P>
<P>
The representatives made a commitment to Otunnu that the LTTE
would not interfere with the distribution of humanitarian supplies
for civilians affected by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu is on a Sri Lanka mission to witness how children are
affected by the protracted armed conflict in the south Asian
Country.

<HEADLINE> Exam Urged on Role of Military in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) Friday called for an urgent
examination on the role of the military in Africa, particularly
at a time when economic resources are scarce.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day symposium here on the role of the African
military in political transition and economic development, ECA
Deputy Executive Secretary Lalla Ben Barka said, "an army is not
only a heavy burden upon limited financial resources, it also
restricts alternative utilization of scarce resources."
</P>
<P>
"In 1994, four African countries appeared in the top 20 list
when military expenditure is expressed as a percentage of gross
national product: Angola, Mozambique, Rwanda and Botswana," Ben
Barka said.
</P>
<P>
She recalled the calls to cut military expenditure in African
countries made recently by U.N. chief Kofi Annan, saying they are
in the context of efforts to rationalize allocation of resources
and avoid expenditure on unproductive sectors."
</P>
<P>
"Africa has had its share of conflicts and some persist today,
but, on the whole, there are far fewer conflicts in Africa today
than there were five years ago," she noted.
</P>
<P>
She hoped the meeting would discuss the new role and mission
of the military in Africa in support of political transition to
democracy and the national efforts to accomplish sustainable
economic development while maintaining its twin role of defending
national security and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, jointly organized by the ECA and the Global
Coalition for Africa, has drawn military personnel, civilian
defense officials and experts from African countries.

BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Finance Minister
Hikmat Mezban Ibrahim said here on Friday that the resumption of
the broken Iraqi-Lebanese diplomatic relations has become "a
natural matter," but needs time.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese National News Agency quoted Ibrahim as saying that
all negative factors against ties between the two countries have
been removed and the Iraqi-Lebanese relationship is friendly and
brotherly,
</P>
<P>
"And so, the intention to resume ties has become a natural
matter, which is being taken into planning," he said after a
meeting with his Lebanese counterpart Fuad Sinyoura.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi minister continue to point out that in
consideration of the current situation in the two countries, the
resumption of diplomatic relations still needs time and
maturation. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ties between Baghdad and Beirut were severed after
an Iraqi opposition leader was assassinated in Lebanon in 1994.

OTTAWA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The jobless rate in Canada edged down
to 8.4 percent in April, the lowest since August 1990, Statistics
Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Employment surged by an estimated 72,000 in the month, bring
the gain since the beginning of 1997 to 543,000.
</P>

However, because of increased labour force participation, the
unemployment rate edged down only 0.1 percentage points, the

In April, most of the job growth was in part-time employment.
This brings the part-time gains over the last two months to
73,000.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent growth in part-time jobs, nearly all of the
543,000 employment gain since the beginning of 1997 has been
full-time jobs, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Contributions Keep Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Campaign donations to candidates
for U.S. House of Representatives and Senate races totaled 338
million dollars and candidates spent 185 million dollars in the
past 15 months, according to a report released Friday by the
Federal Election Commission (FEC).
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions have increased 14 percent compared to
the 1996 election season, the report found. More than half of the
money came from individual donations of 1,000 dollars or less, 25
percent came from political action committees -- groups
representing a point of view and parcels out campaign money to
lawmakers or candidates sharing that point of view, and the rest
came from the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 166 Senate candidates raised 140 million dollars
and spent 70 million dollars, while 1,343 House incumbents and
challengers raised 198 million dollars and spent 113 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive race in the nation is a 20-million-dollar
free-for-all for the seat currently held by Senator Alfonse
D'Amato, a Republican of New York State. Democratic challenger
Charles Schumer has out-raised every other candidate in the
country, with net receipts of 11 million dollars so far. D'Amato
is the nation's third-highest fundraiser, with 9.2 million
dollars. Other Democrats in the race, Geraldine Ferarro and Mark
Green, have raised more than 1 million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
In the House, the top fundraisers are House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, a Republican from Gerogia, and Democratic leader Richard
Gephardt, from Missouri, who have raised 3.7 million dollars and
3.1 million dollars each. Neither faces serious opposition for
re-election, and both are pumping their money into other
candidates' campaigns.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said on
Friday that it could not confirm reports from Israel that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not attend a summit in
Washington on the Middle East peace process next week.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware that Israel has closed the door on that
possibility," spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Jerusalem, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan told
Reuters that "the chances of our being there on Monday are nil."
</P>
<P>
His comment came hours after Netanyahu held talks with U.S.
special envoy Dennis Ross in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But Foley said he had not been in contact with Ross, who is in
Israel in a last-ditch effort to persuade Netanyahu to attend the
Washington summit, arranged by President Bill Clinton after
inconclusive London meetings on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has seen the conditions set by Clinton for the
proposed Washington summit as something of "dictates" and
indicated on Thursday that he was unsure whether to attend the
Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton invited the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
Washington for further talks on how to enter the final status
negotiations between the two sides. But he said they can only
enter the final status talks only when Israel accepts a U.S.
proposed withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States has suggested that Israel make a further
withdrawal from 13.1 percent land of the West Bank. But Israel
has so far rejected the proposal on the pretext of its security.

LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Malawi President Bakili Muluzi
Friday urged African leaders to avoid being elitists in the
approach to governance and development.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi made the remarks at the end of a three-day Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association (CPA) conference for the African region
held in Blantyre, the commercial center of Malawi, the
Pan-African News Agency (PANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said people must be the focus of any lasting democracy.
</P>
<P>
"All of us should be concerned about our future -- a future in
which democracy will not be about counting people, but in which
people count," he said, noting that "Large masses of people still
remain outside governance structures."
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in people failing to develop a sense of
ownership in their country where the government remains a
"distant institution."
</P>
<P>
CPA Africa region acting chairperson Edna Madzongwe said
democracy and good governance are important toward achieving
peace and sound economic status among the CPA members.
</P>
<P>
"Despite adopting policies such as the structural adjustment
programs, socio-economic problems continue to prevail in Africa,"
said Madzongwe, who is also deputy speaker of the Zimbabwean
parliament.
</P>

Speaker of Malawi parliament Rodwell Munyenyembe said the CPA
annual conferences are aimed at consolidating the role of
legislatures in governance and development for the benefit of the

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia must lift its ban of
Canadian salmon thanks to the ruling from the World Trade
Organization (WTO) panel, International Trade Minister Sergio
Marchi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The panel has found that Australia's ban is inconsistent with
several provisions of the WTO agreement, and has recommended that
the Dispte Settlement Body request Australia to bring its measure
into conformity with its obligation under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"In Canada's view, this means that Australia must lift the
ban," Marchi said in a news release Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister accused the Australian government of
violating the WTO confidentiality rules when it discussed the
details of ruling in a media release on May 6.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I think it is important to clarify
Australia's misleading statement that the Panel did not recommend
the removal of Australia's import ban," Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's ban of Canadian salmon was first introduced in
1975. After years of unsuccessful bilateral efforts to resolve the
dispute, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body established a panel in
April, 1997, at Canada's request.

movement of livestock in West Pokot, Marakwet, Trans Nzoia and
Turkana districts in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The ban was aimed at combating the cattle rustling menace
which had intensified in the areas, said Rift Valley Provincial
Commissioner Francis Baya, quoted by the Kenya News Agency (KNA)
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that cattle rustling which was originally a cultural
practice had been commercialized by unscrupulous traders who took
advantage of the menace to get a supply of livestock at
throw-away prices.
</P>
<P>
Modalities were being worked out to implement a directive
Thursday by President Daniel arap Moi which ordered the Kenya
army and police to be involved in joint operations to arrest
those people with illegal arms, Baya said.
</P>
<P>
Moi said many illegal guns had been smuggled into Kenya
because of insecurity in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that cattle rustling in Marakwet, Samburu,
Turkana and West Pokot had triggered violence which had claimed
dozens of lives and displaced thousands of families in the recent
past.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicated Thursday that about 10,000 residents of
Marakwet District had fled their homes in fear of renewed attacks
by cattle rustlers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Shelling Wounds 7 Lebanese Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of Lebanese civilians
wounded during an Israeli artillery shelling in south Lebanon
Friday has risen to seven from the previously five.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli shelling took place at noon on the villages of al
Mansuri and Majdel Zoun, about 10 kilometers north of the Israeli
border, the country's Orient Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The two people, together with other five wounded, have been
admitted to nearby hospitals in the country's southern coastal
city of Tyre for treatment, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli operation was believed to be a retaliation for the
attacks launched by Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hours before, Hezbollah guerrillas set off a bomb planted in
the home of an Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) officer
near the Israeli-occupied enclave, killing him instantly.
</P>
<P>
They carried out a similar attack on an armed Israeli patrol,
but there was no report of casualties from the roadside bomb.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war to oust 2,000-strong
Israeli occupying forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 as "security zone," with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Early Migration of Whales Baffles Marine Biologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Near-record numbers of mother
gray whales and their calves are moving up the Northern California
coast in an earlier-than-usual migration to the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
But biologists here have not been able to figure out whether
the numbers and the dates mean that more baby whales were born
this year, that some factor of food or weather is influenced the
action or that the migration has simply peaked earlier.
</P>
<P>
Biologist Wayne Perryman with the National Marine Fisheries
Service has an explanation. He said that the number of gray whales
may be nearing the carrying capacity of the range -- that is,
there may be about as many gray whales as can be supported by the
population of their food, amphipods. Amphipods are small
crustaceans that live in the mud on the bottom of the Arctic
feeding grounds and make up as much as 90 percent of the gray
whale's diet.
</P>
<P>
Perryman supervises observers who count the mother-calf pairs
as they migrate past in a point in Northern California. As of last
Saturday, 360 mother-calf pairs had been counted already this
year.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious cue that a pair of whales is approaching is
that the baby whale's head is often sticking up out of the water.
Mother whales and their babies always lag behind in the migration
because they stop and nurse on the way.
</P>
<P>
The other adults and juveniles migrate north earlier than the
mothers and babies, and they travel farther off the coast, making
them harder to count.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Urge Sanctions on French Oil Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and a dozen of other senators prodded President Bill Clinton
Friday to impose sanctions on a consortium led by a French oil
company for investing in Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a letter also signed by Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Lott and his colleagues said that "a
decision not to sanction will reveal the United States as a paper
tiger."
</P>
<P>
The letter came as the Clinton administration neared a decision
on whether the 2 billion U.S. dollar oil contract violates the
Iran and Libya Sanctions Act.
</P>
<P>
The law, enacted in 1996, allows the United States to impose
sanctions on foreign companies that invest 20 million U.S. dollars
or more a year in Iran's oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
The letter said failure to trigger the sanctions would open
"floodgates for further investments" by other international
firms.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the only victims of a waiver will be American
companies barred from doing business in Iran. Such an outcome is
as absurd as it is objectionable," it added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the letter, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said, "The decision is going to be forthcoming. I can't tell you
what day, but it's close."
</P>
<P>
Iran signed the contract last September with a consortium of
French, Russian and Malaysian oil companies led by Total, a French
oil giant, to expand a gas field estimated to hold 300 trillion
cubic feet of gas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the deal violates the law while France
said the law does not apply in France.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the French company Total has divested itself of
its U.S. holdings and may be largely untouched by sanctions," the
senators told Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"That fact must be irrelevant to your considerations. Myriad
other companies (Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum, to name
two) are waiting to see what your administration is going to do,"
they noted in the letter.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Regional security topped the list
of issues addressed by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan during their talks
here on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In their discussions, Museveni said the violence occurring in
various places in the Great Lakes region is cumulative and he
attributed the violence to past distortions in the management of
the countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of guerrillas in the region, Museveni suggested
it could be handled by establishing democracy in the relevant
countries, strengthening the national armies and absorbing those
former soldiers who give up fighting.
</P>
<P>
The two also exchanged views on the current situation in
Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan and
agreed that the resolution to regional conflicts is for the
international community to work with the countries and support
them in putting pressure on various groups involved in the
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Annan pledged U.N. support for efforts aimed at resolving the
regional conflicts, as well as for the Organization of African
Unity's proposed panel of eminent persons who will go around the
region to probe the causes of conflict, the refugee problem and
the genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to launch a private sector project Saturday
morning in the district of Mbale in eastern Uganda and leave for
Eritrea, the last leg of his eight-nation African tour, in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Rolls-Royce Joint Venture in China Delivers First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Rolls-Royce aero engine joint
venture with China's Xian Aero Engine Corporation (XAE) has
delivered its first components less than a year since work began
on a new factory.
</P>
<P>
The components, for Rolls-Royce Tay engines, have been
delivered to Rolls-Royce in the United Kingdom where the Tay
engine is assembled.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held Friday at the factory at Xujiawan Beijiao,
north of the city of Xian, to mark the delivery of the Tay nozzle
guide vanes (NGV) on March 31, according to an announcement by
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Colin Green, director-operations, Rolls-Royce plc, said, "The
delivery of the first parts to Rolls-Royce plc well within a year
was achieved through the dedication and hard work of everyone
concerned with this joint venture."
</P>
<P>
"It confirms our confidence in the tremendous potential for our
future collaboration with China," Green added.
</P>
<P>
Bob Pitt, general manager of the joint venture, said, "When we
held the stone-laying ceremony on May 9, 1997, there was only a
field where our factory now stands, but in just over 10 months we
built our factory... and made our first parts. This is a
remarkable achievement."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, Zhang Zhiying, president of XAE,
said, "Today, we are here to celebrate our joint venture
delivering the first components. This marks the second historical
cooperation between XAE and Rolls-Royce."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Legislative Support to Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday called on lawmakers to join his administration in providing
the American children with the world best education.
</P>
<P>
"Good things don't happen by accident," Clinton told Delaware
state legislature, "We must be on the same page when it comes
to education."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the U.S. elementary and secondary schools are
lagging behind those in other countries, Clinton asked lawmakers
to support his plan to hire 100,000 new teachers nationwide,
repair and update dilapidated schoolrooms, and implement national
standards and testing in reading and math.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the nation is facing a lot of
challenges, such as reforming Social Security and Medicare and
keeping the economy strong while preserving the environment. "But
none of that will matter if we don't save our children."
</P>
<P>
"We have the best system of higher education in the world,"
the president said. "We do not have the best system of elementary
and secondary education in the world."
</P>
<P>
He called on Republicans and Democrats to work together on a
revolution in standards and accountability, in choice and safety,
based on high expectations, accountability and performance.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Clinton told a meeting of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors at the White House that his plan for smaller class sizes,
modernized schools, more teachers, higher standards has not
received support from Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the focus needs to be on helping public
schools. He hailed a new bill introduced by some legislators on
Thursday that would implement his idea of creating 50 "education
opportunity zones" in poor school districts.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only way we can offer opportunity to and demand
responsibility from all the children in all of our communities all
across America," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would spend 1.5 billion U.S. dollars over five
years on grants to help schools in the 50 designated needy
districts of education. The grant money would be used to create
new curriculum standards, set higher achievement standards and
install new technology.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Addresses Cause of Refugees at Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said colonial distortion is the key cause for the generation of
refugees in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president made this statement when addressing a regional
workshop on refugees at the Uganda international conference
center Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the State House said the president
asserted that monopolizing political power, especially by
undemocratic means, has led to the creation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that racial colonial ideologies have also
been used to divide the people, created havoc and escalate the
refugee crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to resolve the refugee issue, he called on national
leaders to defeat these ideologies by exposing the bankruptcy of
those theories.
</P>
<P>
Once the refugees are created, he added, they should be
protected by the countries they flee to and be properly resettled
when they return to their native land.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, he said, has no refugees, but only some internally
displaced people. He said Uganda has handled some of the colonial
distortions that lead to the creation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop was co-chaired by Secretary-General of
the Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim and United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Mrs. Sadako Ogata.

LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's police and airline
officials said Friday that all air passengers in the UK are to be
warned about excessive consumption of alcohol in an attempt to
stamp out drunken in-flight behavior, said a BBC television report
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), together with travel
operators, will hand out leaflets with travel documents from next
week.
</P>
<P>
Travelers will be warned that offenders face a fine of up to
5,000 pounds (8,200 U.S. dollars) and up to two years in jail for
endangering flight safety.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the move follows a steady rise over the
last two years in cases where staff have had to restrain
passengers. And police and airlines believe that it is only a
matter of time before a drunk passenger triggers a serious safety
alert.
</P>
<P>
A CAA spokesman said, "It is not just the responsibility of an
airline to carry you safely. There are obligations on passengers
as well."

DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Zimbabwe have
agreed to intensify cooperation in a wide range of fields at the
seventh meeting of the Tanzania Zimbabwe Commission held this
week in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique signed by Tanzania foreign minister

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges Reforms, Hopes U.S. Pay Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Finance Minister Fuad
Bawazier said Friday that his country will abide by the terms of
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, and hoped the
Untied States would pay some of its contributions in its effort to
salvage the economy from crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to stick to the plan right now," Bawazier said in
an interview with both Reuters and Reuters Television.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has resumed its lending to Indonesia on conditions that
Jakarta pursues reforms. In responding to the IMF decision,
several countries like Australia, Japan and Malaysia said they
would make bilateral funds available from a second line of defense
in a 40 billion dollar international rescue deal agreed last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States also has promised to contribute 3 billion
dollars to the package, but has not yet indicated it plans to pay.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier said he had asked the United States to hand over some
of these funds, but had not yet received a reply.
</P>
<P>
He said he had not discussed this request with U.S. Treasury
officials during his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We don not need all this 3 billion dollars at once. That will
be coordinated as part of coordination with the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier made clear this request was funding to strengthen the
Indonesian economy, and not to finance trade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ex-Im Bank is offering Indonesia 1 billion dollars in
trade financing to help U.S. exporters continue shipments to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier also said the recent protest riots in the country
could slow the progress in the reforms pledged by the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility of that. The focus is going to be
split, at least for the time being," he told Reuters and Reuters
Television.

long-term stability in south-eastern Europe and could cooperate
with Romania in various fields in the regional affairs, Richard
Schifter, special counsellor of the U.S. President, told the press
on Friday, after meeting with the Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei

integration into NATO was clearly affirmed at the Madrid summit.
</P>

In an interview with the CNN broadcast from Kampala, Uganda,

the locations that it has never visited for some seven years.

"If the cooperation continues to be good, and the inspectors
are able to complete their work as soon as possible, Iraq has
also to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel," Annan
said, referring to the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq, imposed
since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the United Nations will continue to work
energetically to implement the oil for food scheme so that Iraqi

<HEADLINE> Canada Cracks Down on Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada is cracking down on computer
software piracy that is rampant in certain areas of the country, a
report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a latest raid, police seized 90,000 Canadian dollars (63,000
U.S. dollars) in alleged counterfeit software at a computer store
in the Toronto's suburb.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, police and computer companies are getting
tougher on pirates because new CD-ROM recorders have hit the
market, making it easy to copy discs.
</P>
<P>
Starting this month, the maximum penalty for illegally copying
software will be set at 20,000 dollars under the federal copyright
law.
</P>
<P>
Still, the temptation to copy keeps growing, as the price tags
for specialty programs can sometimes top 10,000 dollars and a
blank disc used for copying costs only about 20 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It's estimated that out of every 100 programs installed in
computers in Canada, 42 are pirated," Kimberley Lauder,
anti-piracy manager for Microsoft Canada, was quoted as saying by
Friday's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
While that's better than 46 percent estimated for Canada two
years ago, "what that translates into is still a
500-million-dollars loss to the Canadian economy a year," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We've already seen pirated Windows 98," she added. The new
system due for release this Summer is being tested in what is
known as a beta version by computer programmers.

<HEADLINE> High-Speed Train Proposed in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian consortium has proposed to
build a 11.1 billion Canadian dollars (7.8 billion U.S. dollars)
high-speed rail link between Toronto and Quebec City, reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"With this proposal, Canada is closer to an economic, efficient
and environmentally-friendly 320 kilometre-an-hour high speed rail
system that will connect Toronto and Montreal in two hours and 21
minutes," said Jean-Paul Gourdeau, project director for the Lynx
consortium.
</P>
<P>
The consortium says it would build and operate the rail
service, but it wants the government to guarantee financing for
the 7.5 billion dollars it will cost to build the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Equipment and technology account for 3.6 billion dollars, and
would be financed and owned by the consortium.
</P>
<P>
If approved, construction would start in 2001. The
Toronto-Ottawa segment would be operational in 2006, followed by
Ottawa-Montreal and Montreal-Quebec City in 2007.
</P>
<P>
The entire system would be running in 2008 and is projected to
initially carry 11 million riders annually.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Transport Minister David Collenette was reported to
say he needed time to review the proposal.

<HEADLINE> S. African Court Overturns ANC Amnesties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A South African high court
Friday overturned the amnesties granted to Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki and 36 other senior African National Congress (ANC) figures
by the amnesty committee of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
The Cape High Court granted applications by the TRC and the
National Party (NP) to set aside the decision made last year by
the TRC's own amnesty committee, which enjoys autonomy from the
rest of the TRC, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The 37 people include Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, Justice
Minister Dullah Omar, Defense Minister Joe Modise, Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj and Environment Minister Pallo Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The TRC and the NP filed separate applications on the court in
March, saying the amnesties granted to the 37 ANC members were
invalid because of irregularities in the granting process.
</P>
<P>
The law required amnesty applicants to make full disclosure of
what they had done and amnesty be granted only for identified
offenses. But the amnesty committee had failed to meet the
requirements, the TRC said.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that the TRC's amnesty committee should
consider the amnesty applications afresh.
</P>
<P>
TRC chairman Desmond Tutu said Friday afternoon that the 37
ANC members would not have to submit new application forms,
because the fault lay with the amnesty committee rather than with
the applicants.
</P>
<P>
The NP, which accused the amnesty committee of using double
standards in granting amnesties and favoring ANC members, on
Friday renewed its attack on the TRC, saying the truth body is
now facing real credibility crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ANC also reacted to the ruling, saying it remained
convinced that all 37 applicants qualified for amnesty under the
law.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug Experts Call for International Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The sharing of experience among
countries and a common international solution are vital to
tackling the millennium bug, European computer experts said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Millennium bug experts from all European Union states were
meeting in London to discuss the best ways to prevent computer
chaos before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The conference, set up by the UK government as part of its EU
presidency, stressed that the problem, caused by computers'
failure to distinguish dates between the year 1900 and 2000, needs
to be dealt with more urgently.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the start of the conference, UK Trade Minister
Barbara Roche said that it was impossible to tackle the problem in
isolation, as a failure in one part of the EU could have
potentially serious knock-on effects elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in a company in one member state pulling out
all the stops to update its own systems if a key overseas supplier
or some other critical cross-border link then fails," she said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug issue will also be on the agenda at a Group
of Eight summit in Britain later this month.

<HEADLINE> London, Frankfurt Stocks End Week Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Europe's two major stock markets,
London and Frankfurt, recovered Friday from their early losses
triggered by strong U.S. job data to end around the day's best
levels. Paris was closed for the Armistice day holiday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares rose to session
highs in late trading but failed to breach the 6,000-point level,
ending 0.54 percent or 31.8 points higher at 5,969.8, but still a
fall of 40.4 points over last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that sterling's weakness, stronger futures and
Wall Street's ability to shrug off stronger-than-expected U.S.
jobs figures helped support the market.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's decision Thursday to leave base rates on
hold added weight to hopes that rates have peaked.
</P>
<P>
Vickers' shares gained 4.25 percent after the bid battle
between Volkswagen and BMW over its Rolls-Royce unit intensified.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended the week up 71.35 points or
1.38 percent at 5,257.58, buoyed by a firmer dollar.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that car stocks remained in the limelight as the
market reacted to the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler and the
latest developments concerning the sale of Vickers' unit
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse was closed for a public holiday and will
reopen Monday. The CAC-40 index Thursday ended at 3,906.36, down
1.04 percent or 41.09 points, dropping 25.44 points from last
week.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt to Take Steps to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos
said here Friday that his government will take measures at a
proper time to ease tensions in some areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos disclosed the decision at a press conference held
jointly with visiting Namibian President Sam Nujoma, the Angola
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is now seriously undertaking analysis
on domestic situation to avoid any hasty measures.
</P>
<P>
The president believed there are criminal groups in Angola and
there might be certain political conspiracy behind their sabotage
activities, which might trigger off certain military moves.
</P>
<P>
To revert the tension, he said, the measures that the
government will take might be political, diplomatic, or even
military.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma arrived here Friday for a short working visit to the
country, which according to Dos Santos, is aimed at exchanging
views and "reaching understanding on certain issues of mutual
interest," just like the recent visits by South African President
Nelson Mandela and Congolese President Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
During Nujoma's visit, the two heads of state exchanged views
on issues such as security along their common border. Nujoma
believed that it is necessary for the two countries to enhance
relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
There were repeated military incidents in the country carried
out by ex-fighters of the former rebel movement the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) recently in
violation of the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Remnant UNITA militiamen launched a series of armed attacks at
newly-born local administrations, police headquarters and
ordinary citizens, putting people's lives and property at stake
and blocking the further progress of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> 6,000 U.S. Students Expelled for Bringing Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,000 students were
expelled from public schools in the United States in the 1996-97
academic year for bringing a firearm to school, the Education
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a report on the expulsions that 56
percent of expulsions were from high schools, 34 percent from
junior highs, and 9 percent from elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
It also said that 58 percent of the expulsions were for
handguns, 7 percent were for rifles or shotguns, and 35 percent
were for some other types of firearm, including bombs, grenades,
or starter pistols.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley said, "The report is
a clear indication that our nation's public schools are cracking
down on students who bring guns to school."
</P>
<P>
Riley said, "We need to be tough-minded about keeping guns out
of our schools and do everything possible to keep our children
safe."
</P>
<P>
The Gun-Free Schools Act, signed into law in 1994, requires
states to pass laws ordering school districts to expel for one
year any student who brings a firearm to school.
</P>
<P>
Riley said the expelled students should be sent to alternative
schools "and not be allowed to just hang out on the street. These
young people need to get their lives turned around."
</P>
<P>
The report was released following a rash of shootings at U.S.
schools, in which several children were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
In March, an 11-year-old and a 13-year-old boy fired handguns
and rifles at students and teachers at a school in Jonesboro,
Arkansas, killing four children and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
In last October, two were killed and seven wounded in a
shooting at a Mississippi school. Two months later, a boy killed
three students and wounded five in Paducah, Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> ICRC to Aid Angola $5.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) representative in Angola Paollo Dloca revealed
here Friday it has allocated 5.5 million U.S. Dollars this year
for various humanitarian aid missions in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Dloca made the disclosure to the press Friday which marks
ICRC's 70th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
ICRC's missions in Angola this year mainly include providing
aid for the country's agricultural rehabilitation and
development, upgrading basic health level, training technical
personnel in the medical area and restoring health clinics
destroyed by the war, said Dloca.
</P>
<P>
He noted that another major task for the ICRC office in Angola
is involved in plastic surgery for the large number of soldiers
and civilians rendered disabled during the two-decade-long civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC office in Angola has set up three centers for plastic
operations in Luanda, and Huambo and Bie provinces in central
Angola, in which over 1,200 disabled have been fixed with
artificial limbs since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1928 in Switzerland, ICRC is one of the world's
oldest organizations to provide humanitarian aid to countries in
the war. Africa which has been plagued by frequent conflicts is
a prime region for ICRC. The ICRC has been operating in Angolan
long before the country's independence in 1975.
