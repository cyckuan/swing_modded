<HEADLINE> Dhaka Opposes Nuclear Arms Race in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh expressed the hope on
Wednesday that South Asian countries would keep away from further
escalation of a nuclear arms race, the national news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We hope all South Asian countries would refrain from
escalation of nuclear arms race," Foreign Minister Abdus Samad
Azad said in a statement in response to the nuclear tests
conducted by India on Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official response from the Bangladeshi
government following India's nuclear test blasts.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, being a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), believed in peace and was committed to a
nuclear-free world, he said. Bangladesh signed the CTBT in October
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government favored cooperation among the
members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in
economic development and poverty alleviation in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan
Chowdhury said Bangladesh remains committed to world peace and
stability, particularly in South Asia. But he made no comment on
the blasts, reports said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Considers Kosovo Contingency Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is considering whether to give the go-ahead
for its military planners to work out a Kosovo-oriented action
plan.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official said the Wednesday meeting of the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's executive body, had not come to any
decision on whether to allow the NATO Military Committee to
prepare specifics.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, however, discussed what was militarily and
politically feasible and gave much wider consideration to
far-reach options, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official refused to elaborate and only said the discussion
was extensive and no option was excluded.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO Military Committee, the
highest military authority in the 16-nation alliance, said late
last week the institution had not received the mandate for
Kosovo-oriented action planning.
</P>
<P>
The organization has been conducting an exercise in Macedonia
and is planning for one in Albania, and measures to help the
Balkan countries bordering Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo ward
off the spillover of violence.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo since February when
Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians of Kosovo who
outnumber Serbians nine to one.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia
to integrate with Albania, while Belgrade strongly opposes
independence and denied Kosovo's autonomy in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official said the North Atlantic Council discussion
should serve as a signal that it would see to it that Kosovo would
not become a regional problem.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's independence-minded ethnic
Albanians, are scheduled to meet on Wednesday in Belgrade for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers are scheduled to meet later this month
in Luxembourg to re-chart the strategic concept of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are expected to focus on the definition of crisis
management and the relationship between collective defense and
crisis management.

<HEADLINE> Britain Appoints New Minister for N.Irish Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government appointed a
"Minister for Victims" in Northern Ireland on Wednesday to
coordinate policy in improving care for those who have suffered
from violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the job would be
carried out by Northern Ireland Security Minister Adam Ingram and
five million pounds (8.2 million U.S. dollars) will be allocated
to support the victims of the violence.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Belfast, Mowlam said: "Adam
Ingram...will become, as part of his job, the minister for
victims, and is there to understand, to listen and to make
recommendations and to make sure that measures are implemented."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at the publication of a report on
victims, conducted by Kenneth Bloomfield, Northern Ireland Victims
Commissioner responsible for studying ways of recognizing victims'
suffering.
</P>
<P>
Bloomfield, a former head of the Northern Ireland civil
service, said at the joint press conference that those affected in
the 30-year-long conflict needed long-term coordinated help.
</P>
<P>
He proposed Britain should eventually appoint a new "Protector
for Victims" and that the province's churches should hold a
special "memorial and reconciliation day".
</P>
<P>
Around 100 relatives and representatives of victims and their
support groups attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Arrives in Washington for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Wednesday for talks
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the
stalemated peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright said on Tuesday she hoped to re-invite the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders to Washington for a peace summit if she
could reach an agreement with Netanyahu on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted the Middle East peace process is in Jeopardy
after 15-month impasse because of Israel's rejection to a U.S.
proposal on withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Act before it is too late," she admonished on Tuesday at the
National Press Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has proposed that Israel withdraw
13 percent of the territory from the West Bank, but Netanyahu
has rejected, arguing it would endanger Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
The United States has failed in persuading Israel into
compromise despite its diplomacy efforts both by its special
envoy Dennis Ross in the Middle East and Albright in London's
talks with Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned on the eve of her talks with Netanyahu that
the leaders of the Middle East "have reached a crossroads." She
called on them to "decide before the peace process collapses."
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, former Israeli prime minister and one of the
architects of Middle East peace accords, said in New York that
Netanyahu had no choice but to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's no choice but to follow a compromise," he
told reporters on Tuesday after addressing U.S. Jewish groups.
"You cannot have the United States as an honest broker and then
accuse her of trying to press us."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Pick Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. prices charged by
factories and other producers increased in April for the first
time in seven months, the Labor Department reported here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The producers' prices climbed up largely due to increases in
food and tobacco costs. Retail sales rebounded after a lull the
month before.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent seasonally adjusted growth in the department's
Producer Price Index (PPI) represented the first gain since last
September.
</P>
<P>
Since early fall, producer prices have been held down by low
energy costs and drops in the price of goods exported from
crisis-ridden East Asia. However, energy costs edged just 0.1
percent lower last month after six months of steeper drops.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released today, the Commerce Department
said retail sales rebounded moderately in April, up 0.5 percent,
after holding unchanged in March and surging in February and
January.
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of the year, the wholesalers who buy
finished goods from producers have enjoyed a rare period of
deflation. The index for finished goods fell at a 2.5 percent
annual rate. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors,
so-called core prices rose at a scant 0.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
In April, core prices rose 0.2 percent. However, about half the
increase was accounted for by a 3.4 percent jump in tobacco
prices. Tobacco producers have been pushing prices up regularly in
anticipation of expensive legal settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, home electronic equipment costs declined 0.5 percent
in April, household appliances fell 0.2 percent and computers
continued their steep descent, 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, however, increased 0.4 percent last month. El
Nino's rains have drowned California vegetables. Nationally,
vegetable prices jumped 6.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> UK Firms Ignoring Millenium Bug Face Legal Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Companies not taking the millenium
bug seriously could face legal action, the UK government's Health
and Safety Executive (HSE) has warned.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of lives are at risk if equipment with build-in
computer chips including lifts, fire alarms, security monitors and
heating systems could fail, the HSE said.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that companies, especially in the manufacturing
and engineering industries, take the appropriate steps to avoid
any potential problems," said a spokesman from the HSE.
</P>
<P>
He said that computer systems could be affected from as early
as January 1 next year as the digits 999 mark the end of some data
files.
</P>
<P>
"There are a total of eight different dates, starting with
January 1 1999, which could have widespread effect." the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"If companies are found not to be taking the problem seriously
enough then there is scope for enforcement action," he added.
</P>
<P>
An army of inspectors will interview managers of firms across
the country in the coming months in an attempt to ensure they are
adopting the right strategies.

<HEADLINE> New Cars More Affordable for Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- New cars are more affordable for
American families whose income has been rising faster than car
prices, according to the report of the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the phenomenon to "a robust economy
and a glut of new vehicles. The first three months of 1998 have
become the most affordable period to buy a new car in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
It took 25.5 weeks of median pretax family income in the first
quarter to buy the average-priced new car, at about 20,000 U.S.
dollars, Detroit's Comerica Bank reported.
</P>
<P>
That's down from 25.8 weeks in the last quarter of 1997 and
matches 1981's first quarter, the report said. It's also the fifth
consecutive quarter of improved affordability.
</P>
<P>
An official of the bank says that family income rose twice as
fast as car prices, while average loan rates fell 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Automakers have put incentives on new cars to sell them.
Rebates are as high as 3,000 U.S. dollars on some 1998 models.
</P>
<P>
And they get loan rates as low as 1.9 percent for two years and
5.9 percent for five. Most banks are charging 8 percent for new
car loans.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales fell 2.8 percent during the first quarter but were
up 6 percent in April from a year ago, it said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM, Clinton Discuss India Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and U.S. President Bill Clinton Wednesday discussed on the
phone the situation arising from the conducting of nuclear tests
by India this week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Clinton said the Indian action
had created a serious threat to the security situation in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
India conducted two more nuclear tests on Wednesday following
three tests on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on the "dangerous" situation
that has arisen as a result of the nuclear tests carried out by
India, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Sharif that the Indian nuclear tests had come as a
shock to him and that he strongly condemned this action which
exposed India in the eyes of the world, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also reiterated that his administration was
determined to enforce the U.S. Laws relating to nuclear explosions
and ensure that sanctions envisaged in the Laws are implemented
fully.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that his administration considered Pakistan
"a close friend and ally," whose genuine defense and security
requirements were fully recognized by the U.S., according to the
press release.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Sharif emphasized that as a
result of the Indian nuclear tests, "an extremely dangerous
situation had been created in the South Asian region."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan was convinced that India would resort to this extreme
step and therefore these tests had not come as a surprise to us,"
Sharif was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sharif regretted that the international community had done
nothing to prevent India from carrying out these tests.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that like any other country, Pakistan must
give priority to its security needs and it had no option but to
take appropriate measures to protect its sovereignty and security,
in accordance with the aspirations of the people.

BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- United States Envoy Richard
Holbrooke said here Wednesday that unconditional talks on the
Kosovo issue will soon open and no foreign representatives will
participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke made the remark at a press conference after meeting
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
He said the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, will hold
talks with Milosevic in Belgrade on May 15. After that, the two
parties will continue their talks in Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Following the first two talks, Belgrade and Pristina will take
turns to host further talks between the two sides every other week.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic reiterated Yugoslavia's
stand on the Kosovo issue. He stressed that dialogue should be
held on the principle of justice.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement released by Milosevic and Holbrooke said
the Yugoslav president had extended his invitation to Rugova for
talks in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the Kosovo issue have been prolonged due to
serious disagreement between the two sides. The impending talks
between Milosevic and Rugova signals a step towards the peaceful
solution of the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
POTSDAM, GERMANY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton announced here Wednesday his decision to apply
economic sanctions against India over India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after talks with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Clinton described the nuclear tests as
"unjustified" and "a terrible mistake". He said "they clearly
create a dangerous new instability in the region."
</P>
<P>
India stunned the world Monday and again Wednesday by
announcing it had conducted a series of underground nuclear tests,
its first since 1974, and said it had the ability to make nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"It is not necessary for them to match their national greatness
by doing this. It is a terrible mistake," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and urged Pakistan "not to follow the dangerous path India
has taken".
</P>
<P>
Under a 1994 U.S. sanction law to prevent nuclear
proliferation, India would face a suspension of U.S. government
economic aid as well as a bar on U.S. bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Washington could also restrict the exports of American
computers and other products with possible military
applications. It could also oppose international loans to India by
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, however, did not disclose on Wednesday whether
Washington would make full use of these punitive measures against
India.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Kohl said that Bonn would
examine carefully whether to follow the U.S. move to impose
sanctions against India.

<HEADLINE> Prince Denies Opposing Queen's Award to Japanese Emperor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's
husband, on Wednesday strongly denied reports that he had
privately objected to Queen's decision to award the country's
highest order of chivalry to Japan's Emperor Akihito.
</P>
<P>
"The Duke of Edinburgh has not expressed any view privately or
publicly about the award of the Order of Garter to the Emperor of
Japan," said a statement issued from the Queen's London home,
Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
"For very many years, Prince Philip has worked for
reconciliation and for greater understanding between the two
countries," it added.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito, son of wartime leader Emperor Hirohito, is to
be presented with the award during his state visit to Britain
later this month.
</P>
<P>
But a report in Wednesday's Times newspaper quoted British
official sources as saying that the award, which has upset former
British prisoners of war, had caused tension in the royal family.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a British official as saying: "He is deeply uneasy
and unhappy with the whole thing. He feels the government should
have found other ways to honor the emperor.
</P>
<P>
The award to the Emperor was advised by the government, which
said Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, received the same honor
before World War Two, becoming the third successive Japanese
monarch to do so.
</P>
<P>
The British prisoners of war veterans are strongly opposed to
the award and have threatened to stage protests during Akihito's
visit if they do not get an apology and compensation from the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace statement added that Prince Philip was
"well aware of the painful memories which the war causes the
people, both from his own wartime experiences and from meeting
veterans and ex-POWs over the years".

the coming Group of Eight summit of world leaders.
</P>

OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
condemned Wednesday the further testing by India of two nuclear
devices, which followed its testing on Monday of three devices.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is shocked and disappointed at India's action, which
could set off a nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent and
lead other countries to develop and test nuclear weapons," Chretien

The prime minister announced that his country's relations with

<P>
The country has also decided to ban its military exports to India.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Canada has ordered its high commissioner in India back
home as a sign of protest.

ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian House Speaker Dawit
Yohannes Wednesday called for political empowerment of citizens,
saying it will provide a solid foundation for the respect of
human rights in Ethiopia.

<P>
Opening a three-day national conference here on the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomat Reconfirms U.S. Positions on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth
Brill, said here Wednesday that the Turkish Cypriot side is to
blame for the failure of the latest U.S. effort to revive the
peace process in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Brill made the remark after a meeting with Cyprus' speaker of
House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou, during which they
discussed the U.S. diplomatic effort to settle the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. presidential emissary for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, was
in Cyprus early this month in a bid to get the island's Greek and
Turkish communities back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
But the trouble-shooter appointed last year failed his mission
due to preconditions set by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
which demand recognition of his self-styled Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus and withdrawal of Cyprus' application for the
European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Brill said, when asked if the U.S. acknowledges that President
Clerides represents both communities on the island, that "in the
intercommunal talks there are two sides."
</P>
<P>
"But it is also clear that the U.S. has relations with the
government of Cyprus and does all of its official business on
Cyprus with the government of Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Brill's positions, government spokesman Christos
Stylianides Wednesday welcomed any statements which "reconfirm
recognition of the internationally recognized government of the
Cyprus Republic."
</P>
<P>
He also said the government welcomes any statements that
international efforts in Cyprus are aimed at reaching a
bicommunal, bizonal federation.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third in the aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Urges for Education of Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei here on Wednesday called on officials to pay "serious
attention" to the education of the young people.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Khamenei told
officials of the center for the intellectual promotion of children
and the young adults that the Islamic revolution wants a young
generation to get learned and go forward with an inquiring spirit
and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"We are required to think of the education of children and the
young adults and accord high importance to it, but, unfortunately,
some people involved in cultural affairs do not give the due
attention to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official figures showed that about 51 percent of the
country's population are under the age of 20 and were born after
the 1979 Islamic revolution which topple the shah's regime. It has
become a serious concern for the Islamic leadership.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also expressed concern over foreign influence on
Iran's younger generation, saying that foreign cultural centers
are making every attempt to reach the young people "through their
corrupt cultural means."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "I believe we can block the access of
foreigners to our children through our good performance and
precise and scientific methods."
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader called on writers and artists to fill the
leisure time of the young people, saying that with the
intellectual promotion of the young the future of the country
would be guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Develop Capital, Security Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Financial Minister
Antonio Mariano announced here Wednesday that capital and
security markets will be established in the year 2000 to help
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Mariano made the announcement in a speech at the symposium on
national capital and security markets, saying it will be a
gradual and precautious process which requires a series of
economic and legitimate regulations as well as reforms on the
monetary and banking systems.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that some pre-requisites must be
accomplished which include a stable macro-economy, putting an end
to mal-management of state run enterprises, revision on
investment law, expand bank network and modernizing the banking
administration.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the setting up of the markets is an
important element for economic and social development. It will
also promote significant social innovation, so that the private
sector can realize its development and expansion under the law of
the market.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister believed that the establishment of capital
and security markets will help obtain large sum of capital which
may help serve public and domestic debts and the settlement of
long and medium-term foreign debts, in addition to providing
capital for economic rehabilitation and development.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by the Finance Ministry, is aimed to
understand the market operation in a bid to make the Angolan
markets operate within two years.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Downplays Probes against Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
on Wednesday downplayed the investigations launched against him,
saying they were "not important."
</P>
<P>
Addressing his Motherland Party Wednesday, Yilmaz said that "I
am at ease, you should also be at ease."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Turkish parliament voted to launch a second probe
into allegations that Yilmaz cost state money by awarding
consulting work to private firms.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's rival ex-premier Tansu Ciller's True Path Party (DYP)
accused him of awarding a feasibility study for the construction
of a second Istanbul airport to two private firms instead of
government agencies, arguing that the government agencies could do
the same job 18.4 million U.S. dollars cheaper.
</P>
<P>
The parliament launched its first investigation in April, which
was also urged by the DYP, into Yilmaz's personal wealth on
allegations that he had omitted some shares in the Finance Bank
between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yilmaz criticized Chairman of the Republican
People's Party (CHP) Deniz Baykal for supporting the inquiries.
</P>
<P>
The CHP, the main political ally of the government led by
Yilmaz, has voiced support for both inquiries..
</P>
<P>
Baykal said the CHP would continue its support to the minority
government under Yilmaz, but it opposed all corruption no matter
who did it.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the two inquiries against Yilmaz were a
retaliation for the probe now underway into Ciller's private
property.

<HEADLINE> Hedging Contributes to World Gold Price Fall, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The widespread use of hedging by
gold producers in the past 10 years was one of the factors leading
to the fall in the price of the metal, the Financial Times
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a latest study by the World Gold Council, the newspaper
said that as gold producers realized gold prices were on an
extended downward path, they accelerated their hedging activities
last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the study estimated that an additional 500 tons of
gold supply reached the market last year, almost equivalent to all
the new gold produced in South Africa, the biggest producer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
It said that a year ago, a successful hedge program simply
increased a producer's profitability, but now the survival of many
gold mine depends on hedging.
</P>
<P>
However, the study noted that in the short term, hedging is not
likely to be repeated on the same scale as many new gold projects
are being delayed because of the low prices of the metal.
</P>
<P>
It added that the growth of hedging was helped by the
increasing readiness of central banks to lend gold to provide
liquidity for funding hedge transactions.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, central banks lending rose to an annual
4,000 tons from only 400 tons.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Students Drop in Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada has lost ground during the
1990s in attracting foreign students to its schools and
universities, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1995, there were 72,700 students from more than
200 countries studying in Canada at all formal levels of
education, down 11.6 percent from the peak in 1991.
</P>
<P>
This contrasts with countries such as Australia and Britain,
where enrolments of foreign students have continued to grow during
the 1990s, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Enrolment of foreign students in Canada has declined for four
straight years since peaking at 82,200 in 1991. So, despite the
losses in the 1990s, enrolments in 1995 remained 48.2 percent
above the 1985 level, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Asia maintained its long-term status as the major source of
foreign students here in Canada. Throughout the 1990s, nearly half
of the foreign students here have come from Asia.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the largest source of Asian students was Hong Kong,
with 5,900 or 8.2 percent of all foreign students in the country.
In 1991, Canada had a record 13,750 Hong Kong students, or 17.0
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The most popular field of study among foreign university
students in Canada was social sciences, which was chosen by 28.6
percent of the students in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, 14.2 percent of them chose the engineering/applied
sciences field. Another 12.0 percent chose mathematics/physical
sciences, and only 3.0 percent chose education.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Air Raids Kill 10 Palestinians in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 10 Palestinians were
killed and 27 others wounded in Israeli air raids on eastern
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley Wednesday morning, Lebanese National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Israeli warplanes carried out two raids on the
bases of the faction of the Palestinian Liberation movement, Fatah
the Uprising, in Diera Taniyel, central part of Bekaa Valley, a
few miles from Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
During the first raid which started at 1.20 a.m. (2200 GMT
Tuesday), Israeli jets fired four air-to-surface missiles into
suspected targets.
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later, they returned and dropped four packs
each containing 188 cluster and fission bombs which the
Palestinian group claimed are the internationally banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, the wounded palestinians were quickly
taken to several hospitals in the region for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The mosques nearby called on residents through its
loudspeakers to immediately donate their blood for the wounded,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah the Uprising, a splinter group of the Fatah led by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said in its two statements that
four Israeli warplanes launched three raids on an administrative
and medical facility belonging to the group, leaving its six
fighters dead.
</P>
<P>
They vowed to make the Zionist enemies pay for their "savage
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based Fatah the Uprising has quit Arafat's Fatah
and opposes the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal.
</P>
<P>
It was last hit by Israeli forces in 1996 after its fighters
carried out a bomb explosion operation inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement confirmed the raids,
saying Israeli Air Force warplanes Tuesday night attacked
terrorist positions in the area of the Lebanese Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
The pilots reported that the targets were hit and returned
safely to their bases, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came one day after two Israeli soldiers
were wounded by the rockets fired by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah unleashed several Katyusha missiles into northern
Israeli area of Galilee Monday night to revenge Lebanese
civilians wounded in previous Israeli artillery shellings.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 to buffer guerrilla attacks, Lebanon's
resistance forces have locked Israeli troops and its allied South
Lebanon Army in a war of attrition.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday warned the United Nations Observer Mission in
Georgia (UNOMIG) is facing difficulties, while the momentum
created by the groundwork laid in the past few months has been
slowed down by a number of developments.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on UNOMIG to the Security Council, Annan
cited such reasons as the holding of "local elections" in
Abkhazia, Georgia, the implementation of a "privatization law" and
proposed changes of place-names there, as well as recent problems
in the normal functioning of the working groups of the
coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also said there have been difficulties encountered
on Georgian controlled territory relating to the normal operation
of UNOMIG or the provision of humanitarian and other assistance to
Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Annan invited the parties to the conflict to abstain from any
action that might undermine efforts under way, to do their
utmost in support of the peace process and to display the
necessary political will in order to get concrete results on the
central issues of the return of refugees and the political status
of Abkhazia which has tried to separate from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed concern at the personal safety of unarmed United
Nations military observers, following the hostage-taking incident
on February 19. He proposed that the Security Council consider the
provision of a self-protection unit to guard the Mission's
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Meet Zambia's Jailed Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela may meet Zambia's former president Kenneth Kaunda
during his visit to Zambia later this month, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The jailed former Zambian leader is waiting for trials on
charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
Mandela Wednesday referred to Kaunda as "great leader Kenneth
Kaunda" when he accepted credentials from Zambia's new envoy to
South Africa, Bizwayo Nkunika, in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would meet Kaunda when he visited Zambia,
Mandela said: "I don't know whether I'm going to Zambia, but if I
do... and if there is an opportunity for me to see him, I would
be happy to do so."
</P>
<P>
Mandela thanked Kaunda and the people of Zambia for their role
in South Africa's struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Few leaders in the world would have been so brave as to risk
the future of their country to ensure that the suppression of
human rights in South Africa should be removed, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very grateful to the people of Zambia generally and
President Kaunda in particular."
</P>
<P>
Mandela was originally scheduled to visit Zambia early next
week for talks with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, but the
trip was postponed under mutual agreement.
</P>
<P>
He will attend the 50th celebrations of the World Trade
Organization summit in Geneva on Tuesday instead, SAPA quoted
Parks Mankahlana, the presidential spokesman, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A new date has not been scheduled for the Zambia visit,
although it could take place later this month.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that the trip should take place as soon as
possible," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Mandela planned to meet Kaunda, the spokesman
said: "It would not be outrageous to anticipate that the
president would find time to meet Dr. Kaunda, given Dr. kaunda's
standing, not only in Zambia, but in the whole of southern
Africa."
</P>
<P>
However, Mankahlana said Mandela would first discuss "that
kind of meeting with President Chiluba."
</P>
<P>
"He would want to hear President Chiluba's views -- which he
would take seriously -- before meeting Dr. Kaunda."
</P>
<P>
Mandela was among the southern African heads of state who
called for Kaunda's release when he was arrested on Christmas Day
last year in connection with an attempted coup to overthrow
Chiluba's government.

<HEADLINE> India's Tests Ignite Fierce Debates in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- India's five nuclear tests
dominated Senate's debate on Wednesday morning on a
Republican-backed bill aimed at speeding up development of a
system, which was said to be designed to shield the United States
from a nuclear missile attack.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Republican Senators Thad Cochran and
Daniel Inouye, would direct the Pentagon to deploy such a system
as soon as technologically possible.
</P>
<P>
"This administration is taking a wait and see attitude --
wait and see if there's a threat," Cochran said. "The fact is,
the threat exists now."
</P>
<P>
The administrations' present program requires the
identification of an emerging ballistic missile threat first
before it mandates a three-year period to develop the actual
hardware.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Jon Kyl said Indian nuclear testing had
demonstrated to the administration that "We won't necessarily
know when there's a threat."
</P>
<P>
Another Republican Senator, Fred Thompson said: "We're
hearing the thunder now ... reminding us that some countries are
more technologically clever than we gave them credit for."
</P>
<P>
The bill was brought to a quick vote by Republican sponsors
who attempted to override Democratic delaying tactics. But such
a parliamentary move requires 60 votes. the voting result was
59-41 and the bill failed to be approved in the Senate.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Israeli Labor party,
Ehud Barak, on Wednesday was criticized by some of his party
members for his remarks on keeping settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of settlements in the West Bank Tuesday, Barak
said that Beit El and Ofra, two major Jewish settlements, will
remain under Israel's rule forever.
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset (Parliament) member Uzi Baram told Israel Radio
that Barak's remarks were his own view and the party will not
accept it.
</P>
<P>
Another Labor Knesset member Yael Dayan said the party has made
it clear that it will recognize an independent Palestinian state
and its border with Israel will be decided in the final status
negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He added that at present any individual could not reach such a
conclusion in connection with the future border.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Labor whip Elie Goldschmidt voiced his
support to the party leader, contending that Barak's remarks were
in line with Labor's platform.
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt noted that according to the platform, main Jewish
settlements in the West Bank should remain under Israeli
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Rules out Individual Action Against India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday ruled out punitive action by the South
African government against India, saying he would prefer a common
approach under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the latest nuclear tests by the Indian government,
he said: "Our position is well-known: We have condemned without
reservation the proliferation of nuclear weapons and called upon
all countries to help the United Nations promote peace and
stability in the world," South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The proliferation of destructive weapons is contrary to those
efforts and therefore we condemn it (the tests) without
reservation," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
On whether South Africa would follow the United States'
example and impose sanctions against New Delhi, he said:" We
prefer that all these things should be done by the United Nations
and that no country should take an individual position on matters
that affect the international community."
</P>
<P>
The South African government Tuesday condemned the three
underground nuclear tests carried out by India on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the government
was "deeply concerned" about the testing, adding "The South
African government opposes the testing of nuclear devices as a
matter of principle and hopes that these tests (of India) will
not lead to an arms race in south Asia."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ready to Cooperate with UAE: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Metin Gurdere
said Wednesday that Ankara was ready to cooperate with the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) in energy, finance, tourism and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 5th Turkish-UAE Joint
Economic Commission conference in Ankara, Gurdere said that the
two countries' historical ties have formed the basis for improved
economic and commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the two governments should help entrepreneurs
expand trade, Gurdere said that Ankara would create appropriate
conditions for their public and private sectors to enable them to
cooperate smoothly with their UAE counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Turkish trucks carrying exports to the UAE have to go through
three countries after the Gulf War in 1991, which blunted the
competitive edge of Turkish goods due to high customs tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Gurdere suggested the problem be solved by increasing sea and
air shipments between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
UAE Minister of Economy and Commerce Fahim bin Sultan Al-Qasimi
also voiced willingness to cooperate with Turkey, especially in
privatization and finance.
</P>
<P>
He said Abu Dhabi hoped to learn from Turkey's experiences in
privatization and stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Clinches $530 Million from Western Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Wednesday clinched a hefty
economic support package of 530 million U.S. Dollars from western
donors for projects and reforms programs, reported the Zambia
News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The package was delivered to Edith Nawakwi, Zambia's Minister
of Finance and Economic Development, by representatives of the
Paris Club at the end of a two-day consultative meeting with a
Zambian governmental delegation that ended Wednesday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The package, which is less than the 610 million U.S. Dollars
demanded by Zambia as support need, is split into two components,
235 million Dollars for program support and a further 295 million
Dollars for project assistance.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pledged funds could start flowing into the country
as early as June 1, 1998, said ZANA.
</P>
<P>
However, the funds may not entirely fall in the lap of the
Zambian government as the donors are categorical that the issues
of good governance, alleged torture of prisoners detained in
connection with last October's foiled military coup and
meaningful dialogue with opposition parties be redressed.
</P>
<P>
Another precondition is that the widest possible
participation in local government elections to be held next
month be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Zambian Finance Minister assured the
donors that his country will be committed to addressing their
concerns and she expressed the gratitude of the Zambian
government and people to them.
</P>
<P>
While the delegates of the donor countries also promised that
their pledged amounts can be increased later in the year if
additional reforms in the areas of democracy, governance and
human rights are changed positively in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The donors also asked the Zambian government to speed up
privatisation of the on-going privatisation of the state-owned
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines and macro-economic stability.

UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the

Chamber of the International Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed to enable the International Tribunal for the
Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of
International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the
Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (The International Tribunal) to try

</P>
<P>
The Council urged all States to cooperate fully with the
International Tribunal and its organs in accordance with their
obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Council requested the U.N. Secretary-General to make
practical arrangements for the elections and for enhancing the
effective functioning of the International Tribunal, including
the timely provision of personnel and facilities, in particular
for the third Trial Chamber.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: G-15 Cries Help for Checking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 15 (G-15) wound up its
summit here Wednesday while calling developed countries and
international financial institutions to help overcome the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit also focused on South-South cooperation
and South-North dialog.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
attended, among other leaders, by presidents of Indonesia, Kenya,
Algeria, Zimbabwe and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 leaders called for an appropriate global response to
deal with both the financial crisis and the strengthening of
regional and international cooperation in managing such crises in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The leaders urged rich countries and international lenders to
help the Asian states hit by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia, two members of the G-15, are caught in
the center of the crisis and severely hit.
</P>
<P>
But they noted that such assistance should not be conditional
on economic reforms leading to social instability.
</P>
<P>
"Marcroeconomic measures designed to restore market confidence
will not yield the intended results if they lead to social
strife," the leaders said a joint communique issued at the end of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the need for South-North dialog, the G-15 leaders
said that the will to shape a balanced and constructive
South-North relationship through the 21st century turns out to be
a must.
</P>
<P>
The dialog should be "on a systematic basis to address the
challenges posed by the rapidly integrating financial markets and
expanding international capital flows," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo summit took place shortly before the ministers of
trade of the World Trade Organization members meet in Geneva to
consider more globalization measures and the leaders of G-8 major
industrial nations gather in Birmingham, Britain.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the importance of South-South cooperation, the G-15
leaders said they realized the need for continued consultation and
cooperation among developing countries in exchanging experiences
on dealing with the implications of the financial crisis and
avoiding future ones.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its eight-year history, the G-15, an offshoot of the
developing countries' Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement,
has been trying to establish itself as the most vibrant emerging
markets of the Third World, standing abreast with the rich G-7
club in the north.
</P>
<P>
Inter-trade among the G-15 members, about 11 percent of their
overall trade which amounted to 500 billion U.S. dollars in 1996,
is limited. Yet the summit, with its side-line trade fair and
businessmen's forum, highlighted the available facilities and
opportunities for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, founded in 1989, is actually a G-15 plus one after
Kenya became its 16th member in 1997, joining Algeria, Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia,
Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The 16 developing countries from Africa, Asia and Latin
America, are home to 30 percent of the world's population and
account for 39 percent of the Third World GDP.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Argentine Charges over Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi here Wednesday criticized the Argentine
government for renewing accusations against Tehran over a
terrorist blast four years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Mohammadi termed
the charges pressed by Argentine officials as an "unconstructive
behavior," warning that the "continuation of such behavior will
draw serious reaction from the Iranian government."
</P>
<P>
A number of Argentine officials recently accused Iran of having
been behind the 1994 bomb blast in a Jewish center in Buenos Aires
which killed 88 people and injured 159 others. Argentine
government has appointed a new judge to probe into the case.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi criticized the move, saying "we have lodged protests,
via our consul general, with the Argentine Foreign Ministry
concerning the baseless accusations by some Argentine officials."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the allegation that Iran has not cooperated
with the Argentine government in its investigation of the bomb
blast, reminding Argentine officials that "their foreign minister
had expressed satisfaction" with the stands adopted by Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "we have not forgotten that subsequently we
submitted documents to Argentine authorities proving fraudulent
activities by a cunning man residing in the U.S. by the name of
Motamer, who had toyed with the judge looking into the case."
</P>
<P>
"We realized that Zionist circles are taking advantage of our
good will and now we caution the Argentine government not to be
deceived by other cunning men and to demand evidence from anybody
who levels charges against Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the bomb explosion in 1994, an Iranian national,
Manouchehr Motamer, offered some information to the Argentine
authorities, claiming Iranian diplomats in Buenos Aires were
involved in the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The charge has been repeatedly rejected by Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Predicts Nuclear Arms Race following India's Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Wednesday that India's nuclear tests would have a
chain reaction with nuclear arms race in the world.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a chain reaction ... There will be other
countries that see this as an open invitation to try to acquire
this technology," he told a Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
"We have a real proliferation problem that's taking place
globally. This (the Indian tests) is only going to contribute to
that. It's going to cause other countries to find a rationale,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the best response for the United States was to
impose tough sanctions on India, to try to persuade other
countries to impose sanctions and to press other countries not
to follow India's suit.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we can encourage and be successful in encouraging
the Pakistanis not to follow suit. We can continue to urge the
Russians not to transfer nuclear technology to the Iranians, for
example," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday that
he had imposed economic sanctions against India.
</P>
<P>
He told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl that the tests could lead to "dangerous instability in the
region." India should not conduct more tests and its neighbor
Pakistan should remain calm, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from South Africa
and the European Union (EU) are unlikely to meet their mid-1998
deadline set for concluding talks on a proposed free trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
This followed recent major rifts between the two negotiating
parties, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted The Namibian daily as saying that
negotiations in Brussels, Belgium, last month had collapsed, with
the South African team expressing frustration over the EU's
refusal to make substantial concessions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is seeking to reduce its tariffs at a much slower
pace than the EU.
</P>
<P>
Unless a deal was achieved by the end of July, it would be
difficult to secure an accord, EU sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was because the EU would have to direct more attention to
the reform of its regional aid programs and to the overall reform
of the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
The EU has called for the liberalization of 90 percent of
trade over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the proposed agreement, South Africa would lift
barriers on 85 percent of European products and the EU would
offer South Africa free access for 95 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
Southern African states, including Namibia, have raised fears
that a free trade agreement between South Africa and the EU could
result in cheap European goods flooding the regional market to
the detriment of local industry.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's lucrative beef industry, which contributes 90
percent of the agricultural gross domestic product, is likely to
suffer the most if existing tariff protection is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Namibia's major market for livestock and meat
products, accounting for more than 70 percent of the country's
total exports.

JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South African cabinet Wednesday
approved the controversial Employment Equity Bill and the Skills
Development Bill, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Equity Bill will now go to the parliament for
approval.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which forces businesses of more than 50 employees to draw
up and follow plans for affirmative action, was vehemently opposed by
white-based opposition parties. They feared that the recruitment of
unskilled black workers would hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor Ministry argued that the bill aimed to remedy
past discrimination in the work place.
</P>
<P>
The bill provided for severe fines for businesses which failed to
implement the legislation.
</P>
<P>
An unusually heated debate is expected when the bill goes to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Skills Development Bill aims to invest more money to training.

ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Around 5,000 people took to the
streets Wednesday in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, to protest
the attempted killing of Akin Birdal, a leading human rights
activist, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered before the Istanbul branch of the Human

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Go Up 0.5 percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide retail sales
rose 0.5 percent in April, a remarkable gain following a flat
March, the Commerce Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales helped jump to a seasonally adjusted 222
billion U.S. dollars in April, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The gains included increased purchases of spring clothing,
gardening and home-improvement supplies, food and autos.
</P>
<P>
The lowest unemployment rate since 1970, along with almost no
inflation, has helped stimulate a buying heat this year. A plunge
in mortgage rates, encouraging home sales, also has helped the
Americans go shopping.
</P>
<P>
The boom started during this year's mild winter. Post-holiday
discounts and unseasonably warm weather boosted retail sales by a
huge 1.0 percent in January and an upwardly revised 0.9 percent in
February. February sales originally were reported at 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department recently also revised its March retail sales
figures to reflect steady sales in that month instead of the 0.1
percent drop reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods, such as hardware and cars which could
last for at least three years, were up 0.5 percent in April, after
dropping 0.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Stores that sell gardening and home-improvement supplies
increased their sales by a healthy 1.6 percent in April after a
flat March.
</P>
<P>
However, furniture and appliance sales dropped a 0.4 percent
again in April following a 0.5 percent drop in March. But that has
only slightly slowed a huge buying spree begun this winter.
</P>
<P>
Auto dealerships' sales rose by 0.7 percent in April after
decreasing by 0.1 in March.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods, including clothing and food, rose
again in April by 0.6 percent after a 0.2 percent rise in March.
Clothing sales shot up by 1.3 percent after holding steady in
March, and total sales at department and specialty stores were up
0.8 percent in April after a 0.2 percent March rise.
</P>
<P>
Bars and restaurants posted a 0.8 percent increase in April
sales as well, and drug store sales were up 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales at gasoline services stations rose only a slight 0.1
percent in April, following a string of declines prompted by low
fuel prices.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
dispatched U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot to
Pakistan on a mission to persuade the country not to conduct
nuclear tests as its neighbor India had done, the State Department
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president had a very constructive discussion with the
prime minister of Pakistan and as a result of that discussion a
mission is going to be sent to Pakistan.... They are going to be
leaving this afternoon," spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, who commands U.S. forces in
the Middle East and Southwestern Asia, will also go. "They are
going to be meeting with the Pakistani government on Friday.
They're obviously going to discuss the question that has now
arisen from India's nuclear tests and the danger to the region of
India's testing program," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We will be following up, of course, on the president's urging
of restraint on the Pakistani government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank said a meeting of donors ready to
promise aid to India had been canceled as Japan, responding to
India's nuclear tests, declined to host the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting that was scheduled for June 30 and July 1 has been
canceled," a World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the World Bank has no plans to find another
venue for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans at this point as far as relocation or
rescheduling is concerned," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's announcement came as Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto said Wednesday that Japan would not host the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would have been attended by bilateral donors from
Europe and Asia and by multilateral aid organizations. Last year's
meeting, held in Paris on June 25, pledged 6.7 billion dollars in
aid after India promised to open up its economy.

WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday the approval of a 62.8 million U.S. dollar interest-free
credit to the Bolivian government to help finance the

</P>
<P>
The project aims to promote economic development of rural

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry
protested on Wednesday against the European Union's decision to
boycott settlement products from Israel by imposing heavy customs
duties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the EU decision
is "unfair" and would be "harmful" to reviving the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU on Wednesday decided to ask all its 15 members not to
exempt customs duties for products made by Israeli settlements in
the occupied territories. These include agricultural products,
processed foods, wines, flowers and others.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused that the EU's decision violated the trade
agreements signed with Israel, which give partial or complete
exemption from customs duties to Israeli products of these
categories.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that the occupied territories are not part of
Israel, and therefore the settlement products would be subjected
to heavy customs duties.
</P>
<P>
In April, EU threatened to imposed customs duties on products
from Israeli settlements. Israel was making diplomatic efforts to
block the EU move, which it regarded as a grave threat politically
rather than economically.
</P>
<P>
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. In Gaza alone the number is 19.
</P>
<P>
The settlements which encroach on ever-more Palestinian lands,
are armed enclave constantly guarded by Israeli soldiers who often
outnumbered the settlers themselves.

The representative hailed Hong Kong's smooth handover to China
in July 1997, saying that Hong Kong still functioned as a market
economy, committed to free enterprise and free trade, enjoying a
high degree of autonomy and managing its own finances, trade and
economy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government had never interfered
in Hong Kong's affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Any fears that may have previously existed about China
interfering in the running of Hong Kong have been despelled after
the handover, and the Chinese leaders have repeatedly stated that
the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" will be strictly
observed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the trade volume between Hong Kong and Greece stands
at more than 315 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lee also called on Greek businessmen to participate in Hong
Kong's trade fairs, many of these fairs are the largest events of
their kind in the region.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, the first to be held in Greece after Hong Kong's
return to Chinese sovereignty, was jointly organized by the HKTDC
and Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

<HEADLINE> European Union Calls Kosovo Talks Good News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Wednesday
hailed the would-be talks between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and Kosovo's Albanian minority leader Ibrahim Rugova on
resolving their difference as "good news" and urged both sides to
seize this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country is the
current EU president, said in a statement issued Wednesday
afternoon,: "It is good news that Milosevic and Rugova will meet
face to face on Friday. This meeting has been made possible by the
sustained pressure from the EU, the Contact Group and others in
the international community over the last two months."
</P>
<P>
"We now look to both sides to make full use of this opportunity
for constructive political dialogue, particularly to the
authorities in Belgrade given their primary responsibility as the
government to see a negotiated solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke persuaded the
two parties to open a political dialogue in Belgrade Friday in a
bid to resolve the dispute over Kosovo, where 90 percent of its
populations are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
At a London meeting of the G-8 foreign ministers last week, an
investment ban was imposed upon the Belgrade government, which was
blamed for failing to open peace talks with Kosovan ethnic
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls on Iraq to Continue Cooperation with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac on
Thursday called on Iraq to continue to cooperate with the United
Nations in the work of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Tarik Aziz in
the Elysee presidential palace, Chirac also congratulated Baghdad
for showing a ``new spirit of cooperation'' with the U.N., said
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France hopes the new spirit of cooperation
between Iraq and the UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission in charge
of disarmament in Iraq, will be maintained and amplified by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The reintegration of Iraq into the international community is
possible, wishful, and the road to arrive at that exists. It
passes via the application of United Nations resolutions and
notably by the elimination of arms of mass destruction," Chirac
told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He called on Baghdad to make more gestures of cooperation, and
adopt "a modern attitude" and "a different approach which is
marked by a still closer cooperation" with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who has been on a five-day visit to France since Tuesday,
was the first member of the ruling Revolutionary Council of Iraq
to be received by the French president since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has asked for a "legalist interpretation" of the U.N.
resolutions on Iraq, in order to have the sanctions imposed
through these resolutions lifted as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said he has "a sincere conviction" that Iraq has met the
requests of the U.N. on eliminating arms of mass destruction. He
asked for French support in the U.N. on the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the UNSCOM of behaving like an "adversary" of
Iraq and blamed it for the extension of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France had always had "a legalist reading" of
the U.N. sanctions, but promised that France would be one of the
countries which would "help shed light until the end of the
tunnel" in any future dispute between Iraq and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
on Tuesday in Paris, Aziz briefed Annan on the latest developments
in U.N. arms inspections in Iraq and called for the lifting of the
seven-year, crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the
U.N..

<HEADLINE> Russia Tightens N.Exports Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Government has decided
to tighten controls over the exports of nuclear technology, an
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The President's Press Secretary of Russian Federation, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, told the press that the government had ordered
measures to tighten controls over nuclear-sensitive exports, as
Russia considered any form of proliferation a threat to its own
security.
</P>
<P>
"The proliferation of nuclear and other forms of weapons of
mass destruction, the technology of producing them and delivery
means, particularly in countries bordering Russia and near its
regions, are viewed as a serious threat to the security of
Russia," Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian Space Agency will be responsible for
framing the national policy to guide the supervision of nuclear
exports. All firms dealing with nuclear and missile technology
would have special export units set up to monitor procedures
within the companies and ensure that sensitive materials do not
go astray.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government on Wednesday passed guide lines on
establishing a nuclear exports supervising system in related
companies.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered in the Foreign Ministry, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin also stressed the necessity of supervising
nuclear exports to prevent sensitive technologies and materials
from proliferating.

<HEADLINE> China Condemns India's Nuclear Tests: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is deeply
shocked and strongly condemns India for its recent series of
nuclear tests, Li Changhe, Chinese ambassador to the Conference on
Disarmament (CD), said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What the Indian government has done is undisguised contempt
for the international trend to ban nuclear tests completely," Li
told a plenary meeting of the CD.
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes a severe blow to the international efforts to
prevent the proliferation of the nuclear weapons and a major
challenge to the international community as a whole," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It will lead to serious consequences to the peace and
stability of the South Asian region and the whole world.,"
</P>
<P>
Li urged the international community to take a concerted stand
to strongly demand that India stop developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ignorant of the protests from all around the world, India
conducted two more nuclear tests on May 13, two days after it
announced that it had conducted three nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"China strongly urges this country to refrain from further
nuclear test," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a mere coincidence that a government official of
India claimed, just days before these nuclear tests were
conducted, that China represents the biggest threat," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"China poses no threat to any other country," Li said. "This
unfounded talk on a so-called China threat is utterly absurd."
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that India's accusation against China is totally
baseless and with ulterior motives: to find an excuse for its
development of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along pursued a policy of good neighborliness,
and is committed to develop friendly and cooperative relations, on
the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, with
all its neighboring countries, including India," the Chinese
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Since the very first day when China came into possession of
nuclear weapons, Li reaffirmed that China has solemnly declared
that at no time and under no circumstances will it be the first to
use nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"China has also undertaken unconditionally not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states
or nuclear-weapon-free zones," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Adopts New Citizenship Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 14(Xinhua) -- A major purpose of the new citizenship
law recently adopted by Vietnam's National Assembly is to provide
legislation that is more compatible with the government's policy,
the Vietnam News Agency(VNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The law will make Vietnamese communities outside the country an
inseparable part of the nation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This means that more than 2.5 million Vietnamese living in
foreign countries will be given a chance to strengthen their
relationship with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam by exercising
their rights to Vietnamese citizenship, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new law will also allow foreigners to apply for Vietnamese
citizenship while maintaining their original, provided they obtain
the consent of Vietnam's president, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the new law will maintain the principle of single
citizenship for Vietnamese and will not allow the extradition of
its citizen to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The new law of 42 articles and six chapters will become
effective from January 1, 1999, replacing the nation's first
citizenship law adopted on June 28, 1988.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Discusses Macao Law Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chief representatives from both sides
of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) Thursday vowed to
step up efforts to handle the law issues in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side, and his
Portuguese counterpart, Antonio Santana Carlos, held a three-hour
closed-door meeting here on Thursday afternoon and focused their
discussions on the law issues, which Carlos described as "very
important" to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Han stressed that law experts of both sides need to make the
utmost efforts and handle the issues in a "cooperative and
constructive spirit" because there remains a large quantity of
complicated law issues to be addressed in the final stage of the
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
The two chief representatives agreed to step up efforts towards
that end so that solutions acceptable to both sides can be sought
with regard to the law issues.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was the first since Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres' visit to Beijing last month and the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region
Preparatory Committee (SARPC) in Beijing earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Among the topics discussed by the two chief representatives
were the localization of a number of leading laws, the checkup of
laws still in use, judicial cooperation, the renewal of
international conventions applicable in Macao, and the contracts
whose terms will go beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached consensus on the renewal after 1999 of
the trade and cooperation agreement Macao signed with the European
Union in 1992, and narrowed their gap to near consensus on the
Company Law and a law on foreign business disputes arbitration,
according to Carlos.
</P>
<P>
Carlos also pledged that the Portuguese side will provide the
Chinese side with a list of laws that the Macao Government has
promulgated since 1976 and are still effective.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President Seeks Political Realignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
decided Thursday to seek a political realignment of the nation
aimed at breaking the opposition's yoke on the National Assembly,
or parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he is pushing to reshape the political camp because of
the urgency to tide over the current economic crisis, which has
ripped through the country since late last year.
</P>
<P>
"I will consider a political realignment after the June 4 local
elections," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
The president accused the majority opposition Grand National
Party (GNP) of damaging his efforts to pull the country out of the
economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
The GNP, which enjoys 161 seats in the 299-member parliament,
paid no attention to the president's appeal for bipartisan
cooperation for at least one year to cope with the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also frustrated Kim's bid to appoint Kim
Jong-pil by boycotting the National Assembly vote.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the ruling coalition, of the National Congress for
New Politics and the United Liberal Democrats, has already begun
to recruit opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
Some eleven national legislators and several mayors and
governors have defected from the GNP recently to join the ruling
camp.
</P>
<P>
The defections now threatens the GNP's fragile majority in the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has been seeking a political realignment
in accordance with South Koreans' wishes.
</P>
<P>
A survey last week showed that about 70 percent of South
Koreans support the political realignment.

(lower house) Gennady Seleznev said here Thursday that because of
a shortage of money, the Duma had no right to endorse the second
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 2).
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported that Seleznev
made the remark in a speech at the Moscow Institute on
International Relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the major barrier to the approval of the treaty was
financial problems. So far, the State Duma had received no
financial and economic feasibility reports from the government on
the ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said money was needed for the destruction of nuclear
weapons. However, the state budget did not include money for that
purpose, which made it impossible for State Duma to endorse the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the United States has been pressing Russia for
a quick endorsement of START 2. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
expressed the same hope in his Tuesday speech on Russia's current
foreign policies and tasks.

OTTAWA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid 0.8 percent

<HEADLINE> Older Boeing 737s Have More Wiring Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) said that results from the emergency
inspection on the Boeing 737s indicate that older planes likely
have more wiring problems.
</P>
<P>
Of the 185 Boeing 737s inspected so far, 106 wiring bundles
were found to have noticeable chafing in the insulation and
plastic coating protecting their fuel pump wires.
</P>
<P>
The FAA report Wednesday said that the most serious problems
appear to be on the oldest planes. In 19 planes with flight time
over 70,000 hours, six had wire bundles that were more than 50
percent chafed while three planes had wires that were fully
exposed.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in 110 planes with 50,000 to 60,000 flight hours, 17
had wire bundles that were more than 50 percent chafed while six
had wiring that was fully exposed.
</P>
<P>
But in 47 planes that had 40,000 to 50,000 flight hours, only
two had wiring bundles with more than 50 percent chafing and none
had wires that were exposed.
</P>
<P>
The FAA Sunday ordered operators to immediately inspect Boeing
737-100 to 500 series for possible fuel pump damage.

</P>
<P>
The group's mandate is to analyse industrial changes and to
make recommendations for measures or instruments which can be
developed or adapted.

<P>
The group, in an interim report published on Thursday, stressed
the importance of developing an effective and constructive social
dialogue at all levels, particularly in key areas such as
information and consultation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Party Schools Commemorate Debate on Criterion for Truth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The most valuable contribution of a
major debate on the criterion for testing truth was that it
prompted the transformation of the way of thinking for the whole
Party, concurred scholars from Party schools across the country at
a forum recently to mark the 20th anniversary of the debate held
here.
</P>
<P>
The way of thinking for a political party and nation mean how
they treat history, reality and the future, thus concerning the
direction of their existence and development, according to the
forum.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the forum agreed that the debate two
decades ago resulted in a combination of the basic principles of
Marxism with China's actual conditions, initiating the course for
its endeavors to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The debate helped people see the harm of the former way of
leftist thinking, and form a scientific way of thinking that
conformed with the demands of the present era, said Zheng Bijian,
executive deputy head of the Party School of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The third major mind emancipation in China's modern history,
the debate on the criterion for truth established Deng Xiaoping
Theory as the guiding ideology for the CPC, said Gong Yuzhi,
deputy head of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Mind emancipation is key to meeting the demand of pioneering in
new fields instead of following the beaten path, the forum held.
</P>
<P>
To inherit the pioneering spirit of the debate, the scholars
called on the whole Party to actively, completely and accurately
learn and implement the guidelines of the 15th CPC National
Congress, adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind
and seeking truth from facts, and initiate a new stage for China's
development.
</P>
<P>
They also called for Party schools across China to organize
cadres to study Deng Xiaoping Theory and enhance research on key
issues concerning the reality of the Chinese society and China's
reform and opening-up to help with the Party's and the
government's policy-making.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Epidemic Deteriorating in Mogadishu Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- International aid agencies
operating in Somalia have decided to stop all of their cholera
treatment activities in and around the capital Mogadishu,
effective on Friday, reports reaching here revealed.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA) Thursday told
reporters in Mogadishu they have received a letter explaining the
decision by the aid agencies operating under the Nairobi-based
Somali Aid Coordination Body (SACB).
</P>
<P>
The SACB held a meeting on April 30 and decided to stop giving
out all supplies or medical appliances to Mogadishu's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the aid agencies will also affect the health
workers in the quarantine camps who were given some incentives
for their contribution in the campaign against the cholera
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the decision was prompted by the
abduction of the aid workers of the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) in Mogadishu on April 15. In the letter
SACB said they have reconsidered the international laws in
relation with the abduction of the international organizations,
humanitarian workers and the current security situation in the
Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
The letter also said that the cholera situation in Mogadishu
is deteriorating. The two major cholera quarantines, Forlanini
and Bandir hospitals, are currently accommodating more than 500
cholera victims with a mortality of seven people per day.
</P>
<P>
There are also other victims who don't make to the hospitals
and die in their houses.
</P>
<P>
Dr Osman Mahamud Dufle and Dr Abdullahi Elmi Fonka,
coordinators of the JHA, have called on the international aid
agencies to reconsider their decision regarding the cholera task
forces (JHA, MSF-Spain, ACF-French, UNICEF and WHO) formulated to
combat the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The doctors spoke about severe shortage of supplies and lack
of chlorination in the over 500 shallow wells in Mogadishu.
Elsewhere in the country, there are reports of cholera spreading
in the northeastern town of Bosasso and the southern town of
Jilib.
</P>
<P>
In Bosasso alone, more than 100 cholera patients have been
admitted to hospitals where more than ten had died since the
beginning of the month. Meanwhile, more than 20 people have died
and a couple of hundred others were affected by the disease in
Jilib and its surrounding villages since late April.
</P>
<P>
There are also growing speculations that the disease may
further spread with the help of the rainy season which started
recently causing poor sanitation in those regions.

<HEADLINE> HK Concerned About EU Anti-Circumvention Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong expressed grave concern
here Thursday about the European Union's (EU's) anti-circumvention
action against imports of pocket flint lighters from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Alan Chu, Assistant Director-General of Trade, said here
Thursday: "The Trade Department is gravely concerned about the
EU's anti-circumvention action. We doubt the consistency of such
action with the World Trade Organization Agreement on
Anti-dumping, which does not contain any anti-circumvention
provisions."
</P>
<P>
The EU took the action because of a complaint lodged by the
European Lighters Manufacturers' Federation, which alleged that
anti-dumping duty imposed on gas fueled, non-refillable pocket
flint lighter from the Chinese mainland is circumvented by imports
of the same product from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"In our view the allegation is unjustified since our domestic
exports of the products to the EU are rather small," said the
official of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
He continued that the Trade Department would study the case in
detail and put forth its concerns to the European Commission to
seek an early termination of the case against Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The EU is charging anti-dumping duty on the kind of pocket
lighters from the Chinese mainland. The duty will be extended to
any Hong Kong company found guilty of circumvention.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's domestic exports of the pocket lighters to the EU
amounted to 500,000 HK dollars (64,000 U.S. dollars).

Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A number of recommendations were also made at the meeting,
which ended in Kathmandu on Wednesday. These include the adoption
of cost-effective communication links and transit switching
facilities within the region to meet the needs of voice and
non-voice traffic among the SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
The experts took due note of the revenues required to sustain
the development of networks to provide for greater access to rural
communities, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggested that telecom tariffs in the intra-SAARC
region be reduced to the lowest extent feasible, with a view to
achieving uniform tariffs, it said.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that member countries strive for low-tariff
service by providing direct links, especially those across borders
between member countries wherever feasible by using appropriate
switching and transmission technology.
</P>
<P>
They said the member countries should aim to digitalize all
inter-country links, preferably by December 1999, and seek
assistance of the International Telecommunication Union in setting
up websites and databases in the region for exchanging information
to accelerate telecom development.
</P>
<P>
In view of the various options available and the high costs
involved, the establishment of a SAARC satellite should be
deferred until "required demand" arises, said the representatives
from SAARC countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
They said the member countries should accord mutual recognition
of each other's certification or type approval of equipment
standards to facilitate standardization and harmonization of
customer premises equipment in the region.
</P>
<P>
SAARC should encourage research and development activities and
exchange of expertise in all telecom disciplines among the member
countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
And member countries should consider adopting the products and
technologies developed in the SAARC region, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that the development of human resources in
the telecom sector be further encouraged through greater
cooperation and better utilization of the existing training
facilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on telecom was held after SAARC information
ministers met for the first time late last month in Dhaka,
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The communication ministers of the SAARC countries will meet
later this month in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Blair Flies to Northern Ireland on "Yes" Vote Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
was due to fly to Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland,
Thursday afternoon in a bid to persuade unionists to back the
peace accord in a May 22 referendum.
</P>
<P>
A historical peace deal on ending the 30-year-old conflict in
Northern Ireland came into being on April 10 in the wake of 22
months of protracted talks among all groups concerned.
</P>
<P>
It is Blair's second visit to the divided province in eight
days as he pushes for a Yes vote in the referendum, which will be
held in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the nationalist community is expected to back
the agreement, but the government is worried that pro-British
unionist support is wavering.
</P>
<P>
Private opinion polls show that up to 40 percent of unionists
are undecided about the merits of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to address the concerns of the unionist community,
which accounts for 60 percent of the local population, Blair on
Wednesday stressed again that Sinn Fein could not join the new
Northern Ireland executive while still holding "guns under the
table."
</P>
<P>
Decommissioning was an essential part of the peace deal and
republicans could not "pick and choose" which parts they
supported, he said.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Leaves for Home to Tackle Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Suharto cut
short his three-day visit to Egypt and left here for home Thursday
afternoon after talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian leader was seen off at the Cairo International
Airport by Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa after they had a luncheon in Cairo Sheraton
near the airport.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old, Asia's longest-serving president was to rush
home to tackle the spreading demonstrations and riots in Indonesia
sparkled by gas price rises and fueled by popular resent of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Suharto arrived here Sunday to attend the three-day Group of 15
summit which ended Wednesday. He was conspicuously absent from a
joint press conference at the end of the summit Wednesday and sent
Foreign Minister Ali Atalas to stand in for him.
</P>
<P>
Atalas, answering a question, issued an appeal for restraint of
the whole nation to contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
During the brief talks earlier in the day, Mubarak and Suharto
discussed issues such as south-south cooperation, Asian financial
crisis as well as bilateral relations, according to the Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Mubarak-Suharto tete-a-tete summit in 15
years, although both have often met at larger regional or
international occasions. Egypt was the first country in the world
to recognize the independent Indonesia 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day official visit to Egypt, Suharto also visited
the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier in Cairo's eastern suburb of
Nasr City and laid a wreath of flowers on the nearby tomb of late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.

<HEADLINE> Laid-Off Workers Top Priority for Chinese Government: Jiang (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Therefore, Party committees and governments at all levels must
always show concern to them and take effective measures to protect
their interests," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the fundamental purpose of laying off redundant
workers from state enterprises and helping them find new
employment is to add impetus to China's economic growth and lay a
solid foundation for the common prosperity of the entire
population that includes the laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
He said the layoffs from state enterprises are just one of the
problems that have emerged in China's course of advancement. It is
completely different from the serious unemployment that afflicted
western countries during their periods of economic crises.
</P>
<P>
The current situation is also different from that in the early
1960s, when China had a serious shortage of job opportunities as a
result of major national economic difficulties, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Though we will meet a lot of new difficulties in raising the
efficiency of state enterprises and offering new jobs to the
laid-off workers, we have all favorable factors and ability to
overcome these temporal difficulties," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
However, he suggested the government strengthen its macro
control and ensure that layoffs in state enterprises be carried
out in steps and in a planned way, to avoid adding too much
employment pressure to the society.
</P>
<P>
"Some fundamental procedures and systems for the layoff and
re-employment of state-employed workers need to be established,"
he said, adding: "Before laying off their employees, the
enterprises must put forth suggestions on the basic life
guarantees and re-employment of the workers to be laid off."

MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov appealed to India on Wednesday to put an end to its
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the appeal at a press conference here after
meeting visiting Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who arrived on May 11 on a four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed senses opposed to nuclear tests in New
Dehli would prevail. He hoped India's move would not cause chain
reactions in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted that Russia opposed any operations that were
likely to break the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Russia-Vietnam ties, Primakov said he hoped both
sides would maintain and strengthen their traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the two countries had great potential for
economic cooperation. However, the annual trade volume between
them was only about 200 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan will suspend new aid loans to
India as additional sanctions in protest at New Delhi's nuclear
tests, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ambassador to India Hiroshi Hirabayashi will be
recalled temporarily, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has already suspended its new grants-aid-to India, worth
3.5 billion yen (26 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sanctions came in the wake of a second set of nuclear tests
by India on Wednesday, in defiance of international condemnation
of its three tests on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been the largest aid donor to India since 1986. In
October 1997, Japan made a commitment to extend 132.7 billion yen
(about 99.8 million dollars) in loans to India.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, about 20 members of four anti-nuclear
and peace groups held protest demonstrations in front of the
Indian Embassy in Tokyo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, including survivors of the 1945 atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, issued a statement against the
tests, saying that whatever reasons India has, nuclear tests
cannot be justified.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Less than 12 hours after President Clinton appealed for a
halt to all nuclear testing by India, the country's government
carried out two underground tests Wednesday to add to the three
blasts it conducted at the same testing range in the northeastern
desert on Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Russia have reached a broad agreement
on how to proceed with future nuclear arms inspections of Iraq,
now that the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared
itself ready to move out of an active disarmament phase and into
long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's anti-government demonstrations escalated into
rioting in the streets of the capital Wednesday as rampaging mobs
set shops and vehicles on fire and police responded with volleys
of tear gas and gunfire. Sporadic looting continued after
nightfall most by poor workers and unemployed young people.
</P>
<P>
-- The head of the Secret Service has privately warned
prosecutors that forcing his agents to testify in the Monica S.
Lewinsky investigation would have a devastating effect on their
ability to do their job and could result in the death of a
president, according to sources familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The House of Representatives voted 214-213 to pass a
landmark reform bill that would eliminate many of the barriers
separating banks, brokerage firms and insurers. But the vote
lacked the strong bipartisan support required for the Senate to
take up the issue this spring.
</P>
<P>
-- Hotel occupancy rates have fallen to their lowest point in
four years, the strongest proof yet that the nations's 88 billion
dollar a year lodging industry has a bad case of the overbuilding
blues. Occupancy rates in the first quarter fell slightly below 60
percent for the first time since 1994 and are expected to be down
from a year earlier during the important summer season.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Currency Liberalization Takes Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli citizens are essentially
free to do what they want with their foreign currencies from
Thursday on when the government formally lifted most restrictions
as a step further in the liberalization drive.
</P>
<P>
With the long-planned reform measures taking effect, Israelis
will be able to invest overseas unhampered, including in real
estate. They can open and manage bank accounts abroad in shekels
or other currencies as well, enjoying the privilege only accorded
exporters and immigrants before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign currency dealings in Israel will no longer
require special permits and overseas banks or brokers, rather they
can be done via licensed Israeli institutions. Quantitative limits
on personal holding of foreign currencies were also removed.
</P>
<P>
But for Israel's institutional investors, restrictions
remain. Provident funds and insurance companies still can not
invest more than 5 percent of their assets abroad. The ban on
foreign investors' dealing in shekel is still in place.
</P>
<P>
Trying to fend off criticism by the business community over
remaining curbs, the government has promised to lift all of them
sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures, announced on April 28 by the government,
virtually completed a decade-long liberalization process. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the changes would make many kinds
of business transactions easier and could help attract more
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ya'akov Neeman has said that these reforms
reflect Israel's confidence in the country's economic strength.
But he noted that the Knesset (Parliament) still needs time to
complete relevant legislation on the liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Bank Seeks to Stabilize Riel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 14 (Xinhua) -- National Bank of Cambodia held a
brainstorming session Wednesday to seek ways to stabilize the
riel, the local currency, as it slid to the lowest level since
February.
</P>
<P>
The riel's market value sank to 3,860 against the U.S. dollar
in some Phnom Penh exchange shops Wednesday, from 3,600 at the
same time last week, the local newspaper, "Cambodian Daily",
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders from local exchange shops were invited to the
National Bank to debate ways of halting the riel's decline and
preventing a rise in local market prices.
</P>
<P>
A representative agreed that the recent flood of riel onto the
market had contributed to the currency's fall.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have come from the provinces to buy gold and
dollars, which is why exchange shops are increasing the price of
the dollar," she said.
</P>
<P>
The currency traders also attributed this week's fall in the
riel to the failure of the bank to hold their usual twice-weekly
riel auctions because of public holidays.
</P>
<P>
National Bank Deputy Director Chea Sok blamed the downward
trend partially on the economy's heavy reliance on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from provinces went to Phnom Penh to exchange large
amounts of riel spent in markets over the New Year period last
month, causing the currency to lose strength against the dollar,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sok also blamed the plunge on the government's failure to
collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
In response, the National Bank is now offering riel for auction
and is appealing to businessmen to come and buy the currency at a
lower rate than offered on the local market.

<HEADLINE> Furniture Stores Lack Proper Fire Prevention, Check Reveals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's mushrooming furniture
stores lack proper fire prevention measures, according to a
special check of fire prevention today in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The check on seven major furniture stores and 15 other sites
was performed by municipal fire prevention departments in the wake
of a huge fire that destroyed one of Beijing's largest furniture
stored on May 5, which caused damages estimated at 100 million
yuan (12 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some of the stores were renovated from old workshops or
warehouses without adding a built-in fire prevention system, while
newly built ones are not equipped with proper fire warning and
extinguishing facilities, the check revealed.
</P>
<P>
At the 15,000-square-meter Chengwaicheng Furniture City,
officials discovered that the store doesn't have a fire partition
area, enough exits, nor sufficient water supply for fire control.
</P>
<P>
The store was consequently fined 6,000 yuan (723 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At Huansanhuan Furniture City, its automatic water spray system
is not linked to water sources, while the fire hydrant was
obstructed from access by cargo.
</P>
<P>
There are no fire doors between the seven halls at Jinwuxing
Sihuan Furniture City, while its building materials haven't been
treated with fire-resistant chemicals, the check revealed.
</P>
<P>
All furniture stores and other buildings that fail to meet the
city's regulations on fire prevention have been ordered to made
improvements within a certain time period.
</P>
<P>
More than 140,000 fires occurred across China last year,
causing damages of 1.54 billion yuan (185 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Preparing for Flood Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's meteorological departments
have been urged to pay great attention to the coming flood season.
</P>
<P>
Wen Kegang, director of the State Meteorological
Administration, said here today that the northern part of China
has suffered from drought since last winter, and the drought will
very likely continue.
</P>
<P>
However, rainfall in the southern part this spring amounted to
more than usual. Many main rivers and lakes in Hunan, Jiangxi and
Fujian provinces have all had floods this spring. And the water
levels of the main streams of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake and
Poyang Lake were on the high side, a rare occurrence in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
Two dust storms hit northern China in mid-April and there were
outbreaks of forest fires in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
and Heilongjiang Province last month. And the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau has been plagued by snowstorms from last winter to this
spring.
</P>
<P>
Wen called on local meteorological departments to maintain
sharp vigilance and strengthen the work of weather forecasting. In
case of disastrous weather, all the leaders of the meteorological
departments should work on the forefront, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Workers Top Priority for Chinese Government: Jiang (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China should also speed up development of the central and
western areas, Jiang said. The government could organize some
stagnant enterprises and laid-off workers to enhance local
economies in the western areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, state-owned enterprises are being encouraged to
expand their business overseas, in developing countries, in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at various levels must go deep into
state-owned enterprises, especially those crumbling ones, to keep
themselves well-informed of the daily life situation of laid-off
workers and their families and to solve their practical problems.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have banned any impractical measures
and bureaucratic style of work in the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted the Chinese Communist Party and the government have
drawn up a series of guidelines and policies addressing the
employment issue since the country adopted opening-up drive 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
For the last two decades, he said, China has created more than
250 million non-farming job opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy, a proper
employment mechanism must be established for optimizing the
essential factors in production, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, some local enterprises squandered public funds on
duplicate construction and production, he said. "We must put an
end to such practice," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Facing increasing challenges and fierce competition from
outside, enterprises themselves must enhance scientific
advancement, technological renovation, thus setting higher demands
for the scientific and cultural quality of the workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of central government ministries and leading officials
of all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly
under the central government attended today's conference.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Workers Top Priority of Chinese Government: Jiang (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that any state-owned enterprise cannot shirk its
responsibility for laid-off workers. Instead, he said, all
state-owned enterprises with layoffs should set up re-employment
service centers to pool laid-off workers, ensure their basic
living standard, conduct professional training and help them get
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said basic living expenses must be guaranteed for laid-off
workers, and the funds should be raised jointly by the government,
enterprises and social sectors. The money cannot be used for other
purposes and should be expedited into the hands of laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
The basic life of workers retired from state enterprises should
also be guaranteed, and they should be given pensions on time to
enjoy the favorable treatment they deserve, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will give banking, taxation and administrative
assistance to the laid-off workers who seek employment with their
own efforts, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Vocational education should be developed to a great extent, he
said. At the same time, laid-off workers should be guided to
change their views about employment to adapt to new situations
under the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
They should be encouraged to work in private business and
service trades, he said, and foreign-funded and private businesses
should be encouraged to hire laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that medium- and small-size enterprises should be
supported and protected, for they play an important role in
expanding employment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rural market should be better tapped, he
said. Stagnant enterprises and laid-off workers in urban areas can
provide services in the countryside, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Goods Market in Steady Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate in the sales of the
commodity market of China fell by 4.1 percentage points in the
first quarter of this year, compared to the same period last year,
a report of the State Internal Trade Bureau (SITB) says.
</P>
<P>
The total retail sales of consumer goods was about 713.6
billion yuan in the first three months of this year, up 8.5 percent
from the same period of 1997. However, the growth rate in the
sales of social consumer goods kept falling, by 10 percent in some
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The good performance period for the domestic consumer goods
market was in January, when the sales of consumer goods grew by
14.6 percent from the same period of 1997. The growth rate
began to decline in February.
</P>
<P>
During the January-March period of this year, sales of
production means in the Chinese market was about 759.5 billion
yuan, up three percent on the same period of last year. The growth
rate was 4.8 percentage points lower than that for the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Another report by the SITB says that the growth rate of total
sales of consumer goods and production means is usually two
percentage points higher than that of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the report adds, to ensure the projected 8-percent
growth of the national economy this year, the growth rate of total
sales of consumer goods and production means should reach 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Laid-Off Workers Top Priority for Chinese Government: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today urged
Party committees and governments at all levels across China to
give top priority to providing basic life guarantees for laid-off
workers from state-owned enterprises and helping them find jobs,
which he described as "an extremely arduous task."
</P>
<P>
"This is not only a major economic issue, but also a political
one. It has both realistic urgency and long-term strategic
significance," said Jiang, who also is general secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee. Jiang was
speaking at a national conference on basic life guarantees and
re-employment of laid-off workers from state-owned
enterprises. The conference opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji presided over the meeting, which is jointly
convened by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council,
China's cabinet. Li Peng, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing,
all members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central
Committee's Political Bureau, attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China's reform of state-owned enterprises has now
entered a critical stage, and the central government has decided
to help most large- and medium-size state enterprises currently
suffering losses to overcome their difficulties within a
three-year period.
</P>
<P>
"To attain this goal, we must first solve the overstaffing
problem that is haunting many state enterprises, and help them to
raise efficiency and competitiveness through laying off their
redundant employees," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the broad masses of workers in state enterprises in
the past decade have made tremendous contributions to the
country's economic development, reform and opening-up, as well as
the growth of the state sector.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Casualties Rising as Violence Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least three Palestinians were
killed and 70 others injured Thursday as violent clashes between
Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers continued spreading
across the Palestinian territories during the "million-man" march.
</P>
<P>
The first violent clashes erupted in the Gaza Strip in the
morning outside the Gush Katif settlement and near the Erez border
crossing.
</P>
<P>
Two were killed outside the settlement and one nurse shot dead
near Erez while trying to rescue the wounded, according to the
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC), the Palestinian
news service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers reportedly used live ammunition, rubber
bullets and tear gas to disperse the protesters. Another 35
Palestinians were wounded in the Gaza clashes, eight of them in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The JMCC identified the two dead in Gush Katif as Ashraf Arram
and Kamal Al Hasanat, and the nurse as Zamel Al-Wheidi.
</P>
<P>
In the flashpoint West Bank city Hebron, at least 35
Palestinians were injured, five of them critically wounded. The
violence broke out as about 1,000 Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli soldiers guarding the 450 Jewish settlers who remain
in the center of the mostly Palestinian city, the JMCC reported.
</P>
<P>
At least three Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets in
the clash near the border crossing in the West Bank city
Ramallah. In East Jerusalem, hundreds of Palestinians also clashed
with Israeli security forces after the protest turned violent.
</P>
<P>
Near the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb at the entrance to
another West Bank city Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters also
threw stones at Israeli soldiers guarding the site. No casualties
were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The widespread clashes occurred when Palestinians across the
territories held widespread protests to mark the 50th anniversary
of Nakba, or catastrophe, caused by the creation of the state of
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong: Right Choice for Tax Free Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The first two days of the ongoing
Tax Free Asia Pacific (TFAP) '98 demonstrated that Hong Kong is "a
right choice of venue" for hosting the regional trade fair, said
President of Tax Free World Association (TFWA) Jacky Paquet here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It was very natural for us to come to Hong Kong," he told a
press conference, saying the event, now entering its fifth year,
served as a recognition of Hong Kong's premier status in Asia
Pacific duty free sales.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong duty free sales amounted to 830 million U.S. dollars
in 1996 while the Kai Tak Airport, with sales of 380 million U.S.
dollars, beating all the other rivals to be the region's No. 1
retail outlet.
</P>
<P>
In view of the forthcoming opening of Hong Kong's new
international airport at Chek Lap Kok and the huge potential of
the Chinese mainland duty free market, the TFWA invested 20
million U.S. dollars for this year's exhibition, up 30 percent
compared with TFAP 1997 in Singapore, he continued.
</P>
<P>
A total of 260 exhibitors from more than 20 countries and
regions were displaying over 350 brands of duty free products at
the trade fair, which is to run through Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TFWA president anticipated the current regional financial
crisis to be "momentary and transitional" and was optimistic about
the region's long-term prospects for duty free business.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the economic situation, the duty free market in
Asia Pacific remains the world's fastest growing one, amounting to
about 21 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, or 30 percent of the
industry's worldwide sales, TFWA figures showed.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to organize TFAP in Hong Kong in 1999,"
paving the way for future business in the region, Paquet said.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to the future and investing in the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the exhibitors have confirmed that they will come back
next year, according to Secretary-general of the association
Ms. Elysabeth Blachais-Catoire, who was also present at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Chinese mainland duty free market, she said,
motivated by the healthy economic growth, the market is growing
fast.
</P>
<P>
TFWA will promote the duty free industry in this very important
market and will strengthen links with duty free and retail trade
organizations on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
"To further strengthen our contacts, we will attend China Duty
Free 1998 taking place in Beijing next week," said
Blachais-Catoire.
</P>
<P>
She even went on to forecast that "in a few years" her
association will organize an international trade event on the
Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Urged To Tackle Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Experts have warned that China has
to be fully aware of the "Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem," and
speed up its efforts to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
It is dangerous for people to believe that the Y2K problem will
not threaten China because computers are not as widely used here
as in developed countries, said Zhang Qi, chairman of the China
Computer Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, many of the country's important sections, such as
national defense, the financial industry, and posts and
telecommunications are already depending on computer networks to
operate, and will in turn be affected by the Y2K problem," Zhang
explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the People's Bank of China and its branches, the
Civil Aviation Administration of China and some other
organizations have already started tackling the problem. But some
departments still do not pay much attention to it.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that many old-model computers read the year
as two digits, such as "98" instead of "1998." Those computers
will misinterpret "00" as 1900, rather than 2000.
</P>
<P>
The most common way of eliminating the "Year 2000 bugs" is to
go through relevant computer programs and change the two-digit
identification into four digits, said Sun Yuning with the Computer
Technology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS). "These jobs will involve large groups of computer
technicians and may need several years to complete."
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem has already drawn deep concern from the
governments of the United States, Japan and some European
countries. American experts estimate that it may cost the United
States more than 50 billion U.S. dollars to tackle the problem,
while the total cost for the world will be 400-to-600 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem has already taken place in some
industries. Computers in some commercial centers have refused to
recognize credit cards which expire in 2000, because the "00" is
identified as "1900."
</P>
<P>
The former Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI) in China
issued a circular along with the former State Planning Commission
and State Science and Technology Commission in 1997 urging people
from various circles to make feasible plans to settle the Y2K
problem before 2000.
</P>
<P>
The MEI department in charge of the computer industry has
established a special group with IBM of the United States, and the
Computer Technology Institute of CAS also formed an expert
committee to help eliminate the "Year 2000 bugs" for Chinese
computer users.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Create Independent State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Marking the 50th anniversary of
Nakba, or "catastrophe," Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
reaffirmed the Palestinian determination to create an independent
state with Jerusalem as capital.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-recorded speech broadcast to the Palestinian people
by Palestinian radios and television, Arafat spoke with great
emotion on the 50 years of Palestinian sufferings caused by
occupation and persecution.
</P>
<P>
"Half century of wounds and pains have come to an end in our
history, our modern history: It's lighting of a huge flame before
the eyes of the whole mankind on our planet," Arafat said,
referring to the peace process he started with Israel in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader recalled the past pains of Israeli
occupation that led to the displacement of millions of
Palestinians from their homes since the 1948 war, in which Israel
defeated Arab forces and created a Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
He paid tributes to the Palestinian people for enduring the
half-century of sufferings and remaining loyal to their cause of
acheiving independence. He said the continued Palestinian
struggle and the bodies and blood sacrificed have brought the
world attention to the justice of their sacred struggle for
existence and independence.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all these sufferings, our people remain a tolerant
nation capable of enduring all pains and strongly attached to the
holiest of holy, to Jerusalem, our spiritual capital, capital of
our homeland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's speech was broadcast to the Palestinian participants
in the "million-man" march organized by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) in all major Palestinian towns and cities in the
Gaza Strip and West Bank. The march was aimed at wakening the
awareness among Palestinian people of the past pains of Israeli
occupation and to raise the expectation for a better future.
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, sirens were sounded and one-minute silence
was observed to mark the Nakba.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that no independent Palestinian should be
created because it could pose a threat to its security in future.
</P>
<P>
Despite the PNA's efforts to keep the "million-man march"
peacefull, angry Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli
soldiers in various sites across Gaza Strip and West Bank. Three
Palestinians were reportedly killed and 73 others wounded in
widespread clashes.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of violence is believed to cast shadow over the
current efforts made by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to break the impasse on deciding the size of the second Israeli
pullback in the West Bank. Albright is trying to persuade Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now in Washington, to accept a
U.S. plan on a major withdrawal of Israeli troops in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Election Results to Remain Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Unofficial results of the Philippine
elections would remain unknown for at least seven more days due to
the slowdown in the tabulation of results, a private quick-count
company said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel),
the sole non-governmental organization accredited by the
Commission on Elections to conduct a quick count of the votes,
said it would take Namfrel more than 10 days to come out with the
final results.
</P>
<P>
Before the elections, Namfrel said it could release the final
results within 10 days while the Commission on Elections said it
needs at least four weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Namfrel chairman Jose Concepcion said
that Namfrel's failure to retrieve the sixth copy of the election
returns and the fourth copy of the Certificate of Canvass in some
areas was delaying the posting of the results.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said some election inspectors at the precinct level
and some members of the Municipal Board of Canvassers failed to
cooperate with Namfrel volunteers by asking them to show
certificates of authority from Namfrel.
</P>
<P>
The failure by some inspectors to fill in the total number of
votes cast and other important data was also causing the delay of
the quick count, Namfrel said.
</P>
<P>
It added that another factor stalling the quick count was an
error in computer program that had led to discrepancies in the
votes of individual candidates, number of precincts, precinct
percentage and votes cast in a region in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The counting of the votes is being conducted at a very slow
speed in the Philippines. The official counting just started
Thursday, three days after the voting day.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos had expressed disgust over the slowness
of the counting before the Commission on Elections ordered the
speeding-up of the job.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters went to
the polls Monday to vote for a new president, a vice president, 12
out of 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House of
Representatives and thousands of local officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results released by Namfrel, Vice
President Joseph Estrada of the opposition Laban ng Makabayang
Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) continued
taking a commanding lead, far ahead of the other 9 presidential
candidates.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Business Delegation Leaves For Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese business delegation left
here today for Mexico, Peru and Chile to seek trade and investment
opportunities in the three Latin-American countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Yu Xiaosong, chairman of the China
Council for Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), is composed
of senior leaders from scores of Chinese state-owned businesses,
trading companies and financial institutes.
</P>
<P>
These businesses include China Everbright Corporation, Huaneng
Group, China Petrochemical Corporation, China Construction
Corporation, China National Instruments Import and Export
Corporation, China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export
Corporation, China National Instruments Import and Export
Corporation, Bank of China and Shenzhen Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, the delegation will participate in the 8th trade
talks between Chinese and Mexican entrepreneurs and a forum on
Mexico-Asia Trade.
</P>
<P>
In Peru, CCPIT will sign a cooperation agreement with its
Peruvian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese businessmen will also attend a meeting of the
Pacific Basin Economic Council and a seminar on Sino-Chilean trade
in Chile.
</P>
<P>
After concluding its visit to the three Latin-American
countries, the delegation will go to the United States to take
part in activities marking the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of US-China Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The trade between China and Latin America has enjoyed great
development in recent years. The first quarter of this year
witnessed the bilateral trade volume reaching 1.65 billion US
dollars, 19.5 percent more than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to the region in these three months amounted to
one billion US dollars, 40 percent more than in last year's same
period, and China's imports reduced a bit, reaching 566 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume of the two sides is expected to reach 10
billion US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Latin America is one of China's major potential trade
partners. China mainly exports to the region home appliance,
agriculture machinery, textile products, garments and light
industry products, and China's major imports include iron ore,
edible oil, petrochemical products and chemical raw material.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's investment in the region is valued at 700
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages its businesses to strengthen
economic cooperation with Latin-American nations, according to a
senior official in charge of Sino-America trade in the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, due to long geographic distance and other reasons, the
great potential of the trade between China and Latin-American
countries needs to be further tapped, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that China would like to promote the bilateral trade
through establishing trade centers in the region and setting up
companies that assemble machinery and develop local resources.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Financial Opening-up: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will further the supervision
over the financial sector and gradually make the Chinese currency
fully convertible, according to a senior banking official.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to move step by step toward full
convertibility of the Renminbi yuan, and this process will not be
slowed down due to the Asian financial crisis," said Chen Yuan,
President of the State Development Bank, at the '98 China Forum,
sponsored by the Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China will license more foreign financial
institutions to do business in the country and more foreign banks
will trade with Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China will continue to strengthen the
regulation of capital account, and firmly crack down on illegal
acquisition, retention and transaction of foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"To guide market expectation about exchange rate of the Chinese
currency, the ceiling on the amount of foreign exchanges that
individuals are permitted to buy will be raised and the experiment
with forward sales and purchase of foreign exchange via banks will
be expanded," according to the former deputy governor of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal of more than 345 billion US dollars in
foreign trade turnover this year, China will slash domestic cost
of exports, rationalize the composition of exports, and promote
trade by resorting to globally-accepted economic practices
including an increase in the access by exporters to bank credit
and improvement in the tax rebate system.
</P>
<P>
Chen also revealed that China is also considering setting up
Resolution Trust Corp (RTC)-type institutions to deal with
non-performing loans of bank.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the nation's non-performing loans at about 23
percent and bad loans above two percent of the total under the
newly-adopted loan classification system.

<HEADLINE> China to Toughen Anti-Doping Stance in Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAODING, Northern China, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimming
officials vowed on Thursday to toughen their anti-doping stance as
they gathered here for an annual anti-doping conference chaired by
the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA).
</P>
<P>
"We deeply regretted the series of shameful drug scandals the
Chinese swimmers involved in the 1994 Asian Games and the World
Swimming Championships in Perth this January," said Wu Shouzhang,
vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Chinese female swimmer Yuan Yuan was banned for four years and
her coach Zhao Zhewen for 15 years after vials of banned
substances were found in Yuan's luggage at Sydney Airport upon
their arrival for the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"We determined to strengthen the doping control in the nation,
and to resurrect the images of the Chinese swimming."
</P>
<P>
"Drugs do harmful effects to both the sports and athletes," Wu
said, "Anti-doping is the top issue on our agenda. We call for
all the coaches, swimmers and even local governors to fight
against all kinds of banned substances."
</P>
<P>
Shi Tianshu, director of the Chinese swimming center,
emphasized that CSA is resolved to execute the penalty policy
against drug offenders as they have formed a national anti-doping
committee, which featured top sports officials from cities and
provinces.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the anti-doping education program related to
banned performance-enhancing substances in order to let all people
in China's swimming circle gain a thorough knowledge, especially
the face-to-face education with the swimmers," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CSA plans to increase the number of drug tests this
year to 600 and impose more severe sanctions, including a life ban
against first-time setriod offenders.
</P>
<P>
"Our deterrent anti-drug measures will keep our athletes and
coaches hard-working, help enhance the purity of the sport and
create a fair play circumstances worldwide."
</P>
<P>
CSA announced they will make further cooperation with FINA and
other FINA's member federations as before, and welcome overseas
coaches and technical personnel to the Chinese swimming programs
at their own expenses to make joint efforts to fight against
doping.
</P>
<P>
The anti-doping conference, which held annually since 1994,
featured more than 500 swimmers, coaches and porvincial sports
officials prior to the Chinese Swimming Championships to be opened
here on Friday.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Ambassador to China on Relations with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The stand of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on normalizing its relations
with Japan remains unchanged, and the possibility of further talks
depends on Japan's policy toward the DPRK, according to Chu Chang
Jun, DPRK ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
Only after Japan takes a correct attitude toward the DPRK,
could the two sides return to the conference table, said Chu.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at a two-hour news conference held at the
DPRK embassy here today.
</P>
<P>
Chu said that it is the common aspiration of the people of both
countries to forge friendly, good-neighbor relations between the
two countries. Such relationship, he added, is not only in the
interests of the two nations, but also conducive to peace in
Asia. The DPRK government has put forward correct principles and
has made unremitting efforts toward this end, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, during Beijing talks between the two foreign
ministries last August, the DPRK and Japan reached an agreement on
holding the ninth round of talks without preconditions this year,
and documents of understanding were exchanged. However, this
agreement has not been honored because of Japan's dependent
diplomatic mechanism and its yielding to outside pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chu expressed disappointment for Japan's evasion of the issue
on Korean comfort women. He stressed that Japan should apologize
to and compensate the DPRK for crimes it committed in Korea in the
past. Only this, he said, could be conducive to the normalization
of relations between the DPRK and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about food aid to the DPRK, Chu
thanked China for providing large amounts of food aid to the DPRK
without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Chu said the DPRK is still suffering from severe natural
disasters and is unable to solve its grain problem alone. He
appealed to the international community for more grain and medical
aid.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Accords Irrelevant After Indian Tests: Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Thursday that the
international accords on nuclear non-proliferation stood
irrelevant following a series of nuclear tests by India.
</P>
<P>
"The non-proliferation instruments have become irrelevant," a
Foreign Office spokesman told a weekly news briefing Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said a new strategic situation has arisen and the whole
world has to decide as to how to deal with it. "The balance of
power has been tilted and asymmetries have been exacerbated."
</P>
<P>
He described the resumption of nuclear tests by India in
defiance of the international opinion as "operationalization of
India's grandeur ambition and its hegemonistic designs."
</P>
<P>
"India wishes to be treated as a nuclear weapon state and
wishes to ride on its nuclear weapons into the nuclear club," he
said, adding: " their intentions and designs are clear."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated Pakistan's resolve to take all steps
necessary for national security, which are within its sovereign
rights for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to make well-considered, sober, mature and
comprehensive response to the Indian actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his country's determination to "reject any
unilateral, selective and discriminatory pressure from any quarter
on matters pertaining to national security."

Addressing a luncheon organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council in his honor, Stoyanov, who arrived here for a
one-day visit, said he believes that Thursday's meeting is an
excellent starting point for the representatives of Hong Kong's
business community to understand Bulgaria's economy.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said that just over one year ago Bulgaria embarked for
the second time on the transition toward a free market economy
following a brief encounter with a high inflation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Bulgarian government achieved the financial
stability by the successful introduction of the currency board
system last July, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are advancing to a dynamic economic growth by
developing the private sectors and stimulating exports by
maintaining strict financial disciplines," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government is discussing a three-year agreement
with the International Monetary Fund on the structural reform and
the World Bank will provide financial support for the stable growth
of Bulgaria, Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Our national economy offers foreign investors options from
reducing production costs to qualified work force," he added.
</P>
<P>
Today Bulgaria has a stable political situation and the fight
against corruption will be the priority of the government.
</P>
<P>
"I, here, as the president of Bulgaria, can give you political
guarantees that the changes in Bulgaria are no irresistible and so
please do not hesitate to be among the first to invest in
Bulgaria," Stoyanov concluded.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov arrived in Hong Kong Thursday morning from the Zhuhai
Economic Zone of China's mainland following his visit to Beijing
and Shanghai. In the morning, he met with Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He will
go back to Zhuhai Thursday evening and go back home on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- As a key part of institutional
restructuring of the State Council, the reorganization of
leaderships of its subsidiary departments and institutions has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Organization Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the reform is
related to 515 officials in 82 departments and institutions under
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Among the officials, 36.1 percent have remained on their
previous posts, 48.2 percent taken new posts in the departments
and institutions under the State Council, and 15.7 percent retired
or been given jobs outside the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the restructuring was carried out in
accordance with the actual competence of officials instead of
arrangement in order of seniority. In fact, some officials have
been demoted according to practical needs.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, there have been more extensive flow of
officials among different departments and places.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the ages of new officials have declined.
The average age of 29 minister-level officials is 57.45 years. The
youngest minister is 48 years old.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed officials have shown a new outlook in their
work, and the dovetailing of old and new leading bodies has been
well under way, sources with the Organization Department said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Launches Global Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has
launched 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of global bonds through a
syndicate jointly managed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Nomura
and SBC Warburg Dillon Read, an ADB press release said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the transaction, the ADB's largest ever
public bond issue, was floated Wednesday in London and offered
simultaneously in major capital markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, with a coupon rate of 5.75 percent per annum payable
semiannually and a five-year straight maturity, were priced at
99.342 percent to yield 27 basis points over the five-year U.S.
Treasury bill.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the ADB's strong commitment to providing investors
with a U.S. dollar global bond product on a regular basis, the
issue will further develop the ADB's yield curve in U.S. dollar
global bonds and enhance the secondary market liquidity.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the generally difficult situation in the region,
particularly recent unfavorable developments, the ADB is very
pleased that this transaction has reaffirmed investors' strong
confidence in the bank's credit credential and its responsiveness
to the development needs of the area," said the ADB's Treasurer
Shinji Ichishima.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- DuPont of the United States set up

The joint venture will use DuPont technology to double its
annual output of spunlaced fabrics to 6,000 tons in the next two
years. It will serve the markets in China and the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
It will increase Beijing Dayuan's capacity to produce

<HEADLINE> India's Nuclear Tests Pose Danger of Arms Race: Indian Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- India's nuclear tests are morally
shameful and politically foolish, posing the danger of an arms
race in South Asia, said a signed article in the Hindustan Times
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Any act which legitimizes or promotes the production and
deployment of these evil weapons of mass destruction deserves
criticism at least on moral grounds, Achin Vanaik wrote.
</P>
<P>
India's act unleashes a political dynamic which is outside its
control and whose ultimate end can not yet be forecast, Vanaik
said, citing this as one of the numerous reasons why India`s
behavior is so foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
There would now be tremendous domestic pressure on Pakistan to
carry out its own test in retaliation and if this happens, the
pressure on India to go a step further and openly deploy nuclear
weapons will become intense.
</P>
<P>
There is a powerful lobby both inside and outside the ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the coalition government which is
pushing for India to do this, the author said. Once this happens,
Pakistan would follow suit and the regional nuclear arms race
would thus begin, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the so-called Chinese nuclear threat to India, Vanaik
pointed out that "this supposed threat has always been an abstract
one arising not from the actual behavior of China but from two
other directions."
</P>
<P>
Firstly, there has been the "deceptive slant given by vested Indian
interests to the interpretation of the China-Pakistan relationship."
</P>
<P>
"This has falsely been made out to be a near nuclear alliance
when it is actually nothing more than a relationship of
cooperation in dual-use materials and technologies and arms
carried out for mutual economic, technological, commercial and
political benefit," Vanaik said in the article.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there has been the "deliberate and calculated
invocation of China as potential enemy at this juncture, even at
the risk of worsening China-India relations for no justified
reasons."
</P>
<P>
The acts of the Indian government revealed the purpose of
recent tirade against China by its Defense Minister George
Fernandes, which was to lay down the ideological rational for the
nuclear tests, stated the article.
</P>
<P>
"This could not have been pegged to claims about Pakistani
nuclear provocation because of its essentially reactive
diplomacy. It could only have been pegged on the need to counter a
future threat from a 'potential' enemy, China, or on the need for
India too, to be seen as a 'great power,' win world 'respect,'
etc."
</P>
<P>
"This last factor is the real reason for the bomb tests," the
author said, adding that this action "is not the expression of a
mature, calm, confident and relaxed nationalism, but of the very
opposite."
</P>
<P>
Vanaik said that the roots of what Indian elite and middle classes
have said and done are "insecure, tension-filled mood of frustrated
and uncertain nationalism" which has existed for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years after independence, Vanaik wrote, there is a
widespread sense within the Indian elite that the country has not
"made it" internationally.
</P>
<P>
"China has its economic miracle; smaller Far Eastern countries
are greater success stories; India is not listened to seriously; we
are a great civilization, we must shape the 21 century along with
other great powers, etc. These are the sentiments that dominate,"
the article said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Amend Law to Accommodate Abacha's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will soon amend its
political party law to put to rest the controversy over the
presidential candidacy of the military leader, General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by "This Day", a major national newspaper,
Thursday, quoting Alhaji Hassan Yusuf, the deputy head of the
Transition Implementation Committee (TIC) and Ukeje Nwokeforo, a
member of the TIC, as the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the amendment will concern the
Section 34 of the Political Parties (Registration and Activities)
Decree 28 of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The section reads, "a candidate is a member of a registered
party nominated by the party and accepted by the National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) to contest an election
organized by the commission."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the amendment will be made so that
public officers will be able to contest elections without
resigning from office.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's five registered political parties in April adopted
General Sani Abacha as their consensus candidate for the August 1
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
As Abacha is not a member of any of the parties (the law
forbids public officers from being party members), his candidacy
has caused hot debate both in home and internationally.

JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 Palestinians were

march.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, one 25-year-old Palestinian youth was

settlement in Gaza Strip. Six were wounded in the clashes,
according to the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC),
the Palestinian news service based in East Jerusalem.

In the flashpoint West Bank city Hebron, at least 10
Palestinians were injured as about 1,000 Palestinian protesters
clashed with Israeli soldiers guarding the 450 Jewish settlers
who remain in the center of the mostly Palestinian city, the JMCC
reported.
</P>
<P>
Near the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb at the entrance to
another West Bank city Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters also
threw stones at Israeli soldiers guarding the site. No casualties
have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The clashes came as Palestinians across the territories held
widespread protests to mark the 50th anniversary of Nakba, or
catastrophe, caused by the creation of the state of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Hovers Near 12-Year Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was hovering
near 12-year lows Thursday, as the economic and political upheaval
in Indonesia continues to weigh on the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar has tumbled more than 2 U.S. cents since
the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
It traded in a range of 62.63 U.S. cents to 63.17 U.S. cents in
Sydney Thursday, to close at 62.72 U.S. cents, from 63.18 cents
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Steve Nitis, senior foreign exchange dealer from the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said the market tried to probe the
12-year low, recorded on Wednesday night, of 62.62 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"Fears of (Australian) central bank intervention is just
holding the bears at bay in the short term," Nitis said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia last intervened in the foreign
exchange market when the Australia dollar hit 63.15 U.S. cents in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar is now at its lowest levels since July
1986 when it crashed to a historic post-float low of 57.10 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Economists agree that Australia's export exposure to the Asian
region had entrenched the Australian dollar as a Japanese yen bloc
currency.
</P>
<P>
Nomura Australia economist Andrew Pease said Australia used to
be linked to the U.S. dollar bloc but was now deeply embroiled in
the Asian region's troubles.
</P>
<P>
In total, Asia accounts for around 60 percent of Australia's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed at 84.30 Japanese yen from
84.63 yen Wednesday, and at 1.1156 Deutsche marks from 1.1218
marks.

<HEADLINE> Africa Shouldn't Be Mere Signal Receiver: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

a mere receiver of signals from the world, Mozambican Prime
Minister Pascoal Mocumbi has said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 38th general assembly of URTNA here Wednesday, the
Mozambican prime minister also said the union should be made a

</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Mozambique, Mocumbi said that
citizens can't contribute much to the development of their
country unless they get information and understand the reality of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Mozambique is implementing its program to
enlarge the networks of radio and television broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Radio Mozambique has established a number of new medium-wave
transmitters in northern, southern and central parts of the
country, said Mocumbi.

installed in other areas so that the whole country can be
covered.

in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Fall on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to decline
sharply on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) fell by another 30.2 points to close at
1301.78 points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that most of the stock prices were driven down by
escalating riots in Indonesia which have ground business there to
a halt.
</P>
<P>
Short-covering by institutional investors had, however, helped
the market recover part of its earlier losses with the benchmark
STII managing to cling above the 1300-point mark which it broke
earlier in the day, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume continued to increase to 181.59 million
units, valued at 391.85 million Singapore dollars (about 237.48
million U.S. dollars). Declines led advances by 178 to 155, while
261 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 13.32 million units. It was followed by
ST (Singapore Technologies) Engineering which had 8.82 million
shares traded. Keppel Corporation was next with 7.3 million shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Transmarco led the gainers of the day as it rose by 1.3 dollars
to finish at 6.2 Singapore dollars. RothmansI increased by 40
cents to end at 7.55 Singapore dollars. Malaya Bank was up by 18
cents to close at 4.36 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, KhongGuan was the biggest loser as it declined
by 2.48 dollars to end at 2.5 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 fell
by 70 cents to close at 30.8 Singapore dollars, while BATS lost 38
cents to finish at 4.4 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Power Giant Eyes Uganda Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's power giant, ESKOM,
intends to have its market share in Uganda by buying the stakes
in Uganda Electricity Board (UEB).
</P>
<P>
Reuel J. Khoza, Chairman of ESKOM, who spearheaded a
delegation exploring investment opportunities in east and central
Africa, made this plan public here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A Monitor report said Thursday that ESKOM is interested in
buying aspects of UEB when it comes up for privatization.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested to bid for some of the aspects that will be
up for privatization... and look closely at independent power
generation," said Khoza.
</P>
<P>
The ESKOM boss said his delegation had no pre-conceived idea
on investment in Uganda, adding that it is up to Ugandans to tell
them about available opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Ugandans are the ones who will tell us what opportunities
there are for using electricity as a catalyst for development...
our preferred approach would be to work hand in hand with Uganda,
Ugandans setting the pace," he added.
</P>
<P>
ESKOM, with a generation capacity of 38,000 megawatts, is the
biggest power utility in Africa and the fourth largest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old utility intends to have half of its investment
outside South Africa with particular emphasis on sub-Sahara
region in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> China to Account for 100 Million Outbound Travelers in 2020: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will become the world's
fourth largest outbound travel market as the number of Chinese
outbound travelers is expected to reach 100 million by 2020,
according to a report from the World Tourism Organization.
</P>
<P>
China's outbound travel experienced a rapid growth from 2.8
million in 1992 to 5.32 million in 1997, the report "Tourism 2020
Vision" says.
</P>
<P>
Approximate 100 outbound travel buyers from 23 provinces and
cities in China will attend the 12th International Travel Expo,
known as ITE HK'98, which will be held at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center from May 28 to 31.
</P>
<P>
At present, the private outbound travel in China is
predominately arranged through 67 government-endorsed travel
agencies in different provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province constitutes a large proportion
of outbound travelers, mainly to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the recent drop in the outbound travel in some
Asian countries quickens their steps to develop the China market.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reiterates Commitment to Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General Sani
Abacha has reiterated his government's commitment to pursuing
democracy in its own independent approach.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha made the remarks in a message read by Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi at the summit of the Group of 15, which ended
in Cairo, Egypt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the misrepresentation of events in the country
made by a section of the international community and noted that
those behind it had achieved little success in "peddling their
own version of democracy on our people."
</P>
<P>
General Abacha expressed confidence in the trust, confidence
and support of Nigerians, who he said "possess the independence
of judgement in determining the course of governance in our
land."
</P>
<P>
The democratic form of governance, he said, was an option
which Nigerians had voluntarily chosen and would not only pursue
at their own face, but in a manner consistent with their national
interests and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the government's resolve to pursue an
independent approach to democratic rule to the country's bitter
experience over the 37 years.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha regretted that the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights (UNCHR) had been manipulated by some Western
countries to adopt resolutions on Nigeria without taking
cognizance of the evolving situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also accused these nations of providing funds and other
forms of assistance to some non-governmental organizations and
other anti-government groups and individuals to cause
disaffection in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Concerns about a possible
worsening of the Asian crisis and its implications for Australia
led the Australian share market lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Overlooking a record close on Wall Street, the all ordinaries
index fell 14.3 points to 2759.4 on regional worries.
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of things. You have negative sentiment
about our market coupled with the Asian crisis and perceived
reduction in exports - especially raw materials such as iron ore
and aluminum," said James Pearson, senior institutional dealer
with Hartley Poynton.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is also a certain degree of fear of what is
happening in Asia again and finally, I think the currency is
helping to keep overseas investors away from our market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar sunk to near 12 year lows of 62.62 U.S.
cents overnight, taking its losses since the beginning of the
month to more than 2 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fared slightly better than the
broader market, losing 13.4 points to close at 4766.6.
</P>
<P>
Topping turnover Thursday were Telstra interim receipts as the
telecommunications leader benefited from its status as a defensive
stock in the eye of the Asian storm to rise 4 cents to 3.68
Australian dollars on volume of almost 25.1 million, valued at
57.76 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among banking stocks, the most notable move was ANZ bank's 35
cent drop to 11.10 Australian dollars after a recent strong
run-up. Turnover was a strong 5.1 million shares.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 30.5 cents to 22.145 Australian
dollars while Westpac bank dropped 6 cents to 10.69 Australian
dollars and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was steady at 18.93
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 16.9 points to 1152.0 after
broadly weaker commodity prices and concern about a downturn in
Asia and potential exports.
</P>
<P>
Australia's leading company BHP fell 30 cents to 14.05
Australian dollars on turnover of 3.04 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto fell 44.5 cents to 20.705 Australian
dollars after its London annual meeting was told earnings for the
first four months of 1998 were roughly the same as the same period
of 1997.
</P>

<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada has renewed its call for the
expulsion of Nigeria from the British Commonwealth, should it
fail to conduct "real democracy and changes in the leadership of
the country by October this year."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the British Broadcasting Corporation Wednesday
night, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Auswald threatened that
Nigeria will risk tougher economic sanctions from the
Commonwealth members as well as countries in Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Auswald, the changes in the leadership of Nigeria
must be "real and not superficial."
</P>
<P>
Auswald's threat came a day after representatives of the G-8
and the European Economic Commission called for a genuine
transition to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the British Commonwealth in 1995
after its government hanged nine minority activists on charges of
murder.
</P>

The Commonwealth decided at its summit last October to expel
Nigeria if it fails to have a democratic government by October
this year.

The BPA, initiated by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
late last year, will allow ASEAN countries to use their own
currencies in intra-regional trade and cushion them against the
impact of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
It will also reduce the region's dependence on the greenback
and help revive ASEAN currencies which have lost more 50 percent
of their value against the greenback since last July.
</P>
<P>
Central banks in ASEAN announced on February 17 this year the
setting up of a task force to study the feasibility of using ASEAN
currencies in intra-trade settlement.
</P>
<P>
The other ASEAN countries have shown a strong interest in the
BPA and some have taken their own initiatives, Kerk said, adding
"But, first of all, all ASEAN countries must mutually agree on all
BPA mechanisms before they can be implemented."
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said there will also be a mechanism on
financing which includes a specific clearing system that will be
established by Bank Negara.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said the currency and economic crisis has caused billions
of ringgit in foreign exchange losses mainly due to the import of
machinery, equipment and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, one of MITI's main task now is to try to
promote the local machinery industry and other metal-working and
engineering supporting industries aggressively in order to reduce
the reliance on imports.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said Sino-Indian relations have been undermined unduly in
reply to a question on India's nuclear tests in recent days and
impacts on bilateral ties at a routine press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the Chinese government has always attatched
great importance to the growth of good-neighborly friendly ties
with India on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence, and made lasting and unremitting efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the Indian side repeatedly criticized China
unreasonably recently, alleging that China poses a threat to it,
so that Sino-India relations have suffered undue harms.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side, in defiance of the strong opposition from the
international community, outrageously conducted additional nuclear
tests, and the Chinese side voices its strong condemnations
against such acts and will follow the development of the situation
most closely, the spokesman said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An ancient mausoleum more than
2,000 years old has been unearthed in east China's Zhejiang
Province, Shanghai's "Wenhui Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is at the top of Yinshan Mountain on the outskirts of
Shaoxing, which was the capital city of the state of Yue during
the Warring States Period (475-221 BC). The tomb is supposed to
have belonged to a king of Yue.
</P>
<P>
The mausoleum covers a 100,000-sq.m. area. The tunnel opening
is 46 meters in length, more than 10 meters wide, and about 14
meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The tomb contains large timbers that are more than 30 meters
long, five meters wide, and four meters high, in three rooms.
</P>
<P>
The middle chamber contains a large wooden coffin, over six
meters long and 1.1 meter wide.
</P>
<P>
Although the tomb had been broken into and robbed in the past,
many jade pieces and bronze items remained intact. Archaeologists
guessed that it was built between the Spring and Autumn Period
(770-476 BC) and the early Warring States Period, based on some
funerary items it contains.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opposes India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Ministry voiced strong
opposition in the past two days to the nuclear tests Indian
conducted on Monday and Wednesday respectively.
</P>
<P>
India conducted three underground nuclear tests Monday and two
more tests Wednesday despite international efforts to arrange a
global ban.
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's latest nuclear tests on Wednesday, Thai
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the tests were a
disappointing development as Indian went ahead despite an outcry
and opposition from countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The tests are a disturbing development and could put back the
process of an economic caucus, the so-called BIMSTEC
(Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic
Cooperation), that Thailand and India helped to create," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, in response to India's Monday tests, Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan also expressed Thailand's strong
opposition.
</P>
<P>
"India, which is a member of the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) regional forum and also a dialogue
partner of ASEAN, should be aware of the concern of the countries
in this region on any arms races, especially nuclear weapons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Surin said the tests were not conducive to the process of
establishing the Southeast Asian Nuclear Free Zone, which is
progressing well.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement issued Tuesday, Thai Foreign Ministry
said Thailand does not wish to see competition in the stockpiling
of nuclear weapons and strategic weapons within the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Kobsak, India's nuclear tests will top the agenda
when senior foreign and security officials from the Asia-Pacific
meet during a special session in the Philippines next week to
discuss the regional situation and defense cooperation.

MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary

"Whoever is elected president is still their

<P>
"That is part of our constitution and that is going to be

</P>

Abat quashed rumors that a coup would occur if ever Vice

He also belied reports that there were military factions that

adding that after the elections, whoever is elected president,
becomes commander-in-chief.

The latest unofficial results released by the National

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Indonesia Agree on Adopting Procedure for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia
Thursday agreed on adopting a standard operating procedure for
rapid and hassle-free response in handling disasters in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting between Malaysian
National Disaster Management and Relief Committee Chairman and
Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat and Indonesia's coordinating
minister for social welfare and poverty alleviation Haryono Suyono
here.
</P>
<P>
The accord would guarantee systematic and urgent handling of
disasters, especially forest fires, and would also allow for
unrestricted trans-boundary movement of rescue and relief
personnel including troops, unlike presently, Mohamed told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said he and Haryono agreed on the exchange of experts
and officials from the relevant departments of both countries to
enable them to share their experience and skills.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and
Indonesia's Vice-President B.J. Habibie would meet early next
month to discuss the action plan and the regulations to be used by
the Malaysia-Indonesia Joint-Committee, formed in last December,
to handle disaster-related issues affecting both countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be held in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, and
the delegations of both countries would also inspect the fires
occurring there, he said, adding Anwar and Habibie would then
continue their meeting in Jakarta where the discussions would be
focused on measures to promote tourism and investment in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said both countries would also seek help from various
agencies such as the United Nations Environment Program, the Asian
Development Bank, the United States and the European Union which
had earlier pledged assistance to fight forest fires.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for them to fulfill their pledges as we need
money now to implement the various programs," Mohamed said
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said Malaysia and Indonesia would continue to implement
programs to which they had jointly agreed despite their limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haryono said the forest fires in East Kalimantan
which at their height covered 500,000 hectares had been put out
except that in deep soil and in areas where there was coal.
</P>
<P>
He said the fires had caused losses estimated at 9 trillion
rupiah (about 5 billion ringgit or about 1.295 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Haryono said a team of officials was out there to assess the
extent of the fires and to determine if the coal was the cause of
the fires.
</P>
<P>
Haryono said he was drawn to Malaysia's way of handling fires
and the haze, which involved the pooling of resources of all
groups including the general public.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Getting New Credit Classification System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southeast Asian financial crisis made China's financial
sector more aware of the importance of credit quality, and
although China was not directly affected by the crisis, it has
exposed problems in the financial sector, the most serious of
which is the high ratio of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, the deputy-director of PBOC's Supervision Department,
says that the credit classification change and the reserve system
for bad loans are an important part of China's effort to introduce
a modern financial system and that it will help commercial banks
improve credit management and reduce the number of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC has principles and methods for the new classification
system, and has training programs for financial institutions'
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Financial sector analysts say that China's political and
economic environment and a stable renminbi make this the right
time for credit reforms, but they also say that a good financial
order means the cooperation of the whole society, and that
financial sector efforts must be supported by better credit
consciousness.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Defends Sale of State-owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA)
has defended its sale of over 200 companies at only 70 million
U.S. Dollars, saying many of them were not viable at the time of
sale.
</P>
<P>
"ZPA has raised 70 million U.S. Dollars from over 200
companies because most of them were bankrupt as shown by so many
receiverships and liquidations like Zambia Airways and United Bus
Company of Zambia (UBZ)," Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted ZPA
spokesperson Jane Shamwana as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shamwana was reacting to allegations by Zambia United Front
that there was corruption leading to rampant undervaluing of
companies and asset stripping.
</P>
<P>
Mike Kaira, President of Zambia United Front, accused ZPA of
not being transparent in its dealings, saying there was lack of
accountability to share-holders.
</P>
<P>
But Shamwana defended ZPA, saying it ensured transparency
because valuations of companies earmarked for privatization are
undertaken by independent valuators appointed by the ZPA board.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure transparency, ZPA follows transparency procedures
provided for in the Privatization Act including independent
private sector majority board," she said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for sale of state-owned enterprises are carried
out by independent negotiating teams and valuations are done by
independent expert valuers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Shamwana explained that sale transactions are reviewed by the
attorney-general while there is constant appearances by the ZPA
Chief Executive Valentine Chitalu before members of press and
general public to explain issues.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, out of the total 326 parastatals, 213
had been privatized in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Getting New Credit Classification System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
has released its plan for a new credit classification system for
China's commercial banks for the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
PBOC sources say bank loans will be classified as standard,
special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss-making.
</P>
<P>
This move follows a series of financial sector reforms where
the ceiling on commercial loans was lifted, state-owned commercial
bank capital was improved, and interest rates were lowered.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the new system will lead to a fundamental
reform in financial institutions' operations and will increase the
banks' independence and benefit the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Compare with China's current system, the new system has clear
advantages in avoiding risks.
</P>
<P>
The new system assesses the risk of loans, based on credit
quality, meaning ability to repay, which in turn reflects the
bank's management level more realistically.
</P>
<P>
It can also help reveal problems in outstanding loans and help
bank managers improve credit quality and judge the amount of
reserves to cover bad loans.

TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- In Tianjin City, 15,000 members of

<HEADLINE> More Rwandan Refugees Flow into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported an increased
influx of Rwandan refugees into Tanzania in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have been accommodated at the Mbuba reception
center, in Ngara district of the Kagera Region which borders
Rwanda, Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first mass exodus since the mass return of some
500,000 Rwandans from Tanzania in December 1996, the newspaper
quoted UNHCR Senior External Relations Officer Vincent Parker as
saying.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April this year, a total of 2,120 Rwandan new
arrivals had been screened and registered at Mbuba.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said 2,493 Rwandan refugees living in
Tanzanian villages have also registered themselves at Mbuba
reception center.
</P>
<P>
Parker said the majority of the Rwandan asylum seekers claim
to be coming from eastern Rwanda, especially Kibungo Prefecture,
where they say there is insecurity for them. He said that 69
percent of them are women and children while 31 percent were men.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official said admission to Mbuba reception center
has to be approved by the National Eligibility Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Admission is not based in prima facie recognition of Rwandan
refugees to Tanzania, but is subject to individual status
determination by the National Eligibility Committee," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Parker said the transfer of asylum seekers from Mbuba
reception center in Ngara to Mkungwa camp in the neighboring
Kibondo district was halted as the camp was overcrowed.
</P>
<P>
The swelling number entails expanding facilities such as
water, sanitation, health services and provision of fuel and wood
for communal cooking, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly 10,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzanian
villages in Karagwe district, comprising new arrivals and a large
number of refugees who refused to return home.
</P>
<P>
On the Congolese refugees, the official said, some 38,000
Congolese refugees had been repatriated by April 30 in an
organized way.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR statistics the total refugee population in
the country as of April 30 this year was 328,737.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Masterminds Series of Explosions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The mastermind behind a series of
explosions here last month was an Egyptian financed by a
Jordanian of Palestinian origin living in the U.S., semi-official
Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Initial investigations have shown that the Egyptian Khalid Abu
Shanab was the mastermind behind the organization (who made the
explosions)," the newspaper quoted sources close to the
investigations as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian and seven Jordanians have been referred to the
State Security Court but the group's financier "is still at large
in the United States where he has a green card," according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Acting Information Minister Nasir Lawzi Sunday
announced that a foreign-funded group with Islamist affiliation
and linked to a movement founded in Egypt at the end of last
century was behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
On April 30, a Volvo car exploded at the parking lot of the
Jerusalem International Hotel at the suburb of Amman, seriously
damaging itself and four other nearby vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The car explosion at the hotel followed a series of bombings in
the past month that targeted the car of former head of the General
Intelligence Department Mohammad Rasoul Kilani, the car of former
Interior Minister Jawdat Sboul, as well as the residence of Major
General in the Jordanian Armed Force Yousef Gassous.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the explosions or attacks resulted in loss of
life or injury.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Remove Motor Vehicle Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
announced Thursday it will remove the 22.5 percent tariff imposed
on imported motor vehicles from midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister John Luxton said, "the announcement means
savings from tariff reductions for New Zealand families and
businesses almost immediately and it will remove uncertainty from
the car market. Cars will be cheaper than they otherwise would
have been."
</P>
<P>
The decision applies to all passenger and light commercial
vehicles, excluding motor homes and ambulances.
</P>
<P>
The removal of car tariffs came earlier than expected. Last
year, the government announced that the tariffs would be scrapped
on 1 December 2000.
</P>
<P>
The decision will cut government revenues from car tariffs. In
1997, it collected 300 million N.Z. dollars (about 160 million
U.S. dollars) from car import duties.
</P>
<P>
But the decision will affect four New Zealand car assembly
plants, all of which have announced they would close down because
they will be unable to compete with cheaper imported cars.
</P>
<P>
To assist their transition, Luxton said the government has
agreed to provide the four local vehicle assemblers with over 10
million N.Z. dollars (5.4 million U.S. dollars) as a one-off
payment. With the payment, the four plants will continue to
produce vehicles until around the time of their announced dates of
closure.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ministry Asking For Higher Water Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese water specialists have
called for raising the price of water from the Yellow river in a
bid to ease water shortages along the river, according to today's
"Economic Daily."
</P>
<P>
The current price of 1,000 cubic meters of water from the
Yellow River, the second longest river in China, is the same as
the price of a bottle of mineral water .
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zhang Jianhua, a water specialist, as saying
that an increase in the price of water in inevitable, and that
more needs to be done to make farmers aware of the need to save
water.
</P>
<P>
The water from the country's rivers and lakes used to be free,
but, in 1989 the Water Resources Ministry began to levy a charge
on water for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry document, in the April-June period,
10,000 cubic meter of water for irrigation costs the same as 44.4
kg of wheat. At other times, the cost is equal to 33 kg of
wheat. The price of one cubic meter of water for industrial use
was 4.5 mill (1 yuan = 1,000 mill).
</P>
<P>
A water conservation specialist says that the price is lower
than the actual cost of water, which is at 1.5 fen (one yuan = 100
fen) per cubic meter and the price has been the same for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there has of course been a great deal of water
wasted over the years.

KUWAIT CITY, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian politician Vladimir
Zhirinovsky has offered to mediate the release of Kuwaiti
Prisoners of War (POWs) detained in Iraq on paid condition, while
Kuwait is ready to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Deputy Chairman of the National Committee
for the POWs and Missing Affairs Ibrahim Al-Shaheen in an
interview with English daily Kuwait Times published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The families of the POWs received an offer from Russian Liberal
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky that he will help
release the detainees if he is paid 80 million U.S. dollars,
Al-Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky won the praise and trust of Baghdad when he arrived
there with a planeload of medical supplies and a group of
politicians in the middle of the Iraq-U.S. standoff over
U.N. weapons inspection crisis last February.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen said "if any one wants to take up the initiative to
secure the release of the detainees, the country will welcome it,"
adding that Kuwait is very much keen on the safe return of its
citizens and that money is never an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been the only and most emotional one
hindering the improvement of relations between Kuwait and Iraq as
the other bilateral issues arising from the Iraqi 1990-91
occupation of Kuwait have been solved.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait said that Baghdad still detains 625 POWs in Iraqi jails
and has frequently urged Iraq to release them, but Baghdad said
those POWs were missing during turmoils in southern Iraq following
the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq late last year released several Kuwaiti POWs detained
after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen said "we welcome any humanitarian efforts and we do
not reject any initiative. At the same time, we don't accept the
politicization of the POWs issue by any state."

<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe

on the security of the war-ravaged Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the office of the president and cabinet
Wednesday night, a press release available here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, will review the situation in the Great Lakes,
one of the most politically unstable regions of Africa, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region includes Rwanda, Burundi, and part of
Democratic Congo, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>

The summit will also seek to promote economic cooperation and
the reconstruction and development of the region, Zimbabwean

<P>
Other participants from outside the region will come from

<P>
"The quest for a mechanism capable of restoring security in
the region by peaceful means will be a central concern," the
president's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Modalities for development, which would implement an agreed
plan of action compatible with the resources that can be
mobilized, will also be examined," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The summit marks the beginning of a process to gather
consensus on the existing problems common to countries of the
Great Lakes and how to solve them.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is currently Chairman of the Organization of the
African Unity (OAU), will be accompanied by Foreign Affairs
Minister Stan Mudenge, Defense Minister Moven Mahachi and
Minister of State for National Security Sydney Sekeramayi.
</P>
<P>
After the Kinshasa summit, the Zimbabwean president will then
leave for Windhoek, Namibia Sunday for a southern African
economic summit, which will bring together regional and
international leaders of both government and the business world
to discuss trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Namibia is the sixth such summit that has been
organized jointly by the World Economic Forum and the Southern
African Development Community.

<P>

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Blasts Japanese Film "Pride, the Fateful Moment" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper the
People's Daily on Thursday published a commentary entitled "No
Whitewashing for War Criminals" to express the country's outrage
at a Japanese movie, "Pride, the Fateful Moment."
</P>
<P>
The movie previewed recently in Japan distorted the Japanese
history of aggression and whitewashed the aggressors, the
commentary said. The concoction of this film fifty years after the
end of the Second World War was clearly a demonstration against
the Asian people and a provocation to the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Pride, the Fateful Moment" heroized Hideko Tojo, who led
Japan's World War II aggressions and who was later convicted as
the top war criminal and executed by the Allies in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The film has even drawn criticism in Japan, the commentary
said. Even the employees at the Toei company, which produced the
film, formed a "Criticism Club" to show their indignation and
staged a protest at the very beginning of its preview.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the club pointed out that the film distorted
historical facts and shirked Japan's responsibility as an invader
and a perpetrator in the Second World War despite Japanese
people's aspiration for peace.
</P>
<P>
Another group of Japanese people also staged a protest at Toei
Company and warned that the whitewashing of the invasion war "will
lead to a new war system in Japan."
</P>
<P>
It is no strange that the film was unpopular in Japan, the
People's Daily commentary went on, because it barefacedly
propagandized the reactionary conception of history, preached the
theory of "innocent invasion," "meritorious war," and "harmful
self-introspection," and intended to reverse the verdicts of the
Tokyo court-martial war crime trials.
</P>
<P>
All these were unacceptable to all the people upholding
justice, including the Japanese people, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
The movie preached a vicious theory that "aggression is no
guilty," saying the aggressive war was an action taken by a
country to defend its own interests, so people who have involved
in the action were "innocent."
</P>
<P>
In the movie, Tojo falsely alleged that he was not guilty to
the countries invaded by Japan, but only to Japanese soldiers
killed in battles and the Japanese people suffering from the
war. He even claimed that leaders of all countries involved in the
war, no matter losers or winners, were guilty as well.
</P>
<P>
Basically, the movie simply denied the differences between a
war of aggression and that of anti-aggression in an attempt to
obliterate Japan's responsibility for war crimes. It even
attempted to put a halo on the war criminal's head.
</P>
<P>
The movie depicted the Japan-launched Asian-Pacific war, which
started by Japan's surprise attack on an American navy base in the
Pearl Harbor, as a self-defensive war for breaking the
blockade. It shamelessly described the war as part of the national
liberation movements in Asia as if Japan were the savor of the
Asian people.
</P>
<P>
This is a sheerly gangster logic, said the commentary. Anyone
who has basic knowledge of history knows that Japan's invasion of
Asia aimed to colonize other Asian countries, which would have
served as the first step to conquer the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The movie advocated that "self-introspection is harmful to
Japan." It tried every possible way to depict a judge who defended
Japanese militarism and described the Tokyo court-martial trials
as "unfair" and "a revenge of a winner on a loser."
</P>
<P>
The movie went so far as to claim the Nanjing (Nanking)
massacre, in which 300,000 innocent Chinese were slaughtered by
the Japanese army in December 1937, was a "fabrication based on
rumors."
</P>
<P>
It tried to convey a message through the mouth of Tojo that if
Japan admitted the war crimes, the root of trouble would be laid
up for Japan in the future and Japan would be considered as "an
evil country" by the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In fact, to bravely face the history is the only way for Japan
to achieve a proper pride. Japan will gain nothing by whitewashing
its aggressive war, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Japan took the road of foreign aggression and
expansion following the Meiji Restoration. During the Second World
War, Japan put most part of Asia under the heel of Japanese
militarism, throwing the people in these countries into deep
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary said, during the fifty-year postwar
period, a handful of right-wing extremists in Japan stubbornly
refused to admit the war crimes committed by the militarist Japan.
</P>
<P>
They had been seizing opportunities to reverse the verdicts of
the Tokyo war crime trials. It's their usual tricks to deny the
conviction of the Japanese history of aggression through film
productions, the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the release of such films had drawn strong
criticism from other Asian countries and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
It said there were two most erroneous points in the movie
"Pride, the Fateful Moment." Firstly, it did all it could to
eulogize and whitewash the top war criminal Hideko Tojo.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the commentary said, the film was particularly
reactionary and provocative because it was released at a time when
the world people had just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
anti-Fascist war.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the film was by no means produced by
chance, but resulted from the development of the prevailing trend
of right-wing extremism in Japan.
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the militarist thought in Japan was not
completely ridded of, leaving the evil seed deeply rooted in the
Japanese society. Even today, it still has its market in Japan,
which is the country's misfortune.
</P>
<P>
Some movie producers had said flagrantly that "We want to
assert that Japan has not waged a war of aggression," "We want to
change the countrymen's conception of history" and "Nothing could
be more effective than films in achieving such objectives."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the statements had fully reflected the
political state of mind of a handful of extreme rightists in Japan.
</P>
<P>
It said the film serves as a significant negative example which
is a reminder to people of the existence of such adverse current
in the Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
The commentary called for people's vigilance against the
adverse trend.
</P>
<P>
It is Japan's obligation and historical commitment to prevent
the rightist trend of thought from running rampant, and to
guarantee that Japan would continue to take the road of peace and
development, it said.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Faster Railway Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enginees have developed a new
railway switch that allows trains to travel at speeds of 140 to
160 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The new switch was designed by the Railway Ministry's Joint
Team for Railway Switch Design and manufactured by the Baoji Bridge
Factory in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The switch is a major part of controlling train speed in
transport operations. The slow speed of Chinese trains in the past
was largely blamed on slow railway switches.
</P>
<P>
The Baoji Bridge Factory built two other separate types of
railway switches previously that allowed trains to reach a speed
of 120 to 140 km per hour for strait operations and a lateral
passing speed of 75 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The new switch will help meet China's urgent need for faster
trains to get more customers and eventually improve efficiency,
industrial experts say.

<P>
WUHAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A 6-year-old girl in Suizhou, a city
in central China's Hubei Province, died after taking medicine
given by a veterinarian. The veterinarian was severely punished by
the city's bureau of health.
</P>

In addition to offering treatment to animals, veterinarian Yao
Zhongwu reportedly prescribed medicine and gave injections to
villagers in his neighborhood.
</P>

JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police said that the murder of an Arab construction
worker in Jerusalem early Wednesday was a nationalistically
motivated attack that was an act of revenge for the stabbing of
Jews. Just a week ago, a Jewish religious student was stabbed to
death in the Old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed
Wednesday to a two-digit Israeli redeployment in the West Bank --
9 percent to start plus a few more percentage points to be held
"in escrow" until the Palestinians fulfill their commitments. The
major remaining hurdle is over how much land Israel will put "on
deposit."
</P>
<P>
Yedeot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Before his meeting with Albright, Netanyahu said that
despite the friendship between Israel and the U.S. he would not
budge from his own opinion and might say "no" to the
Americans. However, the U.S. sources predicted that Netanyahu will
show flexibility in his talks with Albright and try to find a
solution for the second redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Denies Amassing Troops in Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun has denied recent
accusations by Nigeria that it is amassing troops on the Bakassi
Peninsula, an area of about 1,000 square kilometers claimed by
both countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Cameroun government emphatically denies these baseless
accusations, recognizing them as the usual Nigeria manoeuvers
intended to mislead public opinion so as to justify fresh clashes
in this border conflict," a statement of the Ministry of External
Relations said.
</P>
<P>
The statement dated May 9 reaffirmed Cameroun's "attachment to
international law" and added that it would continue to work for
peace between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun and Nigeria have in the past years had several
clashes over the Bakassi Peninsula, which is believed to be rich
in oil, fishery and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is now in the International Court of Justice,
waiting for ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Defense Ministry, in a statement on May 7,
accused Cameroun of deploying 2,000 more troops in Bakassi,
saying that "the massive build-up of troops by Cameroun along our
common border violates the international Court of Justice (ICJ)
Interim Measures Ruling of March 1996."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Shao Huaze, president of "People's
Daily", said today that establishing a means to verify truth
through practice is badly needed to improve the ability and build
standard of discovering and understanding the truth.
</P>
<P>
In his article "Significance and Enlightenment of the
Discussions on the Criterion of Truth" in today's issue, Shao said
that it is highly important to improve the building of socialist
democracy and  political science and working hard to create a
democratic environment and conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of implementing the criterion
of truth guaranteed by a system and legality, and developing a
work style of speaking the truth, doing things in a down-to-earth
manner, and a means for voicing different opinions.
</P>
<P>
Shao called for developing democracy extensively in the

<HEADLINE> Economists Optimistic About Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Peiyan, Minister of the State
Development Planning Commission, was quoted by Wednesday's
People's Daily as saying that he is optimistic about an eight
percent economic growth of China this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate, which is of vital importance to both China and
other Asian countries, can be achieved because the increasing
consumer demand and savings deposits will provide support for
China's rapid economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the three leading factors affecting China's economic growth,
the major one is maintaining a proper growth in investment in
fixed assets, Zeng stressed.
</P>
<P>
With stable consumer spending and uncertain exports, 8
percent or higher growth has to be driven chiefly by increased
investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He predicts consumer spending to stay steady and exports to be
affected by the Asian financial crisis this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the past three months show China's economy
growing 7.2 percent, 0.8 percentage points lower than the set
target.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Qiu Xiaohua, a State Statistics Bureau spokesman, has
listed the factors that favor economic growth: development in
stagnant industries like transport, telecommunication, energy, and
raw materials; abundant grain reserves; 140.6 billion U.S. dollars
worth of foreign exchange reserves; a high individual saving rate;
and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Kathie Krumm, the head of economics of the World Bank's
resident mission in China, says that acceleration is expected
gradually in investment.
</P>
<P>
China's reforms of the last couple of years, especially
macroeconomic and foreign exchange controls, have provided better
conditions for economic growth, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, the Minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that this year's major tasks are to stimulate
consumer spending, especially in rural markets, increase
exports, and promote technical improvements.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Fixed Assets Investment Down in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China spent 161.8 billion yuan on
fixed assets in the first quarter of this year, 10.3 percent up
from the same 1997 period, but the increase is down 3.6 percentage
points on a year-on-year basis, according to the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The number of new projects and investment in real estate
increased noticeably, a sign that the government macro-economic
controls have begun to take effect, although somewhat slowly.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, 91 billion yuan was spent on
infrastructural construction from January to March, up 11.3
percent over the same 1997 period. However, the growth rate is 3.1
percentage points less than that a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Spending on technical innovations was 29 billion yuan, up 5.8
percent, which is down 18.3 percentage points from the rate a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Real estate used 32.6 billion yuan, up 9.2 percent, which is
4.1 percentage points higher than that for the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
In the three-month period, there were 6,158 new state-level
projects, 2,150 more than for the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Investment in apartment projects was 19 billion yuan, up 13.9
percent, and 6.88 million square meters of apartments were sold in

<HEADLINE> Australia to Suspend Defense Links With India: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced Thursday it
would suspend defense links with India and all non-humanitarian
aid to India in its strongest reaction to India's latest nuclear
tests Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said a meeting of
Australia's National Security Committee Thursday decided Australia
should suspend defense contacts, including withdrawing the
country's defense attache from India.
</P>
<P>
"That will mean that our defense attache will be withdrawn from
New
Delhi, that ADF (Australian Defense Force) officers training in
India
will be withdrawn from India and likewise (three) Indian officers
training in Australia will be asked to leave," he told a press
conference
at the Australian federal Parliament House Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"All proposed defense-related visits and ship and aircraft
visits will also be canceled," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Australia's ministerial and senior
official visits to India would also be suspended, and that
Australia would register its strong opposition to the nuclear
testing to international forums including the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Australia gives about 12 million U.S. dollars a year in
non-humanitarian aid to India.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore and condemn absolutely what India has done - it is
an irresponsible genuflection to transient domestic political
popularity.
</P>
<P>
"What the Indian government has done is to play fast and loose
with international safety and security in the interests of a
short-term political gain.
</P>
<P>
"We are very very deeply concerned about the possibility of a
nuclear arms race".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called on India's neighbor Pakistan to show
restraint.
</P>
<P>
"Looking to the immediate future, that we ask that the
government of Pakistan display the outmost restraint. We ask that
the government of Pakistan not respond by tit-for-tat detonation
of nuclear devices".
</P>
<P>
India conducted a further two nuclear tests Wednesday, one day
after worldwide condemnation for conducting three blasts.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Agricultural Exports to EU Projected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN's agricultural exports
to the European Union (EU) markets are projected to rise
substantially in the coming years as the currencies depreciation
made ASEAN exports more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The depreciated currencies would help especially
export-oriented and resource-based sectors such as palm oil and
rubber, Agricultural Economics Research Institute of Finland said
in a statement Thursday, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The currencies depreciation would also allow the EU to
substitute their imports from other countries, which currencies
have not depreciated, by importing agricultural products from this
region, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural exports from the ASEAN countries to the EU
countries surged at an average rate of four percent over the
1990-1996 period, touching 7 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 EU members, Germany and the Netherlands are the
largest markets for ASEAN products, absorbing more than 40 percent
of these exports, followed by the United Kingdom, France and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The five major commodity groups exported from this region
comprised of vegetable oils, natural rubber, fish and crustaceans,
vegetables and fruits, and cassava, which accounted for around 70
percent of the total ASEAN agricultural exports to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU is still a significant export destination for the ASEAN
products, representing about 16 percent of the total ASEAN
agricultural exports, and despite facing tough competition in the
EU market, the region has steadily increased their market share
over the years.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's share of the total EU farm imports rose to 8.5 percent
in 1996 from 7.6 percent in 1990 and 5.3 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were the largest agricultural
exporters to the EU markets and together they constituted for
about 85 percent of the total ASEAN farm export to the EU, it
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN also groups Brunei, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines,
Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, the institute said the access of the ASEAN
agricultural exports to the EU was somewhat hampered by EU's
restrictive trade policy measures which usually include import
tariffs or quotas to protect domestic suppliers.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Under-ground Water Level Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The underground water level in
Beijing area has been dropping continuously due to random pumping.
</P>
<P>
The underground water level dropped by 1.6 meters by the end of
1997 compared with the end of 1996, according to today's Beijing
Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that when compared with the early 1980s, local
underground water level dropped by 5.52 meters.
</P>
<P>
The drop of underground water was attributed to less rainfall
in 1997, a factor leading to reduction of surface water resources
and intensifying the exploration of underground water resources.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the earth surface of Beijing is sinking by
an annual average rate of 10 to 20 millimeters since an earthquake
hit Hebei Province's Xingtai area in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that the major cause for the sinking of earth
surface in the area is random use of underground water.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Beijing suffers from serious water
shortage, with per capita water resources standing at 300 cubic
meters, which means one-eighth of the national average or one-30th
of the world's average.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime

<HEADLINE> Pests Cause Heavy Loss to Bangladesh's Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh suffers losses of some 18
billion taka (about 390 million U.S. dollars) in rice production
due to pests every year, a report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Conservative estimates put the annual loss of rice yield due to
pests at 10-15 percent, although about 11,000 tons of pesticides
are used each year, according to a status report on pest
management of Bangladesh, prepared by the Integrated Pest
Management Project.
</P>
<P>
"That is equivalent to about 12-18 billion taka (about 260-390
million dollars) a year," the report said, using 1991 as the base
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the South Asian nation's rice production was about
19.5 million tons, and the average price was 6,600 taka per ton.
</P>
<P>
The pesticides could only give a temporary relief against pest
attack and therefore had little impact on reducing production
loss, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A Food and Agriculture Organization report released last month
said that Bangladesh would import 900,000 tons of rice this year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produced 19.86 million tons of food grain in the
1996-97 fiscal year ending on June 30, 1997.

</P>
<P>
It is hoped that both parties will have their personnel in
place by June, said a press release from the Chinese Embassy
here in Washington.
</P>

cooperation in such fields as combating international organized
crime, narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling, counterfeiting,
money laundering.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Delivers New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer Winston
Peters delivered the government's new budget for the coming years
on Thursday afternoon, featuring less spending to boost government
fiscal surplus in face of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the progress in the past year, Peters told the
parliament that "this Coalition Government has had to manage the
economy with considerable care. And we have done that."
</P>
<P>
"This budget continues the progress made in the 1997 budget,"
he announced.
</P>
<P>
Like last budget, education and health are still the two big
winners. According to the budget, total education spending will
increase to 7.1 billion dollars ( 3.8 billion U.S. dollars). The
Coalition Government has so far committed almost 1.7 billion
dollars (92 million U.S. dollars) extra for education since it was
formed at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the area of health, total spending for the new fiscal year
will rise to 6.2 billion dollars ( 3.34 billion U.S. dollars), up
6 percent on the last budget.
</P>
<P>
Peters estimated the government budget surplus for the current
fiscal year, which ends at June 30, stands at 2.8 billion dollars
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars), 1.3 billion (700 million U.S. dollars)
more than the forecast made in the last budget.
</P>
<P>
He predicted surplus for next year will be at 1.3 billion
dollars. And for the 1999/2000 year, the surplus is projected at 2
billion dollars (1.08 billion U.S. dollars), increasing to 3
billion dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) the following year.
</P>
<P>
For the repayment of government debt, another focus of the
former government led by the National Party, Peters pointed out
that the current goal of reducing net debt to 20 percent of GDP is
forecast to be met by 2000/2001.
</P>
<P>
The present government has looked beyond the next three years
and revised its net debt target to below 15 percent of GDP, said
Peters.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that on current projections, this new
target should be met within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
However, the goal of spending an extra 5 billion dollars (2.7
billion U.S. dollars) in three years, set in the agreement to form
the coalition between the National Party and the New Zealand First
Party, has been cut by 300 million dollars (160 million U.S.
dollars) in order to bolster government surplus for the next year.
</P>
<P>
On the economic outlook, the budget notes that till December
this year, economy will grow at 2.3 percent a year as a result of
the Asian crisis. However, it is expected to pick up in the second
half of 1998, ending the year 1998/1999 with a growth rate of 2.7
percent. It also expects growth rate will reach 3.9 percent in
1999/2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Bankers, Central Bank Governor Differ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- As Thailand's new Central Bank
Governor Chatulmongol Sunakul began operating his duty Wednesday,
people are eager to know how he handles the knotty problems left
by his unlucky predecessor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
Among these problems, the fate of ailing financial
institutions, which triggered turbulence in the stock market in
recent days, drew the primary attention.
</P>
<P>
Despite calls from local bankers, Chatulmongol ruled out the
possibility to close ailing financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ailing financial firms would not be closed, he said. Instead,
the Central Bank would maintain current policies, with firms
unable to increase capital directed to change management, write
off bad debt and recapitalize through debt-for-equity swaps.
</P>
<P>
Given the government's promise of fully insurance of depositors
and creditors of all financial institutions, it makes no sense for
the Central Bank to order ailing firms to close down, the new
governor added.
</P>
<P>
However, Banthoon Lamsam, chairman of the Thai Bankers'
Association, suggested that ailing firms should be closed by
regulators and liquidated.
</P>
<P>
He said the question now was what direction the Central Bank
would take in dealing with banks and finance companies unable to
raise new capital or set aside loan-loss provisions.
</P>
<P>
Shares in several finance companies have nose-dived in recent
days, sparked by investor fears of liquidity problems and deposit
runs.
</P>
<P>
Banthoon, also president of Thai Farmers Bank, said finance
companies would survive only if they were backed by banks and
maintained public trust.
</P>
<P>
But the public lacked confidence in the finance sector, despite
the blanket government guarantee on deposits and liabilities for
all institutions.
</P>
<P>
Four banks taken over by the authorities in the past year would
probably have to close because of insufficient capital.
</P>
<P>
What financial institutions now needed was liquidity,
particularly from abroad. But attracting overseas fund hinged on
the pace of reform, Banthoon said.
</P>
<P>
"Pumping in money isn't the solution. If liquidity comes in
without reform, without improvements in competitiveness, it will
lead to a second bubble," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank governor disagreed with the local banker
on the condition of the four banks taken over by authorities,
saying confidence returns from depositors and cash-flow problems
ease after regulators step in.
</P>
<P>
But he, too, admitted the urgency of reforms in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
When appointed governor last week, Chatulmongol said his
priority would be restructuring the Central Bank and reforming its
working system.
</P>
<P>
In his first day in office Wednesday, Chatulmongol pledged to
promote a "market-oriented" working style, strengthen regulatory
systems and improve staff training.
</P>
<P>
Apart from reforms of the Central Bank, legal reforms,
including new foreclosure and bankruptcy law, should establish a
framework for corporate restructuring later this year.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Down in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela sold 17,970 imported and
domestic cars in April, down 14.4 percent from March, the
Venezuelan Automotive Chamber said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the decrease in sales is attributed to the rising
interest rate of credit, which is up from 20-25 percent to 45-49
percent.
</P>
<P>
About 60 to 80 percent of automakers sell cars on credit in the
South American country. Rising interest rates cause real sales
problems for car companies. General Motors, Ford and Fiat are
affected most by the setback in sales.
</P>
<P>
To boost sales, the chamber has proposed increasing the amount
of the down payment so the monthly car payment can be lowered to
match the buying power of persons in the country.

the European Central Bank presidency.

<HEADLINE> Jute Production to Drop by 15 Percent in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Raw jute production in Bangladesh is
likely to slip by 10-15 percent to 4.5 million bales this year
from less than 6 million bales last year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was the result of the fact that many farmers had
sown paddy on their jute-producing land, following bad weather in
the country during the last rice season, to meet the shortfall of
food grains, the experts said, the Bangladesh Observer, an
national English daily, reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total consumption capacity of the country's 67 jute mills,
both public and private, was roughly 3.5 million bales, and the
rest of the raw jute was for export, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The production cost of jute goods in Bangladesh was higher than
that of India and Pakistan, and that made Bangladesh-manufactured
jute products less competitive in the world market, according to
the experts.
</P>
<P>
The jute industry, which helped earn half the country's hard
currency in the 1970s, accounted for only about 8 percent of its
export in 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insists On Full Implementation of Dayton Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States opposes any
possibility of changing the Dayton agreement and asks from all
parties concerned to implement the agreement in full, U.S. special
envoy Robert Gelbard said in Sarajevo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard made this statement at Sarajevo airport after the talks
he and Richard Holbrooke held with Bosnia's highest state
officials, the Croatian news agnecy Hina reported.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot and will not in any way accept the ideas on the
so-called decantonisation of the country or the establishment of a
third entity," Gelbard said during his talks with the Croat
representative in Bosnia's three-member presidency, Kresimir Zubak.
</P>
<P>
The United States will continue to support the Federation as
established on the basis of the Dayton agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Richard Holbrooke said that greater progress had been made in
the past nine months in the implementation of the peace agreement
than in the past year and a half.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still some serious problems which should be
solved soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zubak pledged that he and his colleagues would continue to
support the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zubak described Wednesday's talks as "short and constructive,"
adding the Croat side had been asked to show its readiness to
implement the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH and
its officials will work on implementing the peace agreement,he
added.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he asked the Chairman of the Bosnian Presidency,
Alija Izetbegovic, to accelerate the establishment of better
contacts with the Serbian side, especially with Belgrade
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mediators conveyed to Izetbegovic Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic's wish for more frequent contacts, especially
in economy.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian side has been especially requested to engage in a
speedier return of Serbs, particularly to Sarajevo, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted unofficially sources as saying that talks
Holbrooke and Gelbard had with Izetbegovic were very hard,
although Izetbegovic's advisor on foreign policy Mirza Hajric
maintained that the visit of the U.S. mediators "was a reason for
satisfaction" and represented" support for keeping up the current
peace".

CARACAS -- Venezuela has earned 2.58 billion U.S. dollars in
oil sales during the first quarter of the year, a 34 percent drop
in revenue compared to the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Venezuela attributed the decline, which is
estimated at 440 million dollars per month, due primarily to the
sustained decline of petroleum prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan petroleum producers said the net foreign exchange
income of crude sales reached nearly 18 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that sales income this year would be lower than
the one registered last year, due to the reduction of petroleum
production and the persistent price decrease in the international
market. (Venezuela-Oil Income)

LONDON -- The widespread use of hedging by gold producers in
the past 10 years was one of the factors leading to the fall in
the price of the metal, the Financial Times newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a latest study by the World Gold Council, the newspaper
said that as gold producers realized gold prices were on an
extended downward path, they accelerated their hedging activities
last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the study estimated that an additional 500 tons of
gold supply reached the market last year, almost equivalent to all
the new gold produced in South Africa, the biggest producer in the
world. (Gold-Hedging)

NEW YORK -- New cars are more affordable for American families
whose income has been rising faster than car prices, according to
the report of the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the phenomenon to "a robust economy
and a glut of new vehicles. The first three months of 1998 have
become the most affordable period to buy a new car in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
It took 25.5 weeks of median pretax family income in the first
quarter to buy the average-priced new car, at about 20,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
That's down from 25.8 weeks in the last quarter of 1997 and
matches 1981's first quarter, the report said. It's also the fifth
consecutive quarter of improved affordability. (US-Car Prices)

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
consider India's nuclear tests "unacceptable for the international

</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made a phone call to his
U.S. counterpart Secretary of State Madeline Albright Wednesday
evening at the request of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. is seriously concerned about the

Both sides held that the international community should take a

Albright said India has ignored efforts by the international

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Strongly Condemns Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government was "deeply
shocked" by the nuclear tests conducted by India and expressed its
"strong condemnation" for India's act.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today issued a statement on
the matter. Following is the full text of the statement:
</P>
<P>
"In disregard of the strong opposition of the international
community, the Indian Government conducted two more nuclear tests
on May 13 following May 11 nuclear tests. The Chinese Government
is deeply shocked by this and hereby expresses its strong
condemnation. This act of India's is nothing but an outrageous
contempt for the common will of the international community for
the comprehensive ban on nuclear tests and a hard blow on the
international effort to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation. It
will entail serious consequences to the peace and stability in
South Asia and the world at large. The international community
should adopt a common position in strongly demanding India to
immediately stop its nuclear development program.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Government, which itself has undermined the
international effort in banning nuclear tests so as to obtain the
hegemony in South Asia in defiance of the world opinion, has even
maliciously accused China as posing a nuclear threat to
India. This is utterly groundless. Ever since China possessed
nuclear weapons, it has advocated the comprehensive prohibition
and complete destruction of nuclear weapons and has unilaterally
and unconditionally undertaken not to use or threat to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear-free
zones. This gratuitous accusation by India against China is solely
for purpose of finding excuses for the development of its nuclear
weapons. The Chinese Government will continue to closely watch the
development of the situation."

<P>
On relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), Tarasyuk also said that Ukraine hoped to enhance its
cooperation with the military alliance and carry out a pro-NATO
policy.
</P>
<P>
He added that although Ukrainian constitution did not rule out
the possibility of joining NATO, the entry issue was not the top
priority.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk stressed that to put its relations with Russia at the
top of foreign policy was not contradictory with the multilateral
foreign policy of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua at the end of the press conference that to
develop relations with China, especially closer bilateral
cooperation in the economic field, was one of the major tasks in
foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Approves Farmers Support Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian parliament approved
the Farmers Support Act on Wednesday to exempt farmers
from tax on their plant and animal produce.
</P>
<P>
Ventsislav Vurbanov, minister of agriculture, forests and land
Reform, said, "I believe it will encourage people who are willing
to engage in farming."
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, the juristic-person farmers were exempted
from the tax for only five years before the law passing.
</P>
<P>
Following a debate started last week, members of parliament
decided against setting a minimum level on the state subsidy of
the Agriculture Fund. The members of parliamentary Group of the
Democratic Left, the Euro-Left and the Popular Union demanded the
revenue of the fund to be set not less than 0.3 to 0.5 percent of
the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian agriculture declined seriously for years and the
country had to import food and meat from abroad. The government
set up the State Agriculture Fund to provide financial support to
farmers in order to promote production.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the Agriculture Fund cannot set guaranteed and
recommended prices for farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Prices are set by the market to avoid speculation and
parasitical middlemen, Chairman of the parliamentary Committee on
Agriculture, Forests and Land Reform Vladimir Kostov said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Continues Criticism of Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy continues to express deep
disappointment and criticism over India's nuclear tests, a senior
foreign ministry official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a Rome meeting with the Indian Ambassador Fabian Pranchu,
Silvio Fagiolo said India's nuclear tests have created great
concern in the Italian government, political and media circles.
</P>
<P>
The tests are contrary to the international trend of
disarmament and efforts to promote a global test ban regarding
nuclear weapons, Fagiolo said.
</P>
<P>
Italy hopes that India will change its security policy in
the face of worldwide protests over the tests, he added.
</P>
<P>
India exploded three nuclear devices on Monday, drawing
intensive criticism from the international community. Despite the
economic sanctions the United Stated announced on Tuesday, New
Delhi carried out two more nuclear tests on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the Italian media, foreign ministry officials
also met diplomats from the Pakistan Embassy in Rome. They asked
Pakistani authorities to take a responsible and a self-controlled
attitude toward the event.
</P>
<P>
Any out-of-control reactions to the Indian tests would heighten
tensions on the sub-continent of Southern Asia, Italian officials
said.

<P>
HELSINKI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen said Wednesday that her country was deeply shocked by
India's second round of nuclear blasts conducted earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
She criticized India for defying worldwide protests against
the three underground tests on Monday and the two explosions
carried out on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests would reduce stability in the region and also
jeopardize the international ban on nuclear tests, Halonen said.
</P>
<P>
Finland and other international organizations would ask India
stop all nuclear tests and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty approved by the United Nations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish minister appealed to other countries in the region
to show great restraint to avoid an arms race.
</P>
<P>
After India's first nuclear blasts on Monday, Halonen stressed
the tests were a very dangerous step and said every country had a
duty to ban nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish Foreign Ministry summoned the Indian Ambassador
Wednesday, to express its disapproval of the tests.

<HEADLINE> Egypt FM Says NPT Becomes Ineffective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Anr Moussa
said Wednesday that the nuclear tests undertaken recently by India
prove that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was
indefinitely renewed, became ineffective.
</P>
<P>
In a press statements released following a meeting between
President Hosni Mubarak and Indian Vice President Krishnan Kant,
Moussa branded the NPT as a non-international agreement that is no
longer capable of controlling matters relevant to nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the two leaders discussed the recent developments
in India. India exploded three types of nuclear devices at an
underground testing site Monday in the desert 550 kilomers
southwest of New Delhi, the first such tests since 1974.
</P>
<P>
When asked on Egypt's stance on the Indian nuclear tests,
Moussa said the topic opens once again talk on how far the NPT is
effective and of use.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the necessity of reconsidering the agreement,
Moussa noted that the credibility of the NPT is eroding "day after
another."
</P>
<P>
"Each country in the world is free to join the NPT or not to
join it, but it remains sure that this treaty is a failure," the
Egyptian top diplomat noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to reconsider the NPT as its credibility is
eroding day after day," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indian vice president strongly defended India's nuclear
tests at a joint press conference with leaders from other 15
developing countries attending the G-15 summit in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Poll Body Vows to Quicken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid accusations by opposition
parties that the poll body was deliberately delaying the counting
of votes to rig election results, the Philippines' Commission on
Elections (Comelec) has vowed to ensure the credibility of
election results.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to expedite the results of the elections,"
Comelec Chairman Bernardo Pardo said Wednesday, pledging to start
the counting of the votes for senators and finish the entire
process in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
As for the canvassing of the returns for the presidential and
vice presidential elections, Pardo said this would start on May
25, when the bicameral Congress resumes session and convenes into
the National Board of Canvassers.
</P>
<P>
"Let no one cast doubt on the determination of the Comelec to
ensure the credibility of election results," Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, only a fraction of the estimated 27 million
votes have been counted, raising fears of cheating.
</P>
<P>
"The longer it takes to count the votes, the more chance there
is of cheating," said Senator Orlando Mercado, secretary-general
of the opposition LAMMP party (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses).
</P>
<P>
The National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel),
the sole non-governmental organization accredited by the Comelec
to conduct a quick count of the votes, said it had managed to
tabulate only six percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel Secretary General Guillermo Luz said they are being
held back by the counting for the party list, but opposition
leaders claimed the delay was part of a "sinister plot" by the
ruling Lakas-NUCD to rig the polls.
</P>
<P>
The party list system was introduced in Monday's elections to
enable small political parties and marginalized and
under-represented sectors to obtain possible representation in the
House of Representatives, which was traditionally dominated by big
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting in Philippine elections is a laborious, manual
process that takes weeks to produce a result.
</P>
<P>
After the counting of votes at the precinct level, the election
returns would be transferred to the municipal or city level where
the total votes of the returns will be recorded and tabulated on
the certificate of canvass.
</P>
<P>
The certificate would be then sent to the provincial level
which would then give the forms to the House of Representatives
for the counting of presidential and vice presidential positions
while the Commission on Elections will count the votes for the
senatorial and party list positions.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters went to
the polls on Monday to elect a new president, a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House
of Representatives and more than 17,000 local officials and
councilors.
</P>
<P>
The latest unofficial figures released by Namfrel showed that
Vice President Joseph Estrada of the LAMMP continued to take a
commanding lead with 1,158,710 votes.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Ramos' anointed candidate of the
ruling Lakas-NUCD party, was ranked third with 458,210 votes.
</P>
<P>
Independent presidential candidates senator Juan Ponce Enrile
accepted defeat on Wednesday, becoming the first to concede defeat
to Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, who was one of Estrada's
most outspoken critics during the campaign, called Wednesday on
losing candidates to concede defeat to Estrada, saying "the trend
is now clear."
</P>
<P>
But President Ramos remained optimistic that his preferred
successor, Speaker Jose de Venecia, would give Estrada a good
fight.

<HEADLINE> Possession of Child Pornography Illegal in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish parliament approved a
move Wednesday to make possession of child pornography illegal and
punish offenders with severe prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, put forward by the Social Democrat government, was
passed by 213 to 78 votes in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Possession of pornographic material is allowed in Sweden under
the constitutional law on freedom of press and speech. The
adoption of the proposal, which will come into effect on January
1, 1999, will amend the constitutional clause to exempt child
pornography from the law. Offenders will face jail terms of up to
four years.
</P>
<P>
Videos and pictures of child pornography have been banned
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sexual exploitation of children has drawn attention around the
world. In August 1996, Sweden and the U.N. held a convention on
protecting children from sexual exploitation in Stockholm, calling
on all countries to safeguard children's rights.

BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Milorad Dodik, the prime minister
of the Republic of Srpska of Bosnia, spoke of his new government's
performance during the first 100 days of its establishment, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on his administrative program, Dodik, who took
office in January, said his government has unswervingly carried
out the Dayton Peace Agreement and consolidated the status of the
Republic of Srpska in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which officially ended the Bosnian war that
killed 250,000 people and displaced 2 million others, calls for
Bosnia to be preserved as a single state with two equal entities
-- the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation -- with an
almost equal division of land between them.
</P>
<P>
Dodik said that his government has also made the state organs
of the Republic of Srpska functional, and that he has fought crime
with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
On the economic situation, the prime minister said the national
budget is being managed properly and the current expenditures and
revenues have not gone beyond the scheme.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government will continue to raise the
international status of the Republic of Srpska and recover its
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- One in four people from outside
Beijing is making a living building houses in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
A demographic survey of people working in Beijing who are not
permanent residents shows that the size of this special group is
1.81 million against Beijing's population of 12 million, and more
than 90 percent of this group are industrial workers, attendants
or business people.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the people from Hebei, Sichuan and Jiangsu
provinces are industrial workers, most of them in the building
business.
</P>
<P>
While 63.4 percent of the people from Fujian and 55.4 percent
from Zhejiang, both eastern provinces, are business people. Fujian
leads all other parts of the country in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the people from the two northeast provinces of
Jilin and Heilongjiang work in the service industry, and half of
the people from Henan Province are recovering waste and used
goods.
</P>
<P>
And one-third of the people from Shanghai work as
professionals, officials of state agencies, Party or mass
organizations, enterprises and institutions. Professionals account
for 13.7 percent of the Shanghai people working in Beijing, much
higher than the average of 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Management of people from outside Beijing has become important
work for local governments as these people, especially those with
low incomes, tend to be sources of social problems more than the
city's permanent residents since they don't have the same access
to social welfare.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
called on Latvia to alter its policy against Latvian
Russian-speakers and to protect their rights.
</P>
<P>
The demand on Wednesday came after the presidents of three
Baltic nations criticized Russia's political and economic measures
against Latvia on Tuesday in Riga, Latvia's capital.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
Russia's attitude would not change so long as it believed the
rights of Russian-speakers needed protecting.
</P>
<P>
At the Riga summit, Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus,
Latvia's Guntis Ulmanis and Lennart Meri, of Estonia, said Russian
pressure, which they described as "groundless", would not affect
the stability and unity of the three states.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and Latvia have soured since ethnic
Russians in the Baltic nation clashed with police in Riga in March.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered his government to take
economic measures against Latvia after a bomb went off near the
Russian Embassy in Riga in early April.

<P>
VIENNA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
Organization (CTBTO), a U.N. agency based in Vienna, condemned
India for continuing to test nuclear weapons on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CTBTO has also urged New Delhi to completely accept the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"The CTBTO regrets the five nuclear tests India has carried out,"
Secretary-General of the CTBTO Wolfgang Hofmann told the Austrian

</P>
<P>
Referring to India's attempt to join the CTBT, Hofmann
said: "Anyone who wishes to participate in the CTBT has to accept
the treaty without conditions."
</P>
<P>
The CTBTO was set up in September 1996 to monitor the
implementation of the CTBT. Excluding India, 149 countries have
signed the treaty, and 13 nations have already ratified it.
</P>
<P>
India conducted three nuclear tests on Monday and two more
tests on Wednesday, inciting worldwide anger. The United States
is considering sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the National Assembly of Austria issued a

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable plantations have become
a pillar of China's agriculture, according to an official of the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's vegetable plantation acreage reached 11.2 million
hectares last year, 800,000 hectares more than the previous year,
said Zhou Puguo, director of the ministry's agriculture department.
</P>
<P>
He added that China produced 341 million tons of vegetables in
1997, 41 million tons more than the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that China's per capita vegetable
consumption has risen from 119 kilograms (kg) in 1986 to 253 kg in
1997. The vegetable output value averages 250 billion yuan each
year, a figure larger than that for forestry and that for
fisheries, but next to that of grain.
</P>
<P>
China's vegetable plantations have gradually achieved economies
of scale, Zhou said, adding that in 470 counties the vegetable
plantation area has exceeded 6,600 hectares each.
</P>
<P>
However, China currently exports merely 1.37 million tons of
vegetables each year, with foreign-exchange earnings standing at
1.23 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
SAN JOSE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central American aviation
consortium TACA has inspected fuel pump cables on eight Boeing 737
airliners, finding fatigue problems in one Costa Rican plane, an
aviation official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Cerdas, head of the Civil Air Force Department, said
that a Boeing 737 owned by the Costa-Rican company Lacsa, a member
of the TACA group, was discovered to have fatigue problems in
electrical cables.
</P>
<P>
Cerdas said the plane had recorded 53,951 flight hours.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered that
every Boeing 737 aircraft having more than 50,000 flight hours
must be checked, suspecting that fatigue of insulating materials
could cause explosions and fires.
</P>
<P>
FAA believes fatigue of cables connected to fuel pumps could be
the cause of the TWA 800 crash, which killed all 230 people on
board while flying from New York to Paris.
</P>
<P>
TACA, a Salvadoran carrier, has bought controlling stocks in
Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan and Costa Rican airlines,
becoming a major player in Central America.
</P>
<P>
TACA currently uses various Boeing 737s, the majority of them
having not reached the critical mark of 50,000 flight hours.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's auto industry output
fell by 80.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared
with the same period of last year, according to the Federation of
Thai Industries.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle production totaled 26,074, down from 132,239, the

<P>
Car production dropped by 87 percent to 5,415, while the
manufacture of trucks was down by 77.4 percent at 20,294.

Despite the lower production, Thailand still managed to export
10,445 vehicles, up by 59.4 percent and valued at 4.9 billion baht
(about 13 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
When other automotive products are added, including

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Petroleum Income Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela has earned 2.58 billion
U.S. dollars in oil sales during the first quarter of the year, a
34 percent drop in revenue compared to the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Venezuela attributed the decline, which is
estimated at 440 million dollars per month, due primarily to the
sustained decline of petroleum prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan petroleum producers said the net foreign exchange
income of crude sales reached nearly 18 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that sales income this year would be lower than
the one registered last year, due to the reduction of petroleum
production and the persistent price decrease in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Mexico recently agreed to reduce
oil output in an effort to help prop up slumping petroleum
prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one local courts and seven
railway transport courts of Beijing set up reporting centers on
Wednesday to handle calls and mails against judges in a move to
show its determination to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
According to a rule to regulate the reporting work, the
reporting centers are responsible of handling reports against
judges and secretaries who conduct illegal or improper behavior in
trying cases, reported today's "Beijing Daily."
</P>
<P>
The rule advocates reports with real names. The reporting
centers will register reports of various forms, and submit them to
departments of discipline supervision in three days if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The rule also requires the reporting centers to keep secret of
names of reporters and protect their personal safety upon
reporters' requests.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony to mark the establishment of the reporting
center of the Beijing Higher People's Court, Zhang Fusen, deputy
secretary of the Beijing municipal committee of the Communist
Party of China, said the establishment of the reporting centers in
the municipality is a significant measure of the courts at various
levels to tighten discipline and receive public supervision.
</P>
<P>
He asked leading officials at each level and judges to support
the reporting work, saying that the reporting centers must handle
reports earnestly and conduct investigation with concerned
departments.

<HEADLINE> Lethal-Injection Execution Carried out in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A convicted murderer in central
China's Hunan Province was executed by lethal injection last week
by order of the Hunan Zhangjiajie Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
This was China's second court to carry out a lethal-injection
death penalty since the Kunming Intermediate People's Court in
southwest China's Yunnan Province took the lead on March 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, the criminal, Yang Meng, who was
paralyzed, had asked the court repeatedly for a lethal injection
to end his life.
</P>
<P>
After getting approval from the Hunan Higher People's Court,
the court decided to carry out the death penalty through lethal
injection.
</P>
<P>
According to the Criminal Procedures Law of China, which was
amended in 1996 and became effective on Jan. 1, 1997, capital
punishment can be carried out by a firing squad or through lethal
injection on an execution ground or in other designated places of
custody.
</P>
<P>
Law experts said that the lethal injection is an easier and
simpler form of execution. It saves manpower, materials and money,
and helps avoid accidents, and can reduce the suffering of the
condemned criminal.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai exported 9.7 billion U.S.
dollars worth of products in the first four months of the year, an
increase of 14.5 percent over the same period last year, Customs
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Chinese state-owned enterprises' exports amounted to 5.4
billion U.S. dollars, but foreign-funded companies are catching
up. The latter's exports rose by 22 percent on a yearly basis, and
the growth rate led that of the state-owned firms by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Asian financial crisis, Shanghai's exports to
Asia rose by only 2.6 percent in the four months, but imports
dramatically increased. Asia, whose goods became cheaper,
contributed to nearly 60 percent of Shanghai's imports. Shanghai
imported 7.2 billion U.S. dollars of goods, up 9.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> El Nino to Last Until August in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The climatic phenomenon called
El Nino will continue until August in Argentina, the national
meteorological service predicted here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The service said in a communique that El Nino has caused the
occurrence of floods in various provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the storms have ended and climatic conditions have
improved over the past days, water levels are going down and
people who fled the areas are beginning to return home, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentine meteorologists warned that another climatic
phenomenon, La Nina, could cause low temperatures and droughts
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
La Nina occurs when waters of the Pacific Ocean, which are now
lukewarm, become abruptly cold. It happens less frequently than
El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Water temperature at Tierra del Fuego Province has dropped to
an usual low of 12 degrees centigrade below zero, a phenomenon
considered by the meteorologists as a forerunner of La Nina.
</P>
<P>
They believe this southern Argentine province will experience
strong snow storms due to La Nina.

seconds after leaving the bench, giving Chelsea a 1-0 victory
against Stuttgart in the Cup Winners' Cup final Wednesday night.

The goal was Zola's fourth in the competition and the 12th of

<HEADLINE> China's Fujian Province Seeks to Attract Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province is
keen to counter the effects of the Asian financial crisis and
attract more overseas investment, an investment promotional fair
held here indicates.
</P>
<P>
Fujian offered 50 major projects for overseas investment at the
fair on Monday, with total investment hitting 4 billion U.S.
dollars. The projects cover such sectors as infrastructure,
petrochemicals, machinery, electronics, timber processing,
building materials, animal husbandry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The fair attracted more than 300 representatives from foreign
consulates in Shanghai, international organizations, and overseas
companies and financial consortiums.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, an economically dynamic province in coastal China, had
approved more than 23,000 overseas-funded enterprises by the end
of last year, with contracted and paid-in overseas investment
reaching 50 billion and 22 billion U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Fujian utilized an average of more than 4
billion U.S. dollars in overseas investment each year, about 10
percent of the national figure.
</P>
<P>
The recent financial crisis in Asia has adversely affected
Fujian, as more than 70 percent of the province's overseas
investment comes from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
To counter the effects of the financial crisis, Fujian has
introduced some preferential policies concerning tax refunds and
the use of land. It has also taken measures to simplify the
procedure to examine and approve projects.
</P>
<P>
Fujian also has beefed up its efforts to attract investment
from multinational corporations in Europe and the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Underscores Importance of Strong Transatlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Wednesday called on the United States and European countries to
maintain their strong partnership in order to jointly confront
challenges in the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area can only be
secured by our common efforts," Kohl said, adding that "Europe
needs a strong United States, but the United States also needs a
strong Europe".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony held in the Berlin Schauspielhaus for
visiting U.S. president Bill Clinton, Kohl also noted that the
continuing integration of Europe would also open up new prospects
and chances for the transatlantic partnership.
</P>
<P>
"A politically and economically integrated Europe with the
inclusion of central and eastern European nations will be a more
attractive and valuable partner for the United States," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the partnership with the United States as
well as the construction of the "House of Europe" were both of
vital importance for Germany.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose slightly
against the Japanese yen and the mark Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also rose against the Canadian dollar despite
the Bank of Canada's efforts to prop up its currency.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 134.10 yen,
up from 134.07 late Tuesday. The dollar bought 1.7796 marks, up
from 1.7762.
</P>
<P>
Investors once believed that the Bank of Japan is likely to
intervene once the dollar hits 135 yen.
</P>
<P>
There was little action concerning dollar-mark trading.
However, British data released Wednesday showing a
stronger-than-expected economy lowered expectations that Britain
would raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday: 1.4807 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.9635 French francs, up
from 5.9520; 1,754.50 Italian lire, up from 1,751.00; and 1.4444
Canadian dollars, up from 1.4338.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stresses Support for Greater Unity in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton started
his two-day official visit to Germany by reiterating his support
for European economic integration and the eastward expansion of
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"If Europe is in peace, America is more secure; if Europe
prospers, America does as well," said Clinton in a speech
delivered Wednesday at the Schauspielhaus in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
While highlighting the traditional alliance between the United
States and western Europe, Clinton also set out a four-point
agenda which he said should be jointly pursued by the United
States and its European allies in order to meet common challenges
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The four points are to further strengthen security in Europe,
to promote prosperity on both side of the Atlantic, to extend and
strengthen democracy in central and eastern Europe and to
strengthen global cooperation between the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Clinton also highlighted the importance to
strengthen the roles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in order
to guarantee peace and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that Western countries must maintain and
strengthen partnership with Russia and Ukraine and help them
"confront the daunting challenge of transition to market economies
in the age of globalization."
</P>
<P>
He also called on the EU to eventually embrace Turkey which is
currently excluded from membership negotiations of EU enlargement.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
advanced to a new high today.
</P>
<P>
It rose 50.07 points to 9,211.84, beating May 4's record close
of 9,192.66 and extending this year's gain to 16.5 percent --
doubling what many analysts had predicted for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer has now risen four consecutive
sessions, gaining about 235 points.
</P>
<P>
Most broad-market indexes also posted modest gains, but
remained well below record territory.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 3.07 to 1,118.86, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 6.01 to 1,866.17.
</P>
<P>
Decliners still outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 599.25 million
shares as against 600.91 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 0.92 to 579.20, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.59 to 742.99.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.35 to 477.48.
</P>
<P>
For the second day in a row, stocks drew key support from the
bond market, where the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell farther
below 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rally was inspired by the news that inflation remained
caged last month.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that prices charged by factories
and other producers rose in April for the first time in seven
months, while the Commerce Department said retail sales rebounded
after a lull in March.
</P>
<P>
Stocks have seesawed in recent weeks amid concerns that Federal
Reserve officials might boost the central bank's key lending rates
to lessen inflation pressure.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Netanyahu to Meet Again Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
have agreed to meet again Thursday as their 90-minute talks failed
to find a way to break the Middle East peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said in a written
statement Wednesday, "The secretary will meet again with Prime
Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, May 14, in a continuation of this
(peace) effort."
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official disclosed Albright and Netanyahu had not
found a way to "overcome the differences" on the size of Israel's
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said in the statement that they would "try to overcome
remaining differences and thereby put the Middle East peace
process back on track" when they meet again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Albright had scheduled only one day for talks with Netanyahu.
But she canceled a trip she was to take to the Netherlands
Thursday so that she and the Israeli leader could meet again.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American and Israeli experts held their own talks in
an effort to untangle the dispute over the Clinton
administration's proposal that calls for Israel to withdraw from
13 percent of the territory on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright made no statement after her talks with Netanyahu,
while Netanyahu is expected to go to Capitol Hill where he has
considerable support for his position on the U.S. withdrawal
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Blair Condemns "Triumphalism" over IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Wednesday condemned "triumphalism" displayed by convicted IRA
prisoners at its weekend congress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the British parliament, Blair said: "I join
entirely with the comments made by many people, not least the
Irish Taioseach (Prime Minister Bertie Ahern), in saying he
condemns totally the triumphalism that we saw on our television
screens."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
gave warm welcome to notorious former IRA guerrillas, such as the
four-man Balcombe Street gang who were responsible for 16 murders
in Britain in the 1970s, at the congress which endorsed the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Gang leader Hugh Doherty, released just for a day from a
23-year prison sentence to attend the meeting, was photographed
with his fist raised in triumph beside a smiling Gerry Adams,
leader of Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the province's largest Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, also showed concerns to the
triumphalism of the prisoners at Sinn Fein's party congress.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's behavior had increased concern in Northern Ireland
that they would accept the benefits the peace accord gave them
"without accepting the matching obligation to show that there is a
genuine peace," Trimbel said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached on April 10, all IRA prisoners will
be released within two years and Sinn Fein will join the
administration to run Northern Ireland with Protestant
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Cut-inflation: Priority Goal of Romanian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cut-inflation is one of Romania's
top priorities of this year, and a sustained economic growth could not
be carried out without it, Prime minister Radu Vasile stressed
Wednesday, when presenting a report on the state 1998 draft budget
to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Report reads the inflation rate in the first quarter of
this year reached 16.7 percent as compared with the 22 percent
forecasted. The preliminary data for April indicate some 3 percent
inflation rate, and the economic program for the second term is
forecasted at 8.5 percent, and for the last half of the year it is
foreseen 9.5 percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
"If on short term the fight against inflation supposes a strict
control of liquidities and budgetary deficit, on medium term the
salary policies and the policies of competition protection and
fighting the monopolistic structures have a decisive role", the
Report adds.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the government wants in 1998 to
maintain in real terms the Gross Domestic Product /GDP/ at the
1997 level. Given the restructuring acceleration, the report reads
the industrial output will decrease by 0.5 percent, and the GDP
dynamic will be backed by the investments process. The report also
forecasts the export will increase by 5.6 percent, and the import
by 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
As regards the foreign capital investments, the report reads
the new legislation on privatization and the direct investments
will eliminate uncertainties of the domestic and foreign investors
and will stimulate the privatization process. The government
program aims to carry out 2.9 percent of the GDP from direct
foreign investments volume and 1.8 percent of the GDP from the
portfolio investments volume.
</P>
<P>
The draft state budget for 1998 was elaborated by the former
government, toughly negotiated with the International Monetary Fund
representatives and accepted by the Radu Vasile cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In the specialized parliamentary commissions, the draft was not
submitted to essential modifications, the parliamentarians hope to
conclude the debates on this law by 20 May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Testing Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Department said
Wednesday that it would continue testing its costly anti-missile
defense system despite five consecutive test failures.
</P>
<P>
"We're bound to have failures," Defense Secretary William Cohen
told a Senate defense subcommittee Wednesday, a day after the
fifth straight failure of test on the system.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said "technology can be very complicated." But he added
that Pentagon would press forward with the 15 billion U.S. dollar
program.
</P>
<P>
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) failed to
intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White
Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary investigation indicates that the THAAD missile
lost control shortly after launch," the Pentagon said in a written
statement. "The missile impacted on the White Sands Missile Range
about two miles north of the launch site."
</P>
<P>
The missile system, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., is designed
to protect troops in the field from attack by Scud and other
short- and medium-range missiles. It is supposed to be an
improvement on the Patriot missile system.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's budget request for missile defense
seeks 822 million dollars for continued testing and development of
THAAD next year and the House National Security Committee has
endorsed that figure.
</P>
<P>
The Army wants to begin buying 40 interceptor missiles as a
first installment on a system that is projected to cost 15 billion
dollars to acquire and 18 billion dollars to operate over 20
years, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests in the last couple of days backed
Republican lawmakers' call for a national missile defense system.
They cited India's nuclear tests as fresh evidence of the need for
such a program.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Right-wingers vs. Netanyahu on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. At stake is his decision on further Israeli
troop withdrawal, and also, may be his position at home.
</P>
<P>
Just as Netanyahu goes into the meeting in Washington Wednesday
night, Israeli ring-wingers in the government and the Knesset
(Parliament) warned that he should not go too far on Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Signaling mounting pressure from the right-wing camp against
possible concessions on redeployment, Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon has turned down Netanyahu's
invitation to join him in talks with Albright.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, the leading Likud hawk in the government and now on a
visit to the U.S. of his own, expressed the fear that Netanyahu
might agree to Israeli troop withdrawal by a scope larger than the
9 percent the Israeli Security Cabinet had already decided upon.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that any pullback exceeding 9 percent could
endanger the security of the Jewish state. Albright is expected to
tight the screw on Netanyahu to accept the U.S. plan for a 13.1
percent withdrawal, which has been accepted in principle by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Other right-wingers have also begun to mobilize to launch a
campaign against expanding the extent of the second redeployment,
threatening to topple Netanyahu or ruin his chances of re-election
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom, a member of the ruling
partner National Religious Party (NRP), said on Wednesday that his
party could only remain in the government if Netanyahu sticks to a
9 percent pullback.
</P>
<P>
But he sounded his worry that Albright might pressure
Netanyahu to accept a larger-sized withdrawal in order to break
the prolonged deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud member of Knesset Reuven Rivlin warned that
if Netanyahu gives in, another Likud member Zeev Begin,
Netanyahu's leading rival within his own party, might run for
prime minister in the next election.
</P>
<P>
If Begin joins the race, the chances of Netanyahu's re-election
could be severely eroded because Begin could split the votes of
the right-wing camp.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, head of the extremist Knesset group Land of
Israel Front, dismissed the reported compromise proposal that the
Israeli troops would first withdraw from 9 percent of the West
Bank and leave another 4 percent as the nest egg pending PNA's
fulfillment of its commitments.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that if there is such a withdrawal, there would
be "no government." He agreed that Begin could be a good candidate
for prime minister in the next election if the Likud government
carries out a major pullback which would force Begin to leave the
Likud to form a new right-wing party.
</P>
<P>
To drive home their warnings to Netanyahu, one-third of the NRP
central committee members have signed a petition demanding the
party's ministers to quit the government if Netanyahu decides to
hand over more territory to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. not Optimistic over Albright-Netanyahu Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
on Wednesday that Washington was not very optimistic about a
meeting between Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on how to revive the deadlocked
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to be overly optimistic, given the history,"
spokesman James Rubin told reporters as Albright met Netanyahu at
a Washington hotel. But he added, "We remain hopeful" of breaking
the 15-month impasse.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, defending Washington from charges of pressuring Israel
into an agreement, insisted that U.S. leaders had done everything
to accommodate the needs of Israel for its security.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, our ideas meet and are virtually identical with the
essential elements of the desires of the prime minister of
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, now in Germany on a visit, said on
Wednesday that he was "hoping we can find an agreement based on
the ideas we've presented."
</P>
<P>
"We haven't tried to fid a formula to resolve all the issues,"
Clinton told reporters in Berlin. "We've tried to find a formula
to get them over the hurdle."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived in Washington dearlier in the morning. He
made no public remarks before his meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the secretary of state, Netanyahu will
go to Capitol Hill, where he has considerable support for his
objection to a U.S. withdrawal proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has asked Netanyahu to agree to
withdraw from 13 percent of the territory of the West Bank. But
the Israeli leader refused to accept the U.S. formula.
