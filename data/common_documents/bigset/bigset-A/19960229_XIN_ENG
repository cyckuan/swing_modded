<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Planned N. Ireland All-party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today welcomed a decision by the British and Irish leaders to hold
an all-party peace talks on political settlement of the Northern
Ireland problem on June 10.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released by the White House, Clinton
said that he believed the decision by British Prime minister John
Major and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton had laid out a clear
path that would lead to talks on the future of Northern Ireland
once the ceasefire was restored.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month ceasefire in Northern Ireland was abruptly
interrupted by a bombing in London on February 9 claimed by the
Irish Republican Army (IRA). The IRA has accused the British
government of blocking it from taking part in the long-expected
all-party political talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged "those who have resorted to violence to heed the
voice of the people and cease their campaign of terror."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said that he was convinced that the
all-party talks "is the path supported by the overwhelming
majority of the people of Northern Ireland, who have so
resoundingly rejected violence and embraced peace."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the U.S. government remained fully committed to
backing the search for peace in the region, and would remain in
close touch with both British and Irish leaders in promoting the
peace process in Ulster.

<HEADLINE> Wandering Banned on Streets in Lebanon's Main Cities on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after the army command
ordered tonight a ban on wandering in Beirut and other main cities
in Lebanon on Thursday, the Lebanese General Workers Confederation
(GWC) announced its compliance with the order.
</P>
<P>
Semi curfew was imposed by the Lebanese Army in the Lebanese
capital of Beirut and other main cities on Thursday to preempt
demonstrations planed by the powerful GWC and political opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Army Command issued an order tonight, baring
wandering on streets in Beirut and its suburbs, Saida, Sour,
Jounieh, Tripoli, Baalbek, Nabatiyeh, Baaqklin and Zahle from 3:00
a.m. (1:00 GMT) Thursday until another instruction.
</P>
<P>
Only cars of diplomatic missions, U.N. offices, government
departments, water and electricity services, as well as ambulances
and school buses are allowed to drive on the streets, according to
the order.
</P>
<P>
It added that the army and police will shot without a warning
at those carrying weapons openly.
</P>
<P>
And the order authorizes the official armed forces to enforce
the ban and refer those violating the order to the military court.
</P>
<P>
Since this afternoon, more army patrols have been sent to the
streets in Beirut and other cities, and more check points have
been set up at road crosses, and army units and internal security
forces have taken their positions at all entrances of the capital,
in an implementation of a government decision to ban the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
House speaker Nibih Berri's office announced tonight that
efforts made by Berri in a bit to cool the hot atmosphere and to
avert a confrontation between the government and the powerful
General Workers Confederation "resulted in a failure and the
house speaker will fly to Brazil for an official visit as
previously planned."
</P>
<P>
And shortly after the ban on wandering was ordered by the army
command, president of the GWC, Elias Abu Rizk, announced his
confederation's compliance with the order and to suspended
Thursday's demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"We affirm a continuity of the confrontation with the
government until the rights are realized and the demands are
responded," the GWC president said.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that he will call an emergency meeting
of the GWC's Executive Committee to define a future position for a
continuos action.
</P>
<P>
Abu Rizk stressed that his confederation "is with the order of
the army command and is against the decision take by the
government."
</P>
<P>
He said that the day of Thursday, February 29, is a "day of
strike and demonstrations" but the army order to ban wandering is
effective to prevent the demonstrations."

<HEADLINE> PNA Sets Deadline for Turning in Illegal Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) demanded today that all residents in the
autonomous areas who have illegal weapons hand them over to the
Palestinian police by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police chief Razi Jibali warned today in Gaza that
next week, the Palestinian police will carry out raids and
searches and anyone caught with illegal weapons will be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA has set up a military tribunal to try two
senior Palestinian police officers who participated in a memorial
service for Hamas master bombmaker "engineer" Yihye Ayyash, who
was murdered last month in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Hamas accused Israeli secret service agents of killing Ayyash.
</P>
<P>
The two officers are both colonels, and one of them was filmed
on television stamping on the Israeli flag.
</P>
<P>
The new steps taken by the PNA against Islamic extremists came
amid mounting pressure by Israel following Sunday's two Hamas
suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which killed 25
people and wounded 80 others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hamas organization in Damascus today claimed
responsibility for Monday's attack in northern Jerusalem when an
American of Arab origin deliberately drove into a bus stop,
killing one woman and injuring 22 others.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that the driver, Ahmed Hamideh, was a
member of its military wing and carried out the attack to avenge
the death of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shkaki in Malta, who many
Palestinians believe was also murdered by Israeli secret agents.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police first thought that Hamideh lost control
of his car and accidentally drove into the crowd at the
bus stop, and therefore it might be a traffic accident. He
was shot dead immediately by a bystander at the scene.
</P>
<P>
However, after examining the car and road surfaces, the
police said on Tuesday that Hamideh deliberately drove into
the crowd to try to kill as many people as possible.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Vote to Extend Whitewater Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite Democrats'
objection, the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday voted to extend
indefinitely the Whitewater investigation originally due to expire
on April 3.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said the committee needs more time because key
witnesses will not be available until the former business partners
of President Bill Clinton and his wife are prosecuted in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
By a 9-7 party-line vote, the panel approved a resolution to
provide an additional 600,000 dollars for the investigation and
leave the completion date open. The investigation could continue
well into the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat of Connecticut, said that
those who favor a prolonged Whitewater probe are engaging in "a
preoccupation of `Gotcha!.'"
</P>
<P>
"The public perception here" is that "this is a political"
investigation, said Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat of Maryland,
the ranking member of the Senate Whitewater Committee.
</P>
<P>
The resolution to extend the investigation was headed to the
Senate Rules Committee which could send it to the Senate floor
today.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopted Opinion on Intergovernmental Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
adopted today its opinion for the Intergovernmental Conference
(IGC) to open in Turin, Italy on 29 March, which is aimed to
update and amend the Maastricht Treaty on political and economic
integration of the European Union(EU).
</P>
<P>
The opinion, entitled "reinforcing political union and
preparing for enlargement", called for an "ambitious" conference
and underlined one essential point: deepening and enlarging the
Community "go hand in hand".
</P>
<P>
Presenting the opinion on the IGC to the European Parliament
this afternoon, EC President Jacques Santer said that the EC
expected that the IGC would strengthen the Union so as to prepare
enlargement around "a clear political project".
</P>
<P>
In the EC's view, the EU must therefore be closer to its
citizens, make its presence felt in the world, adopt an
institutional system which will work in an expended Europe.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Santer said that it was "absolutely vital" for the IGC to
set clear objectives and provide the right tools.
</P>
<P>
"But that will serve no purpose if it is not supported by real
political will, that is the overriding requirement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC President, the opinion identified ways and
means of "making enlargement a success without any dilution of
European integration" and enumerated a set of practical
guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Non-oil, Gas Imports Rise in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of Indonesia's
imports of non-oil and gas commodities increased sharply in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil and gas imports accounted for 92.95 percent of the
total Indonesian imports in January-November 1995 period while
non-oil and gas exports made up only 76.90 percent, local daily
Kompas reported today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's efforts to boost exports by speeding
up the launch of deregulation packages and providing incentives
for the production sector, imports still exceeded exports.
</P>
<P>
In these 11 months, the non-oil and gas deficit in the balance
of payments amounted to 3,140 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase was primarily caused by surging imports of
half-processed food and beverage for households.
</P>
<P>
The import of electronic goods and components in 1995 increased
247.6 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, the rise of
general imports was due to the changing lifestyle of Indonesians.

<HEADLINE> Plywood Production Drops in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's plywood production
in the January-November 1995 period recorded a drastic drop of
40.44 percent from the same 1994 period.
</P>
<P>
The decline is very sharp considering that production of logs
-- plywood's raw material -- only experienced a fall of 10.44
percent in 1995, according to the data from the Indonesian Wood
Panel Association.
</P>
<P>
Plywood output in the period was recorded at 4.8 million cubic
meters, far below 1994's 8.1 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Produced from large logs, plywood accounts for more than 70
percent of the 6 billion US dollars generated annually from
Indonesian wood product exports.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's wood product exports account for more than 13
percent of its overall annual export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian plywood makes up about 80 percent of the world's
supply.
</P>
<P>
Business circles hope that the sharp decline of Indonesian
plywood production will boost the price of plywood on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
There are three major hard plywood exporting countries in the
world, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil. Major hard plywood
importers are Japan, China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 25 years, the raw materials for plywood will
diminish as the size of Indonesia's large timber areas will
decrease because many of them will become protected forests and
national parks.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, plywood would gradually lose its dominant position
in Indonesian wood product exports, giving way to other particle
board types, such as medium density fiber board and laminated
vinyl lumber board.

<HEADLINE> Keating Keeps Re-election Hope Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating said today that the Labor Party still had chance to
win the federal election on March 2.
</P>
<P>
He told a packed National Press Club here this afternoon that
the latest public opinion polls put Labor only two or three
percentage points behind the Liberal-National coalition.
</P>
<P>
The result of the AGB McNair Poll taken Monday and Tuesday
nights showed that Labor was trailing the opposition coalition
48.5 percent to 51.5 percent on a two-party preferred vote basis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier results of the Morgan Poll also indicated that Labor
cut back the coalition's lead to only two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
This proved that voters were listening to what Labor said,
Keating said.
</P>
<P>
However, another major public opinion poll provided a totally
different picture by revealing that Labor was still far behind the
coalition. The News Poll released Tuesday showed that the gap
between the two sides widened to 10.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Labor's efforts for re-election hit a stumbling block today
when Federal Treasurer Ralph Willis admitted that a letter he used
as evidence against the coalition in the election campaign was
forged.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader John Howard demanded the resignation of
Willis.
</P>
<P>
But Keating dismissed the issue as an error of judgment, saying
that the person who forged the letter was obviously on a non-Labor
side of politics.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Labor was still behind the coalition just two
days before the election. But he stressed that his party was
catching up quickly.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the coalition for "photocopying" Labor
policies.
</P>
<P>
The similarity of the policies of the two sides gives little
clue to voters to determine which side is better. The AGB McNair
Poll showed that 11 percent of voters had yet to make up their
minds on the choice between Keating and Howard.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, any random factors could influence the
swing of voters in the final two days of election campaign. The
volatility and diversity among different polls indicated that
there would be a close contest to the last minute.

MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexandr
Lukashenko left here Wednesday for Russia's oil-rich region of
Tyumen in Siberia to hold talks with local leaders and oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit there, he is expected to discuss
proposals by local oil-producing enterprises to build oil
refineries in Belarus, sources in the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, which is in bad need of Tyumen oil, will have to

Lukashenko, who arrived in Moscow Tuesday on his first official
visit to Russia, had talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
A number of agreements were signed after the talks to speed up
bilateral economic integration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Moscow, Lukashenko told a news conference here

ROME, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Judicial Committee of Italy's
lower house of parliament passed an anti-usury bill today to check
the rampant practice of lending money at an unfairly high rate of
interest.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which cleared the Senate last week, offenders
would be sentenced to one to six years in prison and fined up to
30 million liras (18,750 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 4 million Italians, or 7 percent of
the total population, fell victim to usury.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that the Treasury Ministry will announce a
national average interest rate once every three months and lending
agencies charging interest rates 50 percent higher than the
national average would be seen as practicing usury.
</P>
<P>
The commission will allocate 230 billion liras (144 million
U.S. dollars) for the establishment of a special fund in the next
two years to protect usury victims.

<HEADLINE> Army Deployed in Bangladeshi Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Army was called out last night
in the besieged Chittagong, the largest port city in Bangladesh,
to contain a political rioting sparked by the arrest of the mayor
and the city's secretary general of the largest opposition party
-- the Awami (People's) League.
</P>
<P>
Sources concerned said that army convoys started patrolling
city streets after midnight with sophisticated guns in their
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The port city was cut off as communications on highways snapped
when anti-government protesters put up barricades amidst flare-ups
of violence, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as soon as the news of the arrest of the
mayor spread, the life in the city became completely tormented and
with the law-enforcing agencies men falling back from their posts
and staying closed in their headquarters. The whole city was
virtually turned into pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred cars, baby taxies, tempos, jeeps, buses and
trucks were damaged and set on fire all over the city by frenzied
supporters of the arrested mayor while violent incidents of
clashes, bomb blasts, gunfire, arson and lawlessness left more
than 50 people injured.
</P>
<P>
Since the launching of a "non-cooperation movement" by the
opposition parties last Saturday to protest against the ruling
party-held "one party farcical elections" on February 15, the
authorities have arrested a number of opposition parties' leaders
and workers in a bid to "maintain law and order" in the country.
But the arrests have sparked more violent clashes between the
opposition activists and the ruling party supporters and
law-enforcing agencies.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Aimed at fighting the soaring
unemployment in the nation, Poland will carry out a new employment
and anti-unemployment law as of March 1.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Labor Minister Maciej Manicki told reporters today that
under the new law, those who refuse job offers from labor
departments will no longer receive unemployment pensions.
</P>
<P>
However, those who are registered at labor departments and are
really looking for jobs can receive financial aid or scholarships
for their job trainings, internships or further studies.
</P>
<P>
The new law also encourages school graduates and unemployed
people to leave their hometowns to work in places where they are
most needed by supplying travel expenses and housing rents to
them.
</P>
<P>
Poland has been plagued by serious unemployment in recent
years. Unemployment rate hit nearly 15 percent last year, with
jobless young people accounting for 63 percent of all the
unemployed. The Polish government is determined to reduce the
unemployment rate to 13.9 percent this year.

UNITED NATIONS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has requested the

Addressing a press conference at the U.N. Headquarters today,
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez announced that 27

the last day of the opposition-launched 5-day "non-cooperation
movement" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The incidents, including gunfight, bomb blasts and clashes
between the opposition activists and the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters and the law-enforcing agencies,
took place mainly in Narayanganj near Dhaka, Natore in the west
and the largest port city of Chittagong.

Reports reaching here today said that in Chittagong, the mayor
and the city's general secretary of the country's largest
opposition party -- the Awami League (AL) A.B.M. Mohuidin
Chowdhury were arrested by the police, which triggered a violent
protest in the city.

KATHMANDU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali currency
Wednesday picked up sharply against the US dollar after it hit the
record low of 60-plus three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks here Wednesday traded the Nepali rupee at
nearly 58 against one dollar at the opening, but the Nepali
currency was revalued by one rupee within one hour.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said that the sudden pick-up of the Nepali rupee
was due to the strong performance of the Indian currency in the
foreign exchange market on the same day.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central
bank, Wednesday purchased 10 million dollars worth of foreign
exchange in the local market due to the excess supply of foreign
currencies and strong Indian rupee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many commercial banks were restrained from buying
foreign exchange in fear of further appreciation of the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the Nepali rupee would be stronger in the coming
days.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Polls to Be Held Two Rounds: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) --The Russian presidential
election scheduled for June 16 will go to a second round as none
of the candidates will get enough votes in the first round,
experts said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that the four major presidential
candidates are Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, Yabloko
bloc leader Grigory Yavlinsky, President Boris Yeltsin and
Liberal-Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said Yeri
Levada, director of the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Levada said his experts forecast that Zyuganov will receive 33
percent of the vote in the first round of the election. His
possible rivals in the second round will be Yeltsin and Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
It will be very difficult for Yeltsin to defeat the communist
party leader in the second round, Levada said, adding that "the
maximum support for Yeltsin is 27 percent" according to the
poll. Yavlinsky will be more successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats here believe that it is still too early to
say who will be Russia's next president.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, about 63 percent of respondents voiced
their intention to vote in the election.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Veshnyakov, secretary of Russia's Central Electoral
Commission (CEC), told a news conference on Wednesday that the CEC
has registered 59 initiative groups of voters and electoral
associations which have nominated 49 candidates to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
As many as 10 of them nominated Yeltsin, Veshnyakov said.
</P>
<P>
Documents required for the nomination of presidential
candidates are to be presented by March 2, he said.
</P>
<P>
Signature lists and other necessary documents must be submitted
to the commission by April 16, the CEC secretary added.
</P>
<P>
In line with the law on presidential elections, at least one
million signatures are needed for each candidate.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of 10 Asian and 15
European countries are arriving in Bangkok to attend the first
ever Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
While most of the participants, including Chinese Premier Li
Peng, are expected to arrive today, Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Gutteres was the first to arrive Wednesday. He was
welcomed at the Bangkok Don Muang Airport by Thai Deputy Prime
Minister Samak Sundaravej.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa, who is
also chairman of the ASEM, is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings
with prime ministers of six countries -- John Major of Britain, Li
Peng of China, Lamberto Dini of Italy, Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan,
Goh Chok Tong of Singapore and Helmut Kohl of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, leaders who have arrived will attend an informal
dinner to be hosted by ASEM chairman Banharn, at which the leaders
are to agree on which subjects are, and which are not, to be
discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The informal dinner serves as a curtain raiser for the
unprecedented event, the largest ever gathering of heads of
government from Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The meeting proper begins Friday and is due to last for one day
and a half.
</P>
<P>
Officially, the meeting is "unofficial", with no agenda, no
ritual and no concluding agreement or final report.
</P>
<P>
The expected result is a chairman's statement, which is
expected to stress cooperation in political, economic and social
fields, covering a wide range of topics, including disarmament,
security, reform of the United Nations, trade, investment and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Although some of the leaders may touch upon sensitive issues in
their addresses, they are not expected to engage in serious
discussions on them.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting is the first of its kind, participants from both
continents will try to stress common goal and interest rather than
emphasizing differences and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the fact that the leaders meet at
all is more important than what they actually say to one another.

HAVANA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuba criticized today the
U.S. hegemony in pushing through a Security Council statement,
which "strongly deplores" the shooting down by the Cuban air force
of two U.S. aircraft on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Foreign Ministry described the Security Council
meeting as "precipitated."
</P>
<P>
It criticized what it called the "hegemony" of the United
States and the "biased position" of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out the Security Council statement was adopted
before Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived at the
United Nations headquarters in New York to attend the council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department "delayed" issuing the visa for
Robaina until one hour after the Council approved the statement,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. who is
currently president of the Security Council, said in a statement

XI'AN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Business receipts of rural firms
are expected to reach 100 billion yuan this year in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the income of these firms in the province
jumped to 75.5 billion yuan last year, 20 billion yuan more than
1994's figure.
</P>
<P>
Turnover in rural businesses exceeded one billion yuan in each

</P>
<P>
Profits generated by the rural industry totalled 46.1 billion
yuan last year, accounting for 46 percent of Shaanxi's total.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the fast growth of rural business to
the wider application of modern science and technology and
cooperation from institutes of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, 500 new products have been developed
in the province, many of them attaining advanced world levels,
Quan said.

<HEADLINE> Black Sea Fleet Remains Obstacle in Russian-Ukrainian  Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Differences between Russia and
Ukraine over the Black Sea Fleet should not prevent them from
signing a treaty of friendship, cooperation and partnership,
Ukrainian Prime Minister Evgeni Marchuk was quoted as saying by
local press today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Russian deputies, Marchuk also said
that under the Ukrainian Constitution, the port of Sevastopol is a
municipality directly administered by the central government.
</P>
<P>
But Russian deputies said that unless the dispute over the
Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol were resolved, the State Duma
(lower house of the Russian parliament) would not approve the
treaty, which is expected to lay down the legal basis for
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet has been a thorn in relations between the
two countries since the disintegration of the former Soviet
Union. They have agreed to split the fleet 50-50 and the Russians
are ready to purchase 32 percent of Ukraine's share of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
But Russia insists on basing its part of the fleet in
Sevastopol and moving the Ukrainian Navy's headquarters out of the
port.
</P>
<P>
The two countries could not reach agreement on these issues
early this month when Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov
visited Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk said that the inter-governmental commission will meet in
early March to discuss the issue of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up in January when Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma met with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said if both countries refuse to concede, Yeltsin
will not visit Ukraine as scheduled in early April.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report Highlights Colombia's War Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
has expressed its satisfaction with Colombia's fight against drug
trafficking following the dismantling of the Medellin cartel in
1993 and the recent arrest of the Cali cartel drug barons.
</P>
<P>
In a 64-page annual report of 1995 written by the U.N.'s
International Board of Supervision of Narcotic Substances and
released here today, the United Nations said it observed with
satisfaction the efforts made by Colombia in its war against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The annual report highlighted the war against drugs carried out
by Colombia, Mexico, Bolivia and Peru.
</P>
<P>
Colombia destroyed a large number of fields where illegal crops
of coca bushes and poppies were grown and seized several
clandestine laboratories as well as substantial quantities of
drugs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, expressed concern over the "repeated
seizures of high-quality heroin of Colombian origin."
</P>
<P>
The board urged the governments of the region to take more
steps to check the expansion of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
As for the political crisis in Colombia, the board said that
"it believes that the political difficulties will not diminish
Colombia's vigorous commitment to fight against the organizations
that engage in the trafficking of drugs and the growing,
production and manufacture of illegal drugs."
</P>
<P>
The report said that the fight against money laundering
throughout the world is a major preemptive weapon against drug
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> China's Forests Grow with Help from Above </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Aerial sowing has proved to be
the most efficient way in China of turning barren hillsides into
forests and luscious green acres.
</P>
<P>
The country now leads the world in the amount of area covered
by aerial sowing, and in the wide range of saplings used.
</P>
<P>
The technique has been extended to 800 counties in 25 Chinese
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, covering both
hilly land and plateau areas, "Economic Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
About eight million hectares of newly forested area, or one
fifth of the total man-made forests in China, were accomplished by
aerial sowing, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,500 forests cover an area of about 600 ha each. They
serve as windbreaks or provide an ample supplies of timber and
firewood.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the FAO of the UN, and a number of countries have
visited China to view aerial sowing programs.

<HEADLINE> Transient Rural Laborers Move Smoothly in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The return of thousands of
rural laborers to prosperous Guangdong Province in south China
after the Spring Festival has gone smoothly, thanks to special
transport arrangements
</P>
<P>
Guangdong adjacent, to Hong Kong, where one of the fastest
economic growths has been recorded, draws tens of thousands of
rural laborers from all over the country each year.
</P>
<P>
The rural workers usually go home to spend the traditional
Lunar New Year holidays in January or February with their families.
</P>
<P>
But as soon as the holiday ends they head back again, putting a
strain on transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
To ease the flow, China's railway department laid on more
trains, and road transportation authorities added more buses to
their timetables. Temporary booking offices and bus waiting areas
were also provided to cope with the extra demand.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days railway stations in the provincial
capital of Guangzhou have catered for thousands of transient rural
laborers, peaking with 200,000 arrivals on February 27, double the
figure of last year.
</P>
<P>
The No.2 Bus Transportation Company alone had dispatched over
1,000 buses to transport over 70,000 rural laborers by February
25.

<HEADLINE> Russia Joins Council of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia became the 39th member of
the Council of Europe today, describing its accession as a major
step toward the unification of Europe, reports said here.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov hoisted the country's
red, white and blue flag at a noontime ceremony (1300 GMT) outside
the Council's headquarters in Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
He handed over Moscow's membership documents to Council
Secretary-General Daniel Tarschys, formally marking Russia's
accession.
</P>
<P>
"For the European continent as a whole, Russia's joining the
Council of Europe can also be considered an extraordinary
event. It is a major step toward the genuine unification of
Europe," said Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Tarschys said: "This is yet another proof that the post-war
period is coming to an end and that we are entering an era of
close European cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Primakov also signed the European Convention on Human Rights, a
convention which outlaws torture, a charter on local
self-government and a convention to protect minorities.
</P>
<P>
Russia is also due to abolish the death penalty within three
years and to reform its judicial system.
</P>
<P>
The council, founded to promote integration among West European
nations as the Cold War began in 1949, is the continent's oldest
and broadest political organization.
</P>
<P>
Russia becomes the 15th former East bloc nation to join, but
its path to membership was by no means smooth.
</P>
<P>
It applied in 1992, but the council suspended talks for several
months last year to protest Moscow's military crackdown against
the breakaway region of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, the Council's parliamentary assembly overwhelmingly
approved Russia's membership last month, saying it was better to
cooperate with Russia than to isolate it.

<HEADLINE> More Protection for South China Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The endangered South China
tiger is to be given more protection in a 300 million yuan project
announced recently by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The tiger, together with the giant panda and the crested ibis,
is one of the most endangered species in the world.
</P>
<P>
A little smaller in size than the Northeast China tiger, the
South China tiger survived in large numbers for many years in
southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
But its numbers dwindled drastically because of environmental
destruction, hunting, and its low reproduction rate.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted jointly by the World Wild Life Fund and the
Chinese Ministry of Forestry has shown that at present there are
only about 20 South China tigers living separately in south
China's four provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The protection project, worth the equivalent of 36 million US
dollars, involves building more protection areas; providing mating
opportunities for South China tigers; increasing its number by
artificial means; giving special training to help the tigers adapt
to their natural habitat.

<P>
BONN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his
foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, left here today for Bangkok,
Thailand, to attend the Asia-Europe leaders meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting that starts on March 1 is bringing together
leaders from 25 Asian and European countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to discuss topics concerning freeing up economic
contacts between the continents, to challenge U.S. influence in
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany turned its eye on Asian markets earlier than most other
European Union member countries. New plans were worked out and
organizations set up to promote trade and coordinate relations
with Asian countries soon after Kohl's Asia tour in the spring of
1993.
</P>
<P>
Germany's trade with Asian countries has grown rapidly in
recent years. But its investment in these countries is still less
than that of the United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Health And Welfare of Shaanxi Disabled Served </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A five-year campaign to improve
the health and financial situations of disabled people in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province has shown solid success,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The province has exceeded national goals to improve treatment
and recovery, employment, education and living conditions, the
paper quoted Li Haiqian, director of the Shaanxi Provincial
Disabled Persons Federation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the province has invested 7.72
million yuan (about 0.93 million US dollars) in 74 disabled-run
firms, lifting 5,000 disabled out of poverty, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Shaanxi government ruled that all local
companies and enterprises hire at least 1.5 percent of their
employees from among the ranks of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
As a result, disabled employment increased by 15 percent over
the last five years. More than 60 percent of cities and counties
have disabled employment service agencies and over 80,000 disabled
persons in the province have found jobs in over 2,700 enterprises
and other firms, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 32,780 cataract patients recovered from blindness,
10,670 people were given corrective operations for sequelae of
infantile paralysis and 287 of the province's 1,866 deaf children
enrolled in ordinary kindergartens and schools after special
education to help them cope.
</P>
<P>
These results exceed the goals targeted by the national
government by 194, 157 and 164 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
By December 1995, the province had invested 16 million yuan in
education for disabled children. Shaanxi now has 33 special
schools with 2,552 students, and a training center for special
education teacher has been established.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.54 million disabled people in Shaanxi, mostly in
poor rural areas who lack sufficient food and clothing.

<HEADLINE> Military Observers: Ecuador Violates Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran army have built
heliports and small forts in the demilitarized zone bordering Peru
in violation of a peace agreement between the two countries,
military observers from the guarantor nations said.
</P>
<P>
Military establishments set up by Ecuador were detected
Saturday by the mission of military observers in Patuca during a
routine reconnaissance flight, the local press today quoted the
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government has presented a note to General
Francisco Roberto Albuquerque, general coordinator of the mission.
</P>
<P>
According to the observers, they discovered two sectors inside
the demilitarized zone where Ecuadoran forces had erected military
heliports and shelters.
</P>
<P>
The building of such installations violates the Itamaraty Peace
Agreement, signed by Peru and Ecuador on February 27 last year,
which stipulates the separation of troops and a demilitarized
zone, they said.
</P>
<P>
In January and February last year Ecuadoran and Peruvian armies
fought each other in the Cordillera del Condor border area.
</P>
<P>
The military observers from the guarantor countries, Argentina,
Chile, Brazil and the United States, have been supervising the
compliance of the ceasefire in the area.

<HEADLINE> Bridge on Three Gorges near Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, Februrary 29 (Xinhua) -- The final beam on a new
900meter long bridge across the Yangtze River has been put into
place, marking a crucial phase in the Three Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
The Xiling suspension bridge with a span of 900 meters is said
to be the first bridge on the 195-km-long Three Gorges, and the
first of its kind on the Yangtze River. It is being built 4.5
kilometers downstream from the dam.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge was started in late 1993 by the
Bureau of the Bridge Engineering under the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
It is an important auxiliary scheme in the Three Gorges
project, which will be the world's biggest dam on its completion
early next century.
</P>
<P>
Bridge builders took only 12 days to fix the 72 steel box
beams, each weighing up to 108 tons, to suspended cables. The
final segment was moved into place yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is expected to open to traffic by the end of June
this year.

<HEADLINE> Medvedev Hopes to Play for Russia in Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Tennis player Andrei Medvedev
wants to play for Russia at the Atlanta Olympic Games, the head of
Ukraine's tennis federation said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
German Venyaminov said no attempt would be made to persuade
Medvedev, ranked 13th in the world, to remain in Ukrainian
colours.
</P>
<P>
But the head of Ukraine's National Olympic Committee, 1972
Olympic sprint gold medallist Valery Borzov, said such a change
was impossible under Olympic rules.
</P>
<P>
Venyaminov said Russian citizenship was attractive to Medvedev
because Moscow played in the top ranks of the Davis Cup. Russia,
he said, wanted Medvedev to play alongside eighth ranked Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in the Olympics and the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
But Borzov said it was impossible to change the Ukrainian
national team less than five months before Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"We have already settled our team for the Olympics and the
tennis team is headed by Medvedev," he said. "Changing
citizenship at this point violates the Olympic Charter. We are
prepared to examine this question after the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, 21, has won nine major tournaments and was ranked as
high as fourth in the world in 1993. He is viewed as a national
hero in Ukraine, alongside 1994 Olympic figure skating gold
medallist Oksana Baiul and world pole vault champion Sergei
Bubka.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Reports Highest Ever Export Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region - home to one of China's largest Muslim
communities - reported record exports last year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Regional Department of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation said that the 240 million US dollars worth of
exports in 1995 represented a 64 percent increase on the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
He added that over the past few years the region's exports have
risen at an annual rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region currently exports more than 300 varieties of goods
to 54 countries and regions, including cashmere, anthracite,
chemicals, rubber tyres and farm and sideline products.
</P>
<P>
The export volume now accounts for 12.5 percent of Ningxia's
gross domestic product, the value of goods and services produced.
</P>
<P>
Last year Ningxia exported 16 million US dollars worth of food,
such as beef, mutton, Chinese wolfberry and licorice root, to
Muslims in the Islamic countries of southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic style gowns, wool textiles and knitwear were also
exported to Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is trying to make better use of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The region signed 50 contracts last year with foreign
companies, involving 52 million US dollars in overseas
investment. There are currently 395 foreign-funded enterprises in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Cold Wave Causes Three Billion Yuan Loss in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The recent wave of cold
weather caused losses of three billion yuan in south China's
Guangdong Province, local agricultural departments have reported.
</P>
<P>
Before the Spring Festival on February 19 a strong cold current
from New Siberia swept across Guangdong, sending temperatures
plunging throughout the whole province.
</P>
<P>
Such low temperatures, and accompanying persistent rain, are
rare in Guangdong, with officials saying it was the worst cold
wave since the 1940s. The weather conditions seriously affected
the province's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics show that the cold wave led to losses
across the province totalling three billion yuan (360 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among the losses, the biggest was 150,000 tons of pond fish
frozen to death. It wiped out over one tenth of the whole year's
fish production, leading to direct losses from this sector alone
of nearly one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 hectares of potatoes were also hit by the cold
weather. Total potato production fell by half, with weather
conditions preventing a quarter of the available crop from being
gathered.
</P>
<P>
Tropical and sub-tropical fruit trees, like banana and mango,
were also badly affected, with the weather preventing large
quantities of tropical fruits from being collected.
</P>
<P>
Domestic animals and bamboo in mountainous areas of the
northern part of the province were also greatly stricken.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has issued emergency circulars
calling on people to take measures against the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
A number of provincial cities and counties have also taken
prompt action to reduce the losses.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Communists Protest Against Christopher's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Communist Party
held a demonstration today in front of the presidential palace,
protesting the visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
The protesters demanded that Christopher, who arrived here
Tuesday, "leave the country."
</P>
<P>
They also criticized Chilean government's position on the
shooting down of two small U.S. airplanes by Cuban fighter jets
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The government condemned the incident on the eve of
Christopher's arrival.
</P>
<P>
While the United States said the two planes, belonging to the
Florida-based "Brothers to the Rescue," a Cuban exiles' group,
were shot down over international waters, Havana insisted that the
aircraft violated its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Gladys Marin, the Chilean Communist Party's secretary general,
said the incident created a "grave situation" and provokes
"aggression to Cuba's national sovereignty" with Washington
tightening its blockade against Havana in reprisal for the downing.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's visit "corresponds to this aggressive policy of
the United States" and President Bill Clinton is using the Cuba
situation to boost his standing in his re-election bid, Marin said.
</P>
<P>
She said the presence of the group in front of La Moneda, the
presidential palace, was an expression of solidarity with the
government and people of Cuba "who have been suffering
U.S. aggression for more than 30 years."
</P>
<P>
After his stop in Santiago, Christopher leaves for Buenos
Aires, the third stop on his five-country tour through Latin
America and the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Hopes No "Finger Pointing" At ASEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will join other East Asian and European leaders
in Bangkok on March 1 and 2 for the first Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) which Malaysia hopes will not touch each other's
sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM will be attended by leaders from 15-nation European
Union, seven member countries of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia said the ASEM should work towards creating the ideal
environment for better trade and investment linkages between two
of the most important economic regions of the world, but not
become a platform for "finger pointing".
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah
Aziz said it is time for Europe to network with Asia on an equal
basis and without any conditions, and suggested that through the
first ASEM both sides enhance trade and investment linkages and
facilitate technology transfer from Europe to Asia.
</P>
<P>
As Asian countries have developed rapidly over the past few
years, the European Union itself admits that Asia, with its share
of global output rising from four percent in 1960 to 25 percent
in 1991, could account for 33 percent of global production by the
start of the 21st century. Even without Japan, East Asia would
account for one-half of world economic growth and one-half of
world trade by the end of this decade.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries also said that Europe suffers from a
lack of visibility in Asia and stressed that the "deficit in
relations" between the two regions has to be remedied.
</P>
<P>
But there is also some noise hovering around the ASEM. Some
European countries were pushing for a linkage of trade with issues
such as human and labor rights, social clauses through the ASEM
platform.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar
cautioned that if the European side did that, Asia too had
numerous sensitive issues it could bring up if it wished.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Malaysia said the coming meeting would be time
well spent if Europe used it to find ways to avail themselves of
economic opportunities awaiting them in Asia rather than to
continue to try to penalize Asia for what it claims is Asia's
fault that European goods are not getting a fair share of the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said rather than blaming others and using extraneous
issues as an excuse to protect its domestic industries, Europe
must rectify its weakness such as less efficiency in industrial
production and high costs. It is no use looking for excuse
outside.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also concerned about possible move at the ASEM to
fix a timetable for market opening measures. Malaysia said it is
not practical as the 25 countries participating the ASEM have
different levels of economy, and so it is hard for them to
liberalize trade and investment flows under a fixed timetable.
</P>
<P>
However, the ASEM will offer a chance both for Asia and Europe
to better understand each other, and to create a new partnership
between the two regions. Participants should highly value the
meeting, just as Mahathir said, "Let's talk business, find common
ground to improve economic cooperation, do not waste time finding
fault with each other."

<HEADLINE> Inland Prosperity Helps Enliven Hainan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Sustained and stable
development in inland China helps invigorate the economy in
southernmost China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture in this island province has achieved successive
two-digit growth over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year local agriculture enjoyed a growth of 12.2 percent
over 1994. This is attributed to the national improvement of
living standards and the consumption level of the people,
especially raising of workers' wages by a big margin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since the country implemented macro-economic control in 1993,
the province has been enjoying booming tourism. The five-day work
week since last year has helped Hainan attract many tourists from
the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 hotels in the province received 3.25 million tourists,
up 12.2 percent over 1994, and among them the number of overseas
tourists was up by 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's Shilu Iron Mine provides more than four million tons
of quality iron ore to iron and steel companies in Anshan, Wuhan,
and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry, a pillar industry nationwide, is
expected to witness a speedy development during the 1996-2000
period, increasing the demand for rubber, which grows abundantly
in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the province used 1.46 billion US dollars in overseas
investment, up 15.6 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are shifting their investment focus in the
province from the former real estate to agriculture, tourism,
minerals and marine products.

<HEADLINE> Foschi Brings Her Positive Case to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- American swimmer Jessica
Foschi, who was tested positive for drugs last summer, has
switched her legal battle with US and world swimming governing
bodies to a federal court.
</P>
<P>
Foschi tested positive for steroids at a U.S. meet last August,
but was given only a two-year probation by a U.S. Swimming review
panel rather than a competition ban as prescribed by world
governing body FINA.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming appealed and voted to inflict a two-year ban on
Foschi, but backed down 10 days later and reinstituted the
probation after FINA gave Australian swimmer Samantha Riley a
break after a banned substance positive that could have ended her
Olympic dream.
</P>
<P>
Foschi's case remains pending before FINA with the U.S. Olympic
trials ready to begin next Wednesday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Foschi's lawsuit would give her grounds to act against FINA or
U.S. Swimming should they try and keep her out of the trials,
where she is considered a contender for a berth in the 800-meter
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Foschi is now set to swim at the trials, but should FINA ban
her, Foschi could go to court and prevent the trials from taking
place in her events until she is allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
Another question could be raised if Foschi competes and
qualifies for the finals, a likely prospect. The fastest
non-qualifier could take legal action, claiming she was improperly
kept from reaching the final and swimming for an Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
The same would be true for a third-place finisher if Foschi
grabbed one of two Olympic berths at stake in her events.

<P>
The number of provinces, autonomous regions or cities which

This year south China's Guangdong Province, east China's Fujian
Province, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, will attend the fair for

STOCKHOLM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Cup women's Alpine
skiing downhill event in Narvik, Norway on Thursday will be a
two-leg race over a shortened course to avoid high winds, race
organisers said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The course, originally set over 2,560 meters with a vertical
drop of 717 meters, has been reduced by almost one half, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The new course is about 1,400 meters long with a vertical drop
of 455 meters.
</P>
<P>
"The jury's decision is that the race on Thursday will be held
in two shorter sprint runs," an official said. "It's because of
the winds and because today's training was over the shorter
course."
</P>
<P>
A second practice run scheduled for Thursday was called off
though race chief Alf Martin Solvin said the conditions for the
first run had been perfect.

<HEADLINE> Charity Fund Aids Shanghai's Poor, Handicapped Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Charity is playing an
increasingly important role in aiding the poor and the handicapped
in this, China's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Fund, which was set up in 1994, has
collected donations totalling 55 million yuan (about 6.6 million
US dollars) from organizations, individuals and enterprises both
at home and abroad, the fund's director Chen Tiedi said, adding
that over 60 percent of the money has come from overseas.
</P>
<P>
To date, the organization has spent more than six million yuan
supporting 1,000 childless elderly people, 1,000 families with
monthly incomes lower than 300 yuan each, 1,000 students with
financial difficulties, and 1,000 laid-off workers, handicapped
persons and cancer sufferers, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among Shanghai's 14 million population two
million are people above the age of 60, 500,000 are handicapped,
50,000 old people suffer from senile dementia and there are tens
of thousands of redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
Chen's organization sponsored a charity drive one day before
the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year, calling on local residents
and enterprises to donate one day's income or profits to the poor
and needy.
</P>
<P>
One local resident who donated 20 yuan said that though the
amount was not much it would help contribute to creating an
environment in which every one is ready to help others.
</P>
<P>
More and more enterprises in Shanghai have come to regard
donating to charity as an effort to improve the enterprises'
images and their employees' morale, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next three years the charity fund plans
to build a first-class apartment for senior citizens, an education
center for mentally retarded children, a training center for poor
jobless people and a medical center.

GENEVA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body
FIFA revealed on Wednesday that they are discussing a change in
football's advantage rule.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will put a proposal to the International Board in Rio de
Janeiro on March 9 that should play break down after an advantage
is given, a foul is then awarded for the original offence.
</P>
<P>
Currently, when play breaks down, the attacking team forfeits
the right for a freekick.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's referees commission, which met on Wednesday, will also
ask the board for a new rule whereby line judges can alert the
referee at any time to tell him of something which he failed to
see.
</P>
<P>
However FIFA have dropped any ideas of enlarging the goals,
which officials believed might increase the scoring rate and make
the game more attractive.

<HEADLINE> Another 350,000 Households Jettison Kerosene Lamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 350,000 households
in the rural areas in east China's Jiangsu Province got rid of
their old kerosene lamps last year because electricity became
available to them.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the province has paid great attention to
supplying electricity to the countryside in order to help farmers
eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year another 239 villages in the province were brightened
up by electricity. In northern part of Jiangsu 16 cities or
counties, such as Hai'an, Gaoyou and Ganyu, no longer have to use
kerosene lamps at night.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of power was a key factor in the poverty of farmers in
north Jiangsu. The absence of electricity hampered irrigation,
draining of floods and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the province invested 406 million yuan (about 48.9
million US dollars) in providing electricity to its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
But still 540,000 households in 100 villages of the province
are lack of electricity supply. The government intends to
eliminate kerosene lamps from 99 percent of the households in the
province by 1997.

WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A public oversight board
accountant monitoring the Atlanta Olympics organizing committee is
confident that the group will meet its goal of a break-even Games'
budget.
</P>
<P>
"The overall risk has been reduced," Robbie Pound said. "I
wouldn't say they are over a huump."
</P>
<P>
Pound said the committee, ACOG, has only a minimum 13 million
U.S. dollar contingency fund for its 1.7 billion-dollar budget
even though organizers stand by a figure of 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Organizers must raise another 200 million dollars, chief
operating officer A.D. Frazier told the Metropolitan Atlanta
Olympic Games Authority (MAOGA). Ticket and souvenir sales over
the next five months are expected to produce that total.
</P>
<P>
"We meet the financial test imposed by MAOGA and therefore
there is no change in our operating states or procedures as a
result of this report," Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
Pound is more confident because organizers are watching their
spending.
</P>
<P>
"They are focused on expenses and expense control," he said.
"They know these things need to be addressed."
</P>
<P>
Officials also approved a 1.1 million-dollar project to finish
the Olympic marina at Savannah.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Leaders Meet with Annan on Balkan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and outgoing U.N. Secretary General's special envoy Kofi
Annan held talks here today over the Bosnian peace process and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office issued a statement after the talks
saying the two sides agreed that the peace process in the former
Yugoslavia was unfolding successfully.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Annan, Ghanaian diplomat who is soon to take over
a new post, said there were prospects for a stepped-up and
all-round consolidation of the political situation in the Balkans,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Annan replaced Japanese diplomat Yasushi Akashi as the U.N.
special envoy to the former Yugoslavia last October. After
finishing his job in the Balkans, Annan will work as the
undersecretary general of the United Nations for peace operations.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic "underscored the importance of a full coordination of
the international community's efforts to return life back to
normal and, in particular, reconstruct the territories affected by
the civil war, as a prerequisite for the consolidation of peace
and establishment of stable good-neighborly relations among
states and peoples in the region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic also met today
with Annan, who is making a farewell visit to Yugoslavia, Tanjug
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kontic confirmed the strong commitment of
Yugoslavia to implement the peace process and thanked Annan for
successfully carrying out his duties, the agency added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. plans for New Currency Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury
Department has planned to spend millions of dollars for a new
currency education campaign both at home and abroad while new
bills of 100-dollar will be circulating soon.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to avoid confusion and concern over introducing a
100-dollar-bill, the new public relations campaign is to teach
bankers, investors and businesses worldwide about the new bill and
other redesigned U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
The Treasure Department is to assure the world that both the
old and new U.S. currency remains valid or will not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department will issue its new 100-dollar-bill
in the next few weeks. The new bill, with enhanced
anti-counterfeiting features and a strikingly larger portrait of
Ben Franklin, aims at foiling forgers who wield modern copy
machines and computer scanners instead of the old-fashioned
engraving plate.
</P>
<P>
A new training video for bankers, in which U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
appear, has now been translated into Arabic, Japanese and eight
other languages. Brochures in 20 different languages are
circulating worldwide. Full-page ads are appearing in
international newspapers.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the 380 billion dollars of U.S. currency in
circulation is held out of United States, according to the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
A loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar or fears that it would
be devalued could have disastrous consequences to U.S. foreign
policy and domestic economy.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Federal Police Enter Sarajevo Ilijas District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Police of the Muslim-Croat
federation today entered Ilijas, second Serb Sarajevo district
which fell under the federation's control under the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo Alexander Ivanko said that around 90
federal policemen were in Ilijas under the surveillance of around
50 policemen from the international police force.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs have moved out of the Serb part of
Sarajevo on the eve of the takeover of their sectors by the
federation's police before the deadline of March 19 expires.
</P>
<P>
The federation police entered into Vogosca on Friday, the first
Serb suburb taken over by Muslim-Croat police. A total of five
Serb-held districts will be under the Bosnian government control
in the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
During the entry of federal police into Vogosca, U.N. officials
promised that each federal policeman would be under control of two
instructors of international police.
</P>
<P>
This promise, however, was difficult to keep because the U.N.
does not have enough policemen available, so that federal
policemen could be seen in Vogosca streets patrolling alone.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the inverse proportion was applied in Ilijas:
one international instructor oversees the performance of two local
policemen, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. had planned to send 1,700 international force
policemen in Bosnia, 470 of them in Sarajevo, but many countries
had not responded to the U.N. request by sending out policemen to
Bosnia.

today met with Kuwait's Emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, at
the White House, reaffirming U.S. commitments to defend Kuwait
from an aggression.
</P>
<P>

United States for their assistance in liberating Kuwait."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Welcome Suspension of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic said today the entire life of the Serb state
Republika Srpska should go forward now that sanctions have been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the delay, we welcome the decision of the
international community to suspend sanctions against Republika
Srpska...If there are no wars, Republika Srpska will have a great
future, which already begins today," Karadzic told the Banja Luka
Daily Glas Srpski today.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of sanctions against Republika Srpska took
effect automantically on Tuesday, after the U.N. Security Council
received an Implementation Force (IFOR) report that the Serb side
had withdrawn from the zones of separation and thus met the
condition for their suspension.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic said the Serb economy should reestablish old ties,
primarily those with firms in Yugoslavia, and then also with
others all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"Republika Srpska has met all the provisions of the Dayton
accord and we believe that the international community, with an
unbiased stand and equal treatment, would find in us a reliable
factor of peace for the region," Karadzic assessed.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav government made a decision Tuesday to resume all
political and economic ties with Bosnian Serbs, which was cut off
in August 1994 due to Serb rejection of an international peace
plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian senior official said
here today that the military government hoped the West could
reconsider their sanctions against the west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Walter Ofonagoro, Minister of Information and Culture, today
told German Ambassador Johannes Loshe that Nigeria was
"surprised" to find that her business partner Germany would join
the European Union in imposing sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Germany had been granted most of the construction projects
when Nigeria built its new capital, Abuja, in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The EU, together with the United States, among other western
countries, imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria following the
military government executed nine Ogoni minority activists in
November, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The German ambassador said he has a mission to improve the
bilateral relationship.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Increase Water Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- South African
householders would pay about 10 percent more to turn on their
taps when a 30 percent increase in government water tariffs came
into effect on April 1, the Department of Water Affairs announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the new water tariff policy had been in
development for some time, and had involved extensive
consultation with affected parties, both inter-governmental and
in the private sector, according to a statement issued in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the new policy was a major step towards the
achievement of economic pricing of water in South Africa as part
of the Department's commitment to the efficient, sustainable and
equitable management and supply of water to all.
</P>
<P>
It further stressed that the 30 percent increase in raw water
tariffs also reflected a step towards establishing the true cost
and value of water supply, without government subsidies, but with
amendments for distortions caused by inflation, and with regard
to future needs and objectives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal said at a press
conference that South Africa's tariffs for drinking water were still
among the cheapest in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the 30 percent increase would also apply to irrigation
water from government schemes.

MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican trade union leader
Soares Nhaca today attacked the privatization scheme which he
said did not bring any fruit.
</P>
<P>
Soares said nobody in Mozambique had so far benefited from
the scheme, calling it "a failure".
</P>
<P>
He said privatization did not enhance the living standard of
the Mozambicans. Instead, mismanagement had resulted in the
closure of many factories and a high rate of unemployment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The trade union leader accused the government of handing
over the factories to those who had neither capital nor
experience of management.
</P>
<P>
He called the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
and the International Monetary Fund to exert pressure on the
Mozambican government, urging it to correct the mistakes in its
privatization process.

WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Department
reported here today that business inventories was down by 0.5
percent in December, the first decline in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
It was first time since a 0.1 percent drop in March of 1994 and
the largest decline since it was down by 1 percent in March of
1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. business inventories were unchanged in November, a
revision from a 0.1 percent increase reported initially.
</P>
<P>
Inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted 975.6 billion U.S.
dollars in December, down from 980.7 billion dollars in November.
Sales totaled 699.9 billion dollars, up from 692.9 billion dollars
a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
That produced a inventory-to-sales ratio of 1.39, meaning that
it would take 1.39 months to clear stockpiles at the December
sales rate.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers posted the only inventory increase in December, a
barely perceptible 0.1 percent. Stockpiles shrank 0.7 percent on
the wholesale level and 1.1 percent at retail establishments.
