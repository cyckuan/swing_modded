<HEADLINE> France Hails Benin as "Pioneer in Democratic Transition" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed Benin as "a
pioneer in democratic transition" in Africa as it expects a visit
by Beninese President Mathieu Kerekou to Paris on October 8-10.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said
today that Benin, "as a pioneer of democratic transition in 1990,
showed the political maturity of its people in March this year in
making an alternative choice, in the framework of free and
pluralistic elections."
</P>
<P>
Kerekou, 62, who was Beninese president from 1972 to 1990, was
defeated in the country's first presidential election in 1991 by
opposition leader Nicephore Soglo. He returned to power in the
presidential election in March by defeating Soglo.
</P>
<P>
"This visit also illustrates the quality of ties of friendship
and cooperation which exist for a long time between France and
Benin, but which have taken a new dimension in the past few
years," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France will continue to help Benin in its
democratic transition and economic restructuring aimed at
improving the living standard of its people.
</P>
<P>
Kerekou will meet President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister
Alain Juppe, President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin
and President of the Senate Rene Monory.
</P>
<P>
France sent 329 million francs (66 million U.S. dollars) of
economic aid to Benin in 1995, according to official figures.

<HEADLINE> US Company to Unveil New Supercomputer Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Graphics Inc. and Cray
Research, two companies in the United States which were merged
last February, announced today that they would introduce a new
supercomputer line.
</P>
<P>
The new system, known as the Silicon Graphics Cray Origin 2000,
will eventually replace both Silicon Graphics high-end Challenger
line of computers and Cray Reseaech's T3 series of massively
parallel supercomputers, according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Graphics executives said that the company had already
shipped 10 of the new massively parallel computers, including a
high-end machine with 128 processors, which was installed last
week at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the
University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
The machine installed last week has 32 gigabytes of memory,
4,000 times the capacity of a standard desktop personal computer.
It is distinguished by the fact that all of the processors share a
single pool of computers memory, making them far easier to program
than th first generation of massively parallel supercomputers,
which had memory chips associated with each individual processor.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Graphics officials said that they planned to sell the
Origin system to all of their major markets, which range from
universities to the military and intelligence community.

<P>
HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has invited South
Africa to invest in its export processing zones (EPZS), saying
that will create greater opportunity for economic empowerment of
the respective black majority populations.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day inaugural session of the Zimbabwe/South
Africa Joint Commission meeting in Harare today, Zimbabwean
Deputy Foreign Minister Nicholas Goche said indigenous South
Africans and Zimbabweans should go into joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has established exclusive zones for export production
by offering investors various incentives, which include tax
holidays for the first five years of operation.
</P>
<P>
"In the area of investment, Zimbabwe continues to welcome
South African investors. Indeed, it will be in the interest of
our two countries, if this joint commission were to create
opportunities for the economic empowerment of our respective
majority citizens," Goche said.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad, who
is heading a 50-member delegation from the public and private
sectors, welcomed the invitation to invest in Zimbabwe and the
suggestion of establishing joint ventures.

HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
met with Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mugabe received a special message from Ugandan
leader Yoweri Museveni. The details of the message were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
''I carried a special message from President Museveni and we also
discussed matters in our region, particularly the situation in
Burundi and our relations with Sudan,'' Mbabazi told journalists
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said his government expected the relations between Uganda
and Sudan to improve because an agreement to normalise relations
was signed weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda have been at loggerheads for some time, with
Uganda accusing Sudan of supporting banditry in its northern region.
</P>
<P>
''We have bandits in the northern province who were linked
with Sudan and they have been causing problems but we are now
confident that Sudan will stop helping them,'' he said. enditem

According to the "Abiyotawi Democracy", an organ of the ruling

</P>
<P>
Some 13.26 million quintals of crops were havested last year
from more than 1.4 million hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The bumper harvest in the region is attributed to the

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A salary dispute between
the South African Avitation, Engineering and Allied Union and
South African Airways (SAA), which has resulted in industrial
action since last Wednesday, was costing SAA "hundreds of
thousands of Rands" daily, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters early in the day, SAA spokesman Leon Els
said the work-to-rule campaign caused the cancellation of two
domestic flights and the delay of four international flights.
</P>
<P>
Els said a meeting between SAA management and the union
attempting to end the ongoing strike was taking place on Monday
afternoon, yet no details of the meeting were available thus far.
</P>
<P>
The union was demanding a 25 percent salary increase, while
SAA was offering a 10 percent across the board increase and a 20
percent produtivity incentive bonus.
</P>
<P>
Union President Joe Joubert said the Union in 1988 carried out
a market evaluation and asked for an appropriate salary increase.
This had not been granted and the 25 percent increase demand was
"calculated from what we have lost since 1988".
</P>
<P>
The 2000-strong union, representing technical staff and
engineers, has threatened a full-blown strike starting on
Wednesday if the dispute remained unsolved by the time.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Premier to Sack New Minister Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Minister of Industry
and Commerce, Suchman Tamas, is to be sacked next week, just a
month into the job, after becoming involved in a privatization
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Horn Gyula has proposed to President Goncz Arpad
that Suchman, also Privatization Minister, be dismissed on October
15.
</P>
<P>
The premier said Suchman holds ultimate responsibility for an
"unacceptable" agreement between the Hungarian Privatization and
State Holding Company (HPSHC) and local governments. Suchman was
manager of the company before being appointed minister of industry
and commerce on September 6.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's privatization law, privatized state-run
companies should have transferred some of their shares free to
local authorities. But the local governments demanded more shares.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to solve the problem through negotiation, HPSHC employed
a female lawyer to negotiate on behalf of the company.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the lawyer and the HPSHC, she would
get 10 percent of what she earned for the company in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The secret agreement became public knowledge and caused an
outcry among the opposition who demanded Suchman's dismissal. The
Alliance of Free Democrats, a partner with the Socialist Party in
the coalition government, supported the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the opposition, the AFD and the Socialist
Party itself, the premier decided to sack Suchman even though he
believed the minister had known nothing about the secret agreement
between the company and the lawyer and had done nothing wrong.

<HEADLINE> Russian Interior Minister Renews Attack on Chechen Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov, who has bitterly attacked national security chief
Alexander Lebed over his peace settlement for Chechnya, today
repeated his opposition to the deal with the Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agreement had denied "another victory" to
Russian troops in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"If, on August 14, there had been no command to stop combat
activities, to tap the guns, we would have won a victory this time
as well," he told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a long way off and both politicians and the military
have to fight hard to secure it," he said, making it clear that he
wants his troops to have a say in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Lebed signed a cease-fire and peace agreement with the
separatists at the end of August after the rebels had seized
control of the Chechen capital Grozny from Kulikov's troops on the
eve of the inauguration of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Russian troops started withdrawing from
the region last month.
</P>
<P>
The security chief publicly blamed Kulikov for the fall of the
city and urged Yeltsin to sack him.
</P>
<P>
However, Kulikov said the loss of the city was due to the
absence of a state of emergency in Chechnya "which allowed the
militants to accumulate enough forces and means in advance."
</P>
<P>
He then accused Lebed's agreement with the Chechen separatists
of failing to ensure peace in the republic. He accused the
Chechens of violating the cease-fire and said that 139 Russian
soldiers had been killed since August in spite of the truce.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov also blasted Lebed for disseminating figures about
casualties in Chechnya provided by the separatists.
</P>
<P>
Lebed had said earlier that some 80,000 people, mostly
civilians, were killed in the 20-month Chechen war. But Kulikov
said the figure was invented by separatist spokesman Movladi
Udugov and "echoed by some Russian officials."
</P>
<P>
Kulikov said the civilian death toll in Chechnya was 18,500.
</P>
<P>
He promised to prove Lebed's agreement was "legally invalid"
and said that his personal opinion about the latest developments
in Chechnya was shared by his entire ministry.

LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's industrial output fell
by 0.4 percent in August and manufacturing output fell by 0.3
percent in the same month, official figures released today showed.

The figures confounded City forecasters who had expected a rise
in total production by 0.3 percent and an increase in
manufacturing output by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in August was unchanged and manufacturing
output fell 0.9 percent compared with the same month a year ago.

In July, industrial output rose 0.5 percent and manufacturing
output rose 0.6 percent.

The Argentinian surgeon specialist of the hospital, Dr. Reuben

About 30 patients have been discharged while 80 mainly leprosy

<P>
The military commanding officer in the area, Makor Melvin
Keita, told reporters the deployment "is to protect both the
hosptail from being vandalized and the town from being burnt
down" as the rebels always do after an attack.
</P>
<P>
"We shall do everything to protect the area as it is a
tactical zone bordering a river (Panpana) which can be used by
rebels to invade other villages," Keita said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest Against New Abortion Law in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Anti-abortion activists in
South Africa are against making the country's abortion law from
one of the most strict in the world to one of the most liberal.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people today crowded around the city hall
in the eastern port city of Durban to show their opposition to
the termination of the Pregnancy Bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill is being debated in the Parliament of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South Afrian Press Association (SAPA) quoted an official
of an organization called "Doctors for Life" as saying that the
draft, which is intended to change the bill, is the most
permissive piece of abortion legislation in the world.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa's legislative capital, Cape Town, anti-
abortion protesters said a survey has shown only one in four
South Africans supports abortion on demand.
</P>
<P>
At a protest in the administrative capital, Pretoria, a
nursing sister told SAPA that abortion should not even be
considered because it "amounts to killing".

<HEADLINE> Job Stress Becomes Top Health Hazard in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Work-related stress has become
the most serious health hazard faced by British employees,
according to a Trade Union Congress (TUC) survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey of union health and safety representatives at more
than 7,000 workplaces said that the epidemic of stress-related
health problems was due to longer hours of work, violence and
bullying in offices, depots and factories, and new management
techniques.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of union representatives reported stress
was the main health and safety issue at their workplace.
</P>
<P>
The TUC is reportedly launching a campaign over work-related
stress at a London conference today.
</P>
<P>
John Monks, TUC general secretary, said, "Working people should
be recognized as an asset, not a component that can be used,
abused and cast aside."

<HEADLINE> French Government Declares War on Corsican Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
declared war against Corsican separatists who have claimed
responsibility for Saturday night's bomb attack on Prime Minister
Alain Juppe's mayoral office in Bordeaux in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
The office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe said in a communique
issued this afternoon that it "is determined to fight terrorism
under all forms in Corsica, as on whichever other part of the
national territory, with the same determination as that applied
last year when our country was confronted with other terrorist
violences."
</P>
<P>
The premier's office was referring to the wave of terrorist
attacks in France by Algerian Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
"The police, the gendarmerie and (other) justice departments
have received the firmest instructions for the identification,
arrest and trial with the severity of the law of the law-breakers
who want to... intimidate the republic and blackmail it," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
In a statement sent to local police in Ajaccio, Corsica, the
outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) said,
"Claimings: Attack City Hall of Bordeaux 05/10/96," local media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
While saying that the government will continue to fight without
fail those "who openly defy the law in Corsica," the government
said that the objective of the fight is to dismantle the network
of the law-breakers and "to put them out of a state of harm."
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed that Corsica belongs to France and has
demonstrated its will to stay in France several times.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's bomb attack, which badly damaged Bordeaux's city
hall only hours after Juppe had left it, was an escalation of the
FLNC's 20-year bombing campaign for greater autonomy for the
Mediterranean holiday island.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Continuing Mid-East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Khaled Madadha, minister
of state for foreign affairs of Jordan, today called for the
continuation of the comprehensive peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current session of the
U.N. General Assembly, he pledged to employ and utilize the peace
treaty with Israel in the interests of establishing such a
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the agonies of the devastating wars over the
past five decades and the long, difficult process to reach peace
accords in the region, he said that the return to the policy of
building settlements, the violation of the sanctity of the holy
places, the closure of the territories, the denial of work
opportunities, the refusal to implement the agreements already
signed on the Palestinian-Israeli track and other negative factors
had started to give rise to a sense of frustrations.
</P>
<P>
He said that all Arab governments had expressed their
collective support for and blessings to the peace process and
proclaimed that peace was a strategic and irreversible option.
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Arafat and the Palestinian leadership
had demonstrated the serious and clear desire to achieve a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
But, it was not prudent to stipulate that Syria and Lebanon
should return to the negotiating table without preconditions as if
the Madrid Conference and the painstaking and tough negotiations
that followed had not taken place at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for granting of more time and a chance to the new
Israeli government to return to the peace process and resume it on
the bases agreed upon within the framework of the Madrid Peace
Conference, i.e., the land for peace formula and the
implementation of Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425.
</P>
<P>
He said that the success of the Madrid Peace Conference had
opened to the people of the region, including the Israeli people,
the door to a new life and a better future based on the principles
of justice, peace for all, peaceful relations and trade.
</P>
<P>
It also proved the obsolete principles shallow and wrong such
as achieving security through the resort to force and keeping other
people's land by force to ensure one's own security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, certain nervous calls and appeals were raised
again, advocating the revival of the obsolete security theory and
the imposition of solutions by force, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the American and Russian sponsors of the peace process
to intervene and the international efforts to be concerted to
bring the peace process back on track, restore its previous vigor
and impetus and put an end to all the obstacles.

<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Six people were injured when two
explosions took place inside Britain's Northern Ireland army
headquarters at Lisburn near Belfast today.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted a police spokesman as saying that the blasts
were caused by two bombs, and the first occurred in a car park.
</P>
<P>
Police said no bomb warning had been given by any of Northern
Ireland's feuding guerrilla groups and there was no immediate
claim of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has been largely immune from violence since
rival guerrilla groups called cease-fires in 1994 but the Irish
Republican Army went back to war against British rule with attacks
on British mainland targets in February.

UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today expressed its
support for the lifting of the sanctions against Libya so as to
alleviate the sufferings of the libyan people.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in the general debate at the United Nations General
Assembly, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, minister of external relations
of the Sudan, said that his country fully supports the Libyan
initiatives to put an end to the conflict between Libya and some
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to help to find a
final settlement to this dispute.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the "new trend of the imposition of sanctions
against some countries as a means of the settlement of certain
disputes."
</P>
<P>
These measures, he noted, would adversely affect the people of
these countries, particularly the vulnerable sectors of the
communities, namely women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to reconsider the basis on which sanctions are
imposed, their duration and the lifting of sanctions when their
requirement are met, he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of imposing sanctions, he advocated promotion of
dialogue and preventive diplomacy in the course of settling
disputes among nations.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he told the meeting that the persistent
attempt to impose sanctions on his country following the
assassination attempt on the life of the Egyptian president in
1995 "defies logic and justice, and need be reconsidered."

<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran today revealed a plan to
build a 2,000-kilometer canal between the Caspian Sea and the
Persian Gulf in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Persian evening daily Ettellat reported that Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani expressed satisfaction over
the progress made in feasibility study of the grand project.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the main purpose of the grand canal is
to facilitate trade exchange between Iran and the land-locked
Central Asian states.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 62-year-old president had been informed of
the details of the feasibility study and he reiterated the
necessity of utilizing international expertise for the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Ministry of Construction is in
charge of the waterway project, which would pass through
Iran's central plateau and would be 850 meters above the sea
level at its highest point.
</P>
<P>
Specialists noted that the most important issue would be how to
procure water, which would amount to one billion cubic meters per
year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that with the transit of 100 million tons of
cargo through the waterway, Iran would generate an income of
some 30 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> UN Expresses Concern at Status of Afghan Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other officials have expressed concern
regarding the recent restrictions of women and girls in
Afghanistan, a U.N. spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the news briefing this afternoon, spokeswoman
Sylvana Foa said that in a statement, the U.N. secretary-general
and other officials had expressed alarm at reports that women were
being denied access to education and employment.
</P>
<P>
After the Taliban militia forces seized capital Kabul on
September 26, the fundamentalists declared strict decrees,
including forbidding of women and girls to go to work or school.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson of the United Nations Committee for the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women observed that the
denial had violated the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women and the Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, both of which Afghanistan had signed,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The sorts of restrictions reported would also directly
contravene the spirit and letter of the 1995 Beijing Declaration
and Platform of Action to which Afghanistan subscribed without
reservation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general and other U.N. officials restated their
single, system-wide policy on the question of gender equality.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the United Nations system, the principles embodied
in the United Nations Charter are morally and legally binding,
including its preambular statement of determination `to reaffirm
faith in human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small,'" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that the U.N. system was obliged to be
guided by the norms and requirements stated in the Charter, the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the related resolutions
of the General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu on Peace Process with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here today that he would suggest to the
Palestinians to "start the permanent status talks once the
current negotiations between the two sides are completed."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks as the Israeli and Palestinian
Steering Committee is holding negotiations today on Israeli
army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the
Gaza Strip, came after the opening session of a new round of
continuous talks Sunday night on the implementation of the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
winter session this afternoon, Netanyahu said he is committed to
the Hebron redeployment, but he noted that changes must be made in
the Oslo accords to ensure the security for the Jewish residents
in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister expressed his belief that there is
a nation-wide consensus on Israel's aims in the final talks on
the permanent status of the West Bank and other issues with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu, the majority of the Israeli public are
willing to offer the Palestinians maximum freedom, as long as
Israel maintains overall control of security.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier called on Palestinians to reject violence,
promising that Israel will soon allow thousands of Palestinian
workers to enter Israel again.
</P>
<P>
Due to the seven-month closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been unable
to return to their jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said that there are still Palestinian
violations of the Oslo peace accords, adding that incitements,
and violent activities must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Opposition leader, chairman of the Labor Party
Shimon Peres sharply criticized Netanyahu and his government's
policies in his speech to the Knesset plenum.
</P>
<P>
"There had been 111 days of talks, but not dealing with the
issues of advancing the peace process," said Peres, one of
the architect of the peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Peres, the former prime minister, said that Israel had lost a
lot of goodwill in the world, including that of the United States,
due to the current government's policies on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres also numerated a long list of wrong acts by the
government, including the opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel in
Jerusalem's Old City, which had triggered the recent violent
confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Proposes Sequent Approach of NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief
Alexander Lebed proposed to NATO a sequent approach of the issue
of its eastward expansion when he met with NATO leaders here
today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the press after the meetings, both Lebed and NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana described their discussions as
"frank, rational and constructive."
</P>
<P>
However, they conceded that they agreed to disagree on the
issue of NATO's enlargement. They expressed their desire to build
on a close relationship between NATO and Russia by continuing
cooperation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the new proposals he brought to Brussels, General
Lebed said that he offered his proposals on three principles,
which were: setting up a system for joint decision making, joint
implementation of these decisions and joint responsibility of the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"I proposed to NATO leaders that the problem (of enlargement)
should be tackled sequentially, first of all NATO's
reorganization, then working out NATO-Russia relations, following
on from that deciding on whether NATO should be enlarged, in what
order and how many countries," General Lebed said.
</P>
<P>
When asked by reporters whether he viewed NATO's enlargement as
inevitable, General Lebed replied, "We should not mix up two
different issues, one is the political legitimacy of the process,
the other is whether it is appropriate at this moment."
</P>
<P>
"The political legitimacy of the timing is what we are
concerned about," he said. "Russia is half of the Europe, and this
is the fact that should be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
In front of the international press, both Solana and Lebed
expressed their confidence that they would find a mutually
acceptable approach to tackle this "difficult but vital issue."
</P>
<P>
General Lebed was making his very first trip to the Western
country as he traveled to Brussels at the invitation of the NATO
chief.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the NATO headquarters today, he met with
Solana, and General Kaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's Military
Committee, and also with the representatives of the North Atlantic
Council.

<P>
In Brussels, General Lebed's visit is considered to be an
opportunity to become acquainted with NATO's organization and to
have an initial exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, General Lebed will meet with Belgian Defense Minister
Jean-Pol Poncelet before traveling to the Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe, where he will meet with Supreme Allied
Commander General George Joulwan.
</P>
<P>
Lebed has been the Kremlin's coordinator for security policy
since last June, and has expressed several times Russia's strong
opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
He even said last Tuesday, "NATO's enlargement to the East will
lead to a new arms race and a new period of confrontation in
Europe," according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he had announced his intention to "send a
warning" to the NATO leaders during his visit.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
European Parliament last week, Solana reaffirmed NATO's position
on the subject of its enlargement, saying that he expected the
first new members to become full members of the Alliance in 1999,
after they are invited to open accession negotiations next year.

<HEADLINE> EC Grants Aid for Diphtheria Fighting in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has approved aid worth a total of 1.3 million ECUs (some 1.7
million U.S. dollars) for an emergency campaign against diphtheria
in Ukraine and for victims of the Chernobyl disaster.
</P>
<P>
The grant will enable the International Federation of the Red
Cross to carry out vaccinations and to give Chernobyl victims the
specialist screening they need to catch and treat cancers.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a total of 50,385 cases of diphtheria were reported in
the former Soviet Union, accounting for 99.9 percent of all cases in
the European Union and over 80 percent of cases worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the disease is being contained, but it is
persisting in Ukraine, whose 10 million people urgently need
vaccinating, a press release issued here said.
</P>
<P>
In Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, victims of the
Chernobyl disaster need specialist screening to enable them to be
treated for cancers that are still appearing in increasing
numbers.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Coldly Treats Visit of Greenpeace's Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Environment
Joseph Mughaizel stressed his conservativeness here today towards
the visit of a Greenpeace ship to Lebanon on Thursday, saying that
he would not personally take the decision banning the ship's entry.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by the state-run Lebanese National
News Agency as saying that he did "not feel comfortable on
the positions of the organization toward Lebanon in the past
because they were negative positions."
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has repeatedly criticized the Lebanese government
for failing to process in time chemical wastes dumped by some
western companies in Lebanon during the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, I express my conservativeness on the visit
of the ship, because I do not know how to cope with them,"
the Lebanese minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his experience with Greenpeace, the minister said,
"we make agreement on things and then they change their ideas,
and we do not know what they want."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to keep the interests of Lebanon, we have
plans on the wastes and we also have difficulties," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are other places where the organization can go and
let it go to other countries," he said, "Lebanon is not a
garbage can which could be used for opening struggles on its
land."

<HEADLINE> More People Hurt by Bombs in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Up to 20 people were injured when
two bombs exploded today inside Britain's Northern Ireland army
headquarters at lisburn, south of Belfast, where some 18,000
British troops are stationed.
</P>
<P>
BBC reported that hundreds of police officers kept the public
away from the region as worried relatives sought information about
those injured.
</P>
<P>
Security forces helicopters have been hovering overhead.
Firefighters were also at the scene, where clouds of billowing
black smoke could be seen for miles around.
</P>
<P>
The British army, deployed 27 years ago to keep feuding
Protestant and Catholic gunmen apart, has not been attacked since
1994 when the rival Irish Republican Army and Loyalist guerrillas
declared truces which launched a peace process.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack
but pro-British Protestant spokesmen accused Irish Republicans of
fighting to end British rule.

LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has condemned the bombers who struck a Northern Ireland army base
today as "barbaric" and "unspeakable."
</P>
<P>
"I think what they have done is barbaric," he told BBC
television after the two bomb attacks that injured about 20 people
in Lisburn near Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"To have placed a bomb without warning to kill or maim innocent
men and women and then to place a second bomb where those people
already injured and maimed might be caught as they sought medical
attention, or to kill the people giving them medical attention, is
just unspeakable," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he said there "was no reason" to believe it was the
provisional Irish Republican Army.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhoea Kills 40 in West Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of severe diarrhoea
has killed at least 40 people in Tubmanburg, western Liberia,
within the past two weeks and more than 500 others are being
treated for the disease, according to health officials.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Geoge Boakai, a medical
officer in Tubmanburg, as saying that health authorities feared
that cholera could be responsible for the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has brought specimens to the
capital to check for cholera, he added.
</P>
<P>
Boakai said the health situation in Tubmanburg, 60 km north of
the Liberian capital of Monrovia, was "serious" and the only
health center in the area, which is run by the Liberia Red Cross
Society, could not meet the needs of thousands of persons
displaced by the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Liberian Ministry of Health and non-governmental
organizations to rehabilitate the Tubmanburg Hospital which was
massively looted and damaged during several months of factional
clashes in the area.
</P>
<P>
The village was cut off from humanitarian activities for seven
months because of factional fighting. Relief workers last
month managed to reach thousands of malnourished and displaced
people there after the signing of a peace accord by rival
Liberian factional leaders.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Approves Constitutional Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (xinhua) -- South Africa's
Constitutional Committee today approved amendments to the final
constitution to bring it in line with constitutional court
requirements, said sources here.
</P>
<P>
All political parties in the parliament supported the changes
except the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which once again pulled out
of the national constitution-making process after lifting its
18-month boycott for just one week, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Senior African National Congress (ANC) negotiator Pravin Gordhan,
also Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly's Sub-committee on the
Provinces, said in Cape Town that he had to announce ''with some
regret'' that the IFP was not going to be part of the constitution's
finalisation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters early in the day, Gordhan said he had been
informed by senior IFP negotiator Walter Felgate that the IFP's
National Council had decided the party's representatives should not
be part of the constitutional assembly or any of its structures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Felgate said the IFP wanted to continue bilateral
discussions with the ANC attempting to obtain an ''all-inclusive
settlement'', though sufficient progress had not been made thus
far.
</P>
<P>
Felgate said it was anc's prerogative to grant this or not.
</P>
<P>
The IFP rejoined the constitution-making progress last week after
an 18-month boycott in a protest against alleged failure by ANC to
honour an agreement over international mediation on some major
constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Assembly Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa and Chief ANC and
National Party constitutional negotiators, Valli Moosa and Roelf
Meyer, said they were disappointed at the IFP pull-out.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's final constitution, adopted by the constitutional
assembly on May 8 this year, was rejected by the constitutional court
on September 6, citing the document did not fully comply with the 34
constitutional principles demanded by the interim constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria announced today that it
has started a policy of constructing what it terms as "made in
Nigeria houses" throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Such houses will be built all with local materials, explained
Major-general Abdulkarim Adisa, Minister of Works and Housing,
adding that "the idea is to reduce the cost of housing
construction".
</P>

Prototype houses will be built to show what the houses would
look like, the minister said at a ceremony marking the 1996 world

<HEADLINE> 34 US Universities Agree to Set Up Another Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of 34 universities
agreed last week to create a new national network dubbed Internet
II for higher education, the Chronicle for Higher Education, a
newspaper about education, reported.
</P>
<P>
The new network is expected to cost more than 300 million U.S.
dollars and transmit data more than 10 times faster than the
current version of Internet, which will be a great help for
simultaneous transmission of voice, video and data.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the universities chartering the Internet II
project met in Chicago last Tuesday, the paper said. Each of them
agreed to contribute 500,000 dollars a year for three years and
kick in 25,000 dollars upfront to get the project going.
</P>
<P>
The developer will include 34 most prestigious U.S.
universities, such as the University of California-Berkeley,
Cornell, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Stanford and the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The project will take three to five years to complete and is
likely to expand to include other universities, major technology
companies and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
The explosive surge in Internet usage, as people send
photographs, music, ads and entire books across it, has made the
network increasingly congested. Scientists complained that the
data they send across the country or around the world can get
delayed, lost or scrambled in cyberspace, hampering experiments
in fields such as physics and astronomy.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- African countries have
been urged to preseve their cultures through the use of open-air
museums.
</P>
<P>
Opening a six-day international conference on African open-air
museums in this city today, Thomas Palme, Swedish Ambassador to
Tanzania, said African historical cultures had been destroyed
during colonialism and consistent efforts were needed to preserve
the remaining ones.
</P>
<P>
Palme said colonialists did not bother to divide African
countries into their old ethnic culture, a situation which he
said had led to loss of continuous culture heritage.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, there are number of countries which are old enough
but their historical culture are no longer seen because of
colonial impact," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Anna-Greta Leijom, Managing Director of Skansen Open-air
Museums of Stockholm, Sweden, said: "Open-air museums ensures
that knowledge is not lost at all." Any one who does not know his
or her historical culture could be easily manipulated by an
outsider, he said.
</P>
<P>
The six-day conference is organized by the Village Museum of
Tanzania in collaboration with the Skansen Open-air Museum of Sweden

<HEADLINE> EU to Assign Special Envoy to Follow up Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Seeking to play a bigger role in
the Middle East peace process, the European Union (EU) will send a
special envoy to the region to follow up Arab-Israeli peace talks,
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said today.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Ismailia, a town halfway along the Suez Canal, Spring told
reporters that the envoy will not participate directly in peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will be selecting a special envoy to the Middle East
peace process," he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"He will not participate in the discussions, but he will be
sent to the region to work in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was in Ismailia to attend celebrations marking the 23rd
anniversary of Egypt's initial victory over Israel in the 1973
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, 1973, the Egyptian army launched a surprise
attack on the Israeli troops by successfully crossing the Suez
Canal tearing open Israel's much-bragged "impregnable Bar Lev
Line."
</P>
<P>
Though the Egyptian forces were later pushed back, the initial
victory actually forced the Israelis to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also attended the
celebrations broadcast live by the Egyptian television.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Spring met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa in Cairo for talks.
</P>
<P>
Spring said after the talks that that Europe wants Israel to
take concrete steps to advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Europe wants to help push forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Europe wants to be helpful and we want to participate, but we
want concrete steps to be taken to implement the process," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Spring, currently on a Middle East tour, has also met with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister said that he has expressed Europe's concerns
about peace in the Middle East to Israeli, Palestinian and
Egyptian officials.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Calls for More Burden-Sharing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- UN Higher Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata on Monday urged governments to
combat prejudice against asylum-seekers and to share the burdens
of major asylum countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the annual meeting of the UNHCR's 51-member
Executive Committee, Ogata warned that despite international
commitments to uphold the right of asylum, observance of
international standards for the protection of refugees had
continued to slip in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Access to territory has been either denied outright, as a
result of push-offs of boat arrivals and rejections at borders, or
complicated by new legislative restrictions," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Deadly attacks on refugee camps, sexual abuse of refugee women
and children and forcible conscription of refugee men and children
have seriously undermined safety during asylum...the voluntary
nature of repatriation is increasingly being undermined by a
mounting number of forcible returns," she added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that such problems increasingly arise in countries that
shelter more than their share of refugees, Ogata appealed for more
international burden-sharing.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Germany hosts more Bosnian refugees than all
other countries in Western Europe together. Meanwhile refugees
outnumber the local population in parts of Ivory Coast, Guinea,
Tanzania and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Ogata also urged decision-makers to "de-dramatize" the scale of
asylum-seeker problem in their countries, noting that requests for
asylum were declining in most industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief official in charge of refugee affairs observed
that the past year had seen no new humanitarian emergencies of the
scale witnessed in Rwanda in 1994, but armed conflict in Burundi,
Chechnya, Liberia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and, most
recently, Iraq have again forced people to run for their lives.
</P>
<P>
She called on governments to redouble their efforts to avert
and resolve conflict and asked them to provide more effective
protection to people displaced within their own borders.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasts Show Need for Ulster Peace Talks: Adams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish
Republican Army's (IRA) political wing, said in Dublin this
evening that the latest bomb explosions in Ulster showed the need
for all-party peace talks, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Adams said in a statement to the Irish Radio that the bomb
explosions at the British Army base in Northern Ireland emphasize
the urgent need to fill the current protracted and dangerous
vacuum with a process of real, inclusive dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader said that it was too soon to say which
organization was responsible for the two bombs, which has injured
some 20 people.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been excluded from the current multi-party peace
talks on the future of Northern Ireland as IRA, which has been
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland since 1972,
resumed a bombing campaign in February.

<HEADLINE> Over 50 Percent of Voters Cast Votes in Kuwaiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 percent of the
registered Kuwaiti electorate in 213 polling stations may have
exercised their franchise by casting their votes in the 12-hour
legislative elections today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the elections committee said that judging
from the voting situation in some of the ballot stations,
more than half of the 107,000 registered eligible voters are
estimated to have cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no immediate official confirmation on the
turn-out percentage.
</P>
<P>
Gates of ballot stations were shut as scheduled at 8:00 p.m. in
all of Kuwait's 25 constituencies after the day-long voting. But
an unspecified number of voters were still at some ballot stations
after the gates were closed.
</P>
<P>
The voting day ended peacefully at all polling stations, with
organizers of candidates' campaign trying to influence the decision
of voters outside the ballot stations until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 women activists demanding political rights staged a
sit-in outside a polling station 15 kilometers south of Kuwait
city. But they were barred from marching on the street.
</P>
<P>
A total of 230 Islamist, liberal or nationalist candidates,
including 41 members of the outgoing parliament elected in 1992,
were competing for the 50 seats in the eighth National Assembly of
the Gulf state, which has the only parliament in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Women, who make up 50.4 percent of the country's 708,000
population, were not allowed to take part in the voting in
accordance with the electoral law, although their rights are
guaranteed by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Two candidates would be elected from each of the 25
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting is going on and the results of the elections are
expected to be declared by midnight.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Acting PM Accuses Libya of Supporting PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Acting Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today strongly accused Libyan
Leader Muammer Gaddafi of supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) which opposes the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that Gaddafi had committed "a historic mistake" by
words seen as against the Republic of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader said Sunday at a joint press conference
with visiting Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan that "Turkey's future lies not in NATO, U.S. bases and in
repressing the Kurds but in its nobility and its past."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi added: "Kurdistan should be established. I am talking
about the Kurdish nation. This nation should have its place
under the Middle Eastern sun."
</P>
<P>
Ciller blasted Gaddafi for openly backing the PKK, saying
that "this is a serious mistake. Turkey has once again seen who
its friends are and who its enemies are."
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented political storm broke out in Ankara over
what is being perceived in the political spectrum as "gross
insults hurled at Turkey" by Gaddafi during Erbakan's visit to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war for
autonomy, which has claimed the lives of over 21,000 people
including PKK rebels, civilians and government troops in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

GENEVA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- In anticipation of a booming

agronomist on Monday called for more intensive agronomic research
to boast the world food production.
</P>
<P>
Hans Rudolf Herren, who won the 1995 World Food Prize, told a

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav-Macedonian Trade Agreement to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A trade agreement between
Yugoslavia and Macedonia that went into force Monday will
considerably help increase trade between the two countries,
Secretary-General of the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce Bosko
Markovic said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, in early
September by Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic and his
Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski, envisages for
abolishing all tariffs in trade between Yugoslavia and Macedonia,
apart from a charge of only one percent of the value of each
shipment for accounting cost.
</P>
<P>
Full tariff rates will be applied only in exporting and
importing live animals, wheat, cooking oil, brown coal, electric
power and other strategic items.
</P>
<P>
Markovic told local reporters that Yugoslav products would
become much more competitive on the Macedonian market through the
elimination of tariffs applied up to this point and would
consequently contribute to the increase in home production.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in
1991 peacefully and established diplomatic relations with the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rajko Uncanin, President of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce,
said Monday in Belgrade that trade between Yugoslavia and
Macedonia could amount to about 400 million U.S. dollars by the
end of the year, or double the January-August figure.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav-Macedonian trade in 1989 had stood at more than two
billion U.S. dollars, which dwindled to barely 200 million dollars
in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Uncanin said the agreement will also help improve production
cooperation between the two countries' companies, which is vital
for both countries' economic development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on Solving Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- An effective and lasting solution
to the world refugee problem could only be found through the
promotion of peace and development, said a Chinese delegate
Tuesday at a meeting of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual meeting of UNHCR's 51-member Executive
Committee, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, Zhang Yishan,
said peace and development are the two major challenges facing the
international community and as such they also make up the
preconditions for any solution to the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
"Only by means of negotiated and peaceful settlement of
disputes, faster economic and social development and the
establishment of a fair and reasonable new international economic
order can the necessary political and economic conditions be put
in place for an ultimate solution to the refugee problem," Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the international community should follow
the principle of international solidarity and burden sharing and
seek a comprehensive solution to the refugee question from
different channels so as to create conditions for the voluntary
repatriation and resettlement of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the repatriation of the Vietnamese boat-people in Hong Kong,
Zhang said it is a matter of great concern to the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
"The solution of the Vietnamese boat-people issue is a task of
top priority which should not be carried over beyond June 30,
1997," he said.

<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's electronic giant
Hyundai Electronics will invest 1 billion pounds (1.5 billion US
dollars) in Scotland to build a semiconductor plant, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The plant will be located at Dunfermline in Fife, Scotland,
which has an overall unemployment rate of 11.7 percent which,
though not the highest in Scotland, will be above the average of 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The news will come as a much-needed boost to the region hit by
a high unemployment rate especially as a result of the removal of
the nuclear submarine refitting work from Rosyth to Devonport.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to create at least 700 manufacturing jobs
when it begins operating in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's semiconductor plant will be the second large
investment in the UK this year by a South Korean chip-maker. In
July LG Electronics announced a 2.6 billion US dollar
semiconductor and consumer electronics complex for south Wales.
</P>
<P>
With Hyundai's new plant, total South Korean investment in the
UK has reached an estimated 6 billion US dollars, most of it in
the electronics sector.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's stock market will
have a bright future despite the fact that it is facing
challenges from the increasing pace of technological changes and
the increasing globalization of the marketplace, said Edgar Cheng,
chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE).
</P>
<P>
At a function to mark the 10th anniversary of the HKSE here
this evening, Cheng said that along with the challenges, there are
also greater opportunities for HKSE to grow.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opportunities lie in Hong Kong's adaptation
capability to changes and the rapid development in Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the unification of the four stock exchanges
in 1986, market capitalization on Hong Kong's stock market has
increased ten times.
</P>
<P>
Daily turnover on the market has increased 11 times and the
number of listed securities has tripled, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has risen from 15th to 8th place by
capitalization among world territorial markets, and to the second
place in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that an internationally accepted regulatory regime in
both the primary and secondary markets has been established.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the confidence of stock issuers and investors, HKSE
has established itself as a leading international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that HKSE's progress over the next decade
will be even more dramatic than over the last.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Giant Gains International Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- COSCO (H.K.) Shipping Co., one
of the largest fleets in Hong Kong, has gained four international
certificates of quality and maritime safety from two
classification bodies.
</P>
<P>
The China Classification Society (CCS) awarded the shipping
giant two certificates here today -- International Standard
Organization (ISO)-9002 certificate symbolizing high-quality
management system, and the Document of Compliance of International
Safety Management (ISM) Code signifying high standard of safety
management system.
</P>
<P>
The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) also granted both
ISO-9002 and ISM documents to COSCO (H.K.) Co., which has become
Hong Kong's first shipping company to obtain the two certificates
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Walter J. Czerny, president of the ABS Pacific, said at the
awarding ceremony, "obtaining both ISO and ISM certification in
such a short period of time is a tremendous accomplishment for any
shipping company and particularly for one which today operates
nearly 100 vessels totaling about five million tons deadweight
(DWT)." It took COSCO (H.K.) 17 months to prepare for the
necessary documentation, shorter than the routine period of 18 to
24 months.
</P>
<P>
D.Y. Xu, general manager of COSCO (H.K.) Shipping Co., said,
"these certificates are intangible assets of the company." As
recognized by the ISM certification, reliable guarantee on the
shipping safety and friendliness to marine environment would help
COSCO (H.K.) to build an image of safe and green company among its
clients, according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
The ISM code is vital to a shipping giant like COSCO (H.K.)
because the certificate will turn to be a mandated requirement for
shipping companies worldwide till July 1, 1998, a deadline set by
the International Maritime Organization for operators of tankers,
bulk carriers, passenger vessels and high speed craft.
</P>
<P>
Xu continued that no doubt both ISO-9002 and ISM certificates
would make the company more competitive on the world shipping
arena.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> hke - Belarus President Ready to Tackle Differences With Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko announced today that he is ready to find a compromise
with the parliament over their differences on the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told the heads of some Belarus news media that he
will suggest a compromise solution to the country's legislators
next Thursday or Friday, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He may also personally address the parliament, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko submitted a draft of amendments to the Constitution
for the coming referendum in the country, under which presidential
powers will be substantially extended.
</P>
<P>
However, the legislature's version has the chapter on the
president totally deleted.
</P>
<P>
The parliament and Lukashenko also differ on the date of the
referendum. While the president proposed November 7, the lawmakers
want the poll to take place on November 24.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting with the heads of the news media,
Lukashenko said that some 100 deputies, or over 50 percent of the
legislature, are ready to review the earlier decision and to
schedule the referendum for November 7.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the lawmakers asked him to examine and adopt some of
their amendments to the presidential version of a new wording of
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to make this compromise by 99 percent," Lukashenko
declared.

PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of

BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, the executive
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), said today in Beijing that economic and trade
setbacks between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, caused by
Taiwan authorities, will bring no benefit to the island's
businesses or its economic development.
</P>
<P>
But, in the long run, this move cannot halt the development of
economic and trade relations between the two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with correspondents from both sides of the
Taiwan Straits and from Hong Kong, Tang said, "We have always
advocated that the political differences should not affect
economic and trade co-operation across the straits."
</P>
<P>
"We have always said that any difference should be solved
through political negotiations. But, before that, direct mail,
trade, air, and shipping links should be opened between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits, to increase mutual understanding,"
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that Taiwanese business people's rights and
interests will be protected in the inland areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today kicked off a tour of Russia and three other CIS
republics in a bid to boost French investment and trade with the
region.
</P>
<P>
France lags far behind Germany in trade with Russia - its
bilateral trade volume stands at some 4.4 billion U.S. dollars
compared with German-Russian trade volume of 16 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
France contributes 5 percent of European Union members' loans
to Russia and has been the country's eighth biggest trading
partner since 1972.
</P>
<P>
But Germany, which contributes 60 percent of the EU's loans to
Russia, is the country's top trading partner, the French newspaper
Le Figaro said today.
</P>
<P>
De Charette will meet his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov
today to discuss the second French-Russian Economic Commission
meeting, which is to be held soon in Paris, and will be seeking
out opportunities for French investment in Russia, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
After his tour in Moscow, de Charette and his delegation, which
includes executives from oil companies Elf and Total and
electronics giants Thomson and Alcatel, will move on to Armenia,
Georgia and Azerbaijan, three trans-Caucasian republics of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
France has a 10 percent stake in a 4 billion-dollar
multinational contract to develop an oil and gas field in
Azerbaijani territory in the Caspian sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The 1st world abacus conference
opened today in Weifang, a booming city in East China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Chinese and foreign scholars from a dozen
countries and regions, including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia
and Syria attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Abacus, one of China's cultural heritages, was introduced into
European countries through Japan and Korea in Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644), and has played an important role in the economic and
cultural constructions in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xi'an, director of the China Abacus Association, said as
computers are very popular in today's world, the influence of
abacus can still be felt by people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, for example, abacus has become one of the
compulsory courses for the fourth grade students, and more than
100 abacus centers have been set up in the country, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Experts involved believed that the education of abacus helps
develop the children's intelligence potentials in maths and
physics.
</P>
<P>
A contest of abacus calculation was held and an exhibition on
at least 1,000 kinds of abacus was on display.

<HEADLINE> Early Political Negotiations Across Taiwan Straits Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), said today in Beijing that only early political
negotiations will restore stability and develop relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with correspondents from both sides of the
Straits and from Hong Kong he said, "We hope Taiwan authorities
will stop pushing for 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' and
provide a more favorable atmosphere for cross-straits
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taiwan has always refused to negotiate an
end to the state of hostilities, and that it is time for them to
do something practical.
</P>
<P>
As an unofficial organization, Tang said, his association is
willing to make procedural arrangements for political negotiations
between the two sides, and to try to find a way that is acceptable
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the talks between ARATS and Taiwan-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Tang said that talks between
the two organizations' leaders in April, 1993 was a significant
step in developing cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
But their negotiations were of no avail because of interference
by Taiwan authorities, he said, adding that sticking to "one
China" principle is the prerequisite for the realization of
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The "one China" principle has two key points, he explained: One
is that there is only one China in the world, and that Taiwan is
an inalienable part of it, and that China's sovereignty and
territory cannot tolerate separation. The other is that "we are
not against Taiwan making unofficial contacts with foreign
countries in the economy and arts, but we are opposed to Taiwan
authorities' so-called 'expanding international living space' with
the idea of creating 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan'".

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Official Satisfied with Agriculture Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's agriculture growth
in recent years has stimulated productivity in other sectors, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a two-day agricultural ministers' meeting of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here,
Pakistani Minister for Food, Agriculture and Livestock Nawab
Yousuf Talpur said that agriculture growth also led to increased
employment and reduced poverty.
</P>
<P>
Talpur said, "we have in recent decades experienced rapid
growth and development but natural calamities and inequitable
implementation of policies have produced uneven results."
</P>
<P>
"As we seek to optimize productivity, our efforts are
inevitably confronted with the ever increasing population," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural intensification may be the key to increasing
productivity which in turn would help alleviate poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on SAARC region, Talpur said that it is rich in
resources but lacking in basic social and economic services.
</P>
<P>

<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 71 soccer fans have
been arrested over the weekend for allegedly wrecking cars on
Friday after their team lost a match, Antara news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Police Chief Major General Hamami Nata said Monday that
they were arrested following the incident which injured two
persons and damaged at least 23 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Riots erupted at the Senayan Sports Stadium when fans of the
losing Surabaya Team began to throw stones at supporters of the
winning Bandung Team.
</P>
<P>
Nata said many of those arrested coming from Surabaya and East
Java, arrived in Jakarta with little money so they resorted to
such crimes as not paying for their food or pick-pocketing.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta security authorities Saturday sent 3,715 soccer fans
back to Surabaya after the unrest.
</P>
<P>
People angered by the violence pelted east-bound trains

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets International Space Officials in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting today with space
officials from different countries who are attending the 47th
Congress of the International Astronautical Federation and the
Fourth Space Agency Forum, Premier Li Peng called for greater
co-operation with other countries in space development.
</P>
<P>
Li congratulated the on-going congress, saying that it is a
significant event, with astronautical specialists and government
officials from various countries discussing developments and
applications of space technology.
</P>
<P>
"China started its own work in space technology on this very
day 40 years ago, and with arduous efforts over the past 40 years,
has had great developments," he said, adding that China is a
developing country, and its economic strength is not great, but it
has had tremendous achievements in space research.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the achievements to the fact that socialism in
China has allowed it to have several successful events and people
dedicated to space development, and that the Chinese Communist
Party and the government have been paying a great deal of
attention to the field.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should be clear about the gap between China and
developed countries, but we have the confidence to raise China's
space work to a new level through our hard work," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government and China's space industry are ready to
increase exchanges and cooperation with counterparts in other
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Lutor, director of the European Space Agency, said
that all the participants spoke highly of China's fast economic
growth. They held the view that Beijing is the right place to hold
the IAF meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lutor called on all countries to co-operate broadly in
exchanging information and sharing each other's achievements.
</P>
<P>
The IAF conference lasts from October 7 to 11, and the Fourth
Space Agence Forum will start tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Russia, France to Cooperate in Preparing OSCE Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia and France will cooperate in
preparing the Lisbon summit of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
In the summit, the OSCE members will have "to adopt an
architecture of European security and to outline its main
principles and parameters," said Primakov after his talks with his
French counterpart Herve de Charette, now in Russia on an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Russia's position on aims and tasks of the
coming forum, Primakov singled out four groups of threats which
should be countered in the interests of strengthening European
security.
</P>
<P>
The first of them is of "hypothetical nature" and presupposes a
conditional possibility of a global clash. The second is connected
"with the development of conflict situations at a regional level."
</P>
<P>
The third covers such evils as organized crime, drug
trafficking and terrorism. The fourth group includes problems
connected with insufficient protection of human rights, above all,
rights of national minorities on the continent.
</P>
<P>
When drafting the architecture of European security, Primakov
said, it is necessary to carry out "stock-taking" of operation of
European and other international organizations which are engaged
in countering the above risks and threats.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the role and place of the OSCE in a future system of
European security, Primakov noted that Russia and France attach
very great importance to this organization. However, they are
against the OSCE fulfilling "any command functions or duplicating
operations of other structures."
</P>
<P>
For his part, de Charette said that the position of Russia, as
spelled out by Primakov, creates ample grounds for further
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He voiced support for strengthening the OSCE and using a
comprehensive approach to tackling issues of European security,
taking into account the interests of each particular country.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Primakov, de Charette also met with
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The French minister and Chernomyrdin discussed preparations for
a regular Russian-French Commission session at premiers' level,
which is to be held in Paris in late November, Russian government
sources said.

ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
trying to solve investors' problems by all means despite
bureaucratic hurdles, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking with a delegation of the Overseas Investors Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (OICCI), Pakistani Minister for Investment
Asif Ali Zardari reiterated the government's commitment to
facilitate the investors.
</P>
<P>
Zardari, husband of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
said, "it is basically a difference of perception between
political Government and bureaucracy."
</P>
<P>
"The perception is so shallow and wrong that what we are going
to implement, they are going to resist," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the gap between the government and
bureaucracy is being narrowed by the realization that it is the
commitment of the government to bring in investment.
</P>
<P>
Zardari asked the business community to come and support the
government particularly to solve the problems of Foreign Investors
and the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The head of the delegation, Tom Higgins, thanked Zardari for
listening their critical views patiently and assured their
cooperation in all fields of manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The OICCI is a representative body of the foreign investors
operating in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> China's Administrative System Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China's vice minister of
personnel, Zhang Zhijian, said here today that 18 years of work
has resulted in a remarkable reform of the administrative system,
with "The basic framework of an administrative system that matches
the socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
Zhang's remarks came during a panel discussion on Chinese
administrative reform at the Third International Conference of
Administrative Sciences, a four-day conference which opened in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The achievements included transforming government functions and
delegating managerial power to lower levels; changing the
relationship between government and enterprises; changing state
enterprises over to independent legal persons; and making the
relationship between central and local governments more rational.
</P>
<P>
"Government functions and staff at all levels have been
streamlined, and a more scientific and competitive personnel
management system and civil service system, have been
established," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang separated China's administrative reforms into three major
phases: experimental, from 1978 to 1987; in-depth development,
from 1987 to 1992; and the new administrative system compatible
with the socialist market economy, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the successes to concentrating on economic
construction and keeping up with economic restructuring, handling
the relationships between reform, development, and stability, and
absorbing the essence of traditional Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that, "Since China is a developing country
with great differences in both economic and social development in
various regions, it is necessary for us to carry out the reform
step by step, and handle different cases in different ways
according to specific conditions."
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that there are still several major tasks
in the coming century, such as further changes in government
functions, the relationship between central and local governments,
further reforms in the personnel system, and integrating human
resources.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Clean Coal for Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-minister of the
power industry Lu Yanchang says that China is giving top priority
to developing clean coal technology for power in order to improve
efficiency and pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation's (APEC)
Fourth Technical Seminar on Clean Fossil Energy, Lu noted that
coal will remain China's main energy source.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, coal accounts for 95 percent of the fuel used
by power generating units. In the next 15 years, the amount of
coal consumed for power will go up annually, and it is imperative
that China develop the technology for generating electricity
efficiently and with little air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's top governing body, has decided to
establish a national planning group for this, with the State
Planning Commission as the head, and the State Science and
Technology Commission and State Economic and Trade Commission as
deputy heads, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
During the next two years, he added, China will push technology
for coal selection, fabrication of shaped coal, coal slurry, flue
gas purification, coal gasification, and coal liquefaction.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the main method of reducing coal consumption will
be developing large power units with high efficiency and low
levels of pollution, and retrofitting mid-size units of 100-200 MW
and gradually eliminating smaller units below 50 MW.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the new technology will be widely used and
efficient flue gas desulphurization and pollution reduction
equipment will gradually be installed in power plants, bringing
China's emission standards at power plants close to international
standards.

The report said that fears are not found that the narrowing of

Despite the 20 basis point contraction in the spread between

JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 71 football fans have been
arrested over the weekend for allegedly wrecking cars on Friday
after their team lost a match, Antara News Agency reported on

</P>
<P>
Jakarta police chief major general Hamami Nata said on Monday

losing Surabaya team began to throw stones at supporters of the
winning Bandung team.
</P>
<P>
Nata said many of those arrested coming from Surabaya and
east Java, arrived in Jakarta with little maney so they resorted
to such crimes as not paying for their food or pickpocketing.

Jakarta security authorities on Saturday sent 3,715 soccer
fans back to Surabaya after the unrest.

JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas today criticized the Dutch police for its alleged inhuman
treatment of the Garuda Indonesia pilot who has been detained
since late September on charges of attempting to smuggle some
8,000 ecstasy pills to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government has contacted the Dutch government
through diplomatic channels to express our deep regret over the
inhuman treatment in handling the case," he told reporters when
attending a seminar.
</P>
<P>
He said as a developed country, which usually boasts of its
good human rights record and often criticizes developing countries
for human rights violations, the Netherlands should become a
model in terms of treating those charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the criticism following a report saying that
the pilot, identified only as MS, received inhuman treatment from
the Dutch police.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that we cannot justify the mistake. Anyone who is
guilty should be punished and taken to court, but this should be
carried out humanely," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said it was looking
into a Dutch press report which suggested that an employee of the
Indonesian embassy in the Hague was involved in an ecstasy
syndicate.

The Washington Post:

their next debate.

He said the textile and apparel industry earned one billion US
dollars for Sri Lanka in 1995. Subsequent to the Uruguay Round of
trade talks, imports of apparel which were not manufactured with
textiles of the exporting country were being restricted.
</P>
<P>
He had talks with US officials to correct this anomaly as this
country used 40 percent of imported cloth for the manufacture of
apparel under a clause passed by the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's exports dropped by 35 percent due to this.
</P>
<P>
He requested the US authorities to restore the status quo with
effect from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Set to Be Asia's Second Largest Coffee Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to export
235,000 tons of coffee worth 425 million U.S. dollars this year,
becoming the largest coffee producer in Asia after Indonesia with
a forecast 350,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the Association of Coffee Producing
Countries (ACPC) predicts Vietnam will become one of the five
biggest coffee exporters in the world if its exports keep
increasing at the present rate.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's record exports have been attributed to the quality of
its coffee, which is up to international standard, and its low
price. Vietnam's robust coffee is considered the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which buys a third of Vietnam's exports,
remains the largest importer of Vietnamese coffee.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies are now starting to show a major interest in
coffee processing in Vietnam. The Swiss food giant Nestle plans to
build an instant coffee factory at a cost of 25 million dollars in
Ho Chi Minh city in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Vietnam's biggest hard currency earner after rice and
crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Kills School Pupil in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A 16-year-old pupil was killed
Monday in a grenade attack on a high school in southern Algeria,
the Algerian newspapers Liberte and El Watan reported today.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at noon when teachers at a school in
Khazrouna near the city of Blida were allowing their pupils leave
for dinner, according to the two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The school guard had already given a warning after sighting a
man carrying a plastic bag acting suspiciously. But the man,
believed to be in his 20s managed to throw two grenades before
running away.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a group of gunmen attacked a school in Boufarik,
also near Blida, killing one school pupil and wounding a dozen
others.
</P>
<P>
The incident may have been a revenge attack by Islamic
extremists against the children of members of the security forces
who have been fighting a bloody four-year war with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people have been killed in the four years of
violence between the extremists and Algerian government forces,
according to figures provided by Western media reports.
</P>
<P>
In another incident this week, security forces reported nine
people were killed in a passenger bus Monday night in Ksar
el-Hirane near Laghouat, 300 kilometers south of Algiers, during
"a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
"The passengers were cowardly assassinated... Security forces
immediately set off in pursuit to find the criminals," a
communique from the security forces said, although no further
details were given.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area where the bus attack took place is
reportedly a stronghold of Islamic extremists who are likely to
kill anyone they believe "collaborated" with the government.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, 17 Algerian youths had their throats cut by
extremists in Ain Oussera in northern Algeria.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, 12 passengers in a bus were decapitated by
extremists in Keddara, 50 kilometers southeast of Algiers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Africa Faces Charge for Involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of Swedish
investigators will arrive in South Africa later this week to
probe into the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof
Palme.
</P>
<P>
South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi
announced this last night in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The investigation follows allegations by a former South
African intelligence officer Eugene De Kock that apartheid South
Africa's security forces were behind Palme's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Palme, active anti-apartheid campaigner, was gunned down in
Stockholm in 1986.
</P>
<P>
De Kock has been convicted of 89 charges for his criminal
activities committed during the apartheid years, including six of
murder and one of conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi told the press last night that he and Justice
Minister Dullah Omar had assured the Swedish government of South
Africa's continuing commitment to assisting the investigation
into the murder.
</P>
<P>
According to Mufamadi, a senior Swedish detective and
prosecutor will arrive in South Africa on Thursday to make
"preliminary contacts".
</P>
<P>
Durding their stay here, the Swedish investigators will hold
talks with South African National Police Commissioner George
Fivaz and Johannesburg Attorney-general jan D'Oliveira and
Mufamade and Omar will attend their talks.
</P>
<P>
Mufamade said that De Kock's cross-examination in the court
might be completed by today and that D'Oliveira " would then be
in a position to start a systematic follow-up on all matters that
arose in the trial, including the Palme assassination."
</P>
<P>
Allegations are also rife that the apartheid South African
government was also behind the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
The French News Agency, AFP, reported yesterday that an
Austrian newspaper, citting "sources close to social democratic
circles", reported that Palme's close associate, Bernt Carlsson,
was a passenger on the doomed plane.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian newspaper claimed that Carlsson was the target of
the bomb which killed all 270 people on the plane and that the
bomb was hidden in Carlsson's tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
It was undoubtedly easy for the security services to place the
bomb in this machine while Carlsson was staying at a hotel, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the motives behind the killing of Carlsson, the
paper said that Carlsson would have been named the United Nations
representative to Namibia which had just gained independence from
South Africa. And he had also authorised secret weapons
deliveries to the African National Congress (ANC), South Africa's
major black liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the paper said, Carlsson was supposed to have
become a "deadly threat" to the apartheid regime which decided to
have him killed, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But former South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha yesterday
backed former intelligence sources who labelled the allegations
as "absurd and farfetched".
</P>
<P>
Pik Botha, who had at the last minute cancelled his booking on
the flight, said: "In an atmosphere of suspicion it is fairly
easy to make allegations in order to attract publicity."
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of ANC's international affairs
sub-committee, Blade Nzimande, said today that the allegations
should not be ignored but fully investigated in line with other
claims of apartheid agents' dirty tricks internationally.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Islamists Win Over Half of Parliament Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will see a more
Islamic National Assembly in the next four years as Islamists and
their supporters in the country won most of the 50-member
parliamentary seats in the small Gulf country, defeating liberals
and their associates.
</P>
<P>
Election results revealed by Kuwaiti Interior Ministry today
showed that the Islamists and their supporters controlled half of
the Kuwaiti parliament seats while pro-government members held
about 40 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
It was a major victory for the Islamists as they maintained
their hold on most of their seats, and the liberals and
liberal-oriented independents, while constituting the minority in
the previous parliament, remained less than the Islamists in the
new parliament to be formed.
</P>
<P>
Two of Kuwait's Islamic groups, the National Islamic Alliance
(Shias) and the Popular Islamic Alliance (Al-Salaf) who
successfully fought the 1992 parliamentary elections did not
field official candidates for the Monday elections, but their
leaders still competed as independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
Another group, the Islamic Constitution Movement or Kuwait's
Moslem Brotherhood, which has possessed four candidates, won two
seats, but its supporters had won several seats.
</P>
<P>
Al-Salaf Islamists won three seats, while their supporters
also retained their seats.
</P>
<P>
Shia Islamists were a major loser as their candidates
Abdulmohsen Jamal and Nasser Sorkhoh failed to retain their
seats. But Adnan Abdul Samad got re-elected in addition to Hassan
Jawhar and Hussein Al-Qallaf who are believed to be close
associates of the National Islamic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Liberals lost most of their strength in the assembly although
two of the three Kuwait Democratic Forum fielded candidates
won. Meanwhile, two of the four cabinet ministers who resigned
last month to contest won and the other two lost.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that only four of the 25
constituencies retained the previous two MPs while the rest
witnessed changes.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, exactly half of the members have been changed,
mostly with first-time parliamentarians. 16 of the 41 former MPs
who competed in the contest lost the elections.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the members are new faces, most of whom have
never even contested the elections. Seven others are former
parliamentarians mostly in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Prominent among winners are former MP and finance minister
Jassem Al-Khorafi who came second in his Shuaikh
Constituency. Former Parliamentary speaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun also
won comfortably for the fourth time from Khaldiya
constituency. The two are set to compete for the speaker's post in
the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Political parties in Kuwait are outlawed but political forces
and groups are allowed to be involved in political life in the
country which holds the only elected parliament in the Gulf
region.

<HEADLINE> British, Canadian Professors Win Nobel Prize for Economics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- British professor James
Mirrlees and Canadian William Vickrey have been jointly awarded
the 1996 Nobel Prize for Economics, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The academy said the 7.4 million Swedish kronor (about 1.2
million U.S. dollars) prize was awarded to the two professors "for
their fundamental contributions to the economic theory of
incentives under asymmetric information."
</P>
<P>
Assymetric information occurs when decision makers have
different information but have to make decisions based on that
information.
</P>
<P>
The academy said one of the most important and liveliest areas
of economic research in recent years addresses the situation where
decision-makers have different information.
</P>
<P>
The two men focused on how governments, companies or any
organization could cope with constantly lacking complete
information but having to make strategic decisions.
</P>
<P>
Research on the "economics of information" focused on the
question of how contracts and institutions can be designed to
handle different incentive and control problems.
</P>
<P>
This has generated a better understanding of insurance markets,
credit markets, auctions, the internal organization of firms, wage
forms, tax systems, social insurance, competitive conditions, and
political institutions, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
It added that this year's laureates "have laid the foundation
for examining these seemingly quite disparate areas through their
analytical work on issues where informational asymmetries are a
key component."
</P>
<P>
Mirrlees, 50, was born in Scotland in 1936 and was Edgeworth
Professor of Economics at Oxford University between 1969 and 1995,
and currently holds a professorship in Economics at the University
of Cambridge in England.
</P>
<P>
Vickrey was born in 1914 in Victoria, Canada, and is currently
Professor Emeritus at Columbia University, New York.
</P>
<P>
Nobel prizes, named after Swedish chemist Alfred Bernhard Nobel
who died in 1896, were set up in 1901 in the fields of chemistry,
physics, medicine, peace and literature. The prizes are awarded to
outstanding scholars around the globe on December 10 each year,
the anniversary of Nobel's death.
</P>
<P>
The economics prize, known formally as The Bank of Sweden Prize
in Economic Sciences, was given for the first time in 1968 and is
the newest of the prestigious awards.

<P>
MACAO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Police in Macao seized more than
three kilograms of drugs in a crackdown on drug trafficking, but
two suspected smugglers escaped, a local report said.
</P>
<P>
Police found in a cargo ship more than 3,200 grams of marijuana
powder, estimated at a price of 240,000 patacas (about 30,380 U.S.
dollars), according to a report in today's "Macao Daily News."
</P>
<P>
Police sources said these drugs were probably intended for
shipping to other areas via the Macao International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Two men suspected of transporting the drugs fled by jumping
into a river during the police action. Macao police will contact
related departments of neighboring regions for further
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The report said Macao police have this year seized as much hemp
 as about 10 times that of last year. But it is the first time
that more than three kilograms of marijuana powder was
discovered.

ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Uzbek Militia led
by Rashid Dostum were consolidating their positions around the
Salang Tunnel, 120 kilometers north of Kabul, said reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that a large number of Uzbek militiamen were
digging in around the tunnel linking Kabul and northern
Afghanistan, and were placing mortars in their positions.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban Militia, which had reached the tunnel a week
before, were very close to the Uzbek positions, but no clashes
between the two sides have been reported.
</P>
<P>
However many civilians living near the tunnel were fleeing from
the area into the Hindu Kush mountains to avoid the possible
fighting.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Taliban Militia were attacking the ousted
government troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood in the Panjshir valley
which is close to the Salang Tunnel to the east.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed During Fighting in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and 20 others wounded when a heavy gunfire exchange
erupted between militiamen supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed and those
of Hussein Mohamed Aidid in Medina neighborhood last night.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sudi Yalahow, the militia and community leader of Medina,
today charged that the fighting was provoked by the militiamen of
Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
There is no clue to what has triggered off the fighting.
However, sporadic shooting and heavy shelling on Medina had been
heard throughout the war-torn capital for the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
A militia commander from Hussein Aidid's faction has accused
their rival militiamen of instigating the fighting in their
attempt to drive their rivals out of the entire neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the area also reported that the largest
institute of Ulumu Diin in Medina district was also looted during
the fighting which began late yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The institute funded by the Africa Moslem agency taught
religious lessons and a few general knowledge to more than 400
students free of charge. No students had been attending the
Islamic institute since the beginning of the fighting in Medina
last June.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of religious and other books pillaged from Ulumu
Diin Institute were seen in Mogadishu's main markets for sale
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Director of the institute, Dr Abdi Samad has called on the
Somali people not to use these books for sugar, fish or other
food wrapping. Doors, windows, tiles and all furniture were also
snatched away from buildings of the institute.
</P>
<P>
Yalahow warned that more roads and areas outside Medina will
be closed down if the mounting siege on their neighborhood by the
forces of Hussein Aidid is not lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's militiamen have been surrounding Medina since
the closure of the era of late general Mohamed Farah Aidid who
died of gun wounds during the fighting in Medina early August.
</P>
<P>
''No food or medicines are allowed to pass through Medina and
there are dozens of seriously war wounded patients in the private
treatment centers in the vicinity,'' Yalahow told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the situation in Medina, Yalahow said more than
four people die of hunger in Medina every day and the struggle of
the Somali Red Crescent Society and Red Cross to alleviate some
of the hardships from Medina had ended up in vain.
</P>
<P>
There is also serious humanitarian crises in the vicinity even
though more than 50 percent of its population have left the area
since the fighting began in the neighborhood last June, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao External Trade Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports in the
first seven months in Macao dropped about three percent from the same
period of last year, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
show that the imports of Macao between January and July this year
declined by three percent to 9.1 billion patacas (about 1.15 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports and re-exports by Macao were reported at 8.5 billion
patacas (about 1.08 billion dollars), down 2.9 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
As a result, trade deficit reached 581 million patacas (about
73.5 million dollars), down four percent.
</P>
<P>
The export of textiles and garments, which accounted for 79.4
percent of all exports, climbed 1.2 percent, comparing with a
17.3-percent increase in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The export of non-textile products fell by 16.2 percent,
compared with an 11.8-percent drop in the same period of last
year. In particular, the export of toys plummeted by 53.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leading export markets for Macao are the United States and
the European Union nations, which absorbed 72.2 percent of Macao's
exports. The exports to the United States, however, had slid by
171 million patacas (about 21.6 million dollars) by July, down 4.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the decrease in exports to the United States was
mainly the result of a trade dispute over textile and garment
products. The United States imposed strict restrictions on the
export of some Macao textile and garment products earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import of consumer and capital goods went down
by more than seven percent, while import of raw materials and
semi-finished goods, fuel and lubricant increased.
</P>
<P>
The import market focuses on the Asia-Pacific region. Imports
from China's mainland, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan all went
up, but those from its dominant goods suppliers, Hong Kong and
Japan, dropped.

<P>
HANGZHOU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Do you ever swear? Do you
litter the ground with cigarette butts? Do you spit in public?
</P>
<P>
For "students" in Wenzhou's newly-initiated classes to train
citizens to be more civilized, the answer is expected to be a
resounding "NO!"
</P>
<P>
With more and more villages becoming urbanized, many farmers
also have become urban residents. But they still retain some bad
habits, such as spitting in public, littering and swearing,
according to Xu Shuncong, director of the Wenzhou City Office for
Promoting Cultural and Ideological Progress.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the citizens' schools in towns around
Wenzhou city in east China is designed to help citizens become
more acquainted with civilized ways of the world, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
A port city best known for its prosperous private sector,
Wenzhou currently administers 130 cities and towns, up from a
dozen in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Students aged 20 to 50 attend the schools, which don't have
stationary classrooms or teachers. Local governments are
responsible for organizing citizens to run classes in the first or
second half of a year.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that Wenzhou currently has "citizens' schools"
scattered throughout 139 towns. By the end of last year, about one
million people had studied in such schools.
</P>
<P>
He cited the school in Mayu Town as a model. Over the next
three years, the town plans to send all residents aged from 16 to
55 to the schools.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Warns Against Renegotiation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has warned against any
re-negotiation of agreements signed between Israelis and
Palestinians and emphasized the need to implement the accords and
resume final status talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On the restored Israeli-Palestinian negotiations which started
Sunday at the Erez crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
Jordanian Minister of Information Marwan Muasher rejected as
"dangerous to the peace process" any attempt to re-negotiate the
accords between the two sides, the English-language daily Jordan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan considers any re-negotiation of (the) agreements
already reached between the Palestinians and Israel as dangerous
to the peace process," the information minister told a weekly news
briefing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Israeli government had been saying that it
wanted to amend some of the provisions in the accords reached with
the Palestinians, particularly in regard to an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable that a party to an agreement turns
around and says it is not happy with the accord and wants to amend
it," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country insisted that "the
Palestinian-Israeli talks focus on swift implementation of
commitment to the agreements into realities on the ground."
</P>
<P>
Jordan also demanded that an immediate attention be given to
moving to the final status negotiations between the two sides,
Muasher said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not right that the peace process remains snagged over
agreements already reached," he said, adding, "The peace process
should move as soon as possible to the final status negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians launched the final status
negotiations as called for in the Oslo agreements in May but the
discussions were suspended pending the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the negotiations have been stalled since Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the hardline Likud bloc,
won the elections over former Prime Minister Shimon Peres' Labor
Party and insisted on amending some of the earlier accords.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian minister also expressed "concern" and "regret"
over Israel's failure to inform Jordan of its decision to reopen a
new entrance to a controversial tunnel near the Islamic holy
shrine Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Muasher pointed out that Israel, in its 1994 peace treaty with
Jordan, recognized the kingdom's "special role" in the Islamic
holy shrines in Jerusalem, saying the Jewish state was duty-bound
to inform Amman of any move related to the shrines. But he did not
elaborate on Jordan's role.
</P>
<P>
"We regret very much that Israel did not inform us of the move
to open the new entrance to the tunnel despite the presence in
Amman of a senior Israeli envoy 24 hours before the opening," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was referring to the visit to Amman by Dore Gold,
an advisor to Netanyahu, on September 23, one day before the
opening of the tunnel entrance.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan considers the Israeli failure to inform it of the
decision as a clear violation of the peace treaty and has made its
position known to Israel through several channels (including the
meeting King Hussein of Jordan had with Netanyahu in Washington
last week)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel entrance on September 24 triggered
fierce violence between Israelis and Palestinians, causing the
deaths of more than 70 people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton hosted a summit in Washington
attended by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Netanyahu and King
Hussein, but it did not produce any tangible results except an
agreement to resume the stalled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Company to Ignore Gene Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A major British insurance company
is to ignore the results of people's genetic tests when
calculating life insurance policies, according to a local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The news has caused a ripple among insurers who are under
pressure to come up with a plan for dealing with waves of new
information from genetic tests about people's future health, The
Daily Telegraph said today.
</P>
<P>
Standard Life said on Monday that anyone applying for life
assurance related to a mortgage for under 100,000 pounds (160,000
U.S. dollars) would not have to reveal that they have had genetic
tests.
</P>
<P>
The fear among customers is that people who test positively for
a disease may be barred from getting pensions and mortgages even
though the gene may be only one of many factors leading to the
disease, including lifestyle and other genes.
</P>
<P>
Other insurance companies are demanding that people reveal the
results of genetic tests they have taken, although no insurance
company requires people to take tests specifically in order to
qualify for a policy.
</P>
<P>
But the Association of British Insurers said that refraining
from looking at the results of genetic tests was "not being in the
real world." Insurance companies had the right to know all about a
person's medical information, it said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Stamps Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The demand for Macao stamps has grown rapidly both in Macao and
other regions including Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Portugal and
Singapore, as the time draws near to the handover of power in 1999
when China resumes exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Macao will increase the number of stamps to
be issued next year by some 20 percent to meet the surging demand.
</P>
<P>
The office usually issues 150,000 to 300,000 pieces for a set
of new stamps while the number of special stamps does not exceed
500,000, which can hardly meet the demand of the local market.

<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Alain Juppe affirmed Monday evening his
determination to fight "terrorism under all forms in Corsica,"
after the National Liberation Front of Corsica, or FLNC-Canal
Historique, signed a declaration of war claiming the bombing
attack on Juppe's mayoral office in Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
-- As American media commentator Hal Bruno said, in the
90-minute presidential debate between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in
Hartford, Connecticut State, the two presidential candidates
neither committed any fault nor caused any change of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNN survey made Monday morning, 43 percent of
those who watched the debate on television said that Clinton was
more convincing in his point of view, while 20 were more inclined
toward Dole.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The FLNC-Canal Historique, the armed wing of the Cuncolta
nationalist organization of Corsica which demanded greater
autonomy for the Mediterranean island from France, has claimed
responsibility for Saturday night's bombing of the Bordeaux City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorist specialists predict that the group will launch
new armed actions in continental France. This escalation of
violence indicates the radicalization of a part of the Corsican
nationalist movement.
</P>
<P>
-- France is trying to catch up with Germany in its trade with
Russia and other former Soviet republics. French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette, who is leading a business delegation to Moscow
Tuesday, will discuss with Russian officials about the second
meeting of the Franco-Russian Economic Commission to be held in
Paris. He will then go to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> High School Girl Pregnancy Rate in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent study shows that two out
of every five secondary school girls in Nigeria have had at least
one previous pregnancy while 150 out of every 1,000 women who
give birth are 19 years old and under.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, more than 60 percent of patients with
abortion complications are adolescent girls and abortion
complications account for 72 percent of all deaths among young
girls under the age of 19.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 50 percent of the deaths in Nigeria's high
maternal mortality rate are those of adolescent girls due to
illegal abortions.
</P>
<P>
These alarming statistics on adolescent reproductive health
were provided at a workshop organized by the Action Health
Incorporated (AHI), a Lagos-based non-governmental organization
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The situation, according to Jadesola Akande, former Vice-
Chancellor of Lagos State University, is resulted in the fact
that the existing family planning and reproductive health
programs ''have rarely considered sexuality, gender roles and
power in designing and providing services.''
</P>
<P>
The first step and possibly one of the important steps to
reverse the present situation ''is to educate our youth and
adolescents about sex and sexuality,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Education Improves in East China's Rural Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Visitors from afar are always
surprised that a rural primary school in Zhejiang Province has
such modern facilities as computers and classrooms with
audio-visual equipment, a gymnasium and a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Hongxi, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of
Zhaozhai Village, proudly tells his guests, "Our school caters to
the needs of the next century."
</P>
<P>
Zhaozhai is a prosperous village in Rui'an, a small city
administered by Wenzhou, well known for its prosperous private
sector. Of the 900 families in the village, 700 either are in
business or manage factories.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the village has spent ten million yuan
to build and equip a school.
</P>
<P>
"In order to turn our village into one that is first-rate and
prosperous, we must give top priority to the expansion of the
educational sector," said village head Zhao Dianzheng.
</P>
<P>
He said that the village also rewards bright students. Two
young villagers recently were given 5,000 yuan each for going to
study in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lin Kefu, deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Committee of Rui'an City, said that government officials and the
general public in Wenzhou agree that in order to expand the
economy, it is imperative to make the educational sector a success
and invest in it.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that it will take several decades to make nine-year
compulsory education universal by depending solely on government
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
But most local residents are prosperous, he said, adding that
they are enthusiastic about providing financing to the educational
sector.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in Leqing, another small city in Wenzhou,
financing for non-state-run schools from non-government sources
has exceeded 100 million yuan over the past three years. Now
thousands of rural children are studying in these schools.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, various schools financed by farmers,
entrepreneurs, non-Communist parties, retired government officials
and overseas Chinese have been set up.
</P>
<P>
For example, Leqing currently has 400 kindergartens, three
primary schools, four junior schools and six senior schools
involving funding from non-governmental sources and 18 secondary
technical schools.
</P>
<P>
Some primary schools even provide English courses for the
first-grade pupils and computer courses for those in the third
grade.

<HEADLINE> Israel Unveils New Type of Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Rafael, Israel's main
military manufacture corporation, has officially unveiled a new
short-range, air-to-air missile, according to today's The
Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The Python-4, considered by many experts to be the best
short-range, air-to-air missile in the world, developed with no
foreign components, has already been operated by the Israeli Air
Force for several years.
</P>
<P>
The missile will be shown to the public for the first time at
the Seoul Air Show in South Korea, which is to open next week, and
it will draw potential customers from southeast Asia, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The Python-4 has a unique aerodynamic design which
incorporates large fins, giving it superior agility, the paper
said, adding that most old missiles have small fins so they do not
turn well.
</P>
<P>
The Python-4 is a head-seeking, "fire and forger" missile
incorporating a high penetration warhead with an active proximity
fuse, which allows it to be deadly even if it does not score a
direct hit.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to be too much of a braggart, but it has been
said that this is the best air-to-air missile in the world,"
Rafael's spokesman Noah Shahar was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as
saying, adding the corporation hoped to market it abroad.
</P>
<P>
While refusing to quote a price for the missile, Shahar said it
would be competitive. "We believe that there is a great potential
for marketing the Python-4," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Python-4 did not have any foreign
components or technology, so that there was no need for Rafael to
get a foreign country's permission to sell it.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low profile and the fact that the missile has
never been tested in battle, other countries have known the
Python-4 for several years.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Python's current closest rival is the
Russian A-11 air-to-air missile, which is used by Syria's
MiG-29's.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States is currently developing the A9X
missile, which it is touting as competitive, not with the A-11,
but with the Python-4.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Jewelry Investors Welcomed in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it
encourages foreign investors to set up a large-scale jewelry
manufacturing plant in the country and that it can provide support
facilities for them.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very conducive environment for intensive jewelry
manufacturing and all supporting facilities for the manufacturing
environment," International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia provides a fairly good sized market for jewelry, she
said when opening an exhibition of gems and jewelry from Sri Lanka
here.
</P>
<P>
She said although the country lacked skilled craftsmen, foreign
investors could provide their own skilled craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia hopes to become a world jewelry manufacturing center
by encouraging more manufacturers to operate in the country, she
added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 manufacturers have been approved to produce
jewelry. Of the total, 20 are in production, four have been
approved specifically to produce costume jewelry and one to
manufacture souvenir and costume jewelry, as well as seven to cut
and polish diamonds.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said Malaysian jewelry exports last year totaled 1.183
billion ringgit (about 473.2 million U.S. dollars). From January
to May this year, exports reached 446.9 million ringgit (about
178.76 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The jewelry was mainly exported to Singapore, Hong Kong, the
United Arab Emirates and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Plans to License Insurance Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), the central bank of Singapore, plans to license
insurance and reinsurance brokers so as to enhance its supervision
of the insurance industry, Finance Minister Richard Hu said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 18th
Conference of the East Asian Insurance Congress (EAIC), Hu said
the legislation facilitating the licensing of brokers is expected
to come into effect in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The move from the current self-regulatory regime to a more
formal regulatory framework will lead to a more financially sound
and professional industry and will, in turn, lead to better
protection of policy-holders' interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that market liberalization is a precondition
for a vibrant, consumer-driven insurance market. But, he stressed,
this does not diminish the government's role in putting into place
proper regulatory fundamentals to facilitate sound and stable
growth.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this, together with a liberalized market
environment, has boosted Singapore's development as a regional
insurance center.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Singapore is currently served by nearly 60 direct
life and general insurance companies. Together they wrote more
than 5 billion Singapore dollars (about 3.6 billion US dollars) in
premiums last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is also home to about 40 largely foreign reinsurance
companies and plays host to about 50 captive insurers of foreign
multi-national corporations.

<P>
ALMA ATA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's National Bank
President Alievich Djandosov announced Monday that Kramds Bank,
one of the country's biggest commercial banks, has gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Djandosov said the National
Bank decided on October 4 to stop the functions of the Kramds Bank
as a financial institution and take back its banking license due
to its bad management and unaffordable debt.
</P>
<P>
Kramds Bank, with a capital of 7.5 million U.S. dollars, had
suffered a total loss of 2 billion tenge (about 29 million U.S.
dollars) by September 1, 1996 and 1.5 billion tenge (about 21.7
million dollars) alone this year, a press report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kazakhstan's regulations on bankruptcy, personal
deposits will enjoy the priority for the debt-paying.
</P>
<P>
The People's Deposit Bank of Kazakhstan will pay off Kramds
Bank's debt as of January 1997, Djandosov said.

<HEADLINE> RMB Foreign Exchange Rate Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China maintained a bullish
foreign exchange market in September, with a stable renminbi
foreign exchange rate, according to statistics from the China
Foreign Exchange Center.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange transaction volume hit 4.82
billion US dollars in September. Among the total foreign exchange
transactions, 4.54 billion were in US dollars, 1.68 billion were
in Hong Kong dollars, and 6.42 billion were in Japanese yen, the
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the weighted average price of foreign exchange
against renminbi declined as affected by supply and demand. The
weighted averages price for a US dollar fell to 8.3017 renminbi
yuan from last month's 8.3063 renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prices for a Hong Kong dollar and Japanese yen
against renminbi also fell 21 points and 1,768 points in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the oversupply situation of the foreign
exchange market to the tax refund policy for export and the
drawing of large amounts of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the market will maintain the momentum and
China's foreign exchange reserve will continue to rise.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects EU's Proposal to Send Peace Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
rejected a proposal by the European Union (EU) on sending an EU
envoy to assist the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister
David Levy turned down the proposal put forward by visiting Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring two days ago, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Spring, whose country holds the current EU presidency, proposed
sending an EU envoy to the region to assist Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks and help ease the tension, just as the EU did in
defusing the Bosnian conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Spring's visit at a time of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension
demonstrated the EU's desire to secure a role in the Middle East
peace process to break the monoply by the United States, which
asserts itself as the sole leading mediator, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the recent EU summit held in Dublin of Ireland, French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette made it clear that Europe must
have a bigger role in promoting diplomatic efforts to help achieve
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Spring held talks with Netanyahu and Levy and urged
Israel to take initiatives to ease current tension with the
Palestinians. He also held talks with Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat before departing for a visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Spring said the EU did not intend to compete with the U.S. in
promoting the Middle East peace process. However, he stressed
that both Europe and the U.S. had a role to play in the
peace-making, adding that the EU would work with Washington to
push forward the process.
</P>
<P>
The EU has criticized Israel for its hardline policies toward
the peace talks which led to the bloodshed two weeks ago and
demanded it honor the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
It is also locked at a war of words with the Jewish state over
the latter's strong objection to EU foreign ministers' visit
to the Orient House in east Jerusalem, the de facto PA
representative office.
</P>
<P>
Israel, claiming to be the sole sovereign authority over
Jerusalem, has threatened to refuse to receive any European
foreign minister who intends to visit the Orient House.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Valley Plays Important Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Valley is
playing an increasingly important role in China's economic
development, and is expected to become the most dynamic region in
China by the end of this century, economists predict.
</P>
<P>
The river valley covers parts of a dozen provinces and
autonomous regions in southwest, central and east China. With a
total area of 1.8 million square kilometers, it accounts for
almost one fifth of the country's total territory.
</P>
<P>
It produces half of the country's grain and freshwater fish,
and 40 percent of the cotton and oil-yielding crops each year,
yielding half of the total agricultural output value in China.
</P>
<P>
The river valley possesses 80 percent of China's mineral
reserves and 60 percent of its technical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Its annual growth rate of major economic indicators ranked
between 14 and 20 percent in the past five years, surpassing the
national average rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Three economic zones, with Shanghai as the center in the lower
reaches, Wuhan heading the middle section and Chongqing leading
the upper areas, have been formed in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River has linked 98 large and medium-sized cities
and 1,900 towns to form the longest golden waterway in China. And
a number of steel and nonferrous metal makers along the river have
formed an industrial corridor.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Enhance Trade Ties With Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian team is to leave for
Angola on October 11 on a market research mission to explore
possible markets for Zambian products.
</P>
<P>
The team is composed of members of the Export Board of Zambia
(EBZ) and 13 Zambian exporters dealing in a wide range of
products, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The research mission is part of a sustainable promotional
strategy developed by EBZ. The purpose of the strategy is to
identify and penetrate new markets including Angola and expand
existing ones especially in the COMESA/SADC region being among
the target markets for Zambian products.
</P>
<P>
The criteria applied in selecting regional markets is due to
proximity, historical ties in some cases and the warm relations
Zambia enjoys with neighboring countries. The stabilizing
political situation in Angola is another factor taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
EBZ has decided to involve exporters themselves in the Angolan
mission to accord them an opportunity to meet and negotiate
orders with would-be importers of their products on a face to
face basis since they will be able to build and strengthen their
relations for further sale.
</P>
<P>
Products to be promoted during the research mission comprise
maize, sorghum, sunflower seeds, sugar, beans, window frames,
pressure geysers, wheel barrows, books on the Lunda/Luvale
culture, exercise books, dresses, trousers and many others.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rules Out Compensation on Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will remain firm on
its "national car" program and will not offer compensation to
countries that file a complaint to the World Trade Organization
(WTO), a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The national car issue is a pure trade issue and it will not
be complicated with other issues including compensation," Industry
and Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo told parliament on Monday,
according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
Japan maintains strong interests with Indonesia's economic
growth as seen by its large amount of investment in the country.
Ariwibowo expressed optimism that Japan would not jeopardize its
economic relations with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the European union last week filed complaints with
the WTO, saying the Indonesian auto program violates international
trade rules. The United States said it would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The complaints came after Indonesian President Soeharto ruled
in February that producers of a "national car" would be exempted
from import duties and luxury taxes, which add about 60 percent to
the price of cars in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which holds a 90-percent share of the Indonesian auto
market, has urged Indonesia to treat all foreign car makers in the
same manner and grant tax breaks to all of them.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has agreed to hold consultations with the WTO to seek
a solution to the dispute.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Institutional Restructuring Based on Realities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren said today that the country will continue efforts to reform
its public administration mechanism, based on its requirements for
the development of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the 3rd International Conference on
Administrative Sciences which opened in Beijing today, Rong said
he expects to learn from the experiences of other countries, and
to widen the international exchanges and cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
Attending the conference are about 700 representatives from
nearly 100 countries and regions, and several international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Rong said the Chinese government has attached great importance
to the reform of its administrative system in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the rapid economic growth and economic reform,
China has already implemented a series of reform measures: the
comprehensive governmental organization reform has been enforced
to transform the functions of government bodies; the civil service
system has been overhauled to improve the country's personnel
system; and talent markets have been developed to cultivate forces
needed to bring China to a more prosperous 21st century, Rong
explained.
</P>
<P>
After these reforms, the government bodies have been more
scientifically restructured, excess public employees have been
laid off and government efficiency has been promoted, the
vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that administrative systems based on scientific
theory are important for the economic development and social
progress in both developing and developed countries, but "the
administrative reforms must be carried out according to their
actual needs of economic development and in accordance with their
own characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Personnel Song Defu said that the economic,
political and cultural backgrounds and level of social development
of a country have an overwhelming influence on its administrative
reform.
</P>
<P>
Song said that the Chinese way of reforming any public sector
is to retain its unique characteristics. The reform measures have
been carried by way of a gradual trickle-down process, and have
sought a balance between social justice and efficiency based on
justice, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference in Beijing will help to promote China's
reform in its administrative system.
</P>
<P>
The International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS)
is the highest-level academic body in the field of administrative
sciences. Specialists and high-ranking officials from all over the
world are here to discuss the theme "New challenges for public
administration in the 21st century: efficient civil service and
decentralized public administration."
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor Li Guixian was present at the opening
ceremony. Rong and Li met leaders of the IIAS before the
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Tamil Rebels' Difficult Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Colombo-Jaffna Highway is
open for traffic after 13 years of closure and there is a free
flow of traffic between the north and south following the rout of
the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on the Jaffna
Peninsula in May and Kilinochchi Town in September.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the highway is a heavy blow to the LTTE, which
as a result is finding itself in an increasing difficult
situation, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Kilinochchi Town, which was used by the rebels as their
headquarters after they recaptured Jaffna city, is on a main
supply route for the Sri Lanka government in despatching food and
provisions to the north. The town had been held by the rebels, who
blocked vehicle traffic on the highway and levied a toll on
individuals who wanted to travel either way.
</P>
<P>
Following their rout, the rebels, who have been fighting for an
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country, have
taken to the neighboring Wanni jungles where they have hastily
constructed huts and sheds mainly to treat their injured,
according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and the other leaders are
reportedly in a jungle hideout at Mullaitivu District, near the
military camp which they overran in August.
</P>
<P>
The military claims that now only Mullaitivu has to be re-taken
to be in total control of North Sri Lanka. It also claims that in
the east too the strength of the rebels has been seriously
weakened following the summoning of their cadres from the east to
help the beleaguered Tigers in the Kilinochchi battle.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte confirms this by
saying the LTTE has been defeated in the north and though there
may be temporary setbacks in the east, government troops could
take full control there too within a short time.
</P>
<P>
While the government is taking steps to rehabilitate the
civilian refugees both in Jaffna and at Kilinochchi, the Tigers
are forcing them to flee to India to sour relations between the
two countries. They are even pumping money into this operation to
smuggle refugees across the Palk Straits so as to create an
international issue, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Already 2,500 refugees are reported to have been transported
recently by the LTTE to southern India.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sri Lankan government, mainly through the
endeavors of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadiragamar, has been able
to obtain much international support in the drive against the
Tigers, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent U.N. conference, the minister appealed to the
international community to help curb terrorism and sought the
support of his counterparts in an effort to draw world attention
to this problem and evoke international support.
</P>
<P>
India has agreed to take steps to stem the flow of refugees and
in a preventive move, naval surveillance has been stepped up by
both countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States has pledged its fullest assistance and
cooperation to "counter the scourge of terrorism perpetrated by
the LTTE and those who support it by fund raising on their
behalf."
</P>
<P>
Britain has offered to mediate peace between the government and
the LTTE. However, the government's insistence on the LTTE laying
down arms before resuming negotiations and the LTTE's refusal to
do so as a basis for dialogue may make international mediation
impossible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, citizens in Jaffna have urged the government not to
allow the LTTE to administer the Jaffna Peninsula. They have
listed the hardships and extortion they experienced in the past 13
years and urged the government to act firmly against the LTTE
rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Germany
will soon sign an agreement on investment promotion and
protection to help enhance investment in both countries,
according to the Saudi newspaper Arab News available here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Wolfgang Gaerte, German Consul General in the

boost investments in both countries."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with the English-language

</P>
<P>
Gaerte said that German investments in Saudi Arabia total 1.5

</P>
<P>
"We are working to further increase both investments and joint
ventures," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that Saudi investments can be enhanced
because Germany now offers more opportunities, especially in such
sectors as real estate and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not say when the agreement will be signed.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between these two countries have been on the
increase in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Total exports by Saudi Arabia to Germany in 1995 was 876.606
million dollars while trade the other way amounted to 2.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Signs are optimistic about an increase this year in both
countries' trade figures," the consul general said, adding that
during the first three months this year, Saudi exports to Germany
totaled 161.032 million dollars while German exports to the
kingdom reached 614.402 million dollars.

KAMPALA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- East African countries have
agreed to spray chemicals in a bid to eradicate hyacinth on
Lake Victoria, a water plant which has blocked traffic and
suffocated fishes, "the New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wagonda Muguli, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, told the paper on
Monday that Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania held discussions on the
matter on scientific and political levels, and reached agreement
to this effect.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to a statement by his Kenyan counterpart
William Mayaka, the Permanent Secretary for Natural Resources.
Mayaka was quoted last week by Kenyan press that the use of
chemicals might have undesirable effect on the lake's fauna.
</P>
<P>
Muguli said, "my colleague may not been properly briefed
when he made the statement."
</P>
<P>
Quoting reliable sources, the report said the chemicals to be
sprayed on the lake are already employed in Entebbe, some 40
kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
But the Uganda government is still facing a court ruling and
sued by Ugandan environmentalist Askia Muhammed who wants to
stop the spraying.

<HEADLINE> Wuxi Promotes New Tourism Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Wuxi, a city known for its
tourism in east China's Jiangsu Province, is luring more visitors
by vigorously promoting holiday and entertainment tours as well as
the traditional trip to scenic Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
Located at the center of the Yangtze River Delta, one of
China's most economically-developed regions, Wuxi is also renowned
for its numerous cultural relics. It is one of the ten
state-designated tourist cities in China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, replicas of ancient cities from the Three
Kingdom Period, and the Tang and Song dynasties have been built in
Wuxi, to be used as outdoor shooting places for several highly
successful TV programs produced by China Central Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The sites have since become very popular among tourists, who
came to enjoy the legendary scenes from the famous ancient tales.
</P>
<P>
To further develop tourist resources at Taihu Lake, a tourism
zone was built on the east side of the lake, which includes a zoo,
an ethnic culture park, and a pet garden.
</P>
<P>
A national tourism and holiday zone is under construction on
the Mashan peninsula in the lake. Villas and a campground have
been built in the 13.5-sq-km zone, and a golf course and yachting
club are under construction.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Wuxi received more than 52 million
tourists, of which 784,000 were from overseas, according to the
local tourism administration.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate more tourists, Wuxi has upgraded its tourism
facilities, and now has 18 star-rated hotels with more than 3,000
rooms, and 14 travel agencies able to receive overseas travelers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Barred From Addressing on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Bangladeshi President
Abdur Rahman Biswas wanted to address the nation over radio and
television on the eve of his relinquishing the presidency, but it
is not going to materialize.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said today that the prime minister's office
stood in the way and instructed the Information Ministry not to
record or put on air the outgoing president's speech.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given by the office in this regard, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The president had been scheduled to address the nation over the
state-run radio and television network tonight, the last day of
his presidency. Both the radio and television authorities had been
alerted to be ready to record the valedictory speech ahead of the
scheduled broadcast time.
</P>
<P>
Biswas, 72 and the 14th president of the republic, is packing
up to leave the presidential palace here today as the first
president to complete his full five-year tenure in Bangladeshi
history. He will be replaced by the president-elect, Justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed, who was elected unopposed in the parliament as
he was the sole candidate nominated by the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
In an emotion-packed one-hour farewell speech to officials,
employees and presidential guards in the presidential palace
Monday afternoon, Biswas expressed his satisfaction that he was
going to retire at the end of his term and pledged to help smooth
the path of transition and make the future of the posterity
secure.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he never allowed himself to bend under pressure
from any quarters or anyone, including that from an envoy of a big
country, which he did not name.
</P>
<P>
"Man is fallible but with the grace of Allah Almighty I tried
to dispense my duties truthfully and firmly taking into
consideration the nation's interest and weighing the pros and cons
of all matters," he explained. He promised to defend himself
against all kinds of allegations, but he did not give any details.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Zambia to Provide Effective Services to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- ''There is great potential of
economic development in Zambia. Enterprisers from China and the
rest of the world are welcome to come to invest and explore the
rich natural resources in the country.''
</P>
<P>
This was said by Bwalya Ng'andu, Director General of the
Zambia Investment Center (ZIC) in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Ng'andu gave a brief introduction about the ZIC which was set
up in early 1992 as a statutory and autonomous institution of the
state with the mandate to promote and facilitate new investments
in the country. Its board of directors is strongly represented
in government departments and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
An investment act was passed in parliament in 1993. It
stipulates the ZIC functions, various policies and incentives for
investment and the process for application of investments in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Ng'andu was appointed as the ZIC director general with effect
from May 1, 1996. By profession he is an economist, industrial
psychologist and banker.
</P>
<P>
Prior to taking up the current appointment, he worked with the
United Nations office for project services directing and
coordinating the establishment of the African economic community
on behalf of the U.N. Economic Commissiont for Africa, the
African Development Bank and the Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
It is of his view that regulations with favorable terms and
incentives alone are not enough to attract investors to come.
</P>
<P>
Ng'andu said it is imperative to enhance the ZIC capacity for
effective delivery of services to the population of investors,
both domestic and abroad.
</P>
<P>
After taking up the new post, he put forward two tasks for the
ZIC direction to promote and facilitate investments in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The first task that the center must perform in the fulfillment
of its mandate is to provide potential investors the world over
with precise and accurate information on the vast and exciting
opportunities that Zambia has to offer.
</P>
<P>
This approach will not only help potential investors to
ascertain Zambia's comparative advantage in agriculture, mining,
tourism and manufacturing but it will also assist them in making
more informed investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
The second task facing the ZIC involves converting it into a
truly one stop institution for investors. This entails broadening
the range of services it offers to potential investors as well as
to those already on the ground.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the center will be more actively involved in
the provision of such services as company formations, on behalf
of overseas investors, conveyancing, executive recruitment, legal
advice, carrying out opportunity, prefeasibility and feasibility
studies and many more.
</P>
<P>
''Our philosophy is based on anticipating the requirements of
investors and potential investors and subsequently building the
institutional capacity to address these requirements in order to
simplify the investment process,'' Ng'andu said.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Controls Pollution of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region will use legal means to control the discharge of pollution
into the Yellow River, China's second largest.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, which has a 830-kilometer section in the
region, is a major water source for local residents.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, water pollution in the region has worsened
when more industrial enterprises are being built.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China strengthened pollution control in the Huaihe
River area, and as a result, dozens of small paper mills moved into the
Hetao District in Inner Mongolia, aggravating the pollution
situation in the Yellow River reaches in the region.
</P>
<P>
The heavy development of coal resources, construction of
thermal power plants, and urban expansion have also increased the
discharge of sewage.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Standing committee of the regional People's
Congress passed a regulation to control pollution of the Yellow
River before the state implements a law to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The regulation requires various local districts to be
responsible for protecting and harnessing the river, and considers
the effort to improve water quality to be an important aspect of
local officials' work.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will control the total amount of sewage to be
discharged by enterprises, and stipulates that the discharge of
wastewater must be licensed.
</P>
<P>
The region also will close down existing paper mills with an
annual output of less than 50 million tons and forbid the
construction of new small paper mills, as well as small
coke-manufacturing or gold-mining enterprises, and prohibit the
renovation of enterprises with technology or equipment that could
cause heavy pollution.

<HEADLINE> Economists Suggest Reserve Ratio Be Lowered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The fourth quarter will offer a
golden opportunity for the state to lower the deposit reserve
ratio of the state commercial banks, and a further interest rate
cut on loans within a reasonable range will be desirable,
according to a newly-released report by the State Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
The October-December period will be the best time for the cut,
the report pointed out, as it is in line with the Central Bank's
early promise to lower the reserve ratio, and will affect the
national economy to a relatively light degree.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has cut the interest rate twice this
year, by an average of 0.75 and 0.98 percent on loans and deposits
on May 1, and 1.2 and 1.5 percent on lendings and savings on
August 23.
</P>
<P>
The report said a further cut in bank loans was desirable, as
the rate cut on deposits was much greater than that on loans in
the two cuts early this year.
</P>
<P>
And though the Chinese enterprises have their debt burden
relieved in some degree with the cut, they are still suffering
from severe capital shortages and are reporting poor economic
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The report also called on the central bank to increase loans
used for purchasing farm and by-products to benefit Chinese
farmers, which may bring this year's credit budget up to more than
800 billion yuan.

NEW DELHI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever claimed 19 more
lives in the past 48 hours in the Indian capital New Delhi,
bringing the toll to 85 since the disease broke out in September,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
With 124 fresh admissions during the last 24 hours, 1,432 cases

</P>
<P>
In the absence of any effective surveillance mechanism, the
government has no way finding how many people have reported to
private hospitals and clinics. As most of the people do not even
report to hospital unless the patient's condition deteriorates. It
is estimated that only 20 percent of the cases have been reported
so far.
</P>

The disease is marked by an onset of high fever which does not
come down for four or five days. Fever is accompanied by severe

<HEADLINE> India Experiencing Power-Sharing Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- In the context of contemporary
political realities, it seemed that the coalition government has
come to stay as an essential feature of the Indian politics, an
Indian scholar said.
</P>
<P>
Professor O. P. Minocha of the Indian Institute of Public
Administration (IIPA) said in his paper that the 1996
parliamentary elections in India had been unique in many ways as
it had not given a clear mandate to any political party to form a
government. Even pre-election alliances and understanding among
different political parties, as predicted, had resulted in a "hung
parliament" -- as the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) could not
remain in power for even two weeks.
</P>
<P>
India is experiencing the type of coalition known as
"power-sharing" coalition. Various parties have begun to formulate
a variety of election strategies, with each striving for the
removal of the Congress or the BJP from power. Another type of
alliance among the regional parties in the form of the federal
front to share power at the center has come to the forefront and
this trend is likely to have a tremendous effect on the
union-state relations, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current government scenario, he said that the
working of the coalition was affected by the need to secure
inter-party consensus and the decision-making process of the
cabinet had been rendered difficult by the disagreements among the
cabinet ministries on political and departmental matters.

<HEADLINE> Official Campaign Starts for October 20 Poll in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Official campaigning for the
upcoming general election, to be contested under a new system
combining single-seat constituencies and proportional
representation, started today with more than 1,400 candidates
vying for the 500-seat in the Diet.
</P>
<P>
The October 20 election for the House of Representatives will
be the first such poll in three years and three months.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not any single party is to win a majority of the
seats, and the performance of the newly-launched Democratic Party
of Japan will have a major impact on the post-election political
landscape in the country, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign is likely to include vigorous debates
between the parties on administrative reform and the planned
consumption tax hike, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest to watchers are those voters who account
for nearly half of all eligible voters and who have not declared
their support for any particular party. How many of these people
vote on October 20, and whom they support, will be important, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The lower house election will also be the first under the new
voting formula combining 300 single-seat constituencies and 200
proportional representation seats to be contested in 11 regional
blocs of the nation, replacing the 511-member lower house elected
under a 70-year-old multiseat constituency system.
</P>
<P>
Of the total candidates, more than 1,200 are expected to run in
the single-seat constituencies, with some overlappingly named on
political parties' proportional representation lists.
</P>
<P>
Some big shots of major political parties are filing their
candidacies for both single-seat constituencies and proportional
representation seats to give themselves two chances of retaining
their Diet seats.
</P>
<P>
The election will reflect the degree of public trust in Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's nine-month-old government combining
his Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party and the
New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 59, dissolved the lower chamber on September 27 in a
bid to strengthen his grip on power by getting a popular mandate.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A joint parliamentary
committee has been formed here to monitor the implementation of a
Nepal-India border river development treaty ratified last month, a
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member committee, comprising seven MPs from the ruling
coalition and main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), will be chaired by Lower House Speaker
Ram Chandra Poudel.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali Development Project Monitoring Committee will

western boundary with India, is the major outcome of the Mahakali
Integrated Development Treaty signed between the two countries in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was ratified by the Nepali parliament on September
20 after main opposition the CPN-UML raised several issues
concerning the treaty for further discussion and demanded the
formation of a parliamentary panel to monitor the treaty's
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed on Monday at a joint meeting of the upper

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Set to Import Power From India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering importing 100-200 megawatts of electricity from its
neighbor India to make up for the severe shortfall and
load-shedding, concerned sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Another 100-200 megawatts are expected to be produced through
barge-mounted generators as proposed by the private sector within
the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
The present available generating capacity in Bangladesh stands
at about 2,200 megawatts, which is merely enough to meet the
country's demand. However, the long-standing gas shortage has
brought down the power generation by 250 to 300 megawatts,
according to the Power Development Board (PDB).
</P>
<P>
An official delegation, led by PDB Chairman Nuruddin Mahmud
Kamal, last month visited India to explore the possibility of
importing electricity and got positive response from the other
side.
</P>
<P>
The move triggered a sharp and nationwide controversy in
Bangladesh. The largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
was critical of the move and termed it as a conspiracy of the new
government.

BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai caretaker Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-Archa Monday said that Laos and Cambodia will
acquire a membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) before Myanmar, which needs more time to sort out its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Banharn made the remarks when he met Norwegian Prime Minister
Gro Harlem Brundtland who arrived here on Monday for a three-day
visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said, however, the ASEAN does not support the idea of
isolating Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that it was the latest position revealed
by Thailand on Myanmar, which currently is an observer of the
ASEAN and hoping to obtain a full membership in the group next
year.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland Monday reportedly persuaded Thailand to exert
pressure on the Myanmar government to respect free and fair
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian prime minister was also critical of ASEAN's
"constructive engagement" policy on Myanmar, saying it failed to
generate results.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Slow Recovery for Asian Exports Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The marked slowdown in export
growth throughout Asia this year has raised questions about the
health of the region's economy, but many analysts believe that the
slack is cyclical and not structural, and a slow recovery for
exports is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
Hit by lower-than-expected export growth this year is Southeast
Asia, where exports had been rising by at least 13 percent during
the past seven years. But its export growth slumped to 7 percent
in the first half of 1996, compared with a 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in exports was, to a large extent, attributed
to a slump in global demand for computers and other electronic
products. As Asia makes more than half of all finished computers
in the world, the slowdown in computer demand is sending shock
waves across Asia.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was the hardest hit by the lower demand as
electronics account for two thirds of the country's exports and
14.6 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP). Singapore is
expected to report a slide in export growth to 3 percent in 1996
from 13.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
For similar reasons, during the first six months of this year,
year-on-year export growth fell from 24 percent last year to six
percent in Thailand, from 33.2 percent to 11.8 percent in South
Korea, from 18.2 percent to 4.4 percent in Hong Kong, and from 23
percent to 6.4 percent in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The declines in exports have affected the growth rate of the
Asian economy. According to the Asian Development Bank, the
region's economic growth so far this year has been put at 7.1
percent, down from 7.9 percent recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
The weak export growth made some Asian countries adjust
projections for their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand recently released lower growth rate
estimates for the year. Thailand's GDP growth for 1996 is
projected at 7.8 percent, dipping below 8 percent for the first
time in a decade when growth averaged 8.7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has similarly revised downwards its growth forecast
for the year from the projected 7.5 to 8.5 percent to 7 to 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The export slowdown and its impact on the region's economic
growth have taken many by surprise and triggered off a debate on
whether the region's exports have lost competitiveness or the
slowdown has been caused by structural problems. Some even wonder
if the growth engines of the Asian economy is starting to sputter.
</P>
<P>
But many economists believe that the export slowdown is just
cyclical as the electronics industry has gone through
boom-and-bust cycles before, and right now it is a down cycle.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based International Data Corpor, a market research
consultancy specialized in personal computers, forecast net sales
to expand 19.6 percent this year, down from last year's 23.8
percent. The corporation said that it is not a huge fall but
people were expecting growth to continue at last year's rate for
another few years.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the slowdown in the first half of this year will
limit the upside for the full year, but demand conditions should
improve in 1997, Ing Barings, also a research body, said in a
report. First improvements are expected to surface in early 1997,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Other economists said that Asian inter-regional trade, which
accounts for about 35 percent of all imports and exports, has
impacted on overall export growth, as a number of the larger Asian
economies have man-made slowdowns and cyclical slowdowns in 1996.
</P>
<P>
They said that this led to a reduction in the pace of their
imports and the pace of exports from their Asian trading partners.
</P>
<P>
But when the man-made and cyclical slowdowns are over next
year, the region's export growth will also recover, they said.

<HEADLINE> USA Threatens Sanctions Against Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
threatened to reimpose sanctions upon Bosnian Serbs if they
continue to boycott joint Bosnian government institutions.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb representative to the new Bosnian
presidential troika, and 11 Serb parliamentarians refused to
attend Saturday's inauguration in Sarajevo for "security reasons."
</P>
<P>
"The United States government was furious with the decision by
Krajisnik not to participate in the opening of the National
Assembly," said U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
"It was an important symbolic event which was meant to kick off
a new era in Bosnia, an era where national institutions will be
built now that the elections have been held," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The United States sees the boycott as a serious blow to the
unsteady peace process and to the re-establishment of a united
Bosnia after three years of war among its three ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha said in Pale earlier
today that the Serb representatives would attend the parliament
session once the venue acceptable to the Serbs was decided.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Nepal Airlines
(RNA), Nepal's national flag carrier, has settled a
multi-million-dollar legal dispute with its one-time sales agent
in Europe last weekend, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
RNA officials said Monday that Dinesh Dhamija, an Indian-born
English businessman, has agreed to drop his lawsuit against the
airline in exchange for a compensation of between 1 million to 1.5
million U.S. dollars, the Kathmandu Post daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had been negotiating in London for such a
settlement since last month when the airline initiated the talks,
fearing an unfavorable court verdict.
</P>
<P>
Dhamija filed a lawsuit in London against the Nepali airline
last year after the latter unilaterally canceled a ticketing deal
with his company, the Fare Ltd., the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The RNA withdrew the 1992 deal with Dhamija in March 1995
citing a huge loss of 21.6 million dollars as a result of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said earlier that the RNA would have to pay
millions of dollars in damages to the English businessman if the
out-of-court settlement could not be reached before a court
verdict.

<HEADLINE> Huge Fire Breaks Out in South Korea's Taejon City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A huge blaze broke out at a
yarn-spinning factory in Taejon, capital of South Korea's South
Chungchong Province, last night and raged for four hours before
being extinguished early this morning, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were immediately reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated 14.6 million U.S. dollars in
damage to Choongnam Spinning Company, destroying one building
completely, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 employees, who were working on night shifts, were
quickly evacuated after the breaking out of the fire.
</P>
<P>
"While electric coating operations were going on inside the
factory, sparks flew to some textile dust, causing a fire," a
factory worker said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted another worker as saying that firefighting
equipment was quickly utilized but the fire rapidly spread to the
entire factory.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five firefighting vehicles were rushed to the scene,
along with some 700 firefighters and police, and burning textiles
and dyes emitting poisonous fumes made firefighting operations
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating the exact cause of the blaze and the
extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
Choongnam, one of South Korea's largest spinneries, has about
2,600 employees at its Taejon plant, which covers an area of
296,700 square meters and consists of 33 buildings.
</P>
<P>
A huge fire at the plant in July 1981 caused 2.44 million
dollars of damage. Another blaze in December 1992 slightly
injured seven employees and led to 1.22 million dollars in
damage.

<HEADLINE> Goods, Services Tax Bill In Sri Lanka's Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 8 (Xinhua)-- A goods and services tax bill is
to be presented to the Sri Lankan Parliament this week by Deputy
Finance and Planning Minister G. L. Peiris, according to ministry
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The bill to be enacted will replace the present cumbersome
turnover tax on imports, manufacturing and services and will
introduce essentially a tax on goods and services on the basis of
the value added in each stage of manufacturing, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new law is generally expected to be superior to other forms
of sales taxation because it will avoid multiple taxation such as
tax on tax or cascading of tax.
</P>
<P>
The new tax will however not cover the banking, financial
services and shipping sectors as revenue considerations require
the turnover tax to continue in the finance sector until it could
be phased out and Sri Lanka is committed under bilateral
agreements to continue the turnover tax.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the goods and services tax is considered a
significant step which will facilitate rationalization of the tax
system.
</P>
<P>
The principal feature of the new system lies in the fact that
it will have limited exceptions and all other goods and services
will be taxed at a standard rate, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The items that will be exempt from the tax include unprocessed
food, items such as agricultural produce, sugar, kerosene,
liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum and cement.
</P>
<P>
Public passenger transport will also be exempted from the tax,
the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Rare Wild Animals Increase in Qinghai Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of rare wild animals
on Qinghai Plateau has increased thanks to the establishment of
four new state-level nature reserves and 19 provincial-level
no-hunting zones in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai, in northwest China, has 74 species of rare wild
animals under class-one and class-two state protection.
</P>
<P>
In the Longbao Nature Reserve, there are 105 black-necked
cranes under priority protection, nearly double the number of a
few years ago. The zone's black-necked crane population accounts
for one ninth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
On Bird Island in Qinghai Lake, bar-headed geese and brown
seagulls have increased by over 40 percent, compared to figures
from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the past, herds of wild yak, antelope and musk deer have
decreased as a result of illegal hunting by both Chinese and
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
With the addition of more state-level and provincial-level
nature reserves and new regulations to protect wild animals, the
number of illegal hunting cases has dropped.
</P>
<P>
During a no-hunting campaign in Qinghai from October 1995
through this March, the province ferreted out 10 illegal hunting
cases in the Yushu and Haixi regions, and confiscated more than
4,000 wild animal skins and 82 guns.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Sets New Record in Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite this year's wind, dust,
drought and floods, the total grain output of north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region reached an historic 13 billion
kilograms, more than two billion kilograms higher than the 1995
figure.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth year the region's grain output has exceeded
10 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jinhua, an official from the regional agricultural bureau,
said that this year's grain output will greatly satisfy the needs
of local agricultural and animal husbandry production as well as
meet the requirements of human consumption. There will also be
millions of tons of surplus corn and sorghum which can be
allocated for transfer to other provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has placed great importance on
agricultural production. Science and technology departments at all
levels sent 12,000 agricultural experts and technical workers to
help and guide farmers in farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
Last spring and this autumn, 3.14 million farmers attended
concerned technical training.
</P>
<P>
A series of advanced agricultural technologies, including
plastic sheeting on dry land, interplanting and improved seeds
have been widely used and proved effective in fighting natural
disasters and improving grain output.
</P>
<P>
This year, the region invested 1.03 billion yuan in
agricultural development, 14.4 percent more than the amount of a
year ago, and agricultural loans reached 5.44 billion yuan, an
increase of 19.8 percent over last year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Jitters Send Thai Stock Market Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Political uncertainty in
Thailand has led to foreign jitters, which sent the Stock Exchange
of Thailand (SET) falling to the lowest level since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling of banking and finance stocks by foreign
investors saw the SET index tumble by 60.26 points, or 6 percent,
to close below the 1,000-point level at 944.63 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline on Monday was the deepest and steepest for a single
trading day since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The stock market responded positively on the following trading
day after Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa dissolved the House
of Representatives on September 27, before it started its
continuous fall.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have adjusted their investment portfolios in
Thailand on the belief that other markets are more attractive and
this is a factor prolonging the bearish sentiment, SET President
Singh Tangtaswas said.
</P>
<P>
He assured foreign investors that trading on the SET in the
interim period before the November 17 general election would move
in line with political developments.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Thailand's bearish sentiment, foreign markets
such as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia offer better
returns and this has led to an investment shift overseas, said a
foreign analyst.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have forecast further downward movement on the SET now
that the index has fallen substantially below the 1,000-point
psychological barrier and there is more selling pressure from
foreign investors.

ALMA ATA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan hopes the present
economic crisis will end in 1997 and then the economy will return
to the right track, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a

</P>
<P>
Since its independence five years ago, Nazarbayev noted,
Kazakhstan has been confronted with an economic crisis and a

He said, however, that although the Kazakh people have yet to
taste the fruit of the reforms launched by the government several

reforms.
</P>

The government will try to maintain a macro-economic stability
in 1997 and to lure more investment from home and abroad so that
the economy will grow on a sound basis, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the country's financial situation, the president vowed to
further contain inflation and reduce unemployment next year. He
urged the parliament to pass a new bankruptcy law which will allow
the elimination of the money-losing enterprises.

BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Public Transportation
Company plans to increase self-service bus lines though the
self-service buses have received some compliments since they were
introduced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The transportation officials see automatic fare collection as a
way to cut labor costs and reduce the need for state subsidies,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Some passengers say the automatic fare collection system, an
international trend in public transportation, is a sign of
civilization and enhances public awareness of ethics.
</P>
<P>
But others say the practice causes disorder and passagers have
to bring with them correct fare because they can not get change
from the fare-box.
</P>
<P>
Now Beijing have 24 self-service lines. Of the 16 lines added
this year, the two-door buses are standard self-service and the
three-door buses are semi-self service, with one conductor to help
elderly or sick passengers and answer questions.
</P>
<P>
Some people say that the transportation company should set up
stands at bus-stops to change money for passengers while the
company held that passengers should gradually develop the habit of
bringing small change when taking self-service buses.

here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Soeharto, who is on a two-day visit to
Malaysia, and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad agreed on
Monday to let the world court decide who has sovereignty over the
two small islands between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the
Indonesian province of Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
While Malaysia wanted the dispute taken to the International
Court of Justice, Indonesia had preferred to have it settled
through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Dewi Fortuna said it was impossible for the two countries to
refer the dispute to the ASEAN High Court Council due to
Malaysia's objection.
</P>
<P>
Both Indonesia and Malaysia are members of the ASEAN which also
groups Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Dewi Fortuna said the agreement to take the dispute to the
world court was also wise for reaching a just solution acceptable
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old dispute flared up again in 1991 after Malaysia
began promoting the islands as a tourist destination.

<HEADLINE> Muster Escapes Suspension for Davis Cup Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Thomas Muster had not
been given more punishment for his walkout at the Davis Cup
doubles, since the International Tennis Federation decided Monday
the previous fine of 8,000 US dollars was enough.
</P>
<P>
Muster walked out the court in the doubles between Austria and
Brazil in Sao Paulo on September 21, citing unfriendly gestures
from the local fans.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian tennis star claimed the Brazilian fans had been
spitting, cursing and throwing objects at him while he was
playing. His teammates followed suit to skip the reverse singles,
giving Brazil an easy 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
For the incident, Muster faced suspension and more fines before
the ITF's Davis Cup Committee Monday, and Austria could have been
kicked out of the competition for a year or relegated to the
bottom ranks.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the committee ruled the forfeiture of 8,000 US dollars
for Muster and 58,760 dollars for Austia, was enough.

HOHHOT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of bronze artifacts which
represent the cultural heritage of north China's 3,000-year-old
nomadic ethnic groups has been found in Ningcheng County in north
China's Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The discovery includes more than 1,000 relics, such as helmets,
plates, pots, and vessels.
</P>
<P>
One of the artifacts had an inscription of more than 90 words,
which recorded the sacrificial rites of the ethnic group. The
remains of two fish were found in a bronze plate, which
archeologists believe was used during the sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of bronze arrowheads were also found, illustrating the
military strength of the ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the group was active in eastern Inner
Mongolia, Liaoning Province, and Hebei Province during the Western
Chou Dynasty (11th century to 771 B.C.) and the Warring States
Period (475-221 B.C.)

<HEADLINE> Misuari Joins Move to Amend Charter in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Barely a week after being
installed as governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM), Nur Misuari has joined other local officials in supporting
initiatives to amend the constitution to extend their terms of
office, including that of President Fidel Ramos, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring Ramos's unwillingness to change the constitution,
Misuari vowed on Monday he would launch his own campaign for
"proportionate representation" for Mindanao in the government and
for extending the term of elected government officials.
</P>
<P>
He said he supports extending the terms of elected government
officials because "too much time, effort, money and wisdom" is
wasted electing officials every three years.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to pursue this fundamental right (to amend the
constitution) of the people. If I can not convince the president,
I will appeal to the good congressmen and senators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said he would first try to work for the convening of
Constitutional Convention through Congress and form another
constitutional commission before gathering forces behind the
so-called people's initiative which he said is being led by Lito
Osmena, the executive vice president of the ruling Lakas-Nucd
Party.
</P>
<P>
"But if necessary, we will support the initiative of Lito
Osmena in order to get the necessary change so that we can
democratize the constitution."
</P>
<P>
Misuari was also seeking "proportionate representation" for
Mindanao in the government through changing the charter. He stuck
to his former request that the Senate be expanded by increasing
the number of Senators from 24 to 72 and 24 of them should come
from Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But at the same day, the Senate was seeking an investigation of
the "people's initiative" to determine whether it is genuine or
just the handiwork of elective officials facing political
extinction.

million units annually, according to Monday's "Guangming Daily."

To date, the company has exported 103,000 of the compressors to

STOCKHOLM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Norway has destroyed its all

arms, according to a report reaching here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Norway, a NATO member, last year announced a ban over the
production, import and use of anti-personnel mines.
</P>

"Norway is the first country in our part of the world to get

Minister Joergen Kosmo as saying earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"We now hope that Norway's example can help speed up progress
toward an international ban," added the minister.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 to 20,000 people, predominantly civilians, are
killed or wounded every year by some 110 million anti-personnel
land mines in 69 countries, statistics of the United Nations show.

<P>
About 5 million new mines are deployed each year, said the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges DPRK to Release American under Spy Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States urged the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Monday to
"immediately" release an American arrested on espionage charges,
saying the man was "not a spy".
</P>
<P>
The American is called Evan Carl Hunzike, a 26-year-old
missionary, who entered the DPRK on Aug 24 and was arrested on the
charges of spying for the South Korea.
</P>
<P>
DPRK issued a terse statement on Sunday claiming: "He (Hunzike)
admitted that he is a U.S. citizen and he illegally entered the
DPRK for the purpose of getting information of its domestic
situation. He will have to take an appropriate penal
responsibility under the DPRK criminal law."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that the
DPRK "ought not to hold on to an American citizen who is being
detained in North Korea and he should be released immediately"
</P>
<P>
A senior administration official told reporters that "this guy
is not a spy. Their charges are groundless."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean news agency said Hunzike was working as a
missionary. His mother is reportedly South Korean and his father
American.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang and Washington have no official diplomatic relations
but Burns said U.S. officials had been discussing the Hunzike case
with DPRK officials based at their U.N. mission in New York.
</P>
<P>
Swedish diplomats, who represent the United States in
Pyongyang, were said to visited Hunzike twice in September,
reports said here.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attacks Turkish Prime Minister's Visit to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
attacked Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan for his visit
to Libya and signing a deal to triple trade with the Libyan
government.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, fulfilling a campaign promise to impose friendship
with Muslim nations after coming to power in June, visited Libya
last week and signed a deal that would triple the trade between
the two countries with his Libyan counterpart Abdel Majeed Ka'ud.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Erbakan said he believed Libya was against
terrorism and was also a victim of terrorism. He specifically
sited U.S. jet-bombing of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's home in
1986.
</P>
<P>
Registering his disapproval of Erbakan's remarks, U.S. State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said: "I hope the prime
minister didn's say those words. It would be highly surprising if
the prime minister of an allied country, a NATO country, were to
defend a terrorist like Moammar Gadhafi."
</P>
<P>
The United States has been leading a campaign to isolate Libya
politically and economically. Libya is one of seven countries the
U.S. State Department attacks as sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains troubled by any trip that could be
seen as benefiting the Gadhafi regime," he said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Tory's Last Hope in Bournemouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, October 7 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the British
Conservative Party delegates' gathering in Bournemouth for its
last annual conference, the latest opinion polls show that it
trails Labor by 25 percent, what an ominous!
</P>
<P>
The ruling Conservatives, already mired in cash-for-question in
Commons scandal, suffered a new blow today when Lord McAlpine, a
former treasurer and ex-deputy chairman of the Party, switched his
allegiance to Referendum Party.
</P>
<P>
The Party has been threatened by an aggressive Opposition, the
Labor, which ended its successful conference last week, the
continuously emerging party scandals, bitter divisions on European
affairs and the refusal of the British people to credit the
Government for economy.
</P>
<P>
So the main task of the Party Annual Conference which starts
tomorrow is to draw upon its inner strengths and prepare for the
election next spring.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the results of the
opinion polls do not always mean all, and no one at this stage can
say the ruling party is doomed.
</P>
<P>
They recalled that the Conservatives have climbed out of their
mid-term abyss in the run-up to each of the last elections. So it
is hard to say they can not do so again.
</P>
<P>
While there are only six months left before the election has to
be called, May 1st, 1977 is the last date for a vote, some
political analysts said in political arena, anything reversed
could happen during this period.
</P>
<P>
However, whether the Conservative Party can avoid a defeat in
next election largely depends on Prime Minister John Major's
performance at the Annual Conference this week.
</P>
<P>
Major must try his utmost to bring the party back to its
confidence and to enthuse the party supporters to go out and work
for the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister must also set up his authority,in and out of
the party, as never before, and hurry to limit the damage of the
Party's in-fighting over Europe and its members' corruption
scandals.
</P>
<P>
If the Annual Conference could persuade British people that
their best hope lies with the continuation of the reform started
by former Prime Minister Thatcher, and persuade voters that new
Labor's alternative is a mixture of policies which lack realism,
and the Conservative offer the best hope of great wealth, the
party's revival is still possible.
</P>
<P>
Although the Labor Party enjoyed huge lead in opinion polls and
the success of the Party Conference last week, the Conservative
still have a chance to make a show at its Conference and make a
fight of general election next spring.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the economic situation now in Britain is also
favorable to the Conservatives. With its sustainable,
inflation-free growth, Britian's overall performance of economy is
better than for many years, which is bound to effect British
peoples' voting intention.
</P>
<P>
But whether the Conservative can survive largely depends on
what the Party will offer the voters in its last Party Conference
before election.

<HEADLINE> European Convention on Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The UN Economic Commission for
Europe (UN/ECE) announced here on Monday that a convention to
protect transboundary water resources within Europe has taken
effect on Sunday after being ratified by 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE Convention on the Protection and Use of
Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes was drawn up
under UN/ECE auspices and signed in 1992 by 25 European countries
and the European Community.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to increase international monitoring of the over
150 large transboundary rivers and some 20 international lakes in
Europe and to manage transboundary pollutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the Convention, the parties will have to draw up
stringent pollution norms and quality criteria that everyone will
have to comply with.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring systems will be set up to coordinate the efforts of
all riparian parties not merely in the event of an accident but
also to monitor pollution routinely.
</P>
<P>
The polluter-pays principle, which means making those who
create the pollution pay the cost related to it, will be applied
across the national borders.
</P>
<P>
"With this Convention, we shall be able to stop Europe's major
rivers from being turned into gigantic sewers that no one cleans
or maintains," said Kaj Baerlund, Director of the Environment
Division of the UN/ECE. "We must realize that these watercourses
and lakes are a common good for which we are jointly responsible
at the European level."
</P>
<P>
Countries which had ratified the Convention by Sunday were
Albania, Austria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Calls for Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda today urged the
creditor countries to extend debt relief to the poor nations in a
bid to boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the General Debate at the current United Nations
General Assembly, Eriya kategaya, first deputy prime minister and
minister of foreign affairs of Uganda, said that the magnitude of
debt and its servicing obligations continue to impose a serious
obstacle to the development efforts in the poor nations.
</P>
<P>
As of March 1996, he continued, his country's total external
debt stood at 3.2 billion U..S. dollars, accounting for 67.5
percent of the gross domestic product. Debt service was 141
million U.S. dollars, or 27 percent of Uganda's total export
earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The precarious situation is compounded by the current rigorous
debt-repayment enforcement regime pursued by creditor multilateral
financial institutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the creditors to take concrete measures to effect
a drastic reduction of the these debts owed by the developing
countries. These measures include debt write-offs and converting
part or the whole of the debts into grants.
</P>
<P>
He noted with appreciation the recent measures by the Bretton
Wood Institutions to put in place measures for debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Ready to Attend Parliament Session, Buha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister
Aleksa Buha said on Monday the Serb authority was for the
parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina to convene as soon as a suitable
venue was found.
</P>
<P>
Buha, who is also the president of the Serb ruling Democratic
Party of Serbia, said in the Serb capital Pale that the Serb
representatives would attend the parliament session once the place
acceptable to the Serbs was decided.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority did not send representatives to the
inaugural session of Bosnia-herzegovina's house of representatives
at the national theater building in Sarajevo last Saturday for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The session was then opened without the participation of the
Serbs. The international High Representative Carl Bildt said at
the inaugural session that the Serbs were shooting in their own
foot by boycotting the first parliament session.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Pale with Jeffrey Beaumont, advisor to the U.N.
Secretary General's special envoy, Buha said there was still time
to carry out the obligation under the Dayton accord to set up
common bodies of power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to Tanjug
news agency report sent from Pale.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord, common bodies of power will be
formed in Bosnia a month after elections, which was held on
September 14.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six members of parliament of the Bosnian Muslim
opposition Democratic National Union in Velika Kladusa in west
Bosnia boycotted on Monday the constituent session of the local
cantonal assembly in the Muslim-Croat Federation, according to
Croatian radio.
</P>
<P>
The union's members of parliament refused to travel to Bihac
for the body's session because the authorities would not guarantee
them a minimum of personal safety, it said.
</P>
<P>
The union won an absolute majority in Velika Kladusa in
Bosnia's September 14 elections, defeating the ruling Muslim Party
for Democratic Action.

<HEADLINE> Dow Attempts 6,000 Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average broke through the 6,000 barrier for the first time ever,
then lost ground Monday as investors sold more blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
It rose to 6,002.17 in the early trading, but only managed
about five minutes above 6,000 before profit-taking took hold. It
fell 13.05 points from Friday's record close of 5,992.86 to
5,979.81.
</P>
<P>
But record highs were reached for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index, the Nasdaq composite index and the New York Stock
Exchange composite index.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on most
exchanges Monday, with NYSE volume totaling 380.74 million shares
as against 463.88 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 rose 0.32 to 701.78, and the NYSE's composite index
rose 0.58 to 374.74.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.00 to 1,250.56, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 2.33 to 582.22.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Dow jumped 60 points after the government
reported that unemployment unexpectedly edged higher in September
from a seven-year low in August. That eased worries about
potential inflation from rising production costs, and helped the
saying that the Federal Reserve need not raise the lending rates
to contain inflation.
