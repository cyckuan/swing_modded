<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Logical End to Constitutional Topsy- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Clouds blotting out the
political horizon of this South Asian nation may have been
dispelled to some extent as the two-month-long tussle between the
government and the judiciary finally came to an end.
</P>
<P>
An anxious public, which have been following the event
nervously during the past couple of months, felt relaxed at the
weekend when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif finally accepted the
recommendation by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah to appoint five
Supreme Court judges.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's acceptance to elevate the five recommended
judges to the apex court defused what seemed to be the worst ever
constitutional crisis in Pakistan's history.
</P>
<P>
The two-month-old nerve-wrecking confrontation between the
government and the judiciary, which had thrown this nation into a
chaotic situation, ended on October 31 as the ruling Pakistan
Muslim League (N) and its allied parties yielded to the pressure
of the chief justice to "avoid a collision with the third pillar
of the state."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be a party to push the nation into the quagmire of
confrontation and chaos," said the prime minister in his
televised speech at the National Assembly Friday evening. "I have
no time to lose and I cannot indulge myself in questions of
obstinacy and egoism."
</P>
<P>
The government's retreat came two days after the Supreme Court
invoked Article 190 of the Constitution asking President Farooq
Leghari to announce the appointment of the five judges as the
government had failed to do the same as per recommendations of the
chief justice.
</P>
<P>
The mini-storm was unleashed on August 19 when the chief
justice recommended to the government names of the five judges to
be elevated to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Sharif had been resisting the elevation
of two of the five judges and had even tried to abolish the five
vacant posts in the apex court, fixing the number of judges at 12.
</P>
<P>
During the 74-day-long standoff between the two major pillars
of the state, Sharif, who assumed his premiership in February this
year with a heavy mandate, had vowed to fix judges' strength
through the parliament while Sajjad indicated in public statements
that any move by the parliament could be struck down if made
without consulting him.
</P>
<P>
The government-judiciary confrontation was intensified when the
Supreme Court resorted to the president early this week and the
National Assembly, in which Sharif's PML(N) enjoys a two-thirds
majority, passed a resolution claiming supremacy of the parliament
in the legislative process and got prepared to clip the powers of
the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that Sharif's compromise in the eleventh
hour will enable the government to get rid of an unnecessary war
of nerves with the judiciary and to devote itself to its ambitious
economic and political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, the Pakistanis remained on their toes
watching this war among institutions as their official functioning
came to a virtual standstill and stock markets plummeted to record
lows.
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted that the constitutional crisis seems
to have ended but the questions which emerged as the crisis
unfolded have to be answered in order to make the system viable.
</P>
<P>
The question of demarcation of domains of the judiciary and the
parliament is very much there and could lead to a crisis of
immense proportion again.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the present government has to face the
fallout of the crisis as two important petitions have already been
filed in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
A petition seeking disqualification of the prime minister for
violating Supreme Court orders and his contempt of court is to be
heard Monday.
</P>
<P>
Another petition challenging the 13th Amendment, which deprived
the president of his discretionary power to dissolve the National
Assembly and the government, has also been filed.
</P>
<P>
The apex court has already suspended the operation of the 14th
Amendment, or the Anti-Defection Law, passed by both houses of the
parliament unanimously early July.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the suspension of the operation of the
Anti-Defection Law by the Supreme Court has loosen the ruling
Pakistan Muslim League's control over its party members' behavior
inside the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that just as all constitutional
interpretations have political consequences, petitions such as
these also have political repercussions with which the government
of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has to deal cautiously.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Undecided on Doha Meeting: Meguid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has not
yet decided whether to participate in the fourth Middle East and
North Africa economic conference due to be held in the Qatari
capital Doha in mid-November, the AL chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
Esmat Abdul-Meguid, Secretary General of the Arab League, told
a press conference here this afternoon that the Arab League has
received an invitation from the Qatari government, but the
group's stand will be based on the state of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to attend the conference if progress is
achieved in the peace process," the secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to make comments on whether the Doha conference
will have negative effects on the Arab-Arab relations and whether
the conference will be helpful to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Arab League "hopes the Doha conference
will be successful."
</P>
<P>
The conference, traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the world, was boycotted by some Arab
states while supported by others.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian National Authority, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia have refused to appear due to
Israel's participation while Jordan and Yemen announced to attend
it. Other Arab states have not made their decisions.
</P>
<P>
The conference deepened the split among Arab League's 22 member
states. Syria said Israel should not be given chances to benefit
from the economic meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt claimed such a conference is meaningless because of the
deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and its supporters, on the other hand, argued that the
Doha conference will "give new impetus" to the peace process and
boost economic developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that his group has no right to impose its will on
Arab countries but will respect all decisions made by Arab states
themselves.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of realizing a comprehensive and
just peace in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped the Palestinian-Israeli meeting to be
held Tuesday in Washington will succeed, but stressing that any
partial solution to the dispute between the two sides is
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Meguid arrived here Saturday to attend a UAE-organized
three-day symposium which began here today on "the future of the
Arab world and the role of the Arab League."
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, participants will discuss issues such as
Arab-Arab relations, Arab-Israeli relations and Arab relations
with superpowers.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Vows Not to Allow Disruption of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba has
said his government will not allow the undemocratic and selfish
forces to disrupt the peace, stability and unity prevailing in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the statement in a speech read by Central
Province Deputy Minister Abel Musonda Chambeshi in Chibombo of
the province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency today quoted him as saying that his
government was mandated democratically by the people of Zambia to
rule the country and will not allow anyone to disrupt the peace
Zambia has enjoyed for the past 33 years.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during the official opening of the
Kulamba-Kubwalo traditional ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba condemned the October 28 failed coup, saying Zambia
does not require a coup because the current democratic system of
governance has afforded it an opportunity to change the
government through the ballot and not through the barrel of the
gun.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambians know the best way of changing government
and that is through the ballot and coups only bring sufferings to
the people.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government will continue to encourage
traditional ceremonies because they are symbols of identity for
each ethnic grouping and are strong unifying force for people.
</P>
<P>
He said the government recognizes chiefs as the custodians of
cultural values and the role they play in the national
development.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba advised traditional leaders to identify, preserve and
propagate all useful aspects of their culture to the young people
who regard some of the traditions as irrelevant to modern
society.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Pessimistic on Washington Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the U.S., Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat decided not to send the
heads of the committees dealing with the interim agreements to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the aegis of the United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
scheduled to meet tomorrow in the State of Virginia outside of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
But as result of Arafat's decision, the Palestinian delegation,
headed by PNA deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), is to include
only Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath and Local Affairs
Minister Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
The decision reflects the pessimism of Palestinians on the
upcoming talks because of Israel's refusal to honor standing
commitments, and on the fact that Israel and PNA have differed
over what to be discussed and whether the talks will produce
results.
</P>
<P>
Israeli delegation, headed by Foreign Minister David Levy,
wants to delve into technical as well as substantive issues. The
former includes an airport and sea port in the Gaza Strip and safe
passage between Gaza and the West Bank, and the latter deals with
further troop pullback and proposed settlement freeze.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Palestinian side believes the redeployment and
suspension of settlement activities must take precedence over
everything else. They contend that the various technical issues
can be dealt with locally and it is unnecessary to include them in
the Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian higher education minister, stressed
today that Palestinian delegation will not allow the main issues
to turn into secondary issues and the Palestinians are going to
Washington to show their commitment to the signed agreements
between two sides.
</P>
<P>
She said that the discussions will not be allowed to become a
gain for the U.S. and Israel at the expense of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Gaza before leaving for the U.S. today, Shaath
warned of a failure of the scheduled peace talks. "Although we are
aware that Israeli intransigent positions will obstruct the talks,
yet, we will go to Washington to present our point of view with
Albright's help," he added.

<HEADLINE> AL Rejects Extradition of 2 Libyans to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has
refused British call for surrendering to London's courts two
Libyans allegedly involved in exploding a Pan Am airplane over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, the AL chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
The AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid told a press
conference here this afternoon that the AL would not urge Tripoli
to respond to the call.
</P>
<P>
"We can not urge Libya to surrender the suspects because
Britain and Libya do not have an extradition treaty," Meguid
said.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief made the remark in response to a letter sent to
the Arab League by the British government calling on the league to
persuade Libya to accept the British proposal.
</P>
<P>
The British government also invited the league to send
observers if the trial was held in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of assuming responsibilities for
the explosion of the airplane, which killed 270 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has repeatedly called for the extradition of the two
suspects to London for trial, but Libya refused.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 banning arms sales
to and flights to and from the north African country for its
failure to hand over the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said the British suggestion could not be accepted by the
Arab world. "The Arab world will not accept the suggestion. We do
think an extradition treaty is the basic ground for settling the
issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meguid arrived here Saturday to attend a UAE-organized
three-day symposium which began here today under the title of "the
future of the Arab world and the role of the Arab League."
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, participants will discuss issues such as
the inter Arab, the Arab-Israeli relations and the Arab relations
with superpowers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Implement Resolutions on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has urged the Zimbabwean government to devise a
strategy of implementing resolutions of the 1995 Beijing
International Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
UNDP resident representative Carlos Lopes today told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the women's project would be entirely
funded by the U.N. agency and implemented in conjunction with the
women's department, UNIFEM.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the 1995 International Conference on
Women held in Beijing, China, a platform for action was endorsed
which compelled all participating countries to devise
implementation strategies to eradicate gender inequality.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, as one of the participants which sent one of the
biggest delegations, endorsed the platform for action but has not
formulated any implementation strategies.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe is the only SADC country which has not finalized
policy on Beijing resolutions. It is sad because there are a lot
of people here who can put together such a policy,'' said Lopes.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project, he said, sought to streamline gender
issues in different government departments' agenda.
</P>
<P>
''Gender issues should be part of the agenda of
macro-economics, population and land policy should have a gender
dimension to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Women constitute at least 53 percent of Zimbabwe's 12.4
million population and are the majority of the poorest in the
southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Joint Team on Land Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has denied reports
that a joint team has been set up with Britain to discuss
compensation to white settler farmers whose land Harare would
have compulsorily acquired.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirayi Kangai, reported to
be heading the Zimbabwean side, today said there is no need for a
joint team because the terms are clear.
</P>
<P>
"The facts are all there. The idea of carrying out a study was
refused," said Kangai, referring to the recent meeting held in
Edinburgh, Scotland between Harare and London.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not true that a joint team was set up because
Zimbabwe's interest in the talks was to impress upon the Tony
Blair administration that no compensation to the aggrieved
farmers would be forthcoming from Harare.
</P>
<P>
Britain, along with the European Union and the United States,
made a commitment, at Zimbabwe's independence to fund the
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"Acquisition of land is not going to depend upon Britain
making money available. We will go ahead," Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
Using the land acquisition act of 1992, the government has
been designating privately owned land to resettle peasant farmers
who were previously cramped in parched parts of the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
With mounting pressure from the former freedom-fighters, the
government of Robert Mugabe has intensified the land acquisition
program despite criticism from the mainly white farmers who felt
they were being unfairly targeted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has repeatedly said the farmers would not be paid for
the land, but would only be compensated for developments such as
houses, bore holes and fencing.
</P>
<P>
"The British government said they are going to look at the
legal and technical implications, then they will come back to
us," said Kangai.
</P>
<P>
He said the farmers would only be compensated once Zimbabwe
received the money from Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Economic
and Social Affairs in the President's Office Eneas Comiche today
urged international community to help Africa uproot corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said at a forum of the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA)
here that Africa can win a victory over corruption if
international community provides enough assistance to it.
</P>
<P>
Comiche acknowledged that joint efforts worldwide are needed
to uproot such a social evil.
</P>
<P>
He also urged transparency among international partners,
especially when they offer material and financial assistance to
needy countries because "at times, corruption comes from donors".
</P>
<P>
Dutch Minister of Cooperation and Development Kwesi Botchwey,
who is also GCA president, said at the forum today that it is
urgently needed for African countries to fight against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I believe corruption has become an obstacle to
development in Africa and that African countries and
international community should solve this problem urgently."
</P>
<P>
It is easy to eradicate corruption in Africa and other
continents by joint efforts, said Diane Marleau, Canadian
minister of cooperation, on the same occasion.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the forum Saturday, Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano promised that his government is taking a series
of measures to fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
He also urged rich states to write off or reduce the debts of
poor countries so as to help them solve their problems and fight
poverty.
</P>
<P>
About 200 delegates from 32 African countries, 17 western
countries and 28 non-governmental organizations including Malian
and Botswana Presidents Alpha Oumar Konare and Ketumile Masire
attended the forum which started Friday and is due to end today.
</P>
<P>
The GCA was founded in Maastricht, the Netherlands in 1990 by
African leaders along with representatives of international
community to discuss the future of North-South cooperation in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS's New Chief Assumes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A Guinean veteran diplomat,
Lansana Kouyate, has assumed office as the new executive
secretary of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the new post in August at the Abuja summit
of heads of state of ECOWAS, to replace his ailing compatriot
Edouard Benjamin. His term will span four years.
</P>
<P>
Before he moved to Abuja in mid-October to assume the office,
Kouyate was the U.N. special envoy to Rwanda. The 47-year-old
Guinean had also served as the assistant U.N. secretary-general
for political affairs, the U.N. special representative for
Somalia and various diplomatic positions.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate speaks both English and French fluently, the major
languages in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Kouyate has pledged to re-energize
the ECOWAS information system so as to make it more relevant and
effective in the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
The report also expressed the belief that Kouyate's U.N.
experience will come in handy to help him survive the hot seat of
a sub-regional body, whose primary objective of regional
integration is increasingly overshadowed by endless political
crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Price Hassan Ibn
Talal said today that Jordan and China should have more cultural
cooperation in the future through influential and
institutionalized channels.
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the statement when he met Chinese Cultural Minister
Liu Zhongde who arrived here Friday on a three-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Both Arab and Chinese cultures had long history and contributed
greatly to the global culture and it was necessary for the two
cultures to increase cooperation, said Hassan during his meeting
with the Chinese guest.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on Arab culture would be held in China next year
and it would give a more comprehensive and accurate image of
the Arab culture to the participants, said the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Liu told Hassan that the cultural exchange had

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Arrives in Crete, Greece, for Balkan Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CRETE, GREECE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis arrived today in Crete, a southern Greek island, to
attend the Balkan summit which is due to take place Monday, with
the participation of Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania,
Turkey, the Republic of Macedonia, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Leaders and representatives of the Balkan countries will gather
here Monday to discuss ways of easing political tensions and
expanding economic cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on his arrival, Simitis said the
cooperation among the Balkans was "still unstable and fragile."
</P>
<P>
As for the role Athens will play in the region, Simitis said
"Greece can and will play a leading role so that in this region,
which was a region of conflict and economic and social
sluggishness, progress, peace, stability and security can
prevail."
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, the first of its kind, is expected to issue
a joint communique, the "Crete Declaration" at the conclusion of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Balkans will agree to hold regular political consultations
at all levels, as well as systematic cooperation by police forces
to combat organized crime, smuggling and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the meeting between Simitis and his
Turkish counterpart, Mesut Yilmaz, will be the focus of the
bilateral contacts.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Greek-Turkish relations have witnessed
increased tension due to the major differences between them and
the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Air Traffic Controllers Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Striking air traffic controllers
and workers in Ghana's civil aviation industry closed the
country's air space today for higher pay and better safety at the
working site.
</P>
<P>
About 50 air traffic controllers, who started the strike
action at around 9:00 this morning, shut down the main control
tower in the capital Accra and informed the airlines that the
Accra information region had been closed, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
The director general of the civil aviation authority quickly
strung together a contingent of control crew called from among
senior management personnel, the Ghana Airways and retired air
control staff, and announced the airspace was open.
</P>
<P>
The situation, if continued, could affect air traffic within,
to and from Ghana, Togo and Benin, as well as over 19 flights
that should depart Accra to other places in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the nerve center of the major air traffic system
covering the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Deputy Turkish PM Warns of Clash in Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said today that clash would
break out in the Aegean Sea if Greeks want the clash to explode.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin made the remarks when visiting a military picture
exhibition in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, according to
semi-official Anatolian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Turkey wants to solve the problems with Greece
through friendship.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have long been at odds over sticking issues,
including mineral resources under the Aegean, air space division
and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz left Turkey this afternoon
for the summit meeting of southeastern European countries
scheduled for November 3-4 on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's visit to Crete will attract attention as he will meet
his Greek counterpart amid simmering tensions between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey started a military exercise, code-named Determination
'97, near Cyprus Saturday and will hold another military
maneuver, code-named Toros 2/97, near Cyprus Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish war games were apparently in response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriots' military exercises in
the Greek Cypriot-controlled area on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and Greece have been worsening
since the Cypriot government announced that it would not give up
the controversial plan to buy 150-kilometer-range anti-aircraft
S-300 missiles from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has repeatedly threatened that it will
destroy these missiles if the missiles are finally deployed in
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Top Male Winners of NYC Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- John sagwe of Kenya won
men's championship in the 28th New York City Marathon here
today, closing at 2:08:12.
</P>
<P>
He bettered his previous record of 2:09:07 in the Prague
Marathon in May and last year's NYC Marathon best at 2:09:54 set
by Italian Giacomo Leone.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe, born on September 1, 1969, finished fifth NYC Marathon
in 2:11:42 and fourth last year in 2:10:59.
</P>
<P>
He was second in the Philadelphia Half Marathon in September,
clocking a career-best 1:01:18.
</P>
<P>
He also won the Old Kent River Bank 25k this year and was the
1995 Pittsburgh Marathon winner in a course-record 2:10:24.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe's compatriot Joseph Chebet finished second at today's
NYC Marathon in 2:09:27 against his career best at 2:08:23 in
Turin in May.
</P>
<P>
Born on August 23, 1970, Chebet began his Marathon career
only last year with a 2:10:57 win in the 1996 Amsterdam
Marathon, over a course not noted for producing fast times.
</P>
<P>
In September he won a half-marathon in Luxembourg in 1:00:53,
posting another career best.
</P>
<P>
Italian Stafano Baldini, born on May 25, 1971, won the third
place in the 28th NYC Marathon with 2:09:31. He is a national
record holder with a 2:07:57 clocked at the 1997 London
Marathon, a gap of only two seconds to the champion Antonio
Pinto of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, his best was 2:11:01 from a sixth-place finish
in his marathon debut at the 1995 Venice Marathon.
</P>
<P>
Baldini has excelled in the half-marathon, setting the Italian
record of 1:00:56 with a win in Rome earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> French Lorry Drivers Begin Blocking Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- One year after they paralyzed
France by blocking all highways, French lorry drivers today again
began blocking all highways in a confrontation with their bosses
over higher pay demands.
</P>
<P>
Several trade unions, including the powerful Force Ouvriere
(FO), Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT), and Confederation
Francaise des Travailleurs Chretiens (CFTC), announced the primary
actions of blockade across the country this evening.
</P>
<P>
The FO called on the lorry drivers this evening to cease work
tonight and joined blockade of all "possible bottlenecks."
</P>
<P>
France's national lorry drivers' organization, the FNCR, this
evening appealed to all transport workers to stage a strike "from
now" with "action of strength and fullness"" to make accept their
requests.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came after negotiations between lorry drivers and
the biggest organization of trucking industry bosses, UFT, broke
down early this morning with the UFT quitting the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Different from last year's demands, the lorry drivers want this
time a 4 to 5 percent rise of their salaries and some other pay
raises.
</P>
<P>
The imminent strike is forcing British lorry drivers, who
transport fresh food from continental Europe to the British isles,
to flee the country, in fear of a replay of last year's blockade
which left them stranded in France for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of French car drivers are also buying up oil in
neighboring Belgium's gas stations because the blockade could
result in the shortage of oil supply, as was in last year's
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot said this evening
that there would not be a nationwide blockade this time and
promised to do all possible to let the conflicting sides reach an
compromise soon.
</P>
<P>
French lorry drivers got almost all they wanted in last year'
strike, including early retirement at 55, after blocking the
country for 12 days last November.

<HEADLINE> 3 US Weapons Inspectors Denied Entry by Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denied again the
entry of three American weapons inspectors into its territory
before the resumption of U.N. inspection Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources here said that the three Americans who arrived
today on a U.N. flight from Bahrain at Iraq's Habbaniya military
airport, some 80 kilometers west of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad,
have been deported by Iraqi authorities back to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Iraq turned away the three American
inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraqi mass destruction weapons despite U.S.' warning
about the consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council issued a statement
Saturday demanding the 10 American weapons inspectors of the
special commission in Baghdad to leave the country within a week.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also demanded the UNSCOM not to use American aircraft for
its inspection missions.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the UNSCOM Richard Butler announced last Saturday
in New York that the inspection team would resume its mission
Monday to see whether Iraq was serious in its decision to expel
American weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan, Swiss Runners Snatch 1997 NYC Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- John Kagwe, a male runner from
Kenya, first breasted the finishing line at the New York City Marathon
here in 2:08:11 on a misty Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second-fastest finish in the race's 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dream (which) come true for me," said the 28-year-old
African runner. He said he won because he used better tactics this
year.
</P>
<P>
Franziska Rochat-Moser, a lawyer from Switzerland, won the women's
race in 2:28:42.
</P>
<P>
The New York Marathon this year followed the same route and time
schedule of the previous ones, but it started in intermittent
drizzles. Some 30,000 runners surged across the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge in the city's southwest at the sound of the starting cannon at
10:35 a.m. Local residents braved the drizzle, giving their support by
shouting to the runners behind the police brocades.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe has been participating the race and kept improving his
records for the past few years. He was the fifth in the 1995 NYC
Marathon and fourth here last year in 2:10:59.
</P>
<P>
At the finishing line of the Central Park, Manhattan, Kagwe said
his shoe laces got loosened three times at third mile, 10th mile and
about 23rd mile separately. He tightened the first two, but ignored
the last one and ran through the remaining miles with the loosen
laces. "I knew I could not win if I fixed my laces again this time,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe said he was too eager to win last year, but did not succeed.
This time he was very patient and followed closed the first few
fastest runners, including his countryman Kenneth Cheruyot, who kept
the leading position for the first 17 miles.
</P>
<P>
The results of men's race showed that Cheruyot was not among the
first ten.
</P>
<P>
"When has anyone in the recent past won from running alone in
front?" said Tom Fleming, who has twice won the NYC Marathon in 1974
and 1975, and is now a radio commentator.
</P>
<P>
"Winners and record-setters usually run even pace or negative
splits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fellow Kenyan Joseph Chebet came in second at 2:09:27 and Italian
Stefano Baldini was third with a time of 2:09:31.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe won 50,000 U.S. dollars plus a time bonus of 40,000 U.S.
dollars and a Kia Sportage automobile.
</P>
<P>
Rochat-Moser, 31, is also the Swiss record keeper. She became the
leader at about 20th mile where, she said later, she could found
only male runners around. Rochat-Moser is a lawyer at his hometown
of Crissier, near Lausanne. She is a two-time Olympian and a veteran
of three World Championships. But she took part in the New York race
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised. I knew I was in good shape," Rochat-Moser
said.
</P>
<P>
The second finisher was South Africa's Coolleen deReuck, who
ended up at 2:29:11, and Italian Franca Fiacconi cleared the course
at 2:30:15 to take third place.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,800 women were among the 30,000 runners registered for
the 28th New York City Marathon, which passes through all to the
city's five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
The Oldest competitors this year was 90-year-old Sam Gadless, who
ran his first New York City Marathon in 1992 and was running Sunday
with his 55-year-old son and his 25-year-old grandson.
</P>
<P>
While the men's finish was just 11 seconds off the course record,
the women's results were well off the women's record of 2:24:40 set
by Lisa Ondieki of Australia in 1992.

<HEADLINE> No Wage Increase: Philippine Business Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading business group in the
country said here today that any clamor for wage increase at this
time is baseless as prices of basic commodities remained stable.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing wages is probably the wrong move we gonna take
right now. It is counter-productive for the economy," said
Guillermo Luz, president of Makati Business Club which groups most
of the country's top businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Luz downplayed speculations that the continued depreciation of
the Philippine currency of peso is causing a 30 percent fall in
consumers' purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, the peso has devalued by some 34 percent in
the regional currency crisis to the current level of 35.14 pesos a
dollar, prompting some trade unions to ask for a 100 peso wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
However, some government agencies and leading business groups
are arguing that despite the depreciation of the peso, the prices
of prime goods are stable.
</P>
<P>
"So, there is no way it (the wage) would increase," Luz said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Makati Business Club believes that average
inflation for the year will be between 6 to 6.5 percent, the same
as the government's revised target.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months this year, inflation stood at a
lower level of 4.7 percent compared with last year's 8.4 percent.
It slightly went up to 5.3 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Luz explained that companies could not bear higher wage
adjustment at this time, especially with lot of import content and
high interest rates. In addition, demand is slackening.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to prescribe an overall measure for wage hike. But,
if there is a strategy of putting across the board wage increase,
it's counter-productive because it's going to make companies even
more financially difficult," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto is to arrive in Saudi Arabia Saturday for a
two-day official visit on bolstering bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Embassy sources in Riyadh were quoted by Kuwait News
Agency as saying that Hashimoto's upcoming visit is in response to
an invitation by King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz .
</P>
<P>
This will be Hashimoto's first visit to the world top oil
producer and exporter since he took office and the second by a
Japanese prime minister since 1995, when his predecessor Murayama
Tomiichi paid a visit to the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at bolstering the excellent relations
between Tokyo and Riyadh in various domains, particularly the
economic and technical ones, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming talks between Fahd and Hashimoto will center on
searching for ways to boost cooperation between the two countries
in the economic, investment and technical fields.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume amounted to 11.6 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996 with the trade balance tilting in favor of Saudi Arabia
by some 7.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports 925,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi
Arabia, an equivalent of 20 percent of the Japanese needs of
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto will particularly seek a renewal of the contract of
the Japanese Arab Oil Company operating in the Kuwaiti-Saudi
mutual zone oil field. The contract, under which the company
extracts 284,000 barrels of crude from the oil field daily, will
expire in two years, oil sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks between the two leaders will also
cover other important regional issues such as the deadlocked
Middle East peace process, security and stability in the Gulf
region.

<HEADLINE> Competition Policy Advisory Group to Be Set Up in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Competition
Policy Advisory Group (COMPAG), chaired by the Financial
Secretary, will be set up here by the end of this year for a
general review of Hong Kong's competition policy.
</P>
<P>
The primary work of the group will be "the issuing of a clear
policy statement sometime next year" on the objectives of
promoting competition and discouraging various forms of
restrictive business practices, Secretary for Trade and Industry
Denise Yue told a press conference today, in response to the
Consumer Council's report on Hong Kong's competition policy.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Competition Policy: The Key to Hong
Kong's Future Economic Success", is the last, and also the most
important, of a series of competition studies the council has
undertaken since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Published in November 1996, the report recommends that a
comprehensive competition policy be adopted; a competition law be
enacted; and a Competition Authority be established to enforce the
law and offer advice on competition policy, and an Appeal Body be
set up to hear appeals against the Authority's decisions.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee's proposal to enact a general
competition law was rejected by the government. "We don't feel
such a law is needed at this point of time," as it may create
uncertainties and compromise Hong Kong's free and open trade
principles, Yue said.
</P>
<P>
The extent of anti-trust legislation does not seem to be
directly proportionate to the competitiveness of the economy, she
added.
</P>
<P>
A majority of local representative bodies covering various
sectors expressed reservation on the introduction of such a law,
as well as the establishment of a Competition Authority and an
Appeal Body, Yue said.
</P>
<P>
On the Consumer Committee's report, over 110 representative
bodies were consulted between December 1996 and March 1997 and 88
responses received.

today held talks on bilateral relations, economic and trade
cooperation and on regional security.
</P>
<P>
Goncz arrived here Sunday on his first formal visit to
Kazakhstan which was scheduled to finish Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Nazarbayev spoke highly of the good relations
between Kazakhstan and Hungary, saying that the two countries
shared wide prospects of economic and trade cooperation,
especially on oil exploitation, processing, production of
medicines and medical instruments and in promoting small and
medium-sized enterprises and in tourism.
</P>
<P>
He regarded the economic reform in Hungary as a kind of
experience for reference by his country.
</P>
<P>
Goncz said the two countries' cooperative potentials had not
been fully utilized and he hoped to promote bilateral cooperation
through this visit.
</P>
<P>
As both countries had met many similar difficulties and
problems in their economic recovery, strengthening bilateral
cooperation was helpful not only for relations between the two
countries and two peoples, but also in finding solutions to their
domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
As for regional security, the two presidents agreed that the
eastern Asian and the central European countries should have
security systems in their own interests to meet the profound
change in world structure.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Hungary established diplomatic relations in 1992
and set up a commission for economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of trade reached 46.8 million U.S. dollars
last year and 24.4 million dollars during the first half of this
year.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Urged to Regulate Currency Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The group of 15 developing
countries (G-15) today urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank to study recent developments in currency
markets to make them more open and transparent.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the grouping expressed
their deep concern over the recent developments in the
international financial and capital markets in a special statement
on the currency turmoil issued today at the end of the opening day
of their seventh summit here.
</P>
<P>
They noted that in recent months, the stability of the
financial system in several countries including members of the
grouping, independent of their strong economic fundamentals and
solid growth, had come under serious pressure arising from
speculative activities against their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the contagious effect had spread to equity markets
in different regions of the world and this amply demonstrated that
no one country could be insulated from the consequences of
turbulence in the financial market, they said in the one-page
statement.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said "Not withstanding the importance of
maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as
appropriate measures to deal with the present situation, we
underscore the importance of strengthening regional and
international cooperation in managing such crises in the future."
</P>
<P>
The G-15 leaders also tasked their finance ministers, central
bank governors and other appropriate authorities to consider the
matter and make necessary recommendations.
</P>
<P>
This is the first multilateral backing for the fight against
currency speculators led by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad who is chairman of the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Indonesia, both G-15 members, are among Southeast
Asian nations that have been seriously hit by the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 now comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Kenya which was accepted as the
grouping's 16th member today.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Shrink in Last Decade: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Trade union membership around
the world dropped sharply during the last decade, the
International Labor Organization (ILO) said today.
</P>
<P>
In 48 of the surveyed 92 countries, union workers accounted for
less than 20 percent of their workforces, the organization said in
its annual report released today.
</P>
<P>
The union membership rate exceeded half of the national
workforce in only 14 of the surveyed countries, the World Labor
Report 1997-98 said.
</P>
<P>
The organization's corrected figure for 1995 showed that
roughly 12.6 percent, or 164 million, of the world's estimated 1.3
billion workforce were trade union members.
</P>
<P>
However, the drop in union membership did not indicate a fall
in unions' influence, ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne said.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the study at a press conference, Hansenne admitted
that the figures signaled a major turning point in industrial
relations worldwide. But he dismissed the notion of a world-wide
decline in trade union power.
</P>
<P>
In most countries, trade unions have managed to consolidate
their strength in key sectors and enlist new members in emerging
sectors, he said. They also developed a new collective bargaining
strategy on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
"Numbers tell only part of the story," Hansenne said. "Where
many observers around the world see only decline, I see increased
democracy, greater pragmatism and freedom for millions of workers
to form representative organizations to engage in collective
bargaining with their employers and to participate in decisions
affecting society and the workplace."
</P>
<P>
In regional terms, the drop in union membership in central and
eastern European countries was the sharpest, where the membership
ratio declined by an average 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
It mainly resulted from the end of a quasi-obligatory union
membership system, which came upon the break-up of the former
Soviet bloc, the report said.
</P>
<P>
National unionization rate was down 71 percent in Estonia, 50
percent in the Czech Republic, 45 percent in Poland, 40 percent in
Slovakia and 38 percent in Hungary, it said.
</P>
<P>
The largest single increase in trade union membership came in
South Africa, which saw unionization leap by 130.8 percent, the
report said. Most of the rise was attributed to the post-apartheid
era.

<HEADLINE> EC Warns About Blockades by Truck Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
warned that the strike-related blockades by French truck drivers
might affect business in the single market.
</P>
<P>
The executive body of the 15-nation European Union (EU) said
the blockades risk disrupting international road transport and
upsetting the efficient operation of the single market.
</P>
<P>
In a joint written statement, commissioners Neil Kinnock,
Padraig Flynn and Mario Monti said: "The commission is very
concerned about the potential impact these blockades will have on
the free movement of goods and people that is the foundation of
the European Single Market.
</P>
<P>
"The knock-on effects will affect business, especially the
small and medium-sized enterprises who depend on regular supplies
and on being able to ensure deliveries to their markets and
customers. When business suffers there is, of course, a negative
impact on employment too."
</P>
<P>
Almost all of France's 300,000 truck drivers are reportedly
involved in the strike launched late Sunday when they failed to
reach an agreement with their employers on increasing payment and
shortening working hours.
</P>
<P>
Road blocks, the number of which has reached 111, are targeted
at refineries and fuel depots to cut off petrol supplies as well
as border crossings and ferry terminals.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty guiding the operation of the single
market, European Union member states have a legal obligation to
ensure efficient functions of the single market and free movement
of goods and people, while the commission has a duty to ensure the
implementation of this obligation.
</P>
<P>
Yet an EU official told the press that the commission had no
right to interfere this time because the right to take strike
action was enshrined in the national labor laws of member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission, according to the same official, is keeping
hourly contacts with the French government over the strike and
blockades.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, the trade union representing truck
drivers in France called for a new round of talks with employers
in a bid to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a few key border crossings to Germany and Italy were
reopened.

<HEADLINE> Russia Interested in Japanese Nuclear Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Nuclear Energy
Ministry is interested in developing cooperation with Japan in
fast reactor technology, the Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Georgy Kaurov, chief of the ministry's public
relations department, as saying that Russia expected Japan to
invest in the construction of a Russian energy unit with a BN-800
fast reactor in exchange for Russian technologies in the same area.
</P>
<P>
Kaurov said Russia is interested not only in constructing a new
energy unit at Beloyar nuclear power station, but also in a
project involving a South-Urals station.
</P>
<P>
"Fast reactors are the future of the Japanese energy sector,"
he said. However, Japan had not succeeded in creating such
reactors.
</P>
<P>
"They have problems involving safety aspects, while the safety
of the fast reactors existing in Russia has been proven," the
energy official said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that getting access to the Japanese internal
market of nuclear fuel is of critical importance for Russia.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Dismisses Reports on Cross-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Defense Ministry
today dismissed press reports that there was an exchange of
fire Sunday night across the demarcation line between Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
"There was no exchange of gunfire. Shots were heard about
500 meters within the Turkish-occupied area," a Defense Ministry
official said in a statement to Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The press reports, quoting a Turkish military official, have
said that there was an exchange of fire between troops in the
area of Ayios Kassianos, on the eastern part of the walled
city of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
They claimed the incident occurred when a Greek Cypriot
soldier approached an army outpost at the Turkish-controlled
northern part of Cyprus, and a Turkish Cypriot soldier fired
warning shots.
</P>
<P>
"There were no shots either from a National Guard (Greek
Cypriot armed forces) or a Turkish occupation army outpost," the
Defense Ministry official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the United Nations Peace-Keeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) said today that the U.N. was
investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP spokesman Waldemar Rokoszewski said that a number of
shots were heard around 20:00 GMT Sunday night in the area of
Ayios Kassianos, in the old part of the Capital Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"We are in touch with military and police authorities on
both sides in order to find out what really happened," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over 37 percent of the island in the
wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A 1,200-strong UNFICYP patrols a 180-kilometer long buffer
zone across the divided island.

<HEADLINE> Link Shown Between El Nino, Global Warming: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists have
uncovered a link between global warming and the increasing
frequency of the El Nino weather system, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Four Corners TV program claimed scientific data were
showing that a man-made permanent drought was in the offing as a
result of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Steve Wilson, a scientist of the climate modeling program at
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), Australia's top national scientific research body,
explained that a sophisticated computer model set up at the CSIRO
laboratories showed a relationship between sea surface temperature
anomalies and the warm El Nino phase.
</P>
<P>
When the present levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide
were doubled in the experiment, the number of El Ninos affecting
Australia nearly doubled too, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Barry Hunt, leader of the research project, told the program he
wanted more time to verify the model's findings.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to do a more elaborate and longer experiment but as
far as I know, we are the only group who actually found the change
in the frequency of El Nino events," Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
The program said experiments on the relationship between
increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at
the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian
claims.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that we have a very good case for suggesting that
the El Ninos are going to become more frequent ... and more
intense and, in a few years or a decade, so we'll go into a
permanent El Nino," Mauna Loa Director Russell Schneider told the
program.
</P>
<P>
Hunt said climate warming's affect on El Nino was complex, even
showing that a gradual increase in carbon dioxide output would
make the Australian continent drier, while, if the output were
doubled, the effect would actually make Australia wetter.
</P>
<P>
The model's scenario showed Australia getting drier for about
100 years at which time it would become wetter than it currently
is.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Climate Convention will be held in Japan
next month and Australia has argued against binding uniform
targets, preferring the concept of differentiation which would
consider the varying economic circumstances of developed
countries.

<P>
WELLINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jim Bolger announced last night that he will step down at the end
of the month as prime minister, Radio NZ reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Minister of State-owned Enterprises Jenny
Shipley told him that she had enough support from the National
Party MPs to challenge his leadership at the National Caucus
meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said he will step down after attending the APEC meeting
in Vancouver and paying a visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Bolger's resignation is likely to further strain relations
between the National Party and the NZ First party within the
coalition government. At present, Bolger gets on quite well with
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters from NZ First. But NZ First
thinks Shipley is no friend to the party.

<P>
YAOUNDE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The newly sworn-in President
of the Republic of Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso named a 33-member
government today in the capital Brazzaville, according to a
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Martin Mberi, one of the leading former allies of ousted
President Pascal Lissouba who split with him over the four-month
civil war against Sassou, was the new transport minister.
</P>
<P>
Sassou has said he will collaborate with all those who disavow
Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Sassou did not appoint a prime minister,
having proclaimed a transitional constitution with executive
power vested in the president.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kaya, a leading Roman catholic from Madingou in
Lissouba's southern heartland, was on the top of the list. Kaya
took the new economic post of minister of state for company
programming, privatisation and promotion.
</P>
<P>
Sassou's cousin Pierra Oba who was a policeman by training and
former director of his presidential security guard took the
interior and security portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Rodolphe Adada, a mathematician from the north took the
foreign affairs portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Mberi was decentralization and communication minister in the
Lissouba government headed by David Charles Ganao that was
appointed in 1996. He was very close to Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
Sassou who ruled the oil-producing state from 1979 won the war
on October 15 with the help of troops from Angola. He was
imaugurated as President on October 25.
</P>
<P>
Lissouba who became the central African country's first
democratically-elected President in 1992, has fled to Burkina
Faso.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Lissouba is going to visit Washington from
November 3 through 7 to seek support for the restoration of
democracy and free elections, a spokesman for Lissouba said on
Sunday.

<P>
LISBON, Portugal, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Sporting Lisbon coach
Octavio Machado quit late Sunday before a crucial European
Champions Cup game.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Machado became involved in an angry
verbal exchange with the media outside the club's stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Francisco Vital will take over the team for
Wednesday's Group F game, the club board said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Machado, team coach for almost two years, decided to quit after
Sporting's 1-1 draw against lowly Varzim in the Portuguese first
division Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Machado, who declined to comment on his resignation, was
heavily criticized by fans and the press for adopting an overly
defensive approach in his side's 2-0 home defeat against
Leverkusen 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The result left Lisbon in third place in the group after three
games, two points away from joint leaders Monaco and Leverkusen.
</P>
<P>
In the national championship, Sporting ranks fourth after eight
games, five points behind leader FC Porto on a 4-3-1 record.
</P>
<P>
Machado became irritated with the questioning and on Sunday
rebuked a group of journalists at the club's Alvalade stadium.
</P>
<P>
Several reporters said Machado grabbed one journalist by the
nose and threatened to punch him.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Three Gorges Reservoir Operational in Long Run (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Reservoir will replace ancient Yunmeng and Dongting lakes,
both prone to siltation, to store and manage the release of flood
waters of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
According to mathematical calculations by silt experts, the
reservoir should be able to accommodate 86 percent of anti-flood
storage and 92 percent of adjustable storage after 100 years of
operation. The calculations were based on no more reservoirs being
built on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the
worst-possible silting conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, a group of large reservoirs on the upper reaches on
the Yangtze River are on the agenda for construction before the
2030. Taking into account anti-silt measures in these reservoirs,
the silt deposited in the bottom of the reservoirs after one
century is equivalent to the amount piled up in four decades
without any measures being taken in the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the reservoir's long operational period is
based on a method of "draining the muddy water while reserving the
clear water."
</P>
<P>
Generally, most floods and sediment pour into the reservoir in
the main flood season between July and September. The reservoir
will drain muddy water that carries huge amount of sand and gravel
in the flood season and save clear water in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
As a typical gorge reservoir, most silt deposits come from the
water rather than soil eroded from the shore. Also, the annual
runoff and flood peak discharge on the Yangtze at peak seasons are
much larger than the Yellow River, China's second longest, which
has serious soil erosion. The Yangtze usually carries much less
silt than the Yellow river.
</P>
<P>
All conditions appear to be beneficial for the Three Gorgers
Reservoir's ability to drain huge amounts of muddy water in flood
season while keeping sufficient storage for the dry season.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Downplays Simitis-Yilmaz Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CRETE, Greece, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos, following earlier Greek minimizing of the
forthcoming meeting between Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and his Turkish counterpart, Mesut Yilmaz, today downplayed the
event.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told a news briefing here it was difficult to predict
the outcome of the Simitis-Yilmaz talks, which will focus on
relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers are expected to hold face-to-face talks
this evening aimed at defusing the tensions bothering the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Simitis-Yilmaz meeting is thought to be the most important
of the bilateral contacts during the two-day Balkan Summit here.
</P>
<P>
However, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas earlier
said Athens did not expect a major breakthrough in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Before the Balkan summit, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ismet
Sezgin said in Ankara that "friendship would not emerge only
through visits". The two countries should improve their ties
through various channels.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Athens was responsible for the tension in the
Aegean and Cyprus, and: "Turkey will not be provoked."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both member states of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), have experienced increased tension
because of their frequent exercises in the Aegean, and the Cyprus'
missile plan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish F-16 and F-4 jets flew over the Athens flight
information region just a few hours before the start of the Balkan
summit, according to Greek media reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said a number of Turkish warships arrived in
the ports of northern Cyprus Sunday for the coming "Toros '97"
maneuvers in participation with Turkish Cypriot troops.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Greece and Turkey has caused grave concern
among Balkan countries, which urge the two neighbors to exercise
restraint.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial
city has vowed to be on the cutting edge of international
competition surrounding information, biotechnology, financial and
high-technology sectors by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the city invited 160 entrepreneurs from 13
countries to form a "think tank" for its mayor and other local
policymakers.
</P>
<P>
All of the advisers who suggested ways to develop Shanghai's
economy and urban construction are senior managers and chairmen of
27 big-name corporations such as Citibank, General Motors and
Nortel Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Learning from experience of big cities overseas, Shanghai must
map out a sustainable development plan at the dawn of a new
century," Mayor Xu Kuangdi said at the ninth International
Entrepreneurs' Counseling Meeting for Shanghai's Mayor which
closed today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with the theme "Shanghai: Facing the 21st Century,"
discussed how global economic development will affect Shanghai and
the future of the city's pillar industries such as automotives,
telecommunications and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the annual meeting won the approval of the State
Council, China's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
Xu said next year's meeting will focus on preventing financial
risks.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Opposition Leaders Sign Alliance Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's two main opposition
parties, the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and the
United Liberal Democrats (ULD), on Monday officially confirmed
NCNP's leader Kim Dae-jung as their joint candidate for the
December presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony held at the parliamentary hall in downtown Seoul,
Kim Dae-jung and ULD leader Kim Jong-pil signed an agreement on
fielding Kim Dae-jung as the single presidential candidate between
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the accord concluded months of negotiations
between the NCNP and the ULD on the joint candidacy, and on
power-sharing after an election win.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the ULD leader will assume the post of a
strengthened premiership in the coalition government, in return
for the withdrawal from his presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to make efforts to introduce a parliamentary
government system by early 2000, for which Kim Dae-jung said he
would cut short his five-year presidential term and revise the
Constitution by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to expand the opposition alliance, the two
Kims plan to contact influential politicians from both the ruling
and other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rivals of Kim Dae-jung denounced the alliance as an
under-the-table political deal aimed only at seizing power.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hoi-chang, presidential candidate of the ruling New Korea
Party (NKP), accused the two Kims of destroying democracy and
perpetuating old-fashioned politics.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary system would only help the collusive
relations between politicians and businessmen, which would lead to
political turmoil, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The New Party by the People (NPP), a new political group led by
former Kyonggi Provincial Governor Rhee In-je, which was to be
officially inaugurated tomorrow, criticized the alliance for
betraying the people's mandate.
</P>
<P>
"The NCNP and ULD will face national protests because they
infringed upon the voters' sacred rights," said an NNP spokesman.
He accused them of pushing for a constitutional revision for a
parliamentary government system without seeking the people's
approval.
</P>
<P>
With ULD leader's withdrawal from the race and the low
popularity of another presidential candidate, Cho Soon, the
December presidential election is likely to be a tri-partite
competition among the opposition's Kim, former governor Rhee In-je
and the ruling party's Lee Hoi-chang, political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls have shown that the opposition leader maintains
the lead, trailed by Rhee in second place and ruling party's Lee
in third place, with a gap of 10 percentage points each.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- It was 9:00
p.m. today at the construction site of the Three Gorges Project,
the world's largest hydro-power project.
</P>
<P>
A mile-long line of lights along the banks of the Yangtze
River, like two paralleled strings of dotted pearls suspended
in mid air, sparkled the night sky.
</P>
<P>
Down on the cofferdam, roaring two-story-tall, self-tipping
trucks heavily loaded with rocks, boulders and gravel, shuttled
back and forth against a backdrop of swift and turbulent waves of
the Yangtze by the construction site.
</P>
<P>
At the north bank of the Yangtze, engineers, technician and
supervisors of the Gezhouba Group Corp. are busy with writing,
collecting and processing data and looking into files at the
brightly-lit Three Gorges Project Headquarters, a group of
container box-turned-offices that were lined in a row.
</P>
<P>
Opposite to these offices, a count-down board indicated that
"There Are Five Days to Go before the River Damming."
</P>
<P>
On both northern and southern ends of cofferdams stand four
huge lighthouses that have been erected to illuminate the
spacious site along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
A huge pile of boulders which, chained up with iron cables and
flanked the 40-meter gap of the cofferdam upstream, will be used
as the first batch of rocks to fill into the water current on
the day of river blocking on November 8. And rapids and swirls
bubbled and rushed downstream.
</P>
<P>
A no-man hydrographic vessel, positioned at the center of the
entrance of the cofferdam gap, floated on the water to record
round-the-clock hydrographical data and transmit them to a nearby
ship via a microwave system.

Meanwhile, the Three Gorges Project Daming Headquarters of the
Gezhouba Group Corp. is based aboard another ship anchored scores
of meters upstream. "Data processing and collection systems are
being installed," said Huang Huaping, deputy chief of the
headquarters. "All preparatory work will have been done before
November 7."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a deluxe vessel of the like size rented by China
Central Television (CCTV), stayed adjacent to the headquarters.
CCTV is expected to televise live the damming process for 14
consecutive hours in the vessel.
</P>
<P>
Searchlights flooded far and wide to light up all roads leading
to the shores. Two-story-tall, 77-tonnage trucks lined up to dump
rocks and gravel along the river bank, so did bulldozers behind.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jin, a bulldozer driver, who had just taken on his night
shift, told reporters that he and his workmates worked
round-the-clock in three shifts. "My shift will last till six
o'clock tomorrow morning," he said, while climbing into the cab of
the roaring bulldozer with a sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
At a slope hundreds of meters from the shore, firework-like
electric arc sparkled into the dark night sky. Workers were busy
fixing a podium for the incoming dignitaries for the solemn and
grand occasion of the river damming.
</P>
<P>
Further off, siren sounded from the vessels bypassing the
diversion channel off the southern bank of the Yangtze, a
"man-made Yangtze" designed to handle the navigation after the
damming.
</P>
<P>
The clock now ticked pass ten o'clock. It will be another busy
night for builders of the Three Gorges Project.

BONN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Golden Four athletics series
in Oslo, Zurich, Brussels and Berlin has ended, a source close to
the organisers said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source said the meeting promoters had agreed unanimously to
end the series to avoid clashing with a planned Super League to be
launched by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
The lucrative Golden Four series, which shared 20 one-kilo gold
bars between the athletes who won their event in all four
meetings, was launched in 1993. The four meetings are part of the
IAAF grand prix circuit.
</P>
<P>
An IAAF spokesman confirmed the plan for a Super League. He
said it was unclear when it would start but added it should be
launched in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier On His Upcoming Japan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng is
expected to discuss the issue of furthering Sino-Japanese friendly
ties and expanding bilateral cooperation during his visit this
month to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li met today with a delegation from the Japan-China Economic
Association (JCEA) led by a senior consultant of the Japan
Federation of Economic Organization (JFEO) Toyota Shoichiro and
JCEA President Watari Sugichiro.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Japanese government, Li is scheduled
to visit Japan Nov. 11-16.
</P>
<P>
Li said the two countries will affirm efforts by China and
Japan to establish long-term, stable and neighborly ties with a
perspective toward the future to attain the goal of Sino-Japanese
friendship for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
This year marked the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties, Li said, and next year will be the
20th anniversary of The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between
China and Japan. He said that Sino-Japanese ties are at the
critical point of inheriting the past and ushering in the future.
</P>
<P>
Since the international situation has changed profoundly and
the polarization trend is developing rapidly, the two neighboring
countries should pursue friendly and mutually beneficial
cooperation, Li said. This policy is not only in the fundamental
interests of the two countries, but also beneficial to the peace
and development in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should properly handle the problems and
differences between them by focusing on the future, increasing
dialogues and exchanges, and removing the obstacles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should expand their common ground and seek common
interests through economic and technological cooperation and by
carrying forward the friendly traditions of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his stay in Japan he will meet with Emperor
Akihito, and hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto. He also will meet Japanese people from all walks
of life, especially business people, to get a complete picture of
Japan's latest economic and technological achievements
</P>
<P>
Economic and technological cooperation is a major component of
bilateral relations, Li said, and a solid foundation has been laid
for the cooperation. At present, there are opportunities for
advancing such cooperation because the two countries are exploring
their economic development strategies for the next century.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the sides will make joint efforts to
open up new ways and new areas of mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said developing long-term stable Sino-Japanese ties is China's
consistent policy.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the Sino-Japanese ties will develop in a
sound and steady manner as long as the two countries strictly
follow the principles of the Sino-Japanese joint communiques and
the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government will, as always, continue
to make remitting efforts for the friendship of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Shoichiro said that this is the 23rd delegation the JCEA has
sent to visit China since it was founded 25 years ago. China's
economic achievement has deeply impressed the delegation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that JFEO and JCEA hope to advance the economic
cooperation with China, and the business community of Japan is
looking forward to Li's upcoming visit.

<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming
blocking of the Yangtze River has resulted in a soaring passenger
flow to Yichang, where the Three Gorges Project is located.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers handled by the city's train station
has climbed about 30 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the Spring Festival, which usually sees a
biggest passenger flow every year, had come ahead of date,"
said an official at the train station.
</P>
<P>
The city's new airport, which opened to traffic last year, has
also seen unprecedented passenger arrivals, as many as 5000 a
week.
</P>
<P>
Road traffic volume is mounting, with hundreds of buses
shuttling between Yichang and Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei
province.
</P>
<P>
Local telecommunications are also enjoying a brisk business
with increasing inquiries for phone numbers of the China Yangtze
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the Gezhouba
Share-holding Group Corporation, and hotels in the city.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing demand for passenger transportation and
telecommunication business, the city has increased the services
for train and air transportation, installed more
program-controlled phone lines and put a satellite ground station
into operation.

MADRID, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Goalkeeper Inigo Arteaga of

Arteaga scored in the 70th minute to put his side in a 2-0

FIFA changed the laws of the game on July 1 that goals straight

DALIAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Female workers in this northeast
China city now receive financial aid from a special social
insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
More than 900,000 female employees, or 95 percent of the city's
total female workers, have been insured over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women receive at least 1,000 yuan each from the
Maternity Insurance Fund.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Dalian city government upgraded its social welfare
system by adopting a regulation which requires local enterprises
to pay 0.8 percent of the workers' monthly salaries to the fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh announced here this evening that he will resign.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit made the announcement to reporters before he meets his
economic ministers this evening at the residence of Chatichai
Choonhavan, chief economic advisor of the government and leader of
the second largest ruling party Chart Pattana party (CPP), to
discuss the current economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said that he had done his best in solving the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he will make a formal announcement
of resignation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit denied any pressure on him to make his
decision to resign, saying his departure will pave the way for
other people to take over the post.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit came to power late last year after winning a general
election on November 17 with his New Aspiration Party (NAP)
securing 125 seats in the lower house, only 2 seats more than the
Democrat Party which captured 123 seats.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's announcement was made at a time when the economic
woes remained unsolved, in particular when the baht continued to
dive, hitting a record low of more than 41 baht against the US
dollar in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government consists of six parties - the
NAP, the CPP, the Social Action Party, the Prachakorn Thai (Thai
Citizen) Party, the Seritham (Liberal Democratic) Party, and the
Muan Chon (Mass) Party.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu-Clinton Summit Set for Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has fixed the meeting with United States
President Bill Clinton during his visit next week, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-Clinton summit was once in doubt because of the
reported Clinton's displeasure with Netanyahu's handling of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which was resumed early last
month after a seven-month freeze thanks to the intensive
U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is due to visit the U.S. from November 16 to address
the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations in the U.S. and
Canada, to be held in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
According the the radio report, Netanyahu will stop over in
London to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair before visiting
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
For the past month, Israeli officials have been scrambling to
arrange the summit between Netanyahu and Clinton, assuring
Washington that real efforts are being made by the Netanyahu-led
government to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to host the
negotiations in the coming days held by Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Palestinian National Authority's deputy head
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) on implementing the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported late last month that Netanyahu was
considering postponing his U.S. trip if Clinton refuses to
receive him, because Clinton's snub would be construed by his
opponents as evidence that he is out of favor in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in June last year, his hardline
policies have taken the peace process into constant crises to the
disappointment of the U.S. administration, which has repeatedly
urged for acceleration of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the latest crisis early this month, in which Netanyahu
refused to stop the building of Jewish settlement in the occupied
territories, Albright rejected answering the phone call from
Netanyahu as an expression of discontent over the Israeli
leader's uncompromising stand.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Implement Agreements With PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today urged Israel to
implement the signed agreements in its talks with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador in the United States Ahmed Maher said that
to achieve success in the new round of talks and progress in the
stalled Mideast peace process hinge on the attitude of Israel in
Washington talks, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA President Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy are expected to open their
second round of high-level talks in Washington today after
seven-month standoff.
</P>
<P>
Maher referred to the importance of an Israeli commitment to
the Oslo agreements, completion of redeployment of Israeli troops
in the West Bank and a halt to settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should seek effecting a headway to prove good
intentions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called upon the U.S. to take actions to prove its
seriousness in this connection.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recently that
Israel will hand over no more land to the PNA and proposed to move
straight to final status talks that will tackle the most thorny
issues like the future of settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand Israel to implement the long-delayed
redeployment of Israeli troops in the rural areas of the West Bank
and stop settlement construction.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Surges on Asian Market Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar staged a
comeback today, surging more than one US cent following gains in
some Asian stock markets and the release of strong retail sales
data.
</P>
<P>
The currency drifted off slightly in late trading but still
closed three-quarters of a US cent higher at 71.20 US cents, from
70.43 US cents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local unit had benefited from stronger Asian
equity markets which were lifted by the announcement of a 38.00
billion international monetary fund-sponsored assistance package
for Indonesia at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Asian markets also received a helping hand from buying by
Bank Indonesia, the Bank of Japan and the Monetary Authority of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"There was a big move in the Australian dollar this afternoon
and that had a lot to do with Asian currencies," head of foreign
exchange sales at ANZ John Reedyk said.
</P>
<P>
Helping the Australian dollar to close above 71.00 US cents for
the first time in almost two weeks was the release of retail sales
figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the data suggested an overall improvement in
household confidence and reduced the likelihood of another rate
cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia any time soon.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales turnover in seasonally adjusted constant price
terms rose 3.1 percent in the three months to September to 27.9
billion Australian dollars, from 27.1 billion previously.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.43 yen, up from 84.79 against
yen, and at 1.2351 from 1.2119 against mark.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line Gets State Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A committee, composed of
government departments, the Railway Ministry, and provincial and
city officials, today approved the Beijing-Kowloon (Jingjiu)
railway line, a major north-south artery in China, after a
five-day study.
</P>
<P>
The railway was built rapidly, investment was used
effectively, and attention was paid to the land and environment
along the railway, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Work on the 2,400-km-plus railway line began in 1993. In
November of 1995, the track-laying was completed. The project cost
about 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the railway line was an important Party and
State Council decision and will expand the country's railway
network, remove transport bottlenecks, help economic growth along
the line, alleviate poverty in old revolutionary bases along the
line, increase economic exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao, and
push the opening-up drive, according to Ye Qing, vice-minister of
the State Planning Commission and director of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Hua Maokun, a Ministry of Railways engineer, said that the
railway passed the tests of adverse weather and flooding, ensuring
transport safety and generating profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
ended stronger today as investors bought up higher yielding stocks
and the market took on a positive overtone.
</P>
<P>
Some bargain-hunting from offshore and local institutions also
lifted the market after a choppy morning as the local bourse
grappled with nerves over volatility in Asian markets and Wall
Street's stronger close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Scott Emms said some sectors of
the market were also attempting to factor in a rate cut ahead of
tomorrow's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting.
</P>
<P>
Banks and some other industrials drove the market upward with
the all ordinaries index closing up 39.0 points at 2503.8.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about interest rates came amid data which suggested
an overall improvement in household confidence and reduced the
likelihood of another rate cut by the RBA. The RBA is due to hold
its monthly meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
The banking index finished 140.1 points up at 5171.9 with
Commonwealth Bank rising 80 cents to 17.15 Australian dollars.
National Australia Bank lifted 54.3 cents, ANZ was 18 cents
stronger and Westpac increased 27 cents to 8.55 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 246.27 million shares traded worth 746.62
million Australian dollars (530.1 million US dollars), with rises
of 593 outnumbering falls of 518.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was 76.5 points stronger at 4199.2,
while the all resources index was up 8.1 points at 1160.8.
</P>
<P>
The gold index dropped 3.1 points to 1071.8 after the price of
the precious metal fell to 310.20 US dollars an ounce from 315.15
late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Calls for Reforms in Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji has urged reforming troubled state enterprises in the
textile industry.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting this largest manufacturing center in China,
Zhu said the textile industry long has been burdened by
larger-than-needed production capacities, outdated technology and
surplus workers. The whole sector is heavily in debt and workers
have difficulty making ends meet, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said it was high time to phase out the 10 million outdated
spindles in the industry.
</P>
<P>
"By getting rid of the backward spindles, we can not only trim
the industry back to a proper size, but also promote mergers and
asset reorganizations of our textile factories," Zhu told local
officials.
</P>
<P>
On properly arranging redundant workers, the leader said, "we
must promptly institute and improve a social insurance system,
while taking necessary administrative and economic means."
</P>
<P>
"If we can successfully achieve our goal of revitalizing the
textile industry, we can say we found the key to helping state
enterprises in all other industries out of difficulty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against rushing and said the goal should be
attained step-by-step with the phase-out completed by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our goal is to introduce a modern enterprise system
in most state-owned major enterprises in the year 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
This goal is attainable because the macro-environment for
economic and social development has improved substantially, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohsen Aminzadeh will go to Tokyo in mid-November for political
consultation with Japanese government officials, local daily Iran
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Issues of the Mideast peace process, security and stability in
the Persian Gulf and bilateral relations are expected to top the
agenda of the consultation due to start on November 17, the daily
quoted an unnamed informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the dialogue is a move for confidence-
building between the two countries, which started their annual
political consultation since September, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressures exerted by the United States on its
allies to stop cooperation with Iran, Japan still goes ahead with
the dialogue, contending that exchanges of view between Japan and
Iran are necessary for the peace and stability in the Middle East
and the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The United States, accusing Iran of supporting terrorism and
seeking mass destructive weapons, imposed economic sanctions on it
since June, 1995 and threatened to punish foreign companies which
have invested 20 million U.S. dollars in its oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
Oil-thirsty Japan, however, disagrees with the U.S.. At present
more than 30 major Japanese companies are active in Iran's oil and
gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Iran is Japan's third largest oil supplier during 1995-1996.
Their trade volume in 1996 reached 4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Restructure Hospital Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
restructure hospital management to end misapplication of funds
and reduce the debt that has almost crippled operations, Health
Minister Katele Kalumba has announced.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted him as saying in Kitwe in
northern Zambia on Sunday that short term political measures and
the lack of competent management have contributed to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
He accused the hospital managers of having failed to take
measures to adjust their expenditure to the prevailing financial
reality.
</P>
<P>
Major hospitals have continued to perform functions of primary
health care which are supposed to be handled by health centers
and clinics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister charged that the current way of spending money is
not cost effective and hospitals are providing less than 50
percent of their expected type of service as third-level
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident to the Ministry of Health that managers have in
general failed to take the required managerial action to adjust
to the present financial reality. This has resulted in huge debt
burdens building up in the hospital sub-sector," Kalumba said.
</P>
<P>
Major hospitals like Ndola Central and University Teaching
Hospital (debts) have huge debts and strong action is needed to
spare them from bankruptcy, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Ndola Hospital debt was by December 1996 a full 100 percent
of its total annual grant, UTH debt burden was 85 percent, Kitwe
Central 65 percent. Eight out of 14 government hospitals have a
debt burden of above 40 percent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals have coped with the decrease in funding by
buying on credit, delaying maintenance and postponing
replacements and investments, Kalumba said.
</P>
<P>
The government will embark on training managers in management
skills as well as employing people who already have the skills,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Capacity lacks in reforming systems in hospital management.
We have excellent medical clinicians but poor managers.
Managerial reforms are a must with the potential for accredited
legislation," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The system of funding will be changed from the current one
which is based on the number of beds to one which is based on the
activities or services the hospital provided, according to
Kalumba.
</P>
<P>
He said political action is also required to win support and
overcome resistance among national interests and donors.
</P>
<P>
"Most donors in the past shunned involvement in the hospitals
sub-sector. This stance was changed in negotiations concluded at
the end of last month," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's First Aluminum Plant to Be Commissioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's first aluminum plant,
the Aluminum Smelter Company, will be commissioned by the head of
state, General Sani Abacha in December or January next year, the
Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Bashir Dalhatu, Minister of Power and Steel, announced
this Friday while inspecting the facility in Ikot Abasi,
Akwa-Ibom State.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the completion of the project was
significant to Nigeria's industrial and technological
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the project has a capacity to produce
193,000 tons of aluminum billets and ingots per year, which is
about two percent of the world total production.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the production, the minister said, would be
exported to the United States, while the rest 20 percent will be
locally consumed.
</P>
<P>
Dalhatu explained that the 20 percent represented the current
size of the market for imported aluminum used in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Another major benefit of the project, he said, is the
utilization of more than 33.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas
per year. Promoting the use of its huge reserve of natural gas is
a major industry policy of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The project will generate more than 15,000 jobs, and will
boost the production of raw materials such as bauxite, petroleum
coke and pitch, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The aluminum plant is jointly owned by the federal government
of Nigeria (70 percent), Ferrostaal A.G. (20 percent), a German
company who built the plant, and the Reynolds International
Corporation of the U.S. (10 percent), who provided the
technology.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project was started in 1990 and cost about
four billion Deutsche Mark.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire Bid for Ghana Gas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire have
come under competition to enter the lucrative gas market in
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is to build a gas-fired fuel station which will be
utilizing large volume of gas, estimated at 80 million standard
cubic meters per day.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian major oil producing company, Chevron Nigeria Ltd.,
is competing with an Ivory Coast company to win the big contract.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that Nigerian gas goes to Ghana. It is a
unique opportunity for Nigeria to have a win-win situation in the
deal," said Chevron Managing Director George Kirkland, quoted by
local press today.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose how the competition was going on but said
if Nigeria succeeded, the commodity would mainly be sourced from
the Escravos Gas Project (EGP) and transported through the West
African Gas Pipeline.
</P>
<P>
EGP, involving a total investment of some 550 million U.S.
dollars, is the first major associated gas project in Nigeria
targeted at utilizing the rich natural gas that has been flaring
at the country's oil fields.
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to be commissioned by the head of state
General Sani Abacha the coming Wednesday, will process 185
million standard cubic feet of gas per day, while producing over
8,000 barrels of liquefied gas for export.
</P>
<P>
The West African Gas Pipeline project involves the laying of
gas pipeline from Nigeria through Togo and Benin to Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Coup Leader's Family Evicted From Military House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Another coup plotter's family
was evicted from an army home here at the weekend, Daily Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Captain Jack Chiti's wife told the local newspaper that an
army truck with eight army officers came to their home in Roma
Township Friday afternoon while she went to police headquarters
to take some food to her husband.
</P>
<P>
She said there was no notice from the army about the eviction
and it caught them unawares.
</P>
<P>
"I returned home in the evening, only to find that my home was
empty. We do not have a permanent home so we just squat with our
relatives," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the security men have however not harassed her as she
tried to see her husband who she said is being held at police
headquarters although she was not allowed to see him.
</P>
<P>
On the coup attempt, she said the family received the news
with shock when it was discovered that her husband was part of
the group involved in the foiled coup.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the days prior to the "dark" Tuesday, her
husband had been on night duties for seven days.
</P>
<P>
She said Chiti who is a teacher at Arakan Barracks had never
behaved in a peculiar manner because he was of sober character
and very cool person.
</P>
<P>
She said there was a possibility that he could have been
forced into the plot because he had never discussed it with her.
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine what difficulty I am going through as a wife
to one of the men who are alleged to be behind the attempted
coup. Look at the impact it has had on the children. I tell you
this is just like a funeral, may be even worse," she complained.
</P>
<P>
Coup leader Captain Stephen Lungu Alias' family were also
evicted from their Buffalo village home here.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday morning, a military coup was staged in the
capital Lusaka by some army soldiers in an attempt to topple the
elected government led by Presidnet Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The coup was quickly foiled by government forces and most of
the coupists including coup leaders Captain Steven Lungu Alias,
Captain Solo and Captain Jack Chiti have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Says He Will Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh announced here this evening that he will resign.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit made the announcement to reporters before he meets his
economic ministers this evening at the residence of Chatichai
Choonhavan, chief economic advisor of the government and leader of
the second largest ruling party Chart Pattana party (CPP), to
discuss the current economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said that he had done his best in solving with the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he will make a formal announcement
of resignation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit denied any pressure on him to make his
decision to resign, saying his departure will pave the way for
other people to take over the post.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit came to power late last year after winning a general
election on November 17 with his New Aspiration Party (NAP)
securing 125 seats in the lower house, only 2 seats more than the
Democrat Party which captured 123 seats.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's announcement was made at a time when the economic
woes remained unsolved, in particular when the baht continued to
dive, hitting a record low of more than 41 baht against the US
dollar in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government consists of six parties - the
NAP, the CPP, the Social Action Party, the Prachakorn Thai (Thai
Citizen) Party, the Seritham (Liberal Democratic) Party, and the
Muan Chon (Mass) Party.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: G-15 Calls for Regulated Currency Trading, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The seventh summit of the
Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries opened here today with a
call for regulated currency trading and fair rules in global trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day summit, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, as expected, took up the currency trading issue and fair
global trade in his opening speech and described the present
system as unethical and unfair.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori and Indian Vice-President Krishan Kant, representing
Africa, Latin America and Asia respectively, also addressed the
two issues at the opening.
</P>
<P>
"The deliberate devaluation of the currency of a country by
currency traders purely for profit is a serious denial of the
rights of independent nations," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, regarded as the most vocal advocate for currency
trading to be regulated, said that a world trading system could
not rely entirely on market forces and it was time that fair rules
be established.
</P>
<P>
He said if globalization was to be accepted, there must be a
fair system of trading, be it in goods and services, shares or
currency.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Indonesia, both G-15 members, and other Southeast
Asian countries have suffered heavily from the recent currency
manipulation and speculation.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Asia, Kant said the currency turmoil which hit
Southeast Asia had highlighted the need for developing countries
to insulate themselves from the whims of market sentiment and
exchange rate fluctuations in major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader said given the importance of private capital
flows for development and the growing integration of developing
countries in international financial markets, the currency
volatility called for a new approach to regional and international
cooperation for their management.
</P>
<P>
"G-15 could work to evolve suitable strategies and consult with
each other," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Latin American members, Fujimori said
there was a need for an international mechanism to efficiently
deal with the problem of monetary instability.
</P>
<P>
He said the turmoil that has swept the financial and stock
markets recently had shown the growing interdependence of the
world's economy.
</P>
<P>
On trade globalization, Mahathir said: "While we should accept
the removal of barriers to trade between nations, we should also
strive for order in the conduct of trade and commerce for the
whole world."
</P>
<P>
He drew the attention of member countries to the disturbing
trends that had emerged since the last World Trade Organization
(WTO) ministerial meeting in Singapore which could be detrimental
to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
He also urged South countries not to be complacent and look to
a new horizon by venturing into non-traditional markets and forge
multi-faceted partnerships among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe echoed the need to intensify South-South cooperation and
warned that Africa, which has 33 of the world's 48 least developed
countries, faced a real danger of being marginalized in the
globalization and trade liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
He said: "For most of the developing countries, the gains of
globalization and trade liberalization are yet to be felt."
</P>
<P>
Kant said future North-South contacts must reflect the credit
developing countries had earned by "telescoping structural
adjustments and liberalization within a truly historic time frame
and proportions."
</P>
<P>
"The developed countries must themselves set an example of
genuine liberalization particularly in sectors of export interest
to developing countries such as in textiles, agriculture, steel,
electronics and information services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori also stressed the need to revitalize North-South
dialogue so that it could take into account the requirements of
developing countries and enable countries in the South to response
to the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said the priority for the developing nations was to
gain more market access in the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
"We must increase deeper international cooperation as it is
important for the prosperity for our countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, which comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, today accepted Kenya as its 16th
member.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also being attended by President Suharto of
Indonesia, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Algerian President
Liamine Zeroual, Argentine Vice-President Carlos Ruckauf and
Jamaican deputy prime minister Seymour Mullings.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 leaders later went into their closed session.

<HEADLINE> Industry Sales Increase in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Industry sales during the first
seven months of the year in the Philippines increased 12 percent
to 240.9 billion pesos (6.88 billion US dollars) from last year's
214.5 billion pesos (6.13 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A survey made by the Department of Trade and Industry showed
today that 12 of the 21 industrial sectors posted positive with
sales value growth ranging from 3 to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food processing was the highest earner during the seven-month
period with sales reaching 52.3 billion pesos (1.49 billion
dollars), as compared to its 1996 figure of 48.2 billion pesos
(1.38 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Electronics, which registered the highest growth rate of 38
percent, followed with sales amounting to 42.1 billion pesos (1.2
billion dollars) from the 30.6 billion pesos (874 million dollars)
recorded during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey traced the increase in sales to the global demand
for electronic products and the depreciation of the peso from
26.19 pesos to a US dollar in July 1996 to 27.67 pesos to a dollar
in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser during the period is still the sugar sector,
whose sales plummeted further by 33 percent from 509.6 million
pesos (14.56 million dollars) during the first seven months last
year to 343.8 million pesos (9.82 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Most big losers were packaging materials and pulp and paper,
which both dropped by 15 percent to 2.3 billion pesos (65.7
million dollars) and 3.8 billion pesos (108.6 million dollars),
respectively.

<HEADLINE> s d s 1516 China-Three Gorges-Dam Site Busy and Quiet Dam Site Seen Before Blocking of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- Although the
final blocking of the Yangtze River is drawing near, not too many
workers are in sight at the Three Gorges Project (TGP) site,
compared with crowds of workers seen at the construction site of
the Gezhouba Power Plant a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This best demonstrated the power of modern technologies," said
He Gong, deputy general manager of the project developer China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Power Plant is expected to generate 84.7
billion kilowatt-hour of electricity a year, almost 6.5 times that
of the Gezhouba Power Plant, but the manpower for construction of
Three Gorges Project was less than one seventh of that for
Gezhouba, said He Gong.
</P>
<P>
With lines of imported graders, bulldozers, and self-dumping
trucks shuttling back and forth at the project site, people can
easily feel the atmosphere that the damming of the Yangtze is
already imminent.
</P>
<P>
"Comparing with the noisy and crowdy site when building the
Gezhouba Power Plant, the Three Gorges Project site is quieter but
even more spectacular due to its unparalleled amount of
construction work," said Zhang Junfang, deputy chief of the
project headquarters, Gezhouba Group.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are fully prepared to take the final challenge,
and are working day and night to ensure the smooth damming of the
Yangtze River," said Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Facing Dangerous Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Health and environmental
experts have warned that the Iranian capital of Tehran was facing
"extremely dangerous air pollution" as winter is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported today that many
physicians, environmentalists and residents in Tehran urged the
government to take it more serious than before the air pollution
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts said that due to its natural and
geographical location, Tehran faces the phenomena of inversion
and the accumulation of various pollutants in the air for 240
days every year.
</P>
<P>
This is extremely dangerous for a city with a large
population and movement of people and goods throughout the day
and night, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Lying in an area of 600 square kilometers between the
southern slopes of the Alborz Mountain range and the northern
fringes of the central Iranian desert, Tehran has a resident
population of 7 million and a floating population of 3 million.
</P>
<P>
With the concentration of social, political and economic
activities in Tehran for the past 207 years, Tehran's air
pollution has reached intricately dangerous proportions.
</P>
<P>
Accumulation of more than the permitted levels of pollution
from sources such as factories, heating devices, motorized
vehicles, dilapidated vehicles and improper fuel consumption by
these vehicles have made the conditions rife for the increasing
pollution on most of the days during fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that at present there are 23,358 taxis, 4,260
buses, 4,643 minibuses, 700,000 private cars, about 53,000
private cars working as taxis, 350,000 motor cycles and over
19,000 various kinds of diesel-fueled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The movement of all these motorized vehicles, has resulted in
the annual release of 1,280,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide, 17,500
tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 21,000 tonnes of suspended particles,
105,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxides, over 2,000 tonnes of lead and
115,000 tonnes of various kinds of hydrocarbons into Tehran's
air.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that the rising high level of lead and
pollutants like carbon dioxide would leave bad and abnormal
effects on the nervous system of the humans, the children in
particular.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent physical and mental damages in the
community, experts hold that the use of natural gas instead of
fossil fuels will not only considerably reduce air pollution and
produce cleaner air but will also save the country billions of
U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
They believe that transforming the fuel of most vehicles to
natural gas can play a very valuable role in reducing pollution
in Tehran because in comparison to fossil fuels, natural gas
burns almost without any fume.
</P>
<P>
The serious air pollution in the capital has caused great
concern of the Iranian government and the Tehran municipality
has started a project of transforming fuel of buses and taxis to
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
However, with an increasing population caused by immigration
from countryside and lacking enough budget, it is difficult for
the local government to take effective measures to control air
pollution in the capital.

MACAO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The mortality rate in Macao
dropped from 5.2 percent in 1976 to 3.3 percent in 1996, official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Macao Public Health Department said
the general health conditions in Macao have improved remarkably
during the 1976-96 period.
</P>

The death rate of infants also dropped from 12.6 per thousand
in 1985 to 4.7 per thousand in 1996. That was much lower than most
neighboring regions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the life expectancy of local residents reached 79
years in 1995, with men at 77.5 and women 81.2. The report said
the figure was much higher than in the Philippines, China's

The leading killer diseases in Macao include cardio- and
cerebro- vascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases,

alcohol, high pressure, sitting too long and poisoning from
cigarette smoking, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The import of tobacco, the report said, surged from 707 tons in

The 5,500-hectare sea reserve is expected to protect the
dolphins. High-speed motorboats that are used for entertainment
and water-skiing have been banned in the area.

The Chinese white dolphin is under top State-level protection
because it is on the verge of extinction. They can be found at
Xiamen and the mouth of the Pearl River to the south of here.

<P>
The number of Chinese white dolphins has declined sharply
because of landfill in the sea, marine pollution, and illegal
fishing by electric devices and explosives.

<P>
Xiamen also has a local law that protects the dolphin.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Assembly of Egypt's General Syndicate for Banks and
Insurances affirmed Sunday its stand against normalization with
Israeli trade unions except after advancing a fair and just peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It also denounced the embargo imposed on Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Arab media highlighted Sunday the statements of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Abu Dhabi on the Doha economic summit,
which he saw without meaning.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt's decision on attending the conference
relied on any tangible progress in the Mideast peace process,
halting settlements and redeployment from the West Bank by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt and Bahrain were working together to establish a
developed economic system that could boost up their cooperation,
Egyptian Minister of Finance Mohieddin Al Gharib said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the leaderships' eagerness of the two countries
to enhance economic and trade ties, saying that Egypt was keen on
implementing bilateral cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt should take advantage of what had been achieved in
economic reforms and building infrastructure in recent years, said

<HEADLINE> French Truck Drivers Block Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- French lorry drivers had set up
77 barriers, including six blockades, by this morning on the
highways and major traffic axis across the country as a result of
another fierce confrontation with their employers over pay
disputes.
</P>
<P>
In their strike last November, lorry drivers paralyzed the
country for 12 days and in the end forced the government to
compromise on almost all of their demands, including early
retirement at 55.
</P>
<P>
Many barriers were set up at French borders with its neighbors
-- Spain, Britain and Germany, while some fuel supply centers were
blocked this morning in Toulouse, Pays de Loire in western France
and Savoie in eastern France near the Swiss border.
</P>
<P>
However, the strikers are only blocking "targeted" transport
and have so far let ordinary travelers go as usual.
</P>
<P>
Police intervened Sunday night and this morning at two
blockades in Biriatou on the French-Spanish border and in
Strasbourg near the French-German border, with no violence
reported.
</P>
<P>
Police in Strasbourg tried to de-block the Bridge of Europe
linking France with Germany at the Rhine River and a refinery
providing oil to the region.
</P>
<P>
The strike came when the truck company owners rejected a
tentative accord on salary issues, prompting drivers' unions to
try to cut off the country's fuel supply and clog its highways.
</P>
<P>
The lorry drivers, belonging to several unions including the
Force Ouvriere (FO), Confederation Francaise Des Travailleurs
(CFDT) and Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT), are requesting
a 20 percent pay rise between now and the year 2,000 and an
immediate increase of 4-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Jean-Clause Gayssot said Sunday that the
government will do its best to control the situation from
developing further.
</P>
<P>
Gayssot promised to reduce tax on trucking industry and give
more autonomy to the trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Asia's urban water supply
situation is improving, but the region's unaccounted water --
water lost through leaks or illegal connections remains unchanged
at 35 percent since 1993, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in
a data book launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The data book, the second published by ADB since 1993, analyzes
mainly the 1995 data from 50 water utilities in 31 of its member
economies.
</P>
<P>
During the period between 1991 and 1995, the book says, piped
water coverage in the utilities studied increased from 75 percent
to 79 percent while production rose 14 percent and connections 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
It says that better demand management is reflected in the fact
that average per capita consumption dropped from 182 to 159 liters
per capita per day.
</P>
<P>
Better financial management is shown by a 13 percent drop in
grant financing and the average operating ratio (expense/revenues)
fell from 0.97 to 0.89, the book says.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason why the region's unaccounted-for water
remains high since the first data book published in 1993, it says
that only half of all connections are properly metered and 60
percent of all meters are functioning accurately.
</P>
<P>
The book calls for reduction of unaccounted-for water by
eliminating public taps and illegal connections, more meter
production and consumption and repairing of leaks.

<HEADLINE> Asian-Pacific Officials to Meet on Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) will hold its 5th
Asian and Pacific Ministerial Conference on Social Development
from November 5 to 11 in the Philippine capital of Manila.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, about 300 government ministers and senior
officials will review the progress in implementing the ESCAP's
Manila Agenda for Action on Social Development for the region,
Philippine Socio-economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said
today.
</P>
<P>
The conference will include a meeting of senior officials on
November 5-8 and a ministerial meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials will review the social development
situation and prospects of Asia and the Pacific into the 21st
century, and the implementation of the action agenda on social
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
They will also propose steps to accelerate the implementation
of the action agenda and draft a ministerial declaration.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss the results of the senior officials'
meeting and approve the draft ministerial declaration.
</P>
<P>
In October 1994, the ESCAP, in preparation for the World Summit
for Social Development in 1995, convened in Manila and adopted the
Manila Agenda for Action on Social Development.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok-based ESCAP, established in March 1947, has 38
Asian-Pacific members and six associate countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Citing the decreasing poverty rate and unemployment rate,
Habito said the Philippines has substantially achieved its social
development goals.
</P>
<P>
According to Habito, the country's poverty incidence has gone
down to 35.5 percent in 1994 from 39.9 percent in 1991, and is
expected to fall further to 30 percent by 1998 given the poverty
alleviation programs that are in place.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the coming conference will provide a venue for
reassessing the measures and action strategies and recommitting
government resources to the goals of social development.

<HEADLINE> Croatian President's Planned Israeli Trip Creates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The planned visit to Israel
by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is creating a political storm
in Israel as some lawmakers pushed to cancel the trip in protest
against his alleged anti-semitic attitude.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry has said that Tudjman planned to
visit Israel next month to realize his promise made in August,
when the two countries established diplomatic ties, that he
wanted to visit the Jewish state to apologize personally for
crimes committed by some of his people during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
But some Israeli lawmakers were upset about Tudjman's planned
visit because of what was called his anti-semitic views. Lawmakers
Yossi Beilin and Yossi Sarid, of the opposition Labor party and
Meretz party, filed urgent motions to the Knesset (Parliament)
Sunday to protest Tudjman's visit.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Sarid called Tudjman as an "anti-semite," adding
the president should be considered a persona non grata in
Israel. "If Tudjman does come, he will encounter stormy
protests. Many will be unable to come to terms with his
provocative and painful presence here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said it would be a mistake to allow Tudjman to
visit. "He never took back his serious published statements that
the Holocaust is a Jewish invention and his willingness to
apologize for his people's crimes does not cover up for his own,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman has long been accused by Israel of making anti-semitic
slurs in his historical writings.
</P>
<P>
Considering the protests over Tudjman's visit, Israeli
President Ezer Weizman has not decided if to receive Tudjman,
the Presidential Office said in a statement Sunday night. Visiting
presidents and monarchs are generally guests of the president in
coordination with the Foreign Ministry.

United States and conducive to world peace, stability and
development.

contributions to China's construction and the strengthening of the
ties between the two countries.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Every house in Lebanon will

firm official was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is carrying out a project aimed at providing a

lines by 2000, Nadim Jawhari, commercial manager of Ogero, the
country's only state-owned telephone company, said in an

He said some 800,000 fixed lines were already ready for
operation and by the end of this year, one million lines would
be ready on the new network.
</P>
<P>
"All the telephone centrals that are being installed are very
advanced and by the year 2000, every household will have a
telephone line which is the simplest right a citizen could
have," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jawhari said that his company had sales people distributing
application forms for lines all over the country.
</P>
<P>
"People wishing to install a new telephone line will only
have to submit an application and they will have their lines
within 24 hours," he promised.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President's Son Released on Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 3 (Xinhua) -- President Kim Young-sam's second
son Kim Hyun-chul was released on bail Monday after spending five
and half months in jail.
</P>
<P>
Kim was sentenced to three years in jail by Seoul District
Court on October 13 convicted of evading taxes and peddling
influence in exchanges for money from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling on Kim's appeal for bail, the Seoul high court
said Monday that according to the principle of criminal suit, Kim
should undergo trial without physical detention.
</P>
<P>
The junior Kim has earlier appealed to court for retrial,
alleging it was unreasonable to find him guilty of evading taxes
for which he has never been asked to pay.
</P>
<P>
"Charges of influence-peddling to obtain money are not so
serious in Kim's case, and it is the first time that the charges
of tax evasion were applied in the court of law," the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
"As the defendant denies his crimes, there is a need for
further deliberations on his case," the ruling added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecutors Monday decided not to appeal against
Kim's bail after discussing the case at an emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
The court confined Kim to his residence in downtown Seoul and
barred him from fleeing or destroying evidence. He must report to
the court whenever he leaves the country for more than three days,
and must appear in court when summoned.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai was fully aware of the assassination plot
against the Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan, the Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli intelligence source was quoted by the newspaper as
saying that Mordechai sat in on a detailed briefing given to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by Mossad chief Danny Yatom and the
agents who were to carry out the attack.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in late August during which the timing
and location of the assassination were settle in the presence of
Netanyahu and Mordechai, the source said.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, Israeli agents assailed Mashaal in Amman.
Failing to killing him, the two agents were arrested by Jordanian
police and the plot was exposed to the public.
</P>
<P>
The botched attack has triggered an uproar in Arab countries
and various political groups or factions in Israel. Israel set up
a committee to investigate the affair to see who were
responsible. While Netanyahu admitted his responsibility,
Mordechai denied his involvement.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has been regarded as an "honest and righteous" leader
and a rising political star in Israel. But involvement in the
affairs could hurt his image and even political future, observers

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The donor nations of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are scheduled to hold their
annual meeting this week with the emphasis on the economic
implications of the closure imposed by Israel on the self-rule
area.
</P>
<P>
Since the July 30 suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem this
year, Israel has imposed total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and caused serious economic difficulties to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to be held in Israel, will also discuss the nature
of the PNA's financial accountability and transparency.This year's
discussion is seen as being of particular importance, since the
first five years of the donor-nation framework end in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among those in the Israeli team will be Foreign Ministry
Deputy Director-General Victor Harel and Treasury Budget
Department Deputy Director Uzi Levy.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to make the meeting as professional as possible,"
said Harel."The atmosphere will also depend on the outcome of
talks between (Israeli) Foreign Minister David Levy and (PNA
deputy) Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas)."
</P>
<P>
Under the aegis of the United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Levy and Abbas will resume negotiations today
in Washington in a concerted bid to remove the obstacles to
final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Benefits from Foreign Know-How </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign expertise has become an
important factor for the rapid economic development of
Heilongjiang province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, more than 10,000 foreign experts have
worked in the province, which has also sent 5,000 of its own
people abroad to study.
</P>
<P>
As a major grain producer of China, the province focuses on
importing agricultural technology, which has been used on 8 million
hectares of farmland, bringing more than 8 billion yuan (close to one
billion US dollars) in economic returns.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, some 70 percent of the province's added grain output
was resulted from the imported agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to foreign expertise, the province's industrial
enterprises have increased pre-tax profit by 550 million yuan and
earned some 100 million US dollars in foreign exchange from
exports.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts have also helped the development of local
education, culture, and public health.

Local paper Notias reported today that participants of the
meeting also called for an immediate campaign against corruption
which concerns not only African governments, but also civilian

<HEADLINE> EU, Israel to Resolve Orange Juice Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Israel will hold talks later this month to end their dispute over
the export of juice from Brazilian oranges under an Israeli label,
today's The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior official of Israeli Foreign
Ministry as saying that the EU and Israel have been at odds over
this issue for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
Israel has allegedly bought Brazilian oranges, extracted the
juice and mixed it with juice from local oranges, and exported it
to Europe under its preferential trade agreement with the EU. And
the South American fruit would not quality for trade privileges if
directly imported to Europe from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The official said the EU has been looking forward to the
negotiation to be held in Brussels late this month.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there are differences of opinion in Israel as
how to tackle the issue between the Foreign Ministry, Treasury,
Customs Department and Industry and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The EU has on several occasions requested that Israel supply
proof that it is no longer mixing the juices.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Kazakhstan has signed
a protocol, agreeing to cooperate in the area of oil and gas at
the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, the protocol was
signed Sunday at the end of a visit to Tehran by Kazakh Deputy
Foreign Minister Yerlan Edrisov.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, the two countries agreed that the Caspian
Sea and its resources belong to all the Caspian littoral states
and the legal regime of the sea should be drawn up unanimously
by these countries only.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Edrisov, who arrived Saturday and left
for home Sunday night, held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi and other senior officials. They discussed the
issue of the Caspian Sea and bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries voiced their opposition to any unilateral
action to explore the resources of the Caspian Sea, calling for
cooperation to determine the legal regime of the world's largest
inland sea.
</P>
<P>
Edrisov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American
affairs Morteza Sarmadi also urged foreign ministers of the
Caspian sea countries to hold a meeting in Moscow as soon as
possible to discuss the Caspian Sea issue.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the Kazakh official expressed hope that in light
of an interim agreement between the experts of the two countries
for an oil-swap through the Iranian soil, the two countries
would improve their cooperation in that area.

<HEADLINE> Australians Urged to Admit Injustices against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Governor-General
Sir William Deane today urged Australians to admit that terrible
things were done in the past against aborigines.
</P>
<P>
The governor-general also urged people not to ignore the plight
of the so-called "stolen generation" of aborigines who were
forcibly removed from their families in 1910-1970.
</P>
<P>
Deane said non-indigenous Australians had to confront the
terrible stories of what happened under the forced assimilation
policies of previous governments, the Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The official Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
Inquiry into the "stolen generation" in 1910-1970 called for a
national apology for the former policies and compensation for the
victims, including about 100,000 aboriginal children removed from
their families in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering its formal response to the
iniquity, but has ruled out compensation or a formal apology, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us have had to accept that in the name of, or with
the support of governments, terrible things were done in the
mistaken belief that it was for the children's good," the
governor-general told an Aboriginal exhibition launched in
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
When viewing an exhibition illustrating the story of Aborigines
paraded as savage cannibals in an American circus in the late
1800's, the governor-general said it acknowledged and expressed
the heartfelt sorrow for past injustices and oppression of
indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition shows how an American showman removed nine
Aborigines from the area around Palm Island in North Queensland of
Australia in 1883 to parade them as savage cannibals in an
American circus.
</P>
<P>
After being sideshow curiosities the aborigines were studied
and measured and photographed by the anthropological societies of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
One by one they died.
</P>
<P>
In 1892, a further eight Aborigines were removed from Australia
and only two were known to have returned.
</P>
<P>
Tambo was the first of the nine to die and his mummified body
was discovered in a basement in Cleveland, Ohio of the United
States, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300,000 aboriginal people in Australia out of
the country's 18 million population.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Launch Campaign to Boost Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police have launched
an aggressive campaign to eradicate colonial hangover still
lingering within the force's ranks in order to boost their image,
the daily The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is designed to instill managerial skills in the
organization's command structure and advocate a culture
sympathetic to human rights in an attempt to improve police's
public image.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Police Augustine Chihuri told legal
practitioners during the 30th Zimbabwe Law Society summer school
in Nyanga of east Zimbabwe at the weekend that the efficiency of
police operations depended on the level of public cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "if police do not respect the rights of the public,
then the public will be hostile and uncooperative toward police.
If the rules which are there to ensure the legitimate rights of
the public are broken by police, then the public will have
disrespect for the land and the police."
</P>
<P>
"However, if the police carry out their duties properly and
efficiently, without breaking the rules which impose limits on
what they can do, the public will have confidence in them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In short, police are there to serve the community and must
respect the human rights of the community," said Chihuri, adding
that police had an obligation to be accountable to society.
</P>
<P>
It was for this reason that policemen were being encouraged to
investigate first, and then make an arrest and not to arrest to
investigate, a situation which has seen the organization pumping
out money to settle suits brought against the force for illegal
arrests and detentions in the past.

TIANJIN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a leading traditional
industrial base in north China, will continue to use foreign
investments to transform its state-owned industrial firms over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
The city has signed technological transformation contracts for
855 projects. Said contracts will be carried out at a cost of 5.6
billion US dollars, including foreign funds of 3.5 billion US
dollars, said Mu Huaishan, director of the Tianjin Municipal
Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Some 202 of 318 medium- to large-sized state-owned enterprises
in Tianjin, or 64 percent of the total, have completed
readjustment or technological transformation projects.
</P>
<P>
Various prestigious transnational companies, including Samsong
and the LG Group from the Republic of Korea, and US-based Otis
Elevator have either funded or entered into cooperative ventures
with industrial firms in Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-State-Run Economy Moving Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists predict that
the state and public sectors will develop along with the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, president of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce (ACFIC), says the private sector, which is quite
strong, is expanding investment in state-owned enterprises and
will play a bigger role in developing a mixed form of ownership.
</P>
<P>
The output value and taxes paid by the private sector were only
one percent of the GDP before 1978. By the end of 1996, they had
590 billion yuan in registered capital. There were 62,617
private-run firms with at least one million yuan in registered
capital each and 752 private-owned enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
The recently-ended 15th Party congress came to a conclusion
that the non-public sector is an important part of the socialist
market economy. The conclusion boosted the morale of the
non-public sector and some provinces and large cities have come up
with their own measures for this.
</P>
<P>
At present, non-public, or private, sector is in the fields of
economy, science and technology, culture, sports and public health
and will have equal status with the public sector in obtaining
bank loans, developing new technology, and using land.
</P>
<P>
Some good performers will be chosen for experimenting with a
modern enterprise system and stock market participation.
</P>
<P>
The country will gradually set up a system to protect the
assets of natural persons and the interests and rights of
investors.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that reorganizing property rights at
state-owned enterprises makes it possible for the non-public
sector to expand its production and that the non-public sector
should improve management, build a modern enterprise system, and
build multinationals to improve its status at home and abroad.

JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Namibia will amend the
stock exchange control regulations in a bid to develop domestic
financial market, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
A bill to the effect will be tabled in parliament next year to
amend the Stock Exchanges Control Act. It would bring Namibia in
line with international practice and create new competition,
Namibian Stock Exchange Chairman Bob Meiring was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"This will allow international firms to become stockbroking
members of the stock exchange, including international banks
which are interested in the Namibian market.
</P>
<P>
"It will also allow local banks to own stockbroking
businesses," Meiring said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Finance Minister Nangoloh Mbumba said last week that
the Namibian government had initiated several strategies to
create an enabling environment for private sector development.
</P>
<P>
These included reforming the financial sector through the
partial removal of foreign exchange control, reforming the tax
system and creating incentives for industrial development and the
creation of export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
Mbumba said liquidity of the Namibian Stock Exchange stood at
11.5 percent, higher than the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's 10.5
percent and Zimbabwe's nine percent.

over the past few years years, with related transactions holding
respective 32.8 percent and 44.3 percent shares of the total
market volume in 1995 and 1996.

<P>
ADB said the five-day meeting will address key issues such as
the need for a greater degree of collaboration in sanitation
services, safer water for the urban poor and more involvement of
communities in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The forum will also discuss ways of encouraging governments,
donors and other stakeholders to intensify efforts to implement
effective water and sanitation programs in Asia, Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Of the developing world's 4.5 billion people, over a billion
people lack access to safe drinking water and more than 2.5

ahead of schedule, the daily The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Project manager Gibson Mandishona was quoted as saying more
than 8,000 lighting units had been installed by last month in
high-density areas, rural business and community centers and
clinics.
</P>
<P>
The 70 million Zimbabwe dollars (about 5.6 million
U.S.dollars) project was launched in 1993 as a pilot program and
is funded by the United Nations development program.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the pilot project this year, the manager noted,
an evaluation committee will be commissioned to look into the
successes and failures of the program.
</P>
<P>
Countries like Zambia, Malawi, Ghana and Sudan have been in
Zimbabwe to learn from its experiences.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase of the project, Mandishona said, GEF
may extend the repayment period and consider bartering crops or
livestock with the rural people as payment in an effort to speed
up the solar power program.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe electricity supply authority and other
non-governmental organisations are designing systems to cater for
specific end-user demands.

NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains have swept
away at least four people and 15 camels in Wajir and Moyale
districts of Kenya's Northeastern Province and Most parts of the
province are impassable as raging floods destroyed roads and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily Nation today quoted a senior police
officer in Wajir as saying "we have been completely cut off from
the rest of the country. Vehicles taking food and medicine to
the people have been stuck as the rains continue."

He noted that an army 18-seater Buma aircraft was airlifting
food to security personnel at the Kenya-Somali border posts.
</P>

No vehicles have arrived in Moyale or left the town for the

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Issue ID Cards for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The issuance of national
security identity cards to Tanzanians would begin before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Tanzanians would be required to carry
IDs, sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
Although Tanzania has for many years wanted to introduce the
ID cards for its nationals, it could not do so for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been an urgent task for more than 80 million
people in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, members of the East African
Co-operation (EAC), to move freely in the region with the ID
cards. Kenya is the only country in this region which issues
identity cards to its nationals.
</P>
<P>
There had been a dispute over whether Tanzania should first
pay 10 million U.S. dollars before the production of the national
cards, according to a report in East African today.
</P>
<P>
The government, the report said, has agreed to pay two million
U.S. dollars to British company Regional Services Limited of the
Isle of Man, to start producing the IDs.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the company will produce 16.4 million cards to be
issued to Tanzanians aged 18 years and above.
</P>
<P>
The IDs will be sold at affordable prices for the prospective
holders. The national passport cost some 32.5 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The East African Co-operation passport which was launched in
last April will complement the national IDs.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a total of 10,000 EAC passports have been issued.
More are expected to be ordered by the member states.
</P>
<P>
"For us the sooner the project starts the better because of
its national importance," a Ministry of Home Affairs official
said, adding that "with the advent of political pluralism, such
documents are necessary for planning and identification of bona
fide citizens."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a population of about 30 million, 16.4 million of
whom are aged above 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the issuance of IDs will greatly help Tanzania's
census scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
The country has over the years hosted thousands of refugees
from Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique and countries as far away as
Somalia and West Africa. It is alleged that some of them easily
assume citizenship due to lack of identity cards.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Children Illegally Employed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 200,000 children
are illegally employed in South Africa, local daily Sowetan
quoted Labor Department Director-general Sipho Pityana as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
Pityana said the 200,000 figure probably did not take into
account unpaid domestic work or children working in the informal
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said this phenomenon was due to poverty, economic
inequality and a lack of investment in the education of black
children, noting one of the legacies of apartheid was the neglect
of children, 50 percent of whom were employed on farms.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was working towards eliminating child
labor. "The South African Schools Act of 1996 introduces
compulsory education for the first time and sets the school
leaving age at 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"We view the introduction of this legislation as an essential
measure to eliminate child labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Primary School Nutrition Program, which was introduced in
September 1994, saw an improved attendance at schools, especially
rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pityana said the Basic condition of Employment bill being
debated in parliament prohibits the employment of children under
the age of 15. It protects those between 15 and 18 years by
barring their employment in jobs where their health, education
and social development is affected.
</P>
<P>
The bill makes children labor a criminal offense and it will
be a crime to help someone employ children.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals Up By 3.7 Percent in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Indonesia
have risen by 3.7 percent in January-September compared with a
year earlier despite fears of a decline due to smoke from forest
fires blanketing the region, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, tourist arrivals reached
3.2 million, Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Joop
Ave said last night.
</P>
<P>
He said the tourists were estimated to have spent 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase, Indonesian officials said it would be
difficult for the country to achieve its 5.5 million minimum
tourist arrival target for 1997 due to bad publicity over the
forest fire haze.
</P>
<P>
The fires have thrown up a cloud of choking smog, which now
covers vast areas of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Several branches of the Association of Indonesian Tours and
Travel Agencies have complained about the increasing number of
cancellations of tourist arrivals by Europeans and Southeast
Asians due to fears about the effects of the haze on health and
flight safety, press reports have said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Indonesia's third largest foreign exchange earner
after textile and wood products exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zambia
Democratic Congress (ZDC), whose leader has been arrested after
the October 28 abortive coup, has advised the government not to
allow its concentration to be completely swayed away from the
contentious national issues following the coup.
</P>
<P>
ZDC Vice General Secretary Stanley Hamusonde said here on
Sunday that while it is important for the government to continue
probing the coup attempt, equal attentions should be attached to
trying to break the political impasse that has entangled the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as citing the recurrent
collapse of inter-party talks and the escalating poverty as some
of the issues that the government should address as they seemed
to have been the causes for the coup.
</P>
<P>
The government should now show an even more committed stance
in resolving the national issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamusonde also wondered why ZDC President Dean Mung'omba was
arrested last Friday, saying it is unfair to do so if the move is
based on the statements Mung'omba uttered before the coup.
</P>
<P>
If the authorities felt that his statements were inflammatory,
he should have been picked up then and not wait until there was
an incident to use as a bedrock, he argued.

<HEADLINE> s d s  2547 China-Three Gorges-Competition Mechanism Market Mechanism Boosts Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- The
introduction of a market mechanism has given the Three Gorges
Project (TGP), now in full swing, a strong boost over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the accelerated construction process and
satisfactory quality in line with designed requirements, the
project developer China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation (CYTGPDC) has managed to cut down on the scale of
investment effectively, according to a company official.
</P>
<P>
Labeled as the world's largest water control project under
construction, the TGP is expected to cost 25 billion US dollars
and take 17 years to complete, the official said. Therefore, he
added, the management system that has been adopted is of crucial
importance to the quality and efficiency of the project.
</P>
<P>
The CYTGPDC, designated by the State Council as the project
developer of the Three Gorges Project, is expected to take full
responsibility of the whole project, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"From the very start, we introduced the market mechanism and
gave high priority to efficiency," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The market mechanism in turn resulted in mounting competition,
and the project's great amount of construction work and huge
demand for materials and equipment drew both domestic and overseas
businesses.
</P>
<P>
And competition prompted the project to gather the best
construction forces in China and pool the world's most advanced
construction machinery, thus laying a sound basis for guaranteeing
the project's quality and construction period.
</P>
<P>
Although the construction of the project was open only to
domestic engineering firms, companies from overseas competed each
other in international biddings for supply of large-scale
construction machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the prestigious generator manufacturers in the world
turned up to bid for the project's most lucrative contract, the
official said, and two European consortia were finally awarded the
opportunity to supply 740 million US dollars' worth of generators
and turbines.
</P>
<P>
The blocking of the Yangtze this November 8 signals the start
of the second-phase construction work of the Three Gorges Project.
"With a market mechanism maturing after five years of practice,
people can be assured that quality and efficiency of the Three
Gorges Project will have a reliable guarantee in the remaining
construction period of 12 years," said the official.

smooth out wrinkle at the corners of the eyes and on the forehead.
</P>
<P>
She said that, according to clinical studies, the therapy has
proved effective on about 92 percent of 192 people, aged 30 to 78,
of whom three-forths are women.
</P>
<P>
In addition to aging, the environment, morale, ailments,
hormones, lack of sleep, and smoking can also affect the balance
of inner organs and cause wrinkles on the face or other skin
problems, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Because acupuncture balances the inner parts of the human body,
other methods of improving looks are often only skin-deep,
Ms. Tjandra said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also comparatively cheap," she said, explaining that in
Indonesia, a face-lift operation costs 3,000 US dollars, while
acupuncture therapy for the face costs about a tenth of that.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Buddha Statue and Its Hall under Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese architects and
archeologists are currently restoring the country's largest bronze
statue of the Buddha, which stands 21.3 meters in height, and
refurbishing the complex in which it is housed in Zhengding, north
China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is the second largest of its kind in Chinese
history, next to renovation of Lhasa's Potala Palace which was
completed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, which has 42 arms, sits on a stone base with
swords, lotus plants or various other items carved in relief. The
work represents the artistic traditions of the Song Dynasty
(960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The Buddha and hall, which have a history of over 1,000 years,
has undergone four major renovations in the Yuan, Ming and Qing
dynasties, and in the 1940s, according to Zhang Lizhu, director of
Hebei Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, previous renovation efforts focused on the main hall
and did not include the two side halls, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The State Cultural Relics Bureau therefore decided to renovate
the entire complex. A number of well-known architects specializing
in ancient architecture have worked on the project since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that renovation of the brick and wood building will
be completed in September 1999.

</P>
<P>
Zhang Xunhai, deputy director of the department overseeing

These include 134 branches of foreign banks, seven
joint-venture banks, five solely foreign-funded banks, six
overseas financial companies, eight branch insurance companies,
one Sino-overseas joint-venture insurance firm and one
Sino-overseas investment bank.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, overseas banks in China had 32.96 billion
US dollars in total assets, 23.08 billion US dollars in

<P>
Overseas financial institutions have been allowed to establish

of loans issued by the overseas banks in China were for people
inside the country and nearly half were for medium- and long-term

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, has recorded notable progress in
developing services for the elderly, thanks to the extensive
efforts of the local government and various social circles.
</P>
<P>
The city, one of the first cities in the country to address
problems related to the aging population, is currently home to
2.31 million people over the age of 60, or 17.8 percent of its
total population.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai introduced China's first local law designed to protect
the legitimate rights and interest of the elderly, with a number
of districts in the city establishing tribunals to deal with
related issues.
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of the towns and rural areas in Shanghai had
introduced insurance system reforms by the end of 1996, with 81
percent of elderly residents participating in the new insurance
system.
</P>
<P>
Various social departments and institutions have joined efforts
to provide better services for the elderly. Related organizations
have issued "priority cards" enabling people over the age of 70 to
enjoy free or preferential treatment when traveling by bus,
visiting local doctors and shopping.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of local enterprises have
joined efforts to provide assistance funds for poverty-stricken
elderly people, with more than 600,000 volunteers currently
serving the city's aging population.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Approach to Int'l Financial Markets Management  Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The recent currency
turmoil called for a new approach to regional and international
cooperation for the management of international financial markets,
Indian Vice President Krishan Kant said today.
</P>
<P>
The currency volatility which hit Southeast Asia has
highlighted the need for developing countries to insulate
themselves from the whips of market sentiments and exchange rate
fluctuations in major currencies, he said when representing Asia
at the opening of the seventh G-15 summit.
</P>
<P>
The recent disturbance in the international financial and
capital markets has adversely affected many countries in Asia and
other parts of the developing world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Given the importance of private capital flows for development
and the growing integration of developing countries in
international financial markets, the recent currency volatility
calls for a new approach to regional and international cooperation
for their management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kant said the G-15 could work to evolve suitable strategies and
consult with each other on this matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that future North-South contacts must reflect the
credit developing countries had earned by "telescoping" structural
adjustments and liberalization within a truly historic time frame
and proportions.
</P>
<P>
"The developed countries must themselves set an example of
genuine liberalization particularly in sectors of export interest
to developing countries such as in textiles, agriculture, steel,
electronics and information services," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries must be able to optimize their
assets of human resources and labor whilst getting their worth for
their environmental and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
There must be fair play in resource allocations especially in
forums like the World Trade Organization (WTO), International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said though Asia had become an epitome of successful
globalization and high economic growth, it is home to the largest
number of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
Kant said the G-15, dubbed as South-South cooperation without
substance when it was conceived seven years ago, had turned into
an enduring reality.
</P>
<P>
He also said developing countries must be given consideration
and support in new areas where they have yet to acquire
competitive robustness by extending the concept of Generalized
System of Preferences (GSP).
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader said that the GSP must cover areas like
financial and telecommunication services, intellectual property
rights, investment measures and other areas where they would
profit from some "offsets" and special entry rights.
</P>
<P>
He said there should be no attempts to neutralize or downgrade
the comparative advantages of developing countries which include
preventing the pre-judicial use of anti-dumping instruments,
technical barriers and anti-competitive practices on exports of
developing countries or introduction of environmental, social or
other conditionalities.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe spoke on behalf of Africa at
the opening and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori addressed the
opening representing Latin America.
</P>
<P>

India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Kenya joins the grouping as its
16th member at the summit.

fifth in the National Party, has now enjoyed overwhelming support
to make a successful bid to topple Bolger as the party leader when
the National Caucus meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Shipley is supported by 75 percent or at
least 32 of the caucus members against 6 for Bolger.
</P>
<P>
It also said that negotiations are now underway between Bolger
and Shipley on the conditions for Bolger's step-down.
</P>
<P>
The leadership crisis started in September when National
Minister of Women's Affairs Christine Fletcher quit and called for
a change of the leader after her resignation.
</P>
<P>
If Bolger steps down now, it comes much sooner than most
observers expected.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Benefits from Foreign Government Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Government loans from 14
countries and regions have contributed greatly to Tianjin's
economic growth, according to a municipal official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 1.32 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
government loans, or half of the north China port city's total
overseas funding, have been committed to infrastructure
construction and development of the machine-building, petroleum,
posts and telecommunications and electronics sectors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign government loans have been an important source of funds
for the construction of a gas plant, two wastewater treatment
plants and three power plants, as well as a telephone installation
project and the purchase of medical equipment for a cancer
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Loans have also been used to upgrade technology for Tianjin's
major industrial businesses, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that loans were used to increase the production
capacity for Xiali automobiles, with the model becoming the most
widely used taxicab in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 14.5 million U.S. dollars in loans have been used to
construct a solar heating project and wastewater treatment
facilities in the Binhai New Area.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: Sino-U.S. Strategic Ties Benefit World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The building of the
constructive strategic partnership between China and the United
States is a new way of handling post-Cold War relations between
big countries, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. partnership "is by no means an alliance," Qian
said in an interview with Chinese and foreign correspondents
assigned to cover Chinese President Jiang Zemin's ongoing
historical state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such a partnership benefits the fundamental interests of the
peoples of China and the United States and is conducive to the
regional and global peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the world is developing toward multipolarization in the
post-Cold War days, Qian explained, all major countries have been
trying to engage cooperative, rather than confrontational,
relationships. And in this sense, the establishment of a strategic
partnership might well be considered as a new way of handling
relations between major countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Qian added, China and Russia, as two big
neighboring countries, have established a strategic partnership
featured by non-alignment, non-confrontation and not targeting any
third parties. China and France have established a partnership
relationship based on the common acknowledgement that the world is
a multipolarized one.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question of how to evaluate the Chinese
president's U.S. tour, Qian defined Jiang's trip as "having
yielded important and specific fruits" in three specific areas.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, Qian said, the two countries have gained common ground
on the goal of their future relations, that is, to build toward a
constructive strategic partnership oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement is the launching of a framework on
high-level contacts between leaders of the two countries and on
the contacts between relevant government institutions.
</P>
<P>
The third aspect of the fruits of the visit is the enhancement
of mutual understanding. During the visit, President Jiang has not
only talked with American leaders but also met people of various
walks of life including those from the mass media, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the Hong Kong issue, Qian said Jiang
and President Clinton did not touch upon the Hong Kong issue
during the summit, as the two sides shared the view that after
Hong Kong's return to China, the territory's economic and social
development, as well as China's economy as a whole, has been good.
</P>
<P>
The recent fluctuation of the Hong Kong stock market has had
nothing to do with Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Qian
said. The fluctuation there was normal, just as those frequent
occurrence in the New York Stock Exchange and elsewhere of the
Southeast Asian countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- India's English newspaper
National Herald today in its editorial praised the recent
Sino-U.S. summit.
</P>
<P>
"When two powerful nations decide to put aside their
differences and regularize relations, it is not only mutually
beneficial but it also helps ease tensions in other parts of the
world. Last week's Sino-U.S. summit holds out promise of achieving
just that," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and the U.S. have their major areas of concern and
interests vis-a-vis each other. The summit has helped the two
leaders, Mr. Jiang Zemin and Mr. Bill Clinton, to assist each
other materially and to focus more clearly on areas of mutual
concern. Armed with better understanding, the two can help ease
tensions in Asia, particularly in Southeast and East Asia," it
further said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only right that as the world moves towards a new century
it acquires the maturity to sort out differences through dialogue
and put to use only one weapon in this exercise -- that of trade,"
it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Africa Being Marginalized in Trade Liberalization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe today warned that Africa faced a real danger of
being marginalized in the globalization and trade liberalization
process.
</P>
<P>
"For most of the developing countries, the gains of
globalization and trade liberalization are yet to be felt," he
said on behalf of Africa at the opening of the seventh G-15 summit
here which was opened by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told the summit, "In the case of Africa, which has 33 of
the world's 48 least developed countries, there is a real danger
the continent may be marginalized in the process."
</P>
<P>
He said despite the fact that most African countries had
embarked on political and economic reforms aimed at creating a
conducive environment for foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows,
the response on the ground had been far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual World Economic and Social Survey released
last July cited Africa as having less than five percent of FDI in
developing countries last year, and taking into account dividend
and other profit payments on existing investments, the net
transfer from FDI in those net-debtor African countries was a net
outflow of over 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This situation has been further exacerbated by the crippling
debt burden and the ever-dwindling Official Development
Assistance, resulting in low economic growth in many African
countries, particularly the least developed among them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the developing world now found itself confronted by new
conditionalities and restrictive measures which negated any
potential benefits from globalization.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 is best placed to play a catalytic role in the
promotion of South-South cooperation, and the various G-15
projects should move from the formulation to implementation
phases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa would like to see increased involvement of the African
business community in intra-G-15 cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Africa was happy to note that G-15 efforts to
promote South-North dialogue had started to yield results and
welcomed development initiatives by industrialized countries in
that continent.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Kenya joins the grouping as its
16th member at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also attended by Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Indonesian President
Soeharto, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, Indian Vice
President Krishan Kant, Argentine Vice President Carlos Ruckauf
and Jamaican Deputy Prime Minister Seymour Mullings.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Senegal, Mexico and Brazil are represented by their
foreign ministers while Chile's economics minister and Venezuela's
industry and commerce minister are standing in for their heads of
government.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Calls for Fair Rules in Currency, Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called for drawing up fair rules for
currency and global trade.
</P>
<P>
"The deliberate devaluation of the currency of a country by
currency traders purely for profit is a serious denial of the
rights of independent nations," he said when opening the seventh
G-15 summit here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described the present system of currency trading as
"unethical and unfair" to the countries attacked and said, if
globalization was to be accepted, there must be a fair system of
trading, be it in goods and services, shares or currency.
</P>
<P>
He said market forces were by themselves exploitative and
cannot determine that the rules and regulations would be fair to
all.
</P>
<P>
Relating the painful experience of Malaysia and other Southeast
Asian countries with currency speculators, Mahathir said while
currency devaluation may be caused by certain weaknesses of a
country's economy, the truth was that currencies weakened only if
currency traders sold them for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the target must be the currency of countries with a
degree of prosperity and this negated years of hardwork and
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who continued his fight against unregulated currency
trading, drew the attention of member countries to the disturbing
trends that had emerged since the last World Trade Organization
(WTO) ministerial meeting in Singapore that could be detrimental
to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
He said direct foreign investments could damage share markets
of developing countries because foreign investors simply dumped
shares for high capital gains after pushing up the prices to
ridiculously high levels.
</P>
<P>
"It is far better for us to invest in productive capacities on
our own and other developing countries than to depend on hot money
inflow into our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged South countries not to be complacent and look to
new horizon by venturing into non-traditional markets and forge
multi-faceted partnerships among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, he said, was unique as it was one of the few economic
groupings of developing countries which was trans-regional and
among its members were some of the most dynamic developing
economics in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We can choose either to make use of this potential or let it
go to waste. We need to consolidate our potentials. Let us not
allow the challenges that we face cloud our visions for tomorrow
as we advance into the new millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also attended by Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe, Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Indonesian President Soeharto, Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori, Indian Vice President Krishan Kant, Argentine

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Calls for Strike Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and other six small opposition groups have
called for a half-day strike in the capital Dhaka Tuesday, to
protest against a ban on street meeting and demonstration and
against police repression.
</P>
<P>
The opposition strike will coincide with the opening of the
two-day Aid Consortium meeting tomorrow, which is critical for
Bangladesh's foreign aid and is taking place for the first time in
this poor South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Mannan Bhuiyan Sunday night announced the
program of the strike from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday, arguing that
the strike has been called to realize people's fundamental rights
for holding meeting and procession.
</P>
<P>
He also said demonstrations would be held and torch procession
would be carried out in each ward of the city today.
</P>
<P>
The BNP leader told a press conference that although the
government has said there is no restriction on procession, police
charged batons and fired tear gas on BNP processions in the
capital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police Sunday cordoned off the Nayapaltan area near the central
office of the BNP to prevent the party from staging
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Failing to take out a procession, the BNP workers reportedly
threw
dozens of crackers and home-made bombs at the police, who in
retaliation resorted to bars and teargas shelling. About
40 people were injured and 16 people were arrested from the spot.
</P>
<P>
"We did not want to call strikes, but this government compelled
us to go for strike," said Bhuiyan, whose party is boycotting the
current session of parliament beginning Sunday.

<HEADLINE> India's Software Industry Worries over US New Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- India's software industry has
expressed serious concern over a bill in the U.S. Congress, which,
if enacted, would adversely affect India's software exports to the
U.S., a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. bill is expected to increase the financial and
administrative costs of hiring Indian software professionals.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the biggest market for Indian software exports. The
increased burden placed on a U.S. company when hiring an Indian
professional would hamper the free flow of software trade between
India and the U.S., he said.
</P>
<P>
"The bill, seeking to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act
of the U.S., is discriminatory in nature as it tries to
differentiate between an Indian and a U.S. employee. India's
competitive advantage in software would be stifled by this kind of
non-tariff barriers being put up by developed countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Society Offers Guidelines Against Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thailand Tourism Society
has provided pricing guidelines for hotel and tour operators as
the country faces continued currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
According to the guidelines issued by the non-government
tourism grouping, local hotel and tour operators are urged to use
the baht as the main currency in a deal unless it is agreed by
partners to use other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The society comprising Thailand's eight major tourism
organizations also suggested that Thai hotel and tour operators
adjust prices in line with inflation or currency fluctuations if
the Thai economy worsens in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the society called on local tour operators to
maintain their existing contracts, despite the impacts of the
currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that most Thai hotel and tour operators
have changed their price quotations to foreign travel agents after
the baht floated on July 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
Worrying about foreign-exchange losses, most Thai hotel and
tour operators adopted a wait-and-see attitude in view of the baht
depreciation before offering new packages to overseas agents,
which have blocked more tourists from visiting Thailand in the
high season.
</P>
<P>
The society warned that the suspension of some contracts may
hurt the country's tourism significantly.
</P>
<P>
The baht continued to decline last weekend, plunging to a
record low of more than 41 baht against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Asks Society to Help Eradicate Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Minister of Health
and Family Welfare Salahuddin Yusuf has urged workers of the
voluntary organizations to work dedicatedly to satisfy the huge
demand for blood and eradicate blindness from the country by
expanding their activities, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We need a coordinated program to ensure the removal of
blindness from society and supply of pure blood to the patients,"
the Bangladesh Observer quoted the minister as saying while
inaugurating the National Voluntary Blood Donation and Posthumous
Eye Donation Day '97 in Dhaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The yearly demand for blood in the country is about 250,000
units, of which 50,000 units are supplied after collection from
the donors, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that blood is also being collected by Lions Club
and Red Crescent Society, and the blood also comes from
professional donors, most of whom are suffering from different
killer diseases.
</P>
<P>
"We can turn the blind people into active citizens by
transplanting cornea timely," the minister said. "For this, we
need modern eye-banks and a huge number of cornea which could be
made available through voluntary eye donation program."
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for developing and modernizing the
blood banks for the country and preventing professional blood
donation.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has a great many voluntary blood donors and
volunteers, the minister said, adding "Now what we need is a
coordinated program."
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no religious bar to eye or blood
donation, rather all the religions have encouraged it.
</P>
<P>
The health sector was seriously neglected by the governments of
last 21 years, the minister noted, adding that as a result, the
rich of the country go abroad for better treatment and spend a
large amount of money every year.
</P>
<P>
The government will allocate enough money for expanding the
activities in such fields, he said.

<HEADLINE> From First Dam on Yangtze to Biggest Hydro-Project in the World (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
engineers and workers have embarked on a journey to scale the
world's summit in water control and power generation by building
the Three Gorges project with the world's largest hydro-power
station, after the Gezhouba project was completed nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
A hydroelectric power station with a total installed capacity
of 18.2 million kw will be erected in the Three Gorges Project,
compared with 12.6 million kw in Brazil's Itaipu project completed
six years ago, currently the world's No.1.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic project, aimed primarily at flood control at the
middle and lower reaches in China's No.1 and the world's No.3
river, was approved by the National People's Congress on April 3,
1992, - with 1,767 deputies for, 177 against, and 664 abstaining
after decades of investigation, planning and debate.
</P>
<P>
On today's Three Gorges worksite, the bulk of builders have
come from the Gezhouba Group since they are the only ones and the
most experienced in building a dam and hydroelectric facilities on
the mainstream of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Looking back to the days of building the Gezhouba, they are
convinced that China's present stability and prosperity guarantee
the smooth progress in construction of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The first phase construction of the Three Gorges project is
soon to be completed with the scheduled river blocking on November
8 after five years of construction, whereas that of the smaller
Gezhouba project took ten years from 1971 to 1980 to complete, as
a result of the turmoil during the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.

The total investment for the Three Gorges project, spanning
1993-2009 is estimated to account for less than one thousand of
the cumulative GDP during the period.
</P>
<P>
The fund for the project will come from the state allocations,
the bond and stock, and from overseas financial sources, said Li
Yong'an, deputy general manager in charge of finance of the China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corp., the project's
proprietor.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, science and technology have played a major role in
both projects, said Chen Xiaolin, Gezhouba Group's chief engineer
for the river damming.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the aid of the sophisticated computers and electronic
detectors, builders of the Three Gorges project gradually solving
the 20-plus most-knotty technical problems involving removal of a
huge amount of rocks, boulders and earth and the pouring of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
And construction equipment in use at the Three Gorges worksite
is more advanced than that used by the Gezhouba project, such as
the 77-ton US made Caterpillar self-tipping trucks instead of the
30-ton ones most commonly use at the Gezhouba worksite.

SINGAPORE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), acting in concert with Bank of Indonesia and the
Bank of Japan, intervened in the Singapore foreign exchange market
today, buying Indonesian rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Finance Minister Richard Hu said that
Singapore's participation in this joint intervention "reflects our
confidence in the macroeconomic policies of the Indonesian
government".
</P>
<P>
The international community announced plans last Friday to get
Indonesia's economy back on track, offering it an almost 40
billion U.S. dollars aid package. The IMF (International Monetary
Fund) was ready to step in with 10 billion U.S. dollars over three
years provided Indonesia met the terms of a comprehensive reform
package.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore supports the Indonesian government's decision to
implement the policy program formulated with the IMF, World Bank
and ADB (Asian Development Bank)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister declared that the depreciation of the rupiah in
recent months is excessive. "Today's joint intervention is aimed
at promoting a strengthening of the rupiah to levels more
consistent with the fundamentals of the Indonesian economy," he
stressed, but gave no details as to how large the size of the
concerted intervention was.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore shares the view of Indonesia and Japan that rupiah
stabilization is necessary for the success of the policy program.
With this in mind, the three monetary authorities stand ready to
act again, as and when necessary, in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka
said in his statement that the Bank of Japan operated in the
Singapore foreign exchange market today on behalf of the Ministry
of Finance, in concert with the Indonesian and Singaporean
monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
"This operation is aimed at correcting excessive depreciation
of the Indonesian rupiah," he said, adding that he "firmly"
believed that the operation should contribute to stabilizing the
Indonesian economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Export Revenue to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to earn up
to 51 billion baht (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) from rice exports
this year, with a year-on-year increase of 10 percent, according
to statistics from the Foreign Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Thailand exported 3.92
million tons of rice worth 43.1 billion baht (1.07 billion
dollars), with an 8 percent drop in volume but a 10.3 percent rise
in value over the same period of last year, a press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The department expected rice exports to continue to rise in the
last quarter of this year to bring the year's total exports to
nearly 5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Buyers of Thai rice included Iraq, which was permitted by the
United Nations to import more rice under the second round of an
oil for food scheme, and Indonesia, which was importing more Thai
rice after suffering a drought brought by the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
El Nino has caused drought and heavy floods in plantations in
many other countries, which has led to higher rice prices.
</P>
<P>
Next year, Thailand is forecast to produce a total of 20.6
million tons of paddy from two crops.

<HEADLINE> Showcase for Equipment Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- At a first
glimpse of the 15.28 sq km dam site of the Three Gorges Project,
reporters were most impressed by a long line of self-dumping
trucks with heavy loads of rocks and gravel shuttling back and
forth on its cofferdam.
</P>
<P>
These huge "Yellow Ducks," as construction workers of the
project call them, are a batch of heavy-duty, self-tipping trucks
made by the Caterpillar company, a U.S. firm. And they constitute
only a small part of the construction machinery imported to use in
the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Youjiang, deputy chief of the Three Gorges
Project Headquarters under the Gezhouba Share-Holding Group, his
project, as the world's largest water control project, has drawn
worldwide attention from the very start, which finally evolved
into increasing competitions and active participation by
international manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Since one third of the project's investment, or more than 8.43
billion US dollars, will be used for purchase of construction
materials and equipment. The project held three international
biddings for equipment purchase last year alone, valued at 135
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fierce competitions and golden opportunity have been
displayed in the massive cumulation of various machinery imports
at the dam site, which Liu described as "a showcase for modern
equipment".
</P>
<P>
"More than half of the machinery equipment put to use at the
project site has been imported," said Liu, adding that the
collection of imported machinery also include US-made vibration
drum-type roller and bulldozers, big-horse power Sweden hydraulic
rigs, Japanese concrete producing equipment, and German
excavators.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project has created a huge demand for the
world's most advanced construction equipment, since it was labeled
as the biggest water control project, involving the most
complicated technologies, according to the deputy chief engineer
of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
Deng Jinglong.

<HEADLINE> UN to Send Mission to Iraq to Resolve Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of
the United Nations Kofi Annan decided today to sent a mission
to Iraq to persuade the Iraqi Government to reverse its decision
on banning Americans taking part in UN weapons inspections,
according to UN spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's office said in a statement, "The
Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the potentially grave
consequences of the decision announced by the Government of Iraq
on October 29 concerning implementation of the Security Council
resolutions governing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ban is widely seen as the response to a resolution
adopted by the U.N. Security Council last month threatening a ban
on travel abroad by Iraqi officials who interfered with the work
of U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The mission would be composed of three: Lakhdar Brahimi of
Algerian, Emilio Cardenas from Argentina and Jan Eliasson from
Sweden, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, head of the arms inspectors, said after
briefing the Security Council on Friday that he would order his
experts to resume inspections on Monday which had been halted
after Iraq announced the ban.

<HEADLINE> Four billion Yuan for Tibet Highway System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
allocate four billion yuan (480 million US dollars) over the next
20 years to construct and improve highways in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, the southwest China region known as the "Roof of the
World".
</P>
<P>
Tibet, located at a high altitude prone to severe weather
conditions, is the only region in China without a railway
system. Highways therefore plays an extremely important role in
the region's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to build or improve highways stretching a
total of 10,000 kilometers. The highway system will link most
parts of the region and will provide access to neighboring Yunnan,
Qinghai and Sichuan provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The region will improve a number of existing highways,
including the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways, by the
year 2000. Related projects will involve blacktopping gravel roads
and consolidating slope protection.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated over four billion yuan
(480 million dollars) for highway construction in Tibet over the
past 40 years, with roads stretching 22,300 km currently linking
77 percent of the counties in the region.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Launch Campaign to Bolster Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will launch
a public relations campaign on state-run radio stations in a bid
to bolster its image and boost confidence in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The move came as Democrats and business groups stepped up
pressure on the Chart Pattana Party (CPP), the key coalition
partner, to pull out of the coalition to force Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to resign, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's public relations effort will involve
three- to five-minute "news" segments after the morning news on
Tuesdays and Fridays to allow the administration to give its side
of the story, deputy government spokeswoman Kanala Kanthaprab was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's piece will announce what is to be discussed at the
day's cabinet meeting while the Friday broadcast will feature a
weekly news wrap-up. The first broadcast will be aired on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kanala said the news segments would be factual in detail and
presented in a straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has blamed the media for exacerbating the
economic crisis in Thailand and scaring away investors by
publishing inaccurate reports.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said political stability was needed to restore
confidence in the economy and the government should not have to
take all the blame for what was going wrong.
</P>
<P>
Democrats and business groups want the CPP to withdraw to force
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to resign, in what they say is a last-ditch
effort to save Thailand from economic ruin.

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government today agreed to study a peace proposal put forward by
one of the two rebel groups still fighting the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia said the government would
study the plan from the National Liberation Army (ELN), which is
headed by former Spanish Roman Catholic priest Manuel Perez.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, Mejia also criticized the ELN's latest
kidnapping, on October 23, of two foreign election observers and a
Colombian human rights official working with the two.
</P>
<P>
The ELN released the three hostages on Saturday and proposed in
the same day a national peace convention as a step toward ending
decades of fighting in this Central American nation.
</P>
<P>
Such a convention, the rebel group said, would "give political
space to those who are always forgotten and take a step toward a
constituent assembly to elect a new government."
</P>
<P>
The ELN proposal is similar to one made by the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is the older and stronger
of the two guerrilla groups in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Prodi: Italy's Welfare Plan Not Perfect, But Big Step Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government's welfare
reform package may not be perfect, but it represents a big step
forward towards the proposed European economic and monetary union,
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi made the remarks at Bologna, his home town, when commenting
an agreement reached between the Italian government and trade
unions on Saturday to save an equivalent of about 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars from the national pension program.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that people could criticize the reform "for not
having done everything, but reforms are made step by step and in
this case enormous progress has been made" to secure Italy's entry
into the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) slated for 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the pension reform, Prodi noted, "we have strongly unified
the Italian pension system. We have not made it perfect, but
reforms are made step by step, with the nation behind them and
above all in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"The pension system, which was very unjust, is now more fair,
thanks to modifying the higher pensions, taking away certain
privileges and eliminating certain special systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government must now reach an agreement with the independent
unions which should also contribute to readjusting the pension
system, said the prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- One more new oil and natural gas
field has been discovered off Myanmar's Tanintharyi coast.
</P>
<P>
Official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted a
report of the Ministry of Energy as saying that the new well, Aung
Zeya Test Well, is located within block M-12, 320 kilometers west

States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company has been jointly developing Myanmar's Yetagun
gas field in partnership with the PTTEP (Thailand), Premier
(Britain), Nippon (Japan) and MOGE (Myanmar). Natural gas from the
field will be exported to Thailand beginning 1999, according to a
contract signed in March between the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand and the developers.
</P>
<P>
Texaco is also conducting drilling at another test well, the
Aunglaba, of the same block.
</P>

According to official statistics, altogether six U.S. companies
including the ARCO, Texaco and UNOCAL are involved in oil and
natural gas exploration in Myanmar, in addition to those from
Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and
Thailand.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Debt Expected to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The total debt stock of the
Philippine government is expected to decline to 1.08 trillion
pesos (30.86 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 from the 1.099 trillion
pesos (31.4 billion dollars) programmed debt for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Latest official documents show that the decline in the national
government's outstanding debt is assumed due to the slowdown in
both foreign and internally generated borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The drop in both sources of borrowing is foreseen because of
the additional revenues that will be raised from the full
implementation of the entire comprehensive tax reform program by
next year.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has approved the remaining portion of the tax
program, including the revenue yielding individual and corporate
taxation scheme and other revenue generating measures to be put in
place in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total domestic debts of the national government is expected to
decline to 733.7 billion pesos (20.963 billion dollars) in 1998
from an estimated 734.5 billion pesos (20.986 billion dollars) in
1997, the data show.
</P>
<P>
Foreign liabilities of the national government is projected to
drop to 347 billion pesos (9.91 billion dollars) in 1998 from
364.8 billion projected (10.42 billion dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Domestic debt accounts for 67.89 percent of the estimated total
obligations of the national government for the period with
external debt representing the balance of 32.11 percent, according
to the data.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Currency Deposits Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine foreign currency
deposits slid 7.3 percent to 15.38 billion U.S. dollars as of
October 17 from the 16.6 billion dollars at the end of June this
year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes
attributed the drop to increased withdrawals following the
continued depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar and the
planned imposition of tax on these deposits.
</P>
<P>
Since July 11, when the peso started falling against the U.S.
dollar, the local currency has depreciated by 35.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the intervening period, foreign currency deposits
withdrawals totaled 1.42 billion dollars, or an average of 12.24
million a day, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Reyes as saying that due to the depreciation
of the peso, investors tend to withdraw their dollars to take
advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
A plan by lawmakers to impose tax on interest income from
foreign currency deposits has triggered more jitters among dollar
account holders and prompted more withdrawals, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The bulk or 80 percent of the foreign currency deposits are
held by residents such as exporters, importers and families of
overseas Filipino workers.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Water Levels at Three Gorges Reservoir (10) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- Three water
levels -- normal storage, flood stage and low level, are inherently
important to the future role the Three Gorges Reservoir will play
in flood control, power generation and navigation.
</P>
<P>
The normal water storage level refers to the depth of water in
the reservoir under normal operation. Higher than normal water
levels will prove the reservoir's greater flood control control,
power generation and navigation capabilities. However, higher
water levels will result in the inundation of more land, and will
require more investments, expanded resettlement of local residents
and proportional increases in negative impacts on the ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the normal water storage level of the reservoir
should be maintained at 175 meters, a level which would ensure a
water storage capacity of 39.3 billion cu.m.
</P>
<P>
The highest water level prior to flood season, or the flood
control water level, has been set at 145 meters. The water storage
capacity of 22.15 billion cu.m. allows leeway for the storage of
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
The lowest water mark during the dry season fulfills
requirements for navigation and is set at a level of not lower
than 155 meters.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted water storage capacity is set at 16.5 billion
cu.m. at water levels of between 175-155 meters.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Says Goal Achieved in His U.S. Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said today that his state visit to the United States has
achieved the goal of bringing China-U.S. relations into a new
historical stage of development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described, at a luncheon here, the goal of his nine-day
trip as "enhancing mutual understanding, broadening common ground,
developing cooperation and building a future together."
</P>
<P>
The luncheon was hosted by the Town Hall of Los Angeles, Asia
Society Southern California Center, National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations and U.S.-China People's Friendship
Association West Region Chapter.
</P>
<P>
And it was attended by about 600 guests, including former
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the luncheon, which began with Chinese and
U.S. national anthems, California's governor Pete Wilson welcomed
Jiang to visit Los Angeles and California.
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to California -- the state built with Chinese muscle
in the 19th century and with Chinese genius in the high-tech world
in the 20th century," said Wilson, who highly praised the
contribution by Chinese immigrants to California's development.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century," Wilson noted, "the United States and
China hold the potential to be the world's largest trading
partners, sharing immense productive capacity and offering each
other vast and vary consumer markets."
</P>
<P>
"The enormous mutual benefit that can come from our
relationship of shared peace and prosperity requires on both sides
of the Pacific we make every effort to build that relationship,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will require open, constant and candid communication. When
we do have differences... we must build a relationship of the
understanding, the mutual respect and the trust that will be
required to resolve them," Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Jiang summed up his current visit. "President Clinton
and I agreed that with a view to advancing the lofty cause of
promoting world peace and development, China and the United States
should strengthen cooperation and endeavor to build a constructive
strategic partnership oriented towards the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"This is going to play a positive role in correctly handling
their differences in history, culture, social system and
development level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who held the fifth summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on October 29, is scheduled to wind up his U.S. tour on
Monday. The state visit, the first since 1985, began on October 26.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the guests at the luncheon that both China and the
United States hold that the two "should apply a strategic and
long-term perspective and take a firm hold of the overall
interests" in dealing with China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides stressed that we should further strengthen the
economic cooperation and trade on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit and expand the scale of the China-U.S. trade and
development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Both also agreed that efforts should be made to "intensify the
exchanges between top leaders as well as government departments of
the two countries in order to facilitate timely exchange of views
and opinions on issues of common interest," he added.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, issued after the summit on October 28, said
that a hot line will be established between Beijing and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet level officials of the two countries will have regular
consultations on political, security, arms control issues. There
will be more military cooperation. And they will start the
implementation of the China-U.S. Agreement on the Peaceful Uses of
Nuclear Energy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said both sides agreed the differences between the
two should be "handled properly in the spirit of mutual respect
and treating each other as equals through consultations on an
equal footing."
</P>
<P>
"The two sides should seek common ground while putting aside
their differences that can not be ironed out for the time being,
and should not take their differences in political system and
ideology as barriers to the growth of their relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, in California on the U.S. west coast, is the last
leg of Jiang's U.S. tour. The second largest U.S. city and
Guangzhou, of China, became sister cities in 1981. China is the
second largest overseas trading partner of this U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
Last year, California's exports to China increased by 39
percent over the previous year and Chinese exports through
California ports totaled 21.1 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Summit Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of 15
developing countries (G-15) began here today their seventh annual
summit to review the grouping's progress to chart its future
direction into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit was opened by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders at the summit include Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Indonesian President Soeharto, Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori, Indian Vice President Krishan Kant, Argentine
Vice President Carlos Ruckauf and Jamaican Deputy Prime Minister
Seymour Mullings.
</P>
<P>
Senegal, Mexico and Brazil are represented by their foreign
ministers while Chile's economics minister and Venezuela's
industry and commerce minister are standing for their heads of
government.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 spans three continents and now comprises Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Kenya will be admitted as the 16th member.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the leaders will review the impact of
globalization on their developing economies and discuss measures
to step up trade, investment and technology cooperation, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are set to issue a special statement on the
currency turmoil that has battered Southeast Asia including two
G-15 members, Malaysia and Indonesia, and triggered a meltdown of
stock markets from Hong Kong to Wall Street last week.
</P>
<P>
The statement to be issued at the end of the G-15 Summit will
present the G-15's collective views on the crisis and will also
include proposals on how to deal with the problem, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are also expected to discuss the enhancement of
South-South dialogue apart from development cooperation, and to
boost intra-G-15 trade that stood at 72 billion U.S. dollars last
year as well as the promotion of North-South dialogue.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 1.74 billion and a combined trade volume
of 796 billion U.S. dollars or 7 percent of global trade last
year, the G-15 provides vast opportunities to be tapped by member
countries.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Three Gorges Reservoir Operational in Long Run (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Reservoir will replace ancient Yunmeng and Dongting lakes,
both prone to siltation, to store and manage the release of flood
waters of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
According to mathematical calculations by silt experts, the
reservoir should be able to accommodate 86 percent of anti-flood
storage and 92 percent of adjustable storage after 100 years of
operation. The calculations were based on no more reservoirs being
built on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the
worst-possible silting conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, a group of large reservoirs on the upper reaches on
the Yangtze River are on the agenda for construction before the
2030. Taking into account anti-silt measures in these reservoirs,
the silt deposited in the bottom of the reservoirs after one
century is equivalent to the amount piled up in four decades
without any measures being taken in the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the reservoir's long operational period is
based on a method of "draining the muddy water while reserving the
clear water."
</P>
<P>
Generally, most floods and sediment pour into the reservoir in
the main flood season between July and September. The reservoir
will drain muddy water that carries huge amount of sand and gravel
in the flood season and save clear water in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
As a typical gorge reservoir, most silt deposits come from the
water rather than soil eroded from the shore. Also, the annual
runoff and flood peak discharge on the Yangtze at peak seasons are
much larger than the Yellow River, China's second longest, which
has serious soil erosion. The Yangtze usually carries much less
silt than the Yellow river.
</P>
<P>
All conditions appear to be beneficial for the Three Gorgers
Reservoir's ability to drain huge amounts of muddy water in flood
season while keeping sufficient storage for the dry season.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Dam Won't Affect Navigation on Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sandouping (Three Gorges), November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze
River, the world's third longest, is one of China's leading
transportation routes. One guarantee made by developers of the
Three Gorges Project ensures smooth navigation at the construction
site during the six-year second phase (1997-2003).
</P>
<P>
A water diversion channel opened formerly on October 6. During
the next-phase construction through 2003, ships will use the
channel to bypass the dam site or use temporary locks now being
built on the north bank of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Engineers said that ships can safely pass through the channel
except for peak water flow seasons. When the water flows faster
than 25,000 cubic meters per second, it could be difficult for
large ships to use the channel. The maximum flow for smaller ships
is between 10,000 and 15,000 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Temporary ship locks are being built to ensure safe passage
during the flood season which normally begins in May.
</P>
<P>
The diversion channel will guarantee that passenger and cargo
transport needs are met in the upper reaches of the Yangtze river
during construction.
</P>
<P>
Permanent ship locks will be in operation after the year 2003.

BRASILIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's first space rocket

officials said.
</P>
<P>
The rocket was launched at 10:25 a.m. local time (1225 GMT) but
was destroyed 65 seconds later by remote control at an altitude of
3,230 meters because one of its propulsion engines failed to
ignite, the Globo television reported.
</P>
<P>
Debris of the Brazilian-made Satellite Launch Vehicle (VLS)
rocket plunged into the sea some two kilometers from the Alcantara
space station, in northeastern Maranahao state.
</P>
<P>
The rocket, with a cost of about 6.5 million U.S. dollars, was
scheduled to carry the country's Data Gathering Satellite into
Earth's Orbit to collect environmental and agricultural data.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian space agency officials said Brazil will go ahead with
scheduled launches in each of the next three years and that of the

PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States
cracked 12th-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 in
the final of the Paris Indoor Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old American needed two hours and 11 minutes to

clinic late Saturday to test for a painful right shoulder and
upper arm and he needed painkillers before Sunday's final.
</P>

Sampras, who has currently won 51 tournaments and 10 Grand Slam
singles titles since 1988, finished the year on top of the

entered the world's top 10 for the first time last Monday when he
took 10th spot after reaching the semi-finals in Stuttgart, will

<HEADLINE> Kenyan, Swiss Runners Snatch 1997 NYC Marathon Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- John Kagwe from Kenya crossed
the finish line first at the New York City Marathon here on a
misty Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe's winning time of 2:08:11 was the second fastest time in
the race's 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dream (which) come true for me," said the
28-year-old African runner. He said he won because he used
better tactics this year.
</P>
<P>
Franziska Rochat-Moser, a lawyer from Switzerland, won the
women's race in 2:28:42.
</P>
<P>
The New York Marathon this year followed the same route and
time schedule of the previous ones, but it started in
intermittent drizzles. Some 30,000 runneres surged across the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the city's southwest at the sound of
the starting cannon at 10:35 a.m. Local residents braved the
drizzle, giving their support by shouting to the runners behind
the police brocades.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe has been participating the race and kept improving his
records for the past few years. He was the fifth in the 1995 NYC
Marathon and fourth here last year in 2:10:59.
</P>
<P>
At the finishing line of the Central Park, Manhattan, Kagwe
said his shoe laces got loosened three times at third mile, 10th
mile and about 23th mile respectively. He tightened the first
two, but ignored the last one and ran through the remaining miles
with the loosen laces. "I knew I could not win if I fixed my
laces again this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe said he was too eager to win last year, but did not
succeed. This time he was very patient and followed the first
few fastest runners, including his countryman Kenneth Cheruyot,
who kept the leading position for the first 17 miles.
</P>
<P>
The results of men's race showed that Cheruyot was not among
the first ten.
</P>
<P>
"When has anyone in the recent past won from running alone in
front?" said Tom Fleming, who has twice won the NYC Marathon in
1974 and 1975, and is now a radio commentator.
</P>
<P>
"Winners and record-setters usually run even pace or negative
splits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fellow Kenyan Joseph Chebet came in second at 2:09:27 and
Italian Stefano Baldini was third with a time of 2:09:31.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe won 50,000 U.S. dollars plus a time bonus of 40,000
U.S. dollars and a Kia Sportage automobile.
</P>
<P>
Rochat-Moser, 31, is also the Swiss record holder. She became
the leader at about 20th mile where, she said later, she could
found only male runners around. Rochat-Moser is a lawyer at his
hometown of Crissier, near Lausanne. She is a two-time Olympian
and a veteran of three World Championships. But she took part in
the New York race for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised. I knew I was in good shape,"
Rochat-Moser said.
</P>
<P>
The second finisher was South Africa's Coolleen deReuck, who
ended up at 2:29:11, and Italian Franca Fiacconi covered the
distance at 2:30:15 to take third place.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,800 women were among the 30,000 runners registered
for the 28th New York City Marathon, which passes through all to
the city's five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
The oldese competitors this year was 90-year-old Sam Gadless,
who ran his first New York City Marathon in 1992 and was running
Sunday with his 55-year-old son and his 25-year-old grandson.
</P>
<P>
While the men's winning time was just 11 seconds off the race
record, the women's results were well off the record of 2:24:40
set by Lisa Ondieki of Australia in 1992.

</P>
<P>
He bettered his previous record of 2:09:07 in the Prague
Marathon in May and last year's NYC Marathon best at 2:09:54 set
by Italian Giacomo Leone.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe, born on September 1, 1969, finished fifth NYC Marathon

last year with a 2:10:57 win in the 1996 Amsterdam Marathon, over
a course not noted for producing fast times.
</P>
<P>
In September he won a half-marathon in Luxembourg in 1:00:53,
posting another career best.
</P>
<P>
Italian Stafano Baldini, born on May 25, 1971, won the third
place in the 28th NYC Marathon with 2:09:31. He is a national
record holder with a 2:07:57 clocked at the 1997 London Marathon,
a gap of only two seconds to the champion Antonio Pinto of
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, his best was 2:11:01 from a sixth-place finish
in his marathon debut at the 1995 Venice Marathon.
</P>
<P>
Baldini has excelled in the half-marathon, setting the Italian
record of 1:00:56 with a win in Rome earlier this year.
