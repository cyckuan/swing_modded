<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Evict Beduin Tribe Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police on Tuesday
moved a Jahalin Beduin tribe living near the Ma'aleh Adumim Jewish
settlement back to a nearby village, the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
About 35 families of the tribe returned to their destroyed
homes near the settlement in the east of Jerusalem early in the
day. The Israeli police went there again and evicted them back to
the village of Kedar, the JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police on Monday drove the Jahalin Beduin tribe to
Kedar in so-called compliance with a 1996 High Court ruling that
the tribe was squatting on state land. Bulldozers leveled the
tents and tin shacks of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, minister for Jerusalem affairs of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) who went to the site during
Monday's eviction, criticized the Israeli move.
</P>
<P>
He said the eviction violated the peace accords between the PNA
and Israel, under which neither side should take unilateral
actions that will prejudice the final status talks of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the nomadic Arab Beduin tribe Mohammad Hiresh
said on monday that the tribe, living in the area near the
settlement for 40 years, refuses to move to Kedar.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli High Court rejected the final petition against the
removal of the tribe last September. It said the Beduin tribe
could be moved to Kedar, which the Israeli government has set
aside for it.
</P>
<P>
The nomadic tribe has fought for 15 years not to leave the
place they have been living. But the Israeli authority has refused
to accept that.

<HEADLINE> IMF Said Not to Be Against Indonesia's Currency Peg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
(IMF) senior official PR. Narvekar said here Tuesday that the IMF
does not basically have any objection toward the possible
implementation of the Currency Board System (CBS) in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The CBS is only one of the aspects that could solve the
economic problems, Narvekar, who was assigned to coordinate with
the Indonesian government, said after meeting with President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government is still studying the possibility of
implementing the CBS with the aim of overcoming the financial
crisis. Under the system, the rupiah, the national currency, will
be pegged at a certain U.S. dollar value along with other foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Indonesia's State Minister of National Development
Planning Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the government will consult
the IMF over its plan to adopt the CBS.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the IMF's stand on the Indonesian plan to implement
the CBS, Narvekar said the system has been implemented in some
countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said
that if the CBS was implemented he could not recommend to the IMF
Executive Board to continue its economic bailout program in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and IMF have agreed to implement an economic reform
program, including economic and financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF-approved program, the world financial institution
pledged to grant 10 billion dollars in financial assistance to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is to provide 4.5 billion dollars, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) 3.5 billion dollars while Indonesia
prepares 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries have also pledged to contribute various
amounts of funds, making the whole economic reform package worth
43 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> German Industry Increases Research and Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- German industry is stepping up
its research and development efforts, investing 61.67 billion
marks (34.25 billion U.S. dollars) in the field last year, up 3.6
percent from 1996, it was reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the German Science Sponsorship
Federation, a survey of companies showed that the chemical and
electronics sectors in Germany would, in particular, increase
their research spending this year.
</P>
<P>
Research and development investment accounted for 1.51 percent
of Germany's gross domestic product in 1997. The proportion was
second only to Sweden's 2.68 percent in Europe, and came fifth
after those in Sweden, South Korea, Japan and the United States in
the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the proportion was 1.81 percent in Germany, it was
noted.
</P>
<P>
Germany has also seen declined employment in the field of
research and development over recent years, the report said. In
1989, about 300,000 people in then West Germany were involved in
new research, compared to 277,000 people in 1996 several years
after the German reunification.

<HEADLINE> Controversial French Writer Honored in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- French writer Roger Garaudy, who
was recently tried by a French court for disputing the number of
Jews killed in World War II, received the highest Muslim honor in
Egypt on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, 84, was received by Imam al Azhar, the highest
authority among Sunni Muslims. He was decorated with the "Medal of
Preaching of Islam" in recognition of his service to Islam.
</P>
<P>
Formerly a Catholic and a member of the French Communist
Party, Garaudy was converted to Islam in 1982.
</P>
<P>
In his controversial book, "The Founding Myths of Israeli
Politics," published in 1996, the writer asserts that the number
of Jews killed by Nazi Germany in World War II was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, who translated the Koran into French, has won much
popularity in the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The verdict for contesting crimes against humanity could draw
one year in prison or a 50,000 U.S. dollar fine. The verdict in
Garaudy's trial will be announced on February 27.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid from WFP Comes into Great Lakes Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of tons of food
offered by the World Food Program (WFP) arrived at Kenya's
Mombasa port Tuesday to help ease mounting food crisis in the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The WFP-chartered vessel Storm Wind docked mid-day at the
Indian Ocean port, carrying with 25,000 tons of maize which will
provide a ration for 1.4 million people for one and a half
months.
</P>
<P>
The food will be divided among Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, said the WFP regional office in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The organization plans to offer 250,000 tons of food, ten
times of this operation's, to the 1.4 million people living in
the Great Lakes region throughout the whole 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge now will be to transport the food in-land,"
said Allen Jones, Regional Manager for WFP's Great Lakes
operation.
</P>
<P>
El Nino floods have severed major transport links from both
Mombasa and Dar es Salaam ports, forcing WFP to resort to longer
and slower alternative delivery routes.

In addition, even if foreign creditors agree to reschedule
debts owed by South Korean companies now in a virtual state of

JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and
Mauritius Tuesday signed an investment protection agreement in
Cape Town, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Closer economic cooperation and the protection of investments
topped talks between South African President Nelson Mandela and
visiting Mauritian Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam, said
SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said although bilateral relations were very strong
and close, there was room for even closer economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
heads of state summit, which will be held in Mauritius in
September, was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is chairman of the SADC.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, with a 14 percent share of the Mauritian market,

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE Negotiators Reach Agreement on Heavy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators meeting at the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) have
reached agreement on protocols on heavy metals and persistent
organic pollutants (POPs) to the Convention on Long-range
Transboundary Air Pollution.
</P>
<P>
Both protocols are ready to be adopted and signed in Arhus,
Denmark, in June on the occasion of the fourth Ministerial
Conference "Environment for Europe", according to a UN/ECE press
release here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy metals and POPs are known to be a threat to health and to
cause damage to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Heavy metals can cause blood disorders and affect vital organs
such as the liver and the kidneys. The ongoing accumulation of
heavy metals is also a considerable stress factor for the forest
ecosystem and for tree vitality.
</P>
<P>
In addition, birds and mammals risk reproductive impairment
through increased exposure to mercury in contaminated prey,
especially in acidified habitats.
</P>
<P>
Very high concentrations of POPs have long been associated with
a number of carcinogenic and other health effects. In recent
years, however, there has been growing evidence that POPs can have
much more subtle effects even at very low concentrations.
</P>
<P>
POPs are thought to cause birth defects and reduce male sperm
counts. They may also have a detrimental effect on physical and
intellectual development, and damage the immune system.
</P>
<P>
The draft protocol on heavy metals targets three particularly
harmful substances: lead, cadmium and mercury.
</P>
<P>
The draft protocol on POPs focuses on a list of 16 substances,
which have been singled out according to certain risk criteria:
</P>
<P>
-- Pesticides: aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, DDT, dieldrin,
endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, toxaphene,
hexachlorocyclohexane (including lindane);
</P>
<P>
-- Industrial chemicals: hexabromobiphenyl, polychlorinated
biphenyls;
</P>
<P>
-- By-products or contaminants: dioxins, furans, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons.

KATHMANDU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the German government have agreed
to provide a total of 17 million U.S. dollars in aid to Nepal, the
official RSS news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's 2.5-million-dollars is for implementing a Micro
Enterprises Development Program, which aims to alleviate rural
poverty through the development of micro enterprises and the
creation of sustainable micro enterprise support service
mechanisms that will enable low-income families to achieve
sustainable livelihood based on local demand.
</P>
<P>
The program will be implemented in 10 districts in the hill and
Terai areas. The Terai plain in southern Nepal is the country's
main grain producer.
</P>
<P>
The 14.5 million dollars granted by Germany aims to implement
an urban development program, a biogas program, a family planning
program, the Middle Marsyangdi hydro-electric project and a road

BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's (EU) executive body, approved a package of
humanitarian aid Tuesday worth 17 million ECUs (approximately 20
million U.S. dollars) for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Commission is also drawing up plans to make available a
separate aid package for 1.77 million ECUs (about 2.1 million
dollars) for victims of the earthquake that hit northern
Afghanistan in February.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive noted that living standards and conditions in
Afghanistan have steadily deteriorated over 20 years of civil
unrest.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan's 20 million people are becoming increasingly
vulnerable," a statement issued on Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
There was massive damage to the infrastructure throughout the
country even before the earthquake in the north. In the south
of the country, the Taliban interpretation of Islamic law has
also endangered access to humanitarian aid, particularly for women
and several non-Pashtu ethnic groups, according to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office
(ECHO), will enable humanitarian organizations to carry out a
coordinated program over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The ECHO program, funded with 17 million ECUs, will focus on
removing landmines, the provisioning of drinking water and
sanitation services, shelter for returning displaced families,
relief assistance for women heads of households and other
vulnerable groups.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Delegation to Visit Freetown on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is to visit Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, Wednesday, the Nigerian military
disclosed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After an on-the-spot assessment of the situation there, the
delegation of foreign ministers from the ECOWAS committee of five
on Sierra Leone will decide when to restore President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, who has been in exile in neighboring Guinea since his
ousting last May.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord signed between the committee and the
junta which overthrew Kabbah's government in the coup, the
elected president will be reinstated on April 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
The committee is composed of foreign ministers from Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, the junta refused to implement the accord, setting
conditions for the peace process to end the disturbance in the
poor west African country.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG last Thursday
broke into Freetown and ousted the junta led by Johnny Paul
Koroma, who is fleeing for alleged comeback from the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Nearly five days after the capture of the capital, the
Nigerian-led peacekeeping force has attained firm control of the
entire Freetown peninsula.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian defense spokesman Col. Godwin Ugbo,
ECOMOG is now carrying out a peace building mission in Freetown
to save lives and property.
</P>
<P>
"What ECOMOG is doing is to ensure that peace returns to the
town and government functionaries start working," said Ugbo, who
is the acting director of defense information.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is consolidating its victory in Freetown, mopping up
the area and moving to other towns and villages to ensure that
the junta did not or do not re-jump, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the junta has barracks in cities like
Bo in the south and Kenema in the north.
</P>
<P>
"So ECOMOG is moving to these areas to ensure that the junta
troops will not re-group as they were doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, refused to confirm the report that a
Nigerian officer in ECOMOG has been named as th head of an ad hoc
administrative body to oversee affairs of Sierra Leone until the
return of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
"One of the section commanders is sent to see the peace we are
fighting for is being built up," Ugbo said.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to give the name of the section commander.
</P>
<P>
Ugbo said "many" junta troops have surrendered to ECOMOG but
did not give any figure.
</P>
<P>
They are treated as prisoners of war and ECOMOG will not shoot
them, he promised.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Faces Water Shortage in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 17 (xinhua) -- Weather changes have caused
serious water shortages in agricultural production across the
country Vietnam, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Since early January, there has been almost no rain in Vietnam,
except some on January 18 and 19 in parts of Quang Ngai and Binh
Dinh Provinces, with rainfall ranging from 60-100 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese agricultural authority has instructed localities to
repair and complete irrigation works, and work out a management
plan for water sources, with a view to ensuring water for the
winter-spring crops in case droughts occur.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, almost all reservoirs have been opened
one or two times to supply water for agricultural
production. Reservoirs in the country's central provinces even
limited their supply to reserve water.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 9,600 hectares of winter-spring rice, in
Quang Nam Province's northern districts, are suffering
drought. Authorities in the province have instructed agricultural
and power services to concentrate efforts on overcoming the
drought.
</P>
<P>
In the Mekong River delta, together with the threat of drought,
the encroachment of sea water deep into paddy fields during dry
season is also threatening the winter-spring crop.
</P>
<P>
The most affected areas are in Long Xuyen quadrangle and an
area next to Cai Lon River. About 10,000 hectares on the western
bank of the Hau River in Kien Qiang Province are also affected by
salt water.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural service has instructed these localities to
bring water from Chem Chem and Ong Doc rivers to these areas for
desalinization.
</P>
<P>
The service has also warned localities in the Mekong River
delta of sea water entering inland crop fields during the dry
season.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Retreats From Support for Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain seems to be sending
confusing signals as to whether it will allow U.S. forces to use
its soil for possible military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry on Tuesday issued a statement, in
Arabic, saying Manama "has not yet allowed U.S. warplanes to use
its lands for any military action against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
But the statement's English version said Bahrain "will not
allow its land to be used for any military action against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Both of the statements, however, stressed Bahrain's belief that
diplomatic efforts should be redoubled "to help reach a peaceful
settlement of the current Iraqi crisis."
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, therefore, it seems that Bahrain, which
hosts the headquarters of the 5th fleet of the United States, is
backing down from its previously reported position on the Iraqi
crisis over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Manama has reportedly agreed to allow U.S. warplanes to use its
soil in a possible attack on Iraq during U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to the country early this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. now has 39 warplanes stationed in the Sheik Isa air
base in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Of the front-line Gulf Arab states, Kuwait and Oman have
voiced their clear-cut support for the U.S. tough line against
Baghdad by agreeing earlier this month to allow U.S. warplanes to
hit Iraq from their soil.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, refused to be a springboard
for the U.S.-led operation. But together with Qatar, which
remained undecided, it voiced no objection to the possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United Arab Emirates is the first and only Gulf

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Tuesday that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan should deliver an
"unambiguous" message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein when he
flies to Baghdad for a last-ditch diplomatic effort to avert a
military showdown between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.N. Security
Council would discuss Annan's mission on Tuesday in New York.
The United States wants "to make clear that he has a very
unambiguous message to deliver" to Saddam on compliance with
U.N. resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said President Bill Clinton was to speak to the joint
chiefs of staff at the Pentagon at about 12:00 p.m. EST
(1700GMT) to "make it clear that the United States is prepared
to act and it's now up to Saddam Hussein to end the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, Clinton would meet his top foreign policy
advisers, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security adviser Sandy Berger and receive a status
report on U.S. forces deployed in the Gulf region, McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Growth Down in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial growth
slumped to 2.4 percent last December, bringing down the growth
rate for the first nine months of the 1997-98 fiscal year starting
April 1 to 4.7 percent compared to 8.6 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The index of industrial production (IIP) released Tuesday
showed that the manufacturing sector recorded a 2.6 percent growth
in December as against the 7.4 percent growth the previous month
and 5.6 percent in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the sector, which accounts for three-fourths of the
total IIP weightage, has remained poor for most of the year with
cumulative April-December figures coming down to 4.5 percent
against 10.6 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
After a robust 21.5 percent growth in November, the consumer
durables sector also slipped into negative in December at 0.9
percent with cumulative growth rates falling to 8 percent from 9
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Mirroring the overall poor growth in December, growth in both
the basic goods and intermediate goods segments slowed down to 4.5
and 9.8 percent respectively as against 4.6 and 10.0 percent
recorded in November.

<HEADLINE> VW to Pay E.U. Fine, But Still to Challenge it </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wolfsburg, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe's largest carmaker
Volkswagen Tuesday said it would pay the 102 million ECU (112.2
million U.S. dollars) fine imposed by the European Union
Commission for alleged unfair business practices, but it was still
planning to challenge it.
</P>
<P>
According to the German company, it was making preparations to
bring a suit against the E.U. Commission before the European Court
of Justice in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
VW has till March 28 to file the suit, two months after the
Commission announcement of the fine on it.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. Commission charged VW with systematically preventing
its dealers in Italy from selling cars to private German customers
in order to stop a rising "re-import" business.
</P>
<P>
The re-import deals enable Germans to buy German-made cars at a
much lower price in another E.U. country by taking advantage of
lower tax rates.
</P>
<P>
VW has denied the E.U. charge and regards the imposition of
fine as unjust.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Four members of the
Philippines' ruling coalition Lakas-NUCD, including two
congressmen, bolted the coalition on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia, also the presidential candidate
of the Lakas-NUCD, tried but failed to persuade the four to stay
inside the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House Representative Rolando Zamora said that 25
more Lakas-NUCD congressmen are expected to leave the ruling
coalition soon and join the united opposition led by Vice
President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Such an exodus of Lakas-NUCD members to the opposition is
expected due to the growing political ambitions of its members who
can not be accommodated by the ruling coalition, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there is difficulty choosing Lakas-NUCD
candidates for local posts, as two or more members are vying for
the same post.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the expected exodus would deal a heavy blow to
the ruling coalition in the coming May 11 elections.

<HEADLINE> D-8 Aquaculture Workshop Opens in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A three-day workshop on
aquaculture in eight developing countries known as D-8 countries
opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Turkey, Indonesia, Nigeria, Egypt and Malaysia. The group of D-8
countries was formally launched in June 1997 in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the workshop, Pakistani
Minister for Food, Agriculture and Livestock Abdul Sattar Lalika
said
"fisheries sector plays a significant role in the economies of
many developing countries through its contribution to income,
employment and supply of food to millions of people all over the
world."
</P>
<P>
He said: "fishery products are a rich source of foreign
exchange earnings to many developing economies including D-8
countries."
</P>
<P>
"The volume of international fish trade has grown substantially
over the years, hence the importance of developing countries in
this trade will continue to grow," Lalika said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has been exporting its fish and fishery
products in raw frozen form, so there is a need to produce
value-added fish products in order to earn better prices from the
exports.
</P>
<P>
"Fisheries sector is the grey area where we would like to seek
cooperation and assistance among D-8 member countries in order to
develop value-added fish products," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to secure future supplies of fish it will
become necessary to depend on large scale fish farming, as most of
the natural fish stock of the D-8 countries are now fully
exploited.
</P>
<P>
"We shall have to depend on fish farming on a larger scale in
order to meet this target," Lalika stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the experts from D-8 member countries
during the workshop will focus on developing a future strategy for
the development of aquaculture in the region.

HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean National
Liberation War Collaborators Association said Tuesday that it
will organize mass demonstration on February 26 if the government
fails to meet its demands by then.
</P>
<P>
Ranjinos Kawara, chairman of the association, told the
Zimbabwean News Agency that his association wanted the government
to recognize the role played by the couriers during the
liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
The members of the association wanted 50,000 Zimbabwean
Dollars (about 3,000 U.S. Dollars) gratuities paid to each of
more than 50,000 ex-combatants in December last year, as well as
tax-free monthly pensions of 2,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (118 U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We can not continue to suffer yet we were very instrumental
in the attainment of independence in this country," Kawara said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, members of the association were caught in a
dilemma as donors were now reluctant to fund their projects
because of their affiliation to the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF).
</P>
<P>
"Unless the president addresses our plight," said Kawara, "we
are going to mobilize at least 200 people from each province to
go on the streets."
</P>
<P>
There are ten provinces in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> WHO Director General: Food Import Bans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Food import bans are
inappropriate for fighting cholera, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima,
Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), has
stated in a formal document to WHO member states.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the placing of embargoes on the importation of
food such as seafood, fresh water fish and vegetables is not an
appropriate course of action to prevent the international spread
of cholera, and can represent an additional burden on the economy
of the affected countries," a WHO press release on Monday quoted
Nakajima as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima made the statement in a Note Verbale, which is a
formal WHO document sent by the Director-General to member states.
</P>
<P>
He felt it indispensable to clarify the potential of the
bacterium which causes cholera, Vibrio cholerae 01, to be
transmitted to humans via food after several countries recently
placed an embargo on the import of fresh fish from a number of
cholera-infected countries.
</P>
<P>
Cases of cholera have occurred occasionally as result of eating
food, usually seafood, transported across international borders by
individual travellers, Nakajima pointed out, but WHO has never
documented an outbreak of cholera resulting from commercially
imported food.
</P>
<P>
The foods that cause the greatest concern to importing
countries are seafood, freshwater fish, and vegetables that may be
consumed raw, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
WHO believes that the best way to deal with food imports from
cholera-affected areas is for importing countries to agree, with
the food exporters, on Good Hygienic Practices which need to be
followed during food handling and processing to prevent, eliminate
or minimize the risk of any potential contamination and to set up
arrangements to obtain assurance that these measures are
adequately carried out.

<HEADLINE> Disease Devastates Coffee in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Wilt disease is spreading in
12 districts in western and central Uganda, Edward Lutakome
Sentamu, an official from Uganda Coffee Development Authority
(UCDA) has said.
</P>
<P>
Sentamu told a Rotarians' meeting that the districts of
Bundibugyo, Kabarole, Hoima and Rukungiri are the most seriously
hit ones where an average of 40-50 percent of coffee farms are
affected or even whole coffee fields were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The disease was first reported in neighboring Democratic
Republic of Congo, Sentamu said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Ministry of Agriculture, National
Agriculture Research Organisation and UCDA has created a task
force in 1996 to coordinate attempts to eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease are yellow leaves, wilting, rapid
leaf defoliation and cracks or cankers in the advanced stages
around the collar of the stems.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately there is no report of the disease in the northern
and eastern parts of the country, which are also coffee producing
areas.
</P>
<P>
The official advised local farmers to patrol their coffee
fields to identify the early symptoms, destroy the completely
infected plants and restrict movement of infected plant materials
to prevent further spreading of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export earns 65 percent of foreign exchange for the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz and visiting head of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization's political department Farouq Qaddoumi Tuesday called
on the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to visit
Baghdad in a bid to defuse the Iraqi-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is Annan's responsibility to travel to Baghdad," Boueiz
said at a meeting with Qaddoumi, who arrived in Lebanon Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
As diplomatic efforts so far failed to produce a peaceful
solution to the current crisis, the international community began
to pin its last hope on a possible visit by Annan in a bid to
avoid a U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said that it would attack Iraq if Baghdad refused
to give U.N. arms experts free access to its presidential sites
suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said a possible U.S. attack against Iraq is totally
unjustifiable, and warned Arab countries against letting
Washington to use their lands to launch the attack.
</P>
<P>
Qaddoumi updated Boueiz on the deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli
peace process, saying that Israeli government is unwilling to
implement the existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the peace process had become the victim of the
Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Calls for More Investment in Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Investment incentives,
cheaper labor, a successful record of oil exploration and growing
energy needs have made Pakistan an attractive place for
investment, President Rafiq Tarar said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of a two-day Oil and Gas Summit
here, Tarar said: "Pakistan is a large and fast growing market for
energy" and its expanding economy was a good reason to lure in
foreign investors both in oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the second of its kind, is being attended by 370
delegates from 26 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Policy announced by the government last year,
which focuses on promoting oil and gas exploration in the
offshore, is designed to attract private sector investment, said
Tarar.
</P>
<P>
He called for wider use of gas from Pakistan's neighbors in the
north and the west as a cheaper substitute for oil.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas currently meet over 80 percent of Pakistan's
primary commercial energy needs. Availability of affordable energy
supplies is directly related to the development of the economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has one of the world's largest coal fields in Thar
desert in the province of Sindh. However, the present contribution
of coal to the country's energy supply mix is just six percent.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan must exploit to the maximum the vast, untapped
resources of coal to meet its growing needs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that foreign private investors would come
and help in exploiting Pakistan's coal potential.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Output Records No Increase in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial output
did not show any increase in January for the first time since late
1996, the Federal Reserve Board reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities was
flat last month following growth of 0.4 percent in December and
0.7 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The decline was partly blamed on the El Nino weather patterns
which have given much of the warmer weather for January. Output at
the nation's electric and natural gas utilities fell by 4 percent
last month because of the sharp decline in demand. Utility output
had risen 1.4 percent in December after having fallen 2.2 percent
in November.
</P>
<P>
Output at the country's factories and plants actually picked up
in January by 0.3 percent, only slightly below the 0.4 percent
gain in December. However, both months reprepresented a sharp
slowdown from manufacturing growth of 1 percent in November and
0.8 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1997, industrial production rose by 5 percent, the
best showing since 1994 as demand was strong for a variety of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe there will be a slowdown in 1998 as the U.S.
economy feels the impact of the financial crisis in Asia. The
steep plunge in currencies and recessionary conditions in a number
of countries are expected to cut sharply into U.S. exports while
the U.S. economy is expected to see a flood of cheaper Asian
imports.
</P>
<P>
The nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 83
percent of capacity in January, down from 83.3 percent in
December. In manufacturing, the operating rate stood at 82.1
percent, down slightly from 82.3 percent in December.

Iraqi foreign minister Mohamed Said al-Sahhaf Tuesday afternoon,
French President Jacques Chirac said that a diplomatic solution to
the Iraqi crisis is still possible, but time is running out.
</P>
<P>
"Today, a diplomatic solution strictly conforming with the

"The ways of talks are not all exhausted as long as Kofi Annan
has not made this visit," said the French president.
</P>
<P>
Chirac again called on Iraq to "scrupulously" implement the all
the U.N. resolutions, which he said is the only way for Iraq to
get the return ticket to the international community.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Iraq to take further compromise measures and to
open its presidential sites to the U.N. inspectors now.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that Iraq will receive in a positive way all
"balanced proposals and suggestions."

said the government wants to attract sizable investment,
particularly in petroleum exploration to relieve the country of a
large annual oil import bill.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has to spend about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars annually
on oil imports. It has become a major cause of the foreign
exchange drain straining the resources for national development.
</P>
<P>
Nasar said Pakistan's reliance on oil and gas has reached 80
percent of its total primary energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imports most of its oil needs and the indigenous
natural gas supplies are insufficient to meet the demand, said
Nasar.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has already taken a number of bold
policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Petroleum Policy, he said, has its primary focus on
offshore exploration, oil refining and development of the
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also committed itself to creating
a peaceful environment to promote oil and gas exploration and
production activities in some tribal areas of Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
"We would welcome initiatives as well as suggestions by the
operating companies in these concessions for facilitation of
exploration," said Nasar.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being attended by 370 delegates from 26
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Rethink Asia Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- American companies are adjusting
their expansion plans in Asia as fewer American workers are being sent
there because of the region's financial upheaval.
</P>
<P>
"Companies are taking a short-term look at this," said Chuck Sweet
at A.T. Kearney Executive Search in Chicago on Monday."They are
cutting their liabilities and bringing their expatriates home."
</P>
<P>
Of about 48,000 U.S. expatriates working in Indonesia at the end of
last December, fewer than 16,000 will remain by March, according to
government estimates reported in the South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Many American workers in Asia may find their wages slashed as some
U.S. firms that traditionally pay expatriates workers in U.S. dollars
are paying partly in local currency.
</P>
<P>
The trend to send fewer U.S. workers abroad is being driven by
several factors. The main reason is that Asian labor costs less and
is abundant. Another one is growing pressure in the region to hire
local labor.

KUWAIT CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister
Tony Blair Tuesday reiterated Britain's support to Kuwait after
Iraq gave a warning to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister made the pledge in a telephone call
to Kuwait Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Blair asserted, during the telephone conversation, his

The agency said that the two leaders also discussed the latest

</P>
<P>
The phone call was made after Iraqi Foreign Minister Saeed
Al-Sahhaf said in Beirut Monday that Kuwait will "bear the
consequences" if it allows the U.S. forces to attack Iraq from its
soil.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London have threatened to strike Iraq if

<HEADLINE> Israel Demands Extradition of Palestinian Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu demanded on Tuesday that the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) extradite terror suspects to Israel if it
wants the peace process to advance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to family members of terror victims, Netanyahu said
the PNA must know that if it does not fight the terrorists, it
cannot expect Israel to make new political concessions.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo accords obligate the PNA to extradite the terrorists
to Israel, an action believed to be a deterrence to terrorism,
Netanyahu added.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel has handed over a list of 34 terror suspects to
the PNA, but the PNA has turned down the request to extradite the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Despite Netanyahu's remarks, Israel and the PNA are stepping up
contacts in an effort to break the deadlock in their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Following Netanyahu's recent secret meetings with senior
Palestinian officials, his attorney Yithzak Molcho also held talks
with PNA President Yasser Arafat in Jordan on various ideas of
bridging the gap.
</P>
<P>
And negotiators of the two sides are scheduled to resume talks
on Wednesday about the interim issues, including the Gaza airport
and seaport, and the opening of a safe passage between the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has deadlocked since last
March when Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement at Har Homa
in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as capital of
their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Armed Hutu Insurgency Loses Steam in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The armed Hutu insurgency
behind the wave of violence that hit northwestern Rwanda in the
past months is on the wane, Rwandan army spokesman, Major
Emmanuel Ndahiro was quoted by Rwanda News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ndahiro, the intense political mobilisation of
local population coupled with increased army operations against
the Hutu extremists has started to pay off.
</P>
<P>
"Those operations have pushed the enemy to resort to desperate
acts of terrorism against the local population in an attempt to
coerce them to support the insurgency," Ndahiro indicated.
</P>
<P>
Recent incidents are a clear testimony of the cruel methods
used by the armed criminals to terrorize local Hutu villagers who
have now started to turn against them.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, an armed gang massacred six civilians in
Ngororero, southern Gisenyi Prefecture on grounds that they had
tipped the army about their activities.
</P>
<P>
"The six civilians were unarmed Hutu residents. The criminals
beat them, cut off their noses accusing them of being traitors,"
Ndahiro underscored.
</P>
<P>
All these brutal massacres have roused strong anti-insurgency
feeling among the local population who accuse the Hutu extremists
of having failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
It is said that last Saturday, residents of Runinga village in
Rungi sector, Kibilira commune in southern Gisenyi, netted three
infiltrators, disarmed them before beating them to death.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Gisenyi indicated that the Hutu insurgents who
encroached on food reserves belonging to local families to carry
on their guerilla activities, have aroused anger among local
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Despite this pressure on the insurgents, some isolated groups
of criminals continue the violence in parts of Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a group of the armed infiltrators ambushed two
vehicles on Kigali - Ruhengeri road, killing three civilians.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not possible to have this report independently
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu extremists, most of whom former Rwandan government
soldiers and the notorious "Interahamwe" militia, stepped up a
campaign of violence in northwestern Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
This campaign followed the 1996-1997 massive returns of
refugees from former Zaire and Tanzania which aided these groups
to sneak into the country.
</P>
<P>
These groups have formed an alliance with Burundi Hutu
extremists fighting the regime in Bujumbura.

<HEADLINE> Bodies of Nine S. Africans to Be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The remains of nine
South Africans who died in an air crash in Kenya Friday will be
flown home Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The autopsies of the bodies have been concluded and final
authorization and arrangements for the repatriation have been
completed, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Kenyan Directorate for Civil Aviation is continuing with
an official investigation into the accident."
</P>
<P>
The cause of the tragedy is not known at the stage. But some
experts blamed bad weather and the pilot's unfamiliarity with the
surroundings of the Wilson Airport, where the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
The South Africans, including the owner of the plane and four
journalists, died when their plane crashed in a mountain near
Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
The plane, one of two bought from Switzerland for a new
tourism venture in South Africa, was on a delivery flight.

<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government offered
here Tuesday a cautious welcome to U.N.Secretary General Kofi
Annan's planned visit to Iraq, but expressed doubts over prospects
of the last-ditch effort to defuse the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at British parliament Tuesday afternoon, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that the London government was
"optimistic that we can secure an agreed authority for the
Secretary General to travel to Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
However, Cook, whose country maintains a tough position over
Iraq, also expressed doubts over the prospects of Annan's trip,
saying, "I cannot express the same confidence to the House about
the prospects for his success in Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
"That will depend entirely on whether Saddam is willing to take
seriously the visit of the most senior U.N. official and whether
Saddam is ready to recognize that any agreement must be fully
consistent with the U.N. resolutions," Cook added.
</P>
<P>
The British government, which refuses to rule out the
possibility of use of force, has sent one of its aircraft carrier
and 18 war planes to the Gulf region.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-two percent of French
people think that nuclear energy will play a far more important
role than other energies 10 years from now, according to a poll
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll was made by the BVA polling institute in December 1997
among 2,004 people representative of all walks of life in France,
according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven percent of the people polled said that France
should continue to use its nuclear centers, while only 15 percent
said nuclear centers should be closed.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent said that electricity from nuclear centers
is the cheapest.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six percent said that by replacing oil, gas and coal with
nuclear power, France has reduced its emission of greenhouse
effect gases, and 64 percent said France has won independence in
energy supply through developing nuclear power.

<HEADLINE> Asian Students Do better at School by Studying Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Researchers said that the
reason why Asian students do better at school than their Western
counterparts lies in the fact that the former think one must work
hard to do well while the latter believe the quality of teaching
is the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study by Harold Stevenson, a psychologist from the
University of Michigan, local press reports said Tuesday that
students from the Far East take responsibility themselves for
their academic achievement and believe that every one can improve
their study by working hard.
</P>
<P>
However, Western children and their parents let others, the
teacher in particular, to take responsibility for their
performance.
</P>
<P>
That is the main reason why Westerners, and Americans in
particular, lag behind Asians at maths and science, said Harold
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another reason is that Westerners are easily
satisfied with their performance at school, which robbed Western
parents and children of the motivation to do better.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said that in a survey of several thousand mothers, 40
percent of Americans said they were very pleased with their
child's academic achievement despite the poor results of American
students compared with their Asian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
However, only fewer than five percent of Chinese and Japanese
have the same opinion.

<HEADLINE> EU Defends Ban on Import of Fish Fillets From E. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
has defended its embargo on importing fish fillets from Tanzania
and other east African countries after they made an appeal for
lifting the ban as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Tuesday, Head of the
European Commission in Tanzania, Peter Beck Christiansen, said
the ban only applies to fresh fish fillets.
</P>
<P>
"While the temporary ban on fresh fish exports is regrettable,
it should be noted that it does not apply to exports of frozen
fish products nor does it apply to on-board processed sea fish,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Christiansen explained that the export ban was necessitated by
cholera outbreaks in east African countries. "In Tanzania the
incidence rate of cholera has been the highest in Africa," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the spread of cholera, the EU countries last
December imposed an embargo of imports of fresh fillets from
Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the ban means that the country will be unable to
export 6,000 tons of fresh fish fillets to EU countries, which
may incur a loss of nearly seven million US dollars a year, said
Zakia Meghji, Minister fro Natural Resources and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Christiansen told reporters that EU banned exportation of
fresh fish from the region because they were worried that the
fish products may carry cholera bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based World Health Organization, however, has
disagreed with EU on the ban.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated to reporters last week, WHO
director-general said the organization has not documented any
outbreak of cholera resulting from commercially imported food,
despite the fact that a minimum of 50 countries in the world have
been affected by the epidemic or endemic cholera each year since
1961.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the embargo "is not an appropriate course of
action to prevent the international spread of cholera, and can
represent an additional burden on the economy of affected
countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Christiansen further explained that the EU standing committee
will meet "very soon" to review the issue of export of fish from
Tanzania. But he would not give an exact date.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, said that EU is determined to protect
its countries and at the same time assist Tanzania in its fishing
industry. Fish exportation is said to be Tanzania's second
largest foreign exchange earner following tourism.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, Tanzania has made efforts to improve
standard of hygiene at fish processing facilities close to Lake
Victoria, to the satisfaction of EU.
</P>
<P>
"Our health inspectors noted major improvements in the
standard of hygiene when they visited the fish processing
facilities in Mwanza last December," Christiansen said.

<HEADLINE> PLC Supports Diplomatic Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) has called on all Arab nations to stand behind a
diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis and oppose any U.S.-led
military strike against the country.
</P>
<P>
The PLC made this call on Tuesday in a special session held in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, according to Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center, a Palestinian media service.
</P>
<P>
The PLC warned that using military forces on Iraq will be bad
for the region in general and for the Middle East peace process in
particular. It called on all Arab nations to support Iraqi people
in the time of need.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PLC held Israeli government totally responsible
for the impasse of the peace process, because it is continuing
with activities of "settlement, confiscation of lands and
judaizing Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
It urged the Palestinian National Authority to continue to
pool its efforts to bring the peace process back on track and to
carry out the actions based on the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
The PLC renewed its call for strengthening national unity
without delay.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, PNA minister of local government and chief
negotiator, told the PLC session that the United States is
planning to present a new plan to move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed the hope that the United States should carry
out its mediation on the basis of the signed agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Diouf, Director
General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), said Tuesday that FAO has taken vital steps to realize the
Rome Declaration on world food security and world food security
plan of actions at national levels.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Diouf when he was meeting Ethiopian
President Negasso Gidada.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry,
Diouf said that FAO has drawn a food security strategy for 150
countries with a view to enabling them achieve food self-

</P>
<P>
On Africa's food production, Diouf said that FAO is preparing
an investment plan to promote infrastructure and agricultural
activities in Africa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angolan Peace Deadline Still Set on Feb 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Committee of the
Angolan Peace Process declared here Tuesday that the deadline for
the peace process is still set on the the predestined February
28.
</P>
<P>
The committee's spokesman Laura Melo said after Tuesday's
conference that she was worried by the slow process of the
rebuilding of government institutions in areas controlled by the
former rebel force -- the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
She said that the rebuilding of government institutions in
UNITA areas, especially in the two strategic cities of Bailundo
and Andulo, where the UNITA headquarters are based, failed to
meet the plan as agreed by both the Angolan government and UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The committee feels it a pity for the violations of the peace
agreement, she said, calling both sides to take a refrained and
cooperative stance so as to keep the situation from further
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Some incidents harmful for the country's peace process have
been reported recently.
</P>
<P>
Many people have evacuated from the central Angola's Huambo
province and Huila Province where the remnants of the UNITA
military had made some terrorist actions. The Chicuma city in
eastern Angola's Benguela province has been captured by former
UNITA military.

<HEADLINE> Syria: U.S. Needs UN License to Strike Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa said Tuesday any military strike against Iraq
should require a license from the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"A fresh military strike on Iraq requires a new Security
Council resolution which is now lacking," Sharaa told reporters
upon his arrival at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who met the Syrian
minister upon his arrival, said Sharaa's visit comes within the
context of Arab consultation and coordination regarding the
current Iraqi crisis and the problems facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt supports all initiatives "likely to avert the
military option and at the same time to ensure the implementation
of U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Despite everything being said about the U.S., Washington is
taking part in political consultations now afoot in the United
Nations," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council plan to
hold their second round of talks with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to find a peaceful solution to the crisis over the U.N. arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa also voiced his country's opposition to the use of force
as a way to force Iraqi compliance with the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The possible military strike against Baghdad would
be in nobody's interest. The political avenue is the right path
to find a way out of the crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria has long declared its opposition to an attack on Iraq,
but it has also called on Baghdad to implement U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened to strike Iraq if
it does not grant full access to U.N. inspectors seeking to
eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Issues State of Nation Message to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, in the annual State-of-the-Nation message of the
president to the parliament, called for a normal multi-party
system in the country, saying that political parties and movements
are a bridge connecting the civil society with the administration.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 all-Russia parties were now registered at federal
level, as well as about 50 all-Russia political movements and
numerous other public organizations are pursuing political goals.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin indicated two main obstacles on the way to the
formation of a multi-party system. One is the "absence of a law on
parties" and the other is "inadequacy of the existing electoral
system as regards the socio-political conditions in Russia."
</P>
<P>
He stressed Russia's system of administration will be reformed,
beginning in the middle of this year, so as to make the state
apparatus compact, efficient and controlled by society.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin especially pointed out the struggle against corruption,
saying it was "an important direction of administrative reform".
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of economic considerations in Russia's
foreign policy was urged by the president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was confident that effective foreign policy is one of
the reserves of the country's rise. He said, "We must considerably
strengthen the economic vector of foreign policy. It is necessary
to seek the lifting of discriminatory measures against our
companies' products."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
"is our constant priority" in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
On domestic economic situation Yeltsin declared that the main
result of the past year of reforms was the establishment of a
market economy in Russia and it will never be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The president believed the main accomplishment of the past year
was the creation of conditions for economic growth. The problem of
economic growth is put in the focus of the current politics.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Federal budget for 1999 must be executed in a way that
will bring down to zero the real primary deficit, Yeltsin said. He
also called for adopting the country's Budget Code in 1998 as it
is impossible to normalize the entire budgetary process without
it.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relations between Russia and the United
States, Yeltsin said it was still marked by "positive dynamics".
He regarded the ratification of the Russo-American START-2 treaty
as an urgent task of the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
In Yeltsin's opinion, commercial and economic cooperation is on
the whole developing successfully. The package of agreements on
the delimitation of the strategic and non-strategic ABM
(antiballistic missiles) systems is of great importance for
safeguarding strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed that "the assertion of the model of a
multi-polar world" was one of the basic parameters of the
foreign-policy concept.
</P>
<P>
The concept of NATO-centrism and one of its manifestations -
NATO's enlargement - remain unacceptable for Russia, the president
said. Russia will firmly oppose these plans without sliding toward
confrontation, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the message Yeltsin repeated the position that the Baltic
countries "give up the search for illusory threats and concentrate
on the establishment of relations based on neighborly relations
and mutually-advantageous partnership."
</P>
<P>
As for the Russian military reform, Yeltsin said Russia's armed
forces will be cut to 1.2 million men in 1998, while 200,000 men
were cut last year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the strategic rocket forces, space forces and
rocket space defense forces were merged last year, he said that
the merger of the air and air defense forces must be completed,
too.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that it is no longer possible to delay the
restructuring of the defense industry. The new defense industry
should consist mainly of large integrated production
amalgamations, research institutes and design bureaus which
produce high-technology and competitive military and civilian
products, he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Russia Continue Efforts to Avert Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Russia continued on
Tuesday their efforts to find ways of resolving the current Iraqi
crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who is accompanying
his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov to tour Greece's Mount
Athos, said that he and Primakov were making specific efforts for
a political solution to the Iraqi crisis caused by Iraq's blocking
of U.N. weapons inspections, according to the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival at the northern Greek airport of Macedonia,
the two ministers contacted with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine and they might contact with other foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that there was a considerable danger and they
hoped that the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was left to do
his job without needless terms and conditions which would just
make things more difficult.
</P>
<P>
"His final efforts could, with some understanding from other
side, bring some result," he added.
</P>
<P>
After their talks on Monday, Pangalos and Primakov voiced their
opposition to the use of force to deal with the Iraqi crisis and
called for more steps to avert the possible military action.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that the views shared by Greece,
Russia and France concerning the Iraqi crisis were assuming the
form of a tripartite initiative aimed at seeking diplomatic
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The initiative involves promoting a visit to Baghdad by Annan
in order to persuade Iraq to neutralize its weapons of mass
destruction and to allow the U.N. arms inspectors to resume their
work there.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Demonstrate in Support of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Lebanese people
staged a sit-in outside the parliament building here Tuesday to
protest against the United States' threat to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators burned U.S. flags and shouted slogans to show
their support for the Iraqi government in its standoff with
Washington over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to attack Iraq if Baghdad refuses to
give U.N. inspectors free access to any sites suspected of hiding
mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The protesters criticized the U.S. for its Middle East policy
and double standard in tackling regional affairs, noting that it
did not show the same desire to enforce relevant U.N. resolutions
on Israel.
</P>
<P>
As the protest went on, the parliament members and ministers
were convening inside the parliament building to discuss the
current Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri condemned
the U.S. threat of military actions against Iraq, saying the
threat has plunged the whole region into a very delicate and
dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said the U.S. goal is not to oust
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but to keep its own troops in the
region, weaken Arab military capability, and keep oil prices at a
low level.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon favors a diplomatic solution to the crisis, and
called on Iraq to implement the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament members called on U.N. to lift
sanctions imposed on Iraq more than seven years ago and stressed
that Lebanon supports Iraqi sovereignty and opposes any bid to
divide the country.
</P>
<P>
They also condemned the Turkish-Israeli military alliance,
saying it poses a direct threat to the region.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan Discuss Report on Mashaal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu made a phone call to King Hussein of Jordan on
Tuesday and exchanged views on how to improve the bilateral
relations, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu talked to Hussein about an investigation report on
the affair of Khaled Mashaal, a leader of the Palestinian Hamas
movement in Jordan, and Israel's policy of fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two sides will take steps to improve
their damaged relations, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad attempted to
kill Mashaal in Amman last September, but failed. Angered by the
assassination attempt, Jordan stopped its security cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
After the botched assassination, Israel appointed a
three-member committee to investigate the affair. On Monday, the
committee submitted a report to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The report determined that the Mossad should bear full
responsibility for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Hussein's office also received the
report along with a letter from Netanyahu to the king on Monday.
Netanyahu defended that the attempt to kill Mashaal was in line
with Israel's policy to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Oded Eran was quoted by the radio
as saying on Tuesday that Jordanian officials have been further
angered by the report.
</P>
<P>
He said they accused the report of not criticizing the fact
that the operation was carried out on the Jordanian soil.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian officials also refuted Netanyahu's statement on
Monday that Israel stands by its policy to strike terrorism in any
place of the world, which they said is unacceptable to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The security of Jordan is not dependent on the decisions of any
other countries and Jordan knows how to defend its national
security, the Jordanian officials said.

<TEXT>

PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi foreign minister Mohamed
Said al-Sahhaf wound up his visit in Paris and will fly to Teheran
Tuesday evening, Agence France-Presse quoted French foreign
ministry as reporting. He was originally scheduled to meet with
United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf met with French President Jacques Chirac Tuesday
morning and foreign minister Hubert Vedrine in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said after his meeting with Sahhaf that a diplomatic
solution to the crisis is still possible, on the condition that
Iraq makes further concession over U.N. arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
He warned Iraq of "extremely grave risks which would result
from a refusal by Iraq to accept the inspection of presidential
sites," and said that "time is being counted"before all diplomatic
efforts are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called Russian president Boris Yeltsin, British
prime minister Tony Blair, Italian prime minister Romano Prodi and
Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar Tuesday to brief them on
his meeting with the Iraqi foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
Chirac will also contact U.S. president Bill Clinton and German
chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with al-Sahhaf, French foreign minister
Hubert Vedrine warned Iraq of "a disproportional tragedy"
resulting from its refusal to accept U.N. inspection in the
presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
But al-Sahhaf insisted that Iraq cannot stand to see U.N.
inspectors "penetrate into official buildings," according to
French diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that France has already done all it can, including
proposing new formulas for inspection of presidential sites and
asking the U.N. secretary general to go to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Mechanism to Be Formed Repatriate Burundian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania, Burundi and
the United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have
agreed to set up a tripartite mechanism to coordinate the
voluntary repatriation of the Burundi refugees from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Sadako Ogata, Head of the UNHCR, said in a statement released
Tuesday that she has won final approval from presidents of
Tanzania and Burundi on such a mechanism during her private talks
with them.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who is on a three-week tour to nine countries in
Africa, said both governments have agreed to guarantee the safe
repatriation of Burundian refugees who wish to return home under
the support of the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the first technical meeting of the tripartite
mechanism will take place by mid-March to make a plan for the
voluntary repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the Nduta Camp in Kigoma Region in western Tanzania
last week, Mrs Ogata demanded the refugees to abide by the local
laws and rules and keep away from being militarized.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental solution to the Burundi refugees problem is
peace in their country which can only be achieved through
political process," Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR statistics show that at the end of last year,
Tanzania harbored 346,703 refugees from Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Somalia, with the Burundians
accounting for 266,498.
</P>
<P>
Despite endless civil wars in Burundi, there are clear
indications that some 68,000 Burundian refugees returned home in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Force may Be Only Answer to Iraq Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday showed his determination to use force against Iraq over
the weapons inspections crisis, saying force is sometimes the only
answer to settle the disputes with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the joint chiefs of staff at the Pentagon, Clinton
said, "Force can never be the the first answer. But sometimes it's
the only answer."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said here that his speech laid the
groundwork for a possible air strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act," He said.
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, which was virtually a marketing campaign,
Clinton was briefed by his military aides on the status of the
U.S. forces in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
About 350 warplanes and over 20 warships, including two
aircraft carriers, are now deployed in the Gulf in preparation
of a possible substantial attack on Iraq. And Clinton's top
advisers have repeatedly warned that time for diplomacy is
running out.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent several weeks building up our forces in the
Gulf," Clinton told his audience, which included his top foreign
policy aides, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and General
Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spelled out the purpose of the military action as
reducing Iraq's capability of manufacturing weapons of mass
destruction and diminishing its threat to the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"If (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein rejects peace and we
have to use force, our purpose is clear: We want to seriously
diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
program. We want to seriously reduce his capacity to threaten
his neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the United States "can
achieve the objective and secure our vital strategic interests."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said a diplomatic solution was still the preferable
outcome. But he said Iraq must agree soon to full, unfettered
inspections of suspected weapons sites, which he was referring to
what Iraq called the "presidential areas", where the United States
is dubious of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"A diplomatic solution must include a clear, immutable,
reasonable, simple standard: Iraq must agree, and soon, to free,
full and unfettered access to these sites anywhere in the
country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Preparing to Return to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah has been making preparations to return home after nearly nine
months of exile in Guinea since his ousting in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
Barely five days into the fall of the military junta in the
capital Freetown, Kabbah has set up a task force for this
purpose, a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The task force will first of all look into the situation in Sierra
Leone relating to law and order because there is currently a lot of
crime committed there, the leader said.
</P>
<P>
The leader was condemning the military junta that toppled the
government of Kabbah in the coup, which has put the country into
insecurity and disorder.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the members of the illegal military regime will
be tried according to their involvement in the crime and the
government might seek outside help during the process.
</P>
<P>
The members of the junta fled Freetown after the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) broke into the capital last Thursday, and
most of them were captured by ECOMOG when they arrived in neighboring
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has said these persons will be handed over to Kabbah's
government for disposal.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military disclosed here earlier Tuesday that a
delegation of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
would go to Freetown Wednesday to assess the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The assessment by foreign ministers from the ECOWAS Committee of
Five on Sierra Leone will form the basis of recommendations to the
ECOWAS headquarters to fix a date for Kabbah's return.

<HEADLINE> Five Detained in Kenya's Hunt for Briton's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan police detained
Tuesday five people related to Sunday's killing of a British
holiday-maker in one of the country's game parks,
local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The police are questioning them when widening inquiries and
combing more areas around the incident scene in hope to find more
information to catch real killers as soon as possible,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Ray Chivers, a 58-year-old former policeman, was robbed by two
men and knifed to death during a morning game walk with his wife
Sandra at a well-fenced sanctuary attached to the Aberdare Country
Club, some 230 kilometers north of capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Tourism Minister Henry Kosgey vowed Monday to take the
quite rare incident "very seriously", not only for bringing the
murderers to justice but also for providing high security for all
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Association of Tour Operators has offered a reward
of 50,000 Shillings (some 800 U.S. Dollars) for any information
leading to the arrest and the conviction of the killers.
</P>
<P>
The luxury Aberdare Country Club, built 27 years ago, has 49
guest rooms, a golf course and an entirely fenced private
1,300-acre game sanctuary.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Transference of Weapons to Iran Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday denied reports
of Radio Cologne of Germany that Iraq has transferred its weapons
of mass destruction to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The reports are "pure fabrication," Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has been the number-one victim of weapons of
mass destruction, such as chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The reports are "needlessly provocative" and will simply
aggravate the tensions caused by the crisis over United Nations
arms inspections in Iraq, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraqi compliance with the U.N. resolutions to dismantle its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also rejected foreign meddling in Iran's judicial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He criticized French Foreign Ministry spokesman for commenting
on the death sentence on former editor of Iranian English-language
daily Iran News Morteza Firouzi.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian judiciary acts independently.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Firouzi received 175,000 U.S. dollars
for providing secret information to France, Japan and South
Korea.

MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today agreed that
bilateral ties have kept a good development momentum and the
strategic coordination partnership continues to be enriched and
expanded in content.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of government expressed satisfaction over this
during their third regular meeting shortly after Li's arrival in
Moscow this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers also reviewed the growth of bilateral ties in

Russian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed a joint statement on the world
multi-polarization and establishment of international new order,
Li said, adding this is applauded internationally and exerts a
positive impact on the changes and development of the
international situation.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation arms reduction agreement, in which China and
Russia have taken part, still serves as example for regional and
world peace and stability, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the survey and demarcation in the eastern border
area of the two nations have contributed to bilateral long-lasting
friendship, and served as inspiration to solve problems left over
by history on the international arena.
</P>
<P>
"China and Russia have also conducted very fruitful cooperation
on the international arena," Li said.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, Chernomyrdin said the Russia-China
ties have advanced smoothly and scored significant achievements
within the framework of the strategic coordination partnership
based on equality and mutual trust.

They agreed that since their second regular meeting in June
1997, both sides have done a lot of work and important progress of
substantial nature has been achieved.

<P>
And sub-commitees on economic, trade, scientific,
technological, transport and nuclear cooperation have held
meetings and progress have been seen in various work, indicating
the premier regular meeting mechanism has put major cooperation
fields under the macro-coordination and guidance of both
governments.
</P>
<P>
This is of great importance to pushing cooperation in these
fields in an in-depth and extensive way, the two premiers stated,
adding they are ready to give further play to the role of this
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The two government leaders also confirmed that Jiang and
Yeltsin will hold their first informal summit in Russia this
Autumn, which they term it as of great importance.

is of unique geographical features and advantages, and bilateral
economy is greatly supplementary and there exists great potential.

ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia loses more than
28.9 million U.S. Dollars in revenues due to the poor quality of skins
and hides supplied to the local market annually, a local report said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 20 percent of sheep and goats hides
delivered to the market yearly have turned out to be below the
standard owing to defects inflicted on them by external parasites

Thirty percent of the hides is downgraded by
improper shearing systems.

The report called on the Ministry of Agriculture and professionals
in the field to make concerted efforts to promote the quality of
skins and hides purchased by local tanneries.
</P>
<P>
Skins and hides account for 12 percent of export value next only
to coffee in the country during 1996/97 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Force may Be Only Answer to Iraq (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday showed his determination to use force against Iraq over
the weapons inspections crisis, saying force is sometimes the only
answer to settle the disputes with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the joint chiefs of staff at the Pentagon, Clinton
said: "Force can never be the first answer. But sometimes it's
the only answer."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said here that his speech laid the
groundwork for a possible air strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act," He said.
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, which was virtually a marketing campaign,
Clinton was briefed by his military aides on the status of the
U.S. forces in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
About 350 warplanes and over 20 warships, including two
aircraft carriers, are now deployed in the Gulf in preparation of
a possible substantial attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen disclosed on Monday that he had
signed orders to send 5,000 to 6,000 more troops from armor and
helicopter units to the Kuwait region.
</P>
<P>
That would bring U.S. ground forces there to about 10,000,
including about 1,500 troops already there on maneuvers in Kuwait,
and 3,000 soldiers from Fort Stewart, Georgia, who got their
orders on Monday to deploy to Kuwait. Now more than 25,000 U.S.
troops are in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent several weeks building up our forces in the
Gulf," Clinton told his audience, which included his top foreign
policy aides, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and General Hugh
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spelled out the purpose of the military action as
reducing Iraq's capability of manufacturing weapons of mass
destruction and diminishing its threat to the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"If (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein rejects peace and we have
to use force, our purpose is clear: We want to seriously diminish
the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. We
want to seriously reduce his capacity to threaten his neighbors,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the United States "can achieve
the objective and secure our vital strategic interests."
</P>
<P>
Clinton vowed to make a second strike if Iraq is found to
rebuild its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
If Saddam "seeks to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction, we
will be prepared to strike him again," he said. "The economic
sanctions will remain in place until Saddam complies fully with
all U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on the Americans to rally behind his
administration for the looming military action. He said: "I know
that the people that we may call upon in uniform are ready. The
American people have to be ready as well."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said a diplomatic solution was still the preferable
outcome. But he said Iraq must agree in a very short time to full,
unfettered inspections of suspected weapons sites, which he was
referring to what Iraq called the "presidential areas", where the
United States is dubious of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"A diplomatic solution must include a clear, immutable,
reasonable, simple standard: Iraq must agree, and soon, to free,
full and unfettered access to these sites anywhere in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John Warner, the second-ranking Republican
on the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed his support to
Clinton's speech, saying it "comes at the precise critical moment"
and is "a very strong message" to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said if the United States "fails to act decisively in this
crisis, it will be a signal not only to Saddam Hussein but most
likely to Iran and other nations to begin to assert their own
agenda."

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Troops Fighting Back in Hinterland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The troops of Sierra Leone's
military junta which fled the capital Freetown last week have
begun to fight back in the hinterland and seemed to gain an upper
hand in some places.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were accompanied with destruction and looting, the
British Broadcasting Corporation reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In the major towns of Bo, Kenema and Makeni, the junta troops
and their Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel allies started
firing at the positions of the civil defense units Monday evening
and Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The civil defense units, mainly the Kamajors which fight along
side the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG only
took over these towns last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The local people, who two or three days ago were jubilating
over their liberation from the junta, were forced to flee to the
hills and surrounding villages with bundles of their belongings.
</P>
<P>
The junta troops entering some of the towns were reportedly
shooting randomly at people and completely looting shops, homes,
ngo offices and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
About five foreigners working for a catholic mission were
kidnaped by armed personnel who "look mostly like the former
members of the army" in one of the towns in northern sierra
leone, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While people are expecting ECOMOG to come to bring sanity to
the towns, its force commander, Nigeria's Maj.-Gen. Timothy
Shelpidi said "we are on the way to these areas."
</P>
<P>
"The ECOMOG will fight them as quickly as possible in these
areas," Shelpidi said in the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG contingent fighting in Sierra Leone is composed
troops of Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea, he said.

<HEADLINE> Donors Urged to Be More Positive to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Tuesday called on foreign donors and states to adopt a more
positive attitude toward the eastern African country while making
no interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
As a sovereign state, Kenya deserved respect and
non-interference of its affairs, said Moi, noting it is the
responsibility of Kenyans to chart their own destiny in line with
their unique background, aspirations and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Nobody should ignore the diversity of nations worldwide and
every country has its problems, he stressed when receiving
credentials from new ambassadors of Australia, India and Italy at
the State House here.
</P>
<P>
Moi said he is not happy about the way Kenya was being treated
by "her friends," complaining the unwarranted and distorted press
campaigns against the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The hesitation of the donor countries and agencies have made
Kenyans to suffer, he charged.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came out during a key visit by a team of
International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is expected by
Kenyans to lead to the negotiations on resuming a three-year
205-Million-U.S.-Dollar aid package later this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF cut the aid loans on July 31 last year on the grounds
of rampant corruption and poor governance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the loans is believed to be key for
re-building up confidence of foreign investors to Kenya now
suffering from poor infrastructure, El Nino rains and tribal
violence.

ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Jacques
Diouf Tuesday called upon African countries to focus on water
control program in their bid to attain food self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Diouf
said that most African countries have remained vulnerable to food
shortages whenever natural calamities occur for they are
dependent on rain, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>

He stressed that implementation in Africa of the water control
program could address food deficit that might result from
depending on the continent's rain fed agriculture.
</P>

Diouf said that FAO has now embarked upon a special program
for food security, with special attention to food deficit
countries, to realize its plan to reduce by half the number of
people facing food shortages.
</P>
<P>
He said that FAO is undertaking the prevention of animal
diseases in Africa. He pledged his organization's material and
technical assistance to Africa.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges All Countries to Ban PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military officers
repeated their call to the international community on Tuesday to
ban the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been outlawed in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Colonel Erkal Bektas from the Turkish
General Staff accused neighboring countries of deliberately aiding
the activities of "illegal organization."
</P>
<P>
He said Germany and France have banned the PKK and "we expect
the same gesture from the other countries."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war in
eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over 28,000
lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Bektas expressed Turkey's concerns about the alleged
"continuous support to the PKK" given by such neighbors as Russia,
Syria, Iran, Iraq, Greece and Cyprus. "Despite Ankara's massive
efforts to curb terrorist activities, these countries have been
continuing support for the PKK," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey believes a PKK training camp exists near
Lavrion, northwest of Athens, and added Greece also allowed PKK
members to open representative offices all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Bektas alleged Iran has provided the PKK with various forms of
assistance, including weapons and ammunition, and there are about
500 PKK guerrillas in Iran, mostly in camps close to the Turkish
border.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 PKK militants have sought shelter in northern Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War and have carried out cross-border attacks
on Turkish targets from Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has also changed its policy since 1988 and started to
train and support the PKK," said the colonel.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed an accusing finger at Syria. "Despite making
efforts to change its image as a country supporting international
terrorism, Syria has used the PKK as a trump card against us in
order to pressure us" over water and territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are at odds over the sharing of water of the
Euphrates and the status of Hatay province bordering Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali reshuffled his cabinet Tuesday, sacking seven
ministers and taking in other six politicians.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new ministers had once held portfolios in former
governments, according to a royal decree on the reshuffle that
was broadcast on Jordan Television.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs Jawad
Anani took the post of foreign minister and another deputy prime
minister for services affairs Abdullah Nsour was given the
portfolio of information minister in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Other reshuffled posts included ministers of education and high
education, labor, transport, post and telecommunication, culture
and youth, and minister for parliamentary and legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bassam Amoush, a former member of the opposition Islamic Action
Front (IAF), was assinged to the newly created portfolio of
minister of administrative development in the 24-member cabinet.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first time that an Islamic politician was
appointed to the cabinet since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Amoush was ousted by IAF because he refused to join a
collective action to boycott the latest parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh was
appointed as chief of the Royal Court. This position usually
leads to the position of prime minister. Tarawneh was renowned
for his participation in the negotiations with Israel which
culminated in the 1994 peace treaty between two countries.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawi
was not included in the new cabinet. Several days ago, Mutawi was
attacked by parliament members for not doing a good job after
Israeli agents failed to murder a Hamas leader in Amman and
permitting a television concert which went too far beyond
Islamic morals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Majali told reporters that the reshuffle had been
considered for a long time and was not related to the
Iraq-United Nations crisis over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet reshuffle was once expected in December 1997 when
the parliamentary election was finished.

LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), began seeking a legal
intervention Tuesday to block the expulsion of the party from the
Norrhern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The move was expected to delay British government attempts to

in two recent murders.

Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said his party was going

</P>
<P>
"We are now seeking a legal intervention as a means of
redressing this situation," local reports quoted him as telling a
news conference in Dublin, the capital of the Ireland Republic
where the Northern Ireland peace talks were being held.
</P>

After Northern Ireland police confirmed that the IRA was

British government Monday began a move to expel Sinn Fein from the
talks which began last September.
</P>
<P>
Both Sinn Fein and the IRA have denied any involvement in the
killings. Sinn Fein argued it was a distinct organization from the
IRA and that it was a political party. There are no grounds to
expel it as it has nothing to do with the killings.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Economy Remains Stable: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite the financial turmoil in
Southeast Asia, Bangladesh's economy remains "stable and strong,"
showing growth in industry and other vital sectors, the
independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Bangladeshi Finance Minister S. A. M. S.
Kibria at Parliament recently, the UNB said.
</P>
<P>
More than 860 industrial units were set up in the first half of
the current fiscal year from July, 1997 to June, 1998, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 75 units were set up with foreign financing while 786
with local investments.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production increased by 12.1 percent in the period,
and industrial loans amounting to 13.9 billion taka (about 300
million U.S. dollars) were disbursed during the period.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased by about 19 percent in the period, and
foreign exchange reserves were over 2 billion dollars as of
February 12 this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that inflation rate at present was 5.66
percent.
</P>
<P>
On revenue earnings, the minister said 62.6 billion taka (about
1.27 billion dollars), or 92.01 percent of the target, was
realized in the period, up 10 percent compared with the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that when Southeast Asian countries suffered
a serious economic disaster recently and devalued their currencies
sharply, the currency devaluation in Bangladesh was only 5.72
percent, the lowest among Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this (economic) stability, confidence has been
created in Bangladesh's economy," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Rise on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
rise on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) surged by 42.08 points to close at
1538.98 points on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that share prices ended higher amid stability in
the Indonesian currency rupiah, as other regional currencies
firmed. But they said that trading was cautious, resulting in
modest volumes.
</P>
<P>
This was because most players remained sidelined as they
monitored economic and political development in Indonesia, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 427.01 million units,
valued at 473.11 million Singapore dollars (286.73 million US
dollars). Advances led declines by 212 to 160, while 239 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
RHB Capital Warrant99 was the most actively traded counter as
it registered a turnover of 61.51 million units. It was followed
by Renong Bhd which had 30.18 million shares traded. MBf Capital
was next with 26.5 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign, UOB (United
Overseas Bank) Foreign and Yew HSS shared the top spot on the
gainers' list as each of them increased by 60 cents to finish at
13, 8.7, and 5.6 Singapore dollars respectively. OCBC (Overseas
Chinese Banking Corporation) Foreign rose by 55 cents to end at
nine Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 and GE Life were both the biggest
losers as each of them declined by 30 cents to close at 38.7 and
11.6 Singapore dollars respectively. Boustd S fell by 15 cents to
end at 1.95 Singapore dollars, while Elec was down by ten cents to
finish at 5.4 US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here Wednesday that the ongoing Asian economic crisis,
which spread from Thailand last July, has not caused any direct
damage to his country.
</P>
<P>
Li admitted that China has felt some of the fallout from the
crisis. "One can not say the crisis has had little influence on
China," Li said in a joint interview with Russian TV, the
Independent Newspaper and the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Li said although the devaluation of currencies in Southeast
Asian countries brings about challenges to China's exports, the
Chinese government has decided to keep the Chinese yuan stable.
</P>
<P>
China's decision will contribute to economic stability in Asia
and the world as a whole. The decision is also well received by
other Asian countries and the international community, said the
Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said the crisis was induced by problems in the
financial sector. "It is not an all-round economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Tuesday for a two-day official good-will visit
to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
in Sydney Wednesday on a stronger note, after a quiet session
during which range trading was the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
"No-one put any fresh light on the Aussie," Colonial State Bank
foreign exchange dealer Nick Volanakis said. "It's really just
demand and supply that's pushed it higher."
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished at 67.13 US cents, from 66.75
previously.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Bank Ltd Wednesday said a somewhat stronger
Australian dollar reflected greater confidence about the outlook
for Asia.
</P>
<P>
But "as long as the impact of the current crisis in the Asian
region on the global and Australian economies remains uncertain,
sentiment will remain fragile," the bank's international economist
Joanne Masters said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the Australian dollar is likely to continue to be
volatile over coming months.
</P>
<P>
"However, in trend terms it remains reasonably well supported
and should recover further through the year."
</P>
<P>
Masters sees the Australian dollar moving into a 72-77 US cent
"fair value" band by the end of the year, compared to 69-73 US
cents range now.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Australian dollar will only return to its fair
value band when the uncertainty about Asia abates and market
sentiment improves which is unlikely until towards mid-year," said
Masters.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 84.91 yen from 83.90 Tuesday,
and at 1.2268 marks from 1.2113.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
edged higher Wednesday with trade only tepid until the final hour
when investors snapped up Telstra Corp's instalment receipts after
the release of the telecommunications giant's half year results.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index retreated from earlier lows to close
4.2 points higher at 2661.2, with mining stocks acting as an
anchor on the market as major stocks were steady or stronger.
</P>
<P>
Telstra instalment receipts rose six cents to 3.56 Australian
dollars on a volume of more than 27 million after announcing
interim net profit of 1.08 billion US dollars, up 118 percent on
the previous corresponding period. The receipts reached a high of
3.61 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
After initial confusion, caused by Australian Stock Exchange
corrections on the results announcement, the shares shot up, with
more than 10 million shares traded in quick time.
</P>
<P>
Trading in Telstra helped buoy the market after it had opened
down.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 6.6 points to 4551.8.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were flat after Tuesday's jump in National

NAB added two cents Wednesday to 19.80 Australian dollars while
Commonwealth Bank of Australia was the strongest of the majors,
improving 19 cents to 17.84 Australian dollars. ANZ bank added a
cent to 9.54 Australian dollars but Westpac bank fell five to 9.94
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index improved 2.4 points to 1154.5, boosted
by a 44 percent increase in the annual net profit of Woodside
Petroleum to 183 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, BHP improved 11 cents to 14.50 Australian dollars
and Rio Tinto was eight cents better at 19.20 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold shares were weaker as the bullion price fell 2.00 US
dollars per ounce to 297.25 US dollars at Sydney trading close.
</P>
<P>
National turnover at 16:44 (local time) was registered at
304.34 million shares at a value of 593.2 million US dollars with

Haotian Wednesday that relations between Australia and China have
entered the best period since the two countries established
diplomatic relations 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Chi, Downer said political relations
between the two countries are good and there has been new
development in the two countries' cooperation in the security
field.
</P>
<P>
On Australia's China policy, Downer said that the containment
policy was a product of the Cold War and that Australia advocates
full engagement with all Asia-Pacific countries including China.
</P>
<P>
China and Australia maintained good relations in the political,
economic and other fields with rapid development in military
exchanges, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He called for joint efforts by both nations to expand bilateral
military relations in an all-round manner and at all levels and
open a new chapter in relations between the two countries and the
two militaries in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Chi, the first Chinese defense minister to visit Australia,
will conclude his six-day visit to Australia Thursday, the last
leg of his four-nation tour, which also includes Japan, Fiji and
New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Deepening Sino-Russian Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here the development of economic and trade ties between
China and Russia is lagging behind the development of political
ties.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in a joint interview Wednesday with the
Independent Newspaper, Russian TV and the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Li said the strategic partnership between China and Russia
includes both political and economic relations, but added that the
development of trade is not satisfactory at the moment.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's foreign trade stood at 320 billion
U.S. dollars. Trade with Russia was a mere six billion dollars,
accounting for only 2 percent of the total, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Li added that China and Russia are neighbors and could
supplement each other in many economic areas. As a result, the two
countries hold great potential for each other in economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the two countries should enhance cooperation
in the following three areas: First, strengthen long-term
cooperation in large and medium-sized projects.
</P>
<P>
Second, achieve a trade balance. Since 1992, Li noted, China
has had an unfavorable trade balance with Russia that amounts to
13 billion U.S. dollars, which is detrimental to the development
of economic ties between the two counties. Li called on Russia to
increase imports from China.
</P>
<P>
Finally, enhance mutual investment and technology exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier arrived here Tuesday for a two-day official
good-will visit, the last leg of his week-long three-nation
European tour, following his visits to Luxembourg and the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Leads Women's Figure Skating Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Top favorite Michelle Kwan
of the United States topped the women's figure skating after she
skated an almost perfect short program Wednesday night at the Nagano
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Kwan's American teammate Tara Lipinski was second followed by
Maria Butyrskaya from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Bronze medalist at the last Olympics in Lillehammer Chen Lu of
China was fourth.
</P>
<P>
Kwan gave a near flawless performance in the short program, which
earned her the highest mark from the panel of nine judges. She had
one 5.9, five 5.8s and three 5.7s for required elements and nine 5.9s
for presentation.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the gold will be vied between Kwan and
Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski took Kwan's U.S. and world titles in 1997 but lost her
U.S. crown to Kwan, falling on a triple flip in her short program. She
recovered with seven long-program triple jumps. But Kwan has the
edge.
</P>
<P>
The short program is worth one-third of the total score.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Earns $75.5 Million from Tourism in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned 75.5 million
U.S. Dollars in 1997 from tourism, an eight percent increase as
compared to 58.9 million Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This is disclosed at a news briefing held in the State House
Wednesday by Zambian Tourism Minister Amussa Mwanamwambwa.
</P>
<P>
The tourism minister also said that about 293,000 foreign
tourists visited Zambia last year as compared to 263,000 in 1996,
recording a growth rate of nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe ranked Zambia's biggest tourism market with 76,000
Zambian arrivals while South Africa the second with 55,600
visitors. Both Zimbabwe and South Africa accounted for 61 percent
of the visitor arrivals, according to Mwanamwambwa.
</P>
<P>
The other three major markets of Zambia's tourism are Britain,
Australia and New Zealand as well as North America.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the increase in the number of tourists
coming to his country to "stable political climate, improved
internal air network, wilderness value of tourism product sought
by tourists and improved marketing efforts."
</P>
<P>
At the news briefing, Mwanamwambwa also called on the
country's tourism industry to provide good service to all
visitors and that the government will not allow it to employ
untrained personnel.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Summarizes Budget Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said Wednesday that Hong Kong can
afford to make substantial tax reductions and keep on course with
all recurrent and capital spending plans despite the financial
crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he had announced the largest package of tax
reductions in Hong Kong's history in the budget that he presented
Wednesday afternoon to the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the measures have been designed with Hong Kong's
competitiveness and long-term interest in mind," Tsang told
reporters at a press briefing held about an hour after he
presented the first budget of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of China.
</P>
<P>
They reinforce Hong Kong's position as a haven of low taxes,
Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
The improved profits tax system creates stronger incentives for
investments that will upgrade productivity, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The salaries tax structure is now much more fair and will
lighten the burden of 99 percent of taxpayers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal year of 1998-99 will be a more difficult year, but
growth in the economy will continue and this growth will sustain
underlying public revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the press briefing, Tsang described the announcement of tax
reductions as one of the four things he has done in his budget
speech.
</P>
<P>
In the budget, Tsang set out the importance of currency
stability to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I have affirmed our commitment to maintain the currency board
system and to maintain the linked exchange rate at the current
level of parity," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also set out guidelines for the handling of Hong Kong's
strong fiscal reserves in his budget.
</P>
<P>
"These are designed to give confidence of our commitment to
monetary stability and assurance that we can maintain a strong
level of public investment in the years ahead," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Another thing Tsang has done in his budget is to have
reconfirmed the government's commitment to proceed with all the
expenditure programs announced by the chief executive last
October.
</P>
<P>
Today's Budget has sought to use Hong Kong's strengths to help
ride out the present storms, but most of all, to use Hong Kong's
flexibility to renew its strengths, Tsang said.

</P>
<P>
Howard made the remarks during a meeting with visiting Chinese

NAGANO, Japan, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Teemu Selanne's two goals
led Finland to eliminate defending champion Sweden 2-1 on Wednesday in
the men's ice hockey quarter-finals of the Nagano Olympics.
</P>
<P>
With the surprise victory, Finland earned a spot in the semi-finals
to meet Russia, while world champion Canada, who downed Kazakstan 4-1
Wednesday night, takes on Czech Republic in another semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Czech defeated Belarus and the United States
respectively with an identical 4-1 in the earlier quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless in the first two periods, Finland opened scoring
in 44:12 by forward Selanne. Eight minutes later, Selanne added his
second goal to secure Finland's seat in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Pre-game favorite Sweden scored in 12 seconds before the
game-ending.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of my biggest wins of course but I hope those bigger
wins are coming in this tournament," said Selanne, captain of the
Finland's team. "It seems to me that we were just a little bit more
hungry than the Swedish team tonight. I think we proved that we can
play good hockey and that we can win some games when everybody's doing
their jobs."
</P>
<P>
The defeat of team USA was also surprising. The Americans came out
strong from at the start with Mike Modano put the puck into the net at
16:12.
</P>
<P>
The red-jerseyed Czechs came out with vengeance in the second
period, whipping in two goals within a minute both by Jaromir Jagr.
Then Czech added other two at 36:35 and 59:21 to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was worth the NHL breaking up the season so its players
could join the Olympics, American forward Mike Modano said: "Right now
it's not worth it. We're going home with nothing."

recently-discovered oil field in Angola would produce one million
barrels of oil once it is put into production.
</P>
<P>
China, on the other hand, has the technology in oil
exploitation and refinery, which provides the basis for
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During Huang's visit, the first one by a Chinese oil company
head, the Angolan side proposed that China participate in the
building of a refinery factory in central Angola's Lobito city,
which will have an annual production capacity of one thousand
tons.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a letter of intent on joint
construction of the refinery factory and the purchase of crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between China and Angola in oil exploiting has
been on the increase in the past years, Huang said. In 1997,
China imported 3.67 million tons of oil from Angola, which
accounted for 11 percent of its total import that year.

<HEADLINE> HK Public Figures Mark Anniversary of Deng's Death (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Government officials,
legislators and other public figures here have expressed the view
that full implementation of the principle of "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong is the best way to commemorate the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the first anniversary of Deng's death on February
19, they paid homage to his great contributions to the successful
settlement of the Hong Kong issue and the smooth return of Hong
Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, noted that Deng had put forward the concept
 of "one country, two systems" with creativeness, taking into
consideration the fundamental interests of the country and people.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains the same nearly eight months after the
handover on July 1, 1997, Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative impact of the recent financial turmoil in
Asia, Tung said, Hong Kong has been able to ride over the
temporary difficulties, thanks first to the backing of the
powerful motherland and second to the policy of "one country, two
systems," which ensures that Hong Kong's social and economic
systems and its people's way of life remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" has also served to
maintain the confidence of the Hong Kong people in their future,
thus safeguarding the foundation of Hong Kong's economic growth,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, recalled
his several meetings with Deng, saying the maintenance of Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity after its return to the motherland
should be first of all attributed to the implementation of the
policy of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Hong Kong's future will be
brighter under the policy.

<P>
Executive Council member Leung Chun-ying said that if Deng
Xiaoping was the initiator and advocate of the concept of the "one
country, two systems," then the third generation of the Chinese
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core is the firm and creative
developer and implementor of the concept.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the policies of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, Leung noted that
under British rule, Hong Kong had to ask for instructions from
London before handling many issues.
</P>
<P>
But now, Hong Kong's internal affairs can be dealt with by the
SAR government itself without the need to ask for opinions from
Beijing. This is a demonstration of the high degree of autonomy in
Hong Kong, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Council Convenor Chung Zse-yuen also recalled his
meeting with Deng on June 22, 1984, and remembered Deng expressing
the belief that the Chinese people in Hong Kong were able to
manage Hong Kong well.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the SAR government know very well that during the
past seven months or more after Hong Kong returned to China, the
SAR government has been able to make its own decisions in policy
making and in handling major issues, Chung said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has never interfered with the internal
affairs of the SAR or given the SAR government any instructions,
Chung said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Provisional Legislative Council Rita Fan said
that thanks to the principle of "one country, two systems," the
overall situation in Hong Kong is good and the administrative,
legislative and judiciary bodies of the SAR are operating
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Tam Yiu-chung, member of the Executive Council and the
Provisional Legislative Council, said the central government has
fully carried out the policy of "one country, two systems" and
always trusted the Hong Kong people. As a result, a good start has
been made in carrying out the principle of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"The priority for us now is to handle Hong Kong's own affairs
in a better way and this will be the best way to commemorate
Deng," Tam said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of Hong Kong-based Chinese institutions
joined the Hong Kong government officials, legislators and public
figures in commemorating Deng.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch; Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in
the SAR; and Liu Zhenwu, commander of the People's Liberation Army
garrison in the SAR, believed that they have cooperated well with
the SAR government under the principle of "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
They noted that they have also lived in harmony with the six
million Hong Kong people during the past months after the
establishment of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their continuous commitment to giving support to
the SAR government and pledged to refrain from interfering with
the internal affairs of the SAR and help maintain the stability
and prosperity of Hong Kong under the policy of "one country, two
systems."

<HEADLINE> Artists Pledge to Hold High the Banner of Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of noted Chinese
artists pledged today to persistently use Deng Xiaoping Theory
to guide artistic creativity.
</P>
<P>
"The Art community will hold high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and will join the rising tide to fully comprehend
his theoretical precepts," according to Gao Zhanxiang,
vice-chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.
</P>
<P>
he federation hosted a seminar here today to commemorate
Deng, the senior Chinese leader who passed away on February 19,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin, director of the blockbuster movie "Opium War", said
that Deng will live forever in the minds of artists.
</P>
<P>
Literary critic Li Zhun said that the fact that the Chinese
economy has continued to grow, and art and culture have continued
to flourish prove the correctness of late leader's theory.
</P>
<P>
Deng is widely recognized as having enriched Marxism, Lennism
and Mao Zedong Thought by providing clear explanations concerning
the relationship between art and politics and between people and
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Deng introduced the reform and opening-up policies in the late
1970s, at a time when urbanites had no access to dance salons,
symphony concerts or discotheques. In addition, the choice of
books and newspapers was extremely limited and TV programming was
extremely dull. Today, however, people have access to wide-ranging
cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
Reform has found its way in state art troupes which are now
encouraged to join in market competition by catering to the taste
of perceptive audiences. In addition, the rights of authors are
respected.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that art circles will diligently study Deng Xiaoping
Theory and President Jiang Zemin's remarks on developing art and
literature. He stressed that artists will rally around the Party
to realize the country's modernization goals.

SHENYANG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Institute of
Automation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the birthplace
of China's first industrial robot, has acquired one-third of the
country's robot market share, while foreign-made robots are
flooding into China.
</P>
<P>
The institute has signed contracts worth more than 80 million
yuan (9.64 million U.S. dollars) during the last three years. The
deep-sea robots developed by the institute have been exported to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The institute, China's robot research base, developed China's
first industrial robot in 1980. In the mid-1980s, China invested
more than 60 million yuan (about 7.2 million U.S. dollars) in the
construction of a pilot robot center in the institute to
promote China's robot industry.
</P>
<P>
China's first deep-sea robot was made in the institute in
1985. The institute now can make deep-sea robots capable of
exploring to the depths of up to 6,000 meters. Last June, a robot
completed an expedition under the Pacific Ocean for 20 consecutive
hours, gaining a wealth of data about mineral resources in the sea.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 70 robots developed by the institute have
been installed on the production lines of some automobile

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- An article written by Xie
Fei, leader of the south China province of Guangdong, says that
Deng Xiaoping made a great contribution to the revolutionary
cause, reforms and opening-up in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The article marks the first anniversary of the late Chinese
leader's death on February 19.
</P>
<P>
Xie is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee and secretary of the Guangdong
Provincial Party Committee,
</P>
<P>
Deng was in the leadership of struggles and important work in
Guangdong during China's democratic revolutionary period and after
the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
On Deng's advice, the CPC Central Committee decided in 1979 to
give Guangdong some favorable policies for its economic
development so that it could lead the country in reforms and
opening to the outside world. As a result, three special economic
zones were established in Guangdong, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1992, when the country's reform and opening-up
reached a critical juncture, Deng made a tour of the province to
give a push and answer questions about the reforms and opening-up
process.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the GDP of Guangdong province reached 730.8 billion
yuan (88 billion US dollars). The annual average growth was 16.5
percent in 1992-1997.

country," he said.

MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Wednesday strongly denied rumors that he is going to abandon
the ruling party's presidential candidate Jose de Venecia and
endorse another one as the campaign season heats up.
</P>
<P>

In his weekly press conference, Ramos said he intends
vigorously to ensure the victory of the entire administration

</P>
<P>
He also denied that the Presidential Palace and the ruling
Lakas party are using every issue that would make the
administration's image look good in the public's eyes.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Better Protect Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Li Tieying
today said no one, either work unit or individual, should damage
or destroy cultural relics for any reason whatsoever, even
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li told officials attending a national cultural relics meeting
that China has rescued cultural relics and protected them in
recent years on a scale seldom seen before, and has kept a great
number of endangered cultural relics from disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Museums and cultural organizations across the country are
holding exhibitions and shows that have contributed greatly to
ethical and cultural progress, Li said, but China still lags
behind many developed countries in protecting cultural relics, and
that is not consistent with China's status as a major world
civilization with a long history.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, social awareness needs to be increased,
and local governments and officials need to place emphasis on
protecting cultural relics, he said, and emphasised the importance
of law enforcement, the crackdown on related crimes, and
government policies of "protecting first while focusing on resue
work", and "effective protection, rational utilization and
improved management".

<HEADLINE> Nomination of Kim Jong-pil as South Korean PM Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the South Korean
Grand National Party (GNP), which provides the majority membership
of the country's parliament, Wednesday opposed the nomination of
Kim Jong-pil as new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
GNP President Cho Soon said, "We agreed that our party should
oppose the nomination motion in the National Assembly."
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, 72, is the honorary president of the United
Liberal Democrats (ULD) and was prime minister of former President
Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
Many GNP young members stood against Kim's appointment because
they regard Kim as a leader of old guard forces.
</P>
<P>
However, a group of senior lawmakers, for the sake of political
stability, called on the party to support Kim, who helped Kim
Dae-jung, leader of the National Congress for New Politics (NGNP),
win the nation's 15th presidential election last December.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached by the NGNP and the ULD on forming a
united front to defeat Lee Hoi-chang in the presidential campaign,
Kim Jong-pil would take the post of prime minister if Kim Dae-jung
won the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, who won the election, is expected to nominate Kim
Jong-pil as prime minister before or after his presidential
inauguration on February 25.

<HEADLINE> China's Power Industry to Undergo Technological Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's power industry will
undergo a large-scale technological innovation to control
pollution, increase economic benefit and guarantee safe operation.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yanchang, vice-minister of power, made the remarks in an
interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
He said China by 2000 will complete the technological
innovation of 7.5-to-8 million kilowatt medium- and low-pressure
condenser-tube generating units which have been in operation for
at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to improve the capability of the units to meet
peak-hour demands for power, increase security, lower consumption
of energy and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Referring to energy consumption, Lu said that coal consumption
in power plants in China will be reduced by an averaging 34 grams
for generating a kilowatt hour of electricity in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, voltage in more than 95 percent of major Chinese
cities will meet its standard, and the reliability rate of power
supply will reach 99.9 percent, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the power grids in China will strengthen coordination
in power supplies, so that the capability of the country's five
major regional power companies and 15 provincial power companies
could match international standards in the transfer and control of
power supplies.

<HEADLINE> China's Machine Tools Market to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's market demands for
domestically produced machine tools will remain around 160,000
this year.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Ministry of the Machinery-Building
Industry said that China built 159,600 machine tools on average
annually from 1980 to 1996, with the highest annual output
amounting to 260,000 and the lowest annual output at 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The average output of previous years has basically reflected
the market's average consumption demands for domestically made
machine tools, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
While keeping total output of machine tools at 160,000, China
expects to have an improved product mix this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, prices for domestically produced
machine tools will remain stable with some cuts, but prices for
imported machine tools will rebound after marked declines in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China's export of machine tools should increase this year in
the wake of intensified enterprise reform, improved product quality,
increased customer base through the Internet and support of state
policies.
</P>
<P>
The demand for digit-controlled machine tools, special-purpose
machine tools and complete plants, and automatic machine tools
will increase 10 percent to 12 percent this year, while demands
for other products will remain stable or even go down.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's largest
cigarette wholesaler, L Suzman Distributors, has applied for
voluntary liquidation, putting 800 jobs at risk, local daily the
Citizen reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year-old company, with 15 branches throughout the
country, has been forced to close, mainly by the government's
excise tax policy on tobacco, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chris van der Walt, managing director of the company, said the
official policy has seen excise duties increase by 25 percent in
1994, 25 percent in 1995, 18 percent in 1996 and 52 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
"These increases have caused volumes to decline by almost 30
percent from 1994 to 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation was exacerbated by the fact that cigarettes in
1997 became the product of choice for syndicates involved in
value added tax (VAT)-related fraud, where cigarettes are
ostensibly exported but ended up in the informal market where
they compete with wholesalers sellers legal stock, Van de Walt
said.
</P>
<P>
L Suzman, founded in 1889, has until recently distributed
almost 30 percent of the cigarettes sold in South Africa.

BAGHDAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz has voiced welcome to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's upcoming visit to Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with CNN Tuesday night, Aziz said that Iraq
is ready to receive Annan and discuss with him the issue of
U.N. arms inspectors' search of Iraqi presidential sites in order
to solve the crisis "created by the United States."
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Tuesday evening in a statement that it would
try to make a success Annan's mediation mission in Iraq to settle
the current Iraq-U.N. standoff peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. crisis erupted as Iraq bars U.N. weapons

hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said late Tuesday that he will make a trip to
Baghdad Friday to try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis,
adding that an advance team would leave Tuesday night for Baghdad
to prepare the ground for his visit.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit to Iraq is widely believed as the last-ditch
international effort to end the Iraq-U.N. standoff in a peaceful
way.
</P>

The U.S. and Britain repeatedly threatened to launch military
strike against Iraq if diplomacy fails to pry open Iraqi sites
where dangerous weapons may be hidden.

<HEADLINE> Laws Guiding China's Economic Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Laws are playing an
increasingly important role in China's economic operations.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the socialist market economy, as defined in the
revised Chinese Constitution, can be largely characterized by
sound economic improvements and significant legal achievements
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress (NPC), the country's highest
legislative body, set a historical precedent during the period by
issuing a series of 50 laws to guide and standardize the
transition of the economic system from a planned to a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The laws, including the first Company Law, Budget Law and Law
on Unfair Competition, have attracted wide-spread international
attention from the international community as China has introduced
major steps to establish market mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers note that guiding the economic transition by law has
been a historical task for China's Eighth NPC since it was
convened some five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The congress regarded economic legislation as an urgent
priority and proposed the initial formation of a legal framework
for China's socialist market economy during its term of office.
</P>
<P>
The congress has successfully achieved the target during its term
of office which will expire in March.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth NPC has enacted 118 laws over the past five years,
half of which are directly related to operations of the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The congress fully considered the experience of other
countries when formulating the laws.
</P>
<P>
Dovetailing China's economic legal system with international
regulations not only will accelerate the country's legislative
process, but also will help to integrate the nation's economy with
the world market, according to one high-ranking legislator.
</P>
<P>
He said China's current legislative efforts regarding the
market economy will yield huge rewards resulting from successful
market reform in the 21st century.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the east African
countries are to meet here this weekend to discuss on the Burundi
issue which has been under regional sanctions since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state from Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Zimbabwe are
scheduled to arrive here on Saturday for the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lewis Balinda, head of information under Ugandan Foreign
Ministry, told Xinhua Wednesday that the meeting will focus on
the present situation in Burundi and review the embargo imposed
on this central African state after the ruling junta seized power
in a coup on July 25, 1996, and removed the elected government of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were aimed at forcing the ruling junta to start
political reforms, to open dialogue with political opposition and
to contain ethnic-related violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions on Burundi include suspending vital exports and
imports, air links and diplomatic relations at ambassadorial
level with the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts by the military junta to meet regional
demands to reopen parliament and free opposition leaders,
confrontations in the country are still serious.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Receives Saddam's "Positive Message" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Wednesday he received a "positive message" from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and expressed his high hope for reaching
a peaceful solution to the Iraqi-U.N. face-off.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after receiving Syrian Vice President
Abdul Halim Khaddam and his accompanying delegation, "I think that
our brothers in Iraq understand the situation."
</P>
<P>
He did not give details of Saddam's message.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are exerted on the part of Russia, France, the U.N.,
the Arab League and other countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Syria have also exerted efforts and I have great
hopes, and I wish, that the crisis is resolved peacefully," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president held a telephone conversation Wednesday
morning with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al Assad and they
coordinated stances to exert their utmost efforts towards a
diplomatic resolve.
</P>
<P>
The developments of the Iraqi crisis were also examined at
Wednesday's meeting, which also included Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa has warned Tuesday that the Mideast peace process
would become the "first victim" of the military strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Expressing hope that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's
mission to Baghdad succeeds, he said he has "high hopes" for a
peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Iraqi president would work hard to render Annan's
visit successful. This will be the last chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful settlement will rescue Iraq and the region from
"countless problems," Mubarak said, adding that he will send
another messages to Saddam. He has sent at least six messages to
the Iraqi leader since the crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told reporters that on Tuesday night he phoned
U.S. President Bill Clinton who expressed hope that the Iraqi
crisis would be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"I assured him that I will continue my efforts towards a
peaceful settlement of the Iraqi crisis," said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened to strike Iraq if
it does not grant full access to U.N. inspectors seeking to
eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, the U.N. chief will go to Baghdad on Friday in a
last-ditch drive to secure Iraqi compliance with the arms
inspection and avert the imminent military strike.

<P>
Jiangsu enjoys a relatively higher economic growth rate and has
witnessed rapid growth in the per-capita income of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The development of markets has not only improved the living
standards of farmers, but also promoted local economic development.
</P>
<P>
For example, one grain market in Xinghua city in northern

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Crime Declining: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has
said that the number of serious crimes including murder and armed
robbery in South Africa is declining rather than increasing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliament hearing on safety and security on
Tuesday, South African Police Service Chief Executive Officer
Keyer Khan, said for the past two years there had been an average
15 percent decline in serious crimes with the exception of rape.
</P>
<P>
Khan said with the programs put in place in terms of the
National Crime Prevention Strategy, he believed that in four to
five years South Africa would be among the top 20 of the world's
safest countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the 190 countries of the world, South Africa was among only
70 that were capable of releasing reliable scientific statistics
on crime, an important step toward understanding the nature and
level of crime in the country, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
According to South Africa's National Police Commissioner
George Fivaz, armed robberies, including heists and vehicle
hijackings, had dropped over the past two years by more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said police authorities would implement one-billion Rand
(500 million U.S. Dollars) automatic fingerprint identification
system to facilitate the effective tracing of suspects and tle
linking of such suspects with any other crimes.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong-based company
and the World Wild Fund for Nature Hong Kong (WWF HK) signed a
contract here on Wednesday for joint action in the protection of
wild tigers.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract for a campaign named Keep the Tiger's
Color in Your World, those who purchase any Lexmark color inkjet
printers during the 12 months of the Year of the Tiger will be
helping donate thousands of HK dollars to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Lexmark International (China) Ltd. has promised to donate 10 HK
dollars to WWF HK for every such machine sold during the whole
year. The donations could be as high as a couple of hundreds of
thousands of HK dollars, depending on the sales.
</P>
<P>
Lexmark also donated an amount of money in cash and printers to
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Money raised from the campaign will be used for conservation
initiatives and to better educate the public about the tiger's
plight. The tiger's population has been declining due to the
destruction of its natural habitat and poaching.
</P>
<P>
The tiger is believed to have originated in East Asia. The
tiger, as one of the most feared animals in the world, is a
protector of mankind, especially children and peace in Chinese
tradition. But the number of tigers has dwindled from 100,000 at
the beginning of the century to between 5,000 and 7,000 today.
</P>
<P>
"Unless drastic action is taken, the tiger's fearful symmetry,
one of nature's most beautiful creations, and the inspiration of
legend and poetry for thousands of years, may not be here to greet
the next Year of the Tiger in 2010," said Kwan Kam Fan, WWF HK's
general manager of fundraising and membership.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Emphasizes Need To Study Deng Theory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- In an article that appeared
today, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that there needs to be a
more in-depth study of Deng Xiaoping Theory on the anniversary of
the late leader's death on February 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Jiang said, the Chinese people have grieved
over the loss of a great statesman and the chief architect of the
country's reforms, opening up, and modernization, but have
continued to follow the path of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics that he began.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, held
its 15th Party Congress successfully, and had scored a number of
successes in economics, politics, science and technology,
education, culture, the military, and foreign affairs, he said,
and although Deng is gone, the Chinese people have been all the
more determined to adhere to his theory and carry on his cause.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged Party officials to be exemplary in their study of
Deng Xiaoping Theory, which the 15th Party Congress decided is the
guiding ideology of the CPC. It is the most important strategy to
come from the Congress, and is considered a fundamental guarantee
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics for the next
century.

<P>
This should begin with a systematic reading of Deng's works,
and of the Party's important documents since the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Committee held in late 1978 and some
important works by Marx and Lenin, and works by Mao Zedong, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that officials should concentrate on the
scientific nature and system and essence of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
especially emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts,
which is also the quintessence of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao
Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping Theory was developed, Jiang said, and generations of
Marxists have continued to solve problems and make new progress.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the fundamental tenets of Marxism and the
country's concrete conditions, he said, Deng drew new conclusions
to the question about what socialism is and how to build
socialism, and developed the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, which has guided the Party and nation in
bringing the socialist cause to a new level.

<HEADLINE> Tax Revenue Growth Slows in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate for China's
industrial and commercial tax revenue slowed somewhat during the
first month of this year, according to the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
China collected more than 61.1 billion yuan in industrial and
commercial taxes in January, up 7.6 percent on the 1996
period. The growth rate was down 5.8 percentage points compared
to the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The SAT attributed the slowdown to the extended holiday season
during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, which commenced on
January 28.
</P>
<P>
SAT figures indicate that value-added and domestic consumption
tax revenue, two major tax items under China's tax system
introduced in 1994, stood at 25.1 billion yuan in January, down
five percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Income taxes collected from foreign-funded enterprises soared
20.9 percent to two billion yuan in January, with personal income
taxes surging 26.2 percent to 2.4 billion yuan, and taxes on
securities trading soared 4.67-fold to 1.99 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Emphasizes Need To Study Deng Theory (part 4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marxism is a science that was founded in the 1840s and has
witnessed great changes in the past 150 years, he
acknowledged. For generations, Marxists have maintained its
vigorous vitality by taking a creative attitude towards Marxism on
the basis of the specific situation of each country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said a theory is the summary of practice and comes from
practice and will undergone tests in practice before it becomes a
guideline for further practice. It will enrich and develop itself
through practice. This is the case for Marxism, Mao Zedong
Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, and it is fortunate that the
CPC has Deng Xiaoping Theory as invaluable ideological asset after
having Mao Zedong Thought, he said.
</P>
<P>
To build socialism with Chinese characteristics is a great
undertaking that is guided by Deng Xiaoping, who laid the
foundation for its advancement.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that "we can only inherit and advance the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics that Deng started
by taking fresh steps and summing up new experience." This is the
only correct attitude towards Deng Xiaoping Theory, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted his own speech at the 15th Party Congress, where
he said that "it is the solemn historical responsibility of the
collective leadership of the CPC Central Committee to keep to Deng
Xiaoping Theory and continue to enrich and creatively develop the
theory."
</P>
<P>
To mark the anniversary of the death of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
once more said that all Party members, especially those of the CPC
Central Committee and the collective Party leadership must take it
as their own noble duty to study and adhere to and develop Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
This is not only the essential guarantee for advancing the
cause of the CPC but the best way to remember Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Emphasizes Need to Study Deng Theory (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The study of Deng Xiaoping Theory should be for the sake of
application, Jiang said, and it must be combined with internal and
external reality, in various areas and departments. The theory can
be used to guide practice and resolve practical and crucial
problems.
</P>
<P>
Whether theory is combined with practice is a matter of style
of study and a political issue that are related to the success or
failure of our cause, he said, and quoted Chairman Mao Zedong, who
compared the relation between theory and practice to that between
an arrow and its target. The arrow is Marxism held by Chinese
Communists and the target is the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang quoted Mao as saying that it is insignificant
but detrimental to talk about empty theory while ignoring the
practice of the Chinese revolution, and China's current reality is
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the reforms, the
opening-up, and the modernization. Any theory separated from such
reality is not correct and therefore inapplicable.
</P>
<P>
So, theoretical study must focus on practical problems in the
course of the country's reforms, opening-up, and moderization
drive, on the application of Maxism, and on new practices and new
theoretical development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
But, people need to adhere to its basic point of view on the
one hand and enrich and develop it through practice on the other,
he noted, this is a scientific view of Marxism. This is the
attitude Lenin used to cope with Marxism, Mao Zedong used to cope
with Marxism-Leninism, and Deng used to cope with Marxism,
Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 15 persons, including six
children, were killed as sea erosion devastated the Abari
community along the Forcados River in Delta State, southern
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The annual erosion also swept away more than nine houses, 10
fishing boats and property worth thousands of Naira, while
threatening an oil pipeline there, the Guardian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>

It quoted community spokesman Tare Faka as saying that weekend
occurrence had forced hundreds of indigenes, mostly women and
children, to flee while others who feared their houses could be
affected were busy evacuating their property.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman blamed that successive state and federal
administrations failed to address the suffering of the community
inhabited by about 9,000 people who are mainly subsistence
farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 400 meters width and about 1.2 km length of the
community's water front has been violently eroded in the Forcados
River since the early 1970s, Faka said.
</P>
<P>
If it is allowed to continue, the entire community stands the
risk of being wiped out, he warned.

million U.S. dollars) in 1998-1999 and 19.9 billion HK dollars
(2.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the four years up to 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
"The concessions do not undermine one of our most significant
and stable sources of revenue, nor do they in any way detract from
our ability to spend money on community programs," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Other business-related taxes, such as capital duty, stamp duty
on stock transaction, hotel accommodation tax and air passenger
departure tax are also lowered to help tourism and other business
sectors, Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to lower rates, which the government levies on
landed properties to finance various public services, from 5
percent to 4.5 percent for a single year, so as to give benefit to
"the greatest number of individuals and businesses of the
community."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Army Reshuffles Leadership Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda army leadership has
been reshuffled again within two and a half months, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni, who doubles as the
Commander-in-Chief of the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF),
Tuesday appointed Brigadier Mugume, the former Chief of
Operations and Training, as the Deputy Army Commander, a post
vacant since 1990 when Major Fred Rwigyema, Mugume's predecessor,
defected to Rwandese Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Fred Tolit, the former Director of Military
Intelligence, replaced Joram Mugume. Tolit, in his turn, was
succeeded by Colonel Henry Tumukunde, the former Army Chief of
Personnel and Administration.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Ivan Koreta, the former first division Commander,
was appointed as the deputy Director of the Internal Security
organization. The post left by the brigadier was filled by
Colonel Edson Muzoora, the deputy Commander of the fourth
division stationed in the north.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Charles Angina, the former Operation Commander of the
second division, assumed the post of the division's commander.
His predecessor Colonel Peter Kerim was suspended due to
allegations concerning abuse of office.
</P>
<P>
Lt Colonel Geoffrey Taban Kyabihende, the first division
Second-in-Commander, was promoted to full Colonel and shifted to
the post of the Commander of the third division stationed in the
east.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has four divisions. Brigadier James Kazini, the former
Commander of the second division, was appointed on January 4 as
the new acting Chief of Staff. He was replaced by Colonel Katumba
Wamala.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's reshuffle also witnessed a shift of Brigadier Ali
Kiiza, the former Director of the Air Force, to the post of
Presidential Advisor on Air Force. He was replaced by his deputy,
Colonel Masaba (one name).
</P>
<P>
Eight Majors have been promoted to Lt. Colonel, and three Lt.
Colonel promoted to full Colonel Tuesday. Tuesday's
reorganization of the army leadership also involved 25 officers
above the rank of Major.
</P>
<P>
The highest military rank in the country is Lieutenant
General. The only Lieutenant General is President and
Commander-in-Chief Museveni himself. Promotion to Major and
shifting of an officer above Major must be approved by the
President and the Commander in-Chief.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier reshuffle in January, President Museveni
appointed a new caretaker of the Defense Ministry, a new Army
Commander and a new Chief of Staff.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Reaps Record Fiscal Surplus in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong recorded a
historic high fiscal surplus in the 1997-98 financial year thanks
to the exceptional surge of land premium and stamp duty in the
government's coffers.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-99 Financial Budget address delivered Wednesday,
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang reviewed the state of public
finance for the current financial year, which ends on March 31.
</P>
<P>
"I am now forecasting a surplus for 1997-98 of 77 billion HK
dollars (9.9 billion U.S. dollars)," Tsang said. "Our total fiscal
reserves at the end of March 1998 (including the Land Fund) are
expected to be 445.6 billion HK dollars (57 billion U.S.
dollars)."
</P>
<P>
The hefty surplus mainly came from higher-than-expected
receipts from land sale and stamp duty, reflecting the exceptional
level of turnover in both the stock and property markets in the
first half of the financial year.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative region
(SAR) received 197 billion HK dollars (25 billion U.S. dollars)
worth of land fund and injected the sum into its fiscal reserves.
"This marked an unparalleled increase in our reserves and a unique
boost to public finances that can offer Hong Kong an enduring
advantage," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Drawing lessons from the Asian financial turmoil, Tsang said:
"It is necessary for the administration to hold substantial public
funds in reserve." He pointed out that these reserves are needed
to meet the operating, contingency and monetary requirements of
public finance.
</P>
<P>
"On the monetary side, a reserve to underpin exchange rate
stability is desirable," he said, adding that "... experience has
shown that the higher the fiscal reserves, the greater the public
confidence."
</P>
<P>
Tsang stressed: "Good reserves are vital to international
confidence in our finances and in the maintenance of the linked
exchange rate. They are fundamental to our economic prospects."

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Appeals for Aid to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has called for immediate humanitarian
assistance to the people of Sierra Leone, where the situation is
returning to normalcy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday in Abuja, the ECOWAS appealed to the
international community and humanitarian agencies to immediately
resume delivery of humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS' appeal came after the peace-keeping force under its
command, the ECOMOG, has reportedly gained control over most part
of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
After one week's fighting, the ECOMOG chased out troops loyal
to the military junta led by Major Johnny Koroma from Freetown
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to defense sources in Nigeria, the Major troops
contributor, ECOMOG's task for now has changed from peace
enforcement to peace-building.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, ECOWAS reaffirmed its commitment to the
reinstalment of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was overthrown
by Koroma in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
Food situation in Sierra Leone is said to be very bad, as the
west African country has been under international sanctions and
embargo since the coup, and continuous fightings between Koroma's
soldiers and Nigerian-led ECOMOG force have made humanitarian aid
almost impossible.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy to Grow 3.5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is
projected to grow a moderate 3.5 percent in 1998, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said on Wednesday when delivering the
1998-1999 financial budget at the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
"Although much depends on the duration of the region's
financial instability and on the speed of our own adjustment
process, I consider this growth forecast realistic," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.2 percent in 1997
despite strong performance in the first three quarters, reflecting
the effects in the final quarter of the regional financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
For the two major components of domestic demand in 1998, the
top financial official predicted a 3-percent growth for private
consumption expenditure and a 2.5-percent increase for gross
domestic fixed capital formation.
</P>
<P>
In the external sector, given the strength of the U.S. dollar,
to which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged, relative to other Asian
currencies, total exports of goods may have a slightly slower
growth, Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
He expected total exports of goods to grow 4.8 percent in 1998,
comprising an increase of 1 percent in domestic exports and 5.5
percent in re-exports.
</P>
<P>
On exports of services, Tsang predicted a growth of 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the tourism industry, Hong Kong's major foreign
exchange earner, has been making intensive efforts to regain
business, it "may take some time to recover from the recent
blows," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the edge we possess in a wide range of service
areas should help sustain growth in our trade-related services, as
well as in our export of financial and other professional and
business support services," he added.
</P>
<P>
As the economy slackens, unemployment is likely to rise in
months ahead, the financial secretary said. But he pointed out
that the government is carrying out major construction programs
which will provide much direct employment.
</P>
<P>
On inflation, he predicted that the Composite Consumer Price
Index will rise to an average of around 5 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Riot-hit Dar Returns to Peace: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam
police chief has assured that the residents in the Tanzanian
capital should not fear for their lives and properties after last
week's riots by Moslem fanatics.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Gewe, the Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander,
quoted Tuesday the intelligence reports as saying that the area
near downtown Mwembe Chai Mosque, where two people were killed
last Friday when the armed police quenched a Moslem-led riot, has
become peaceful.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reported incidents of unrest throughout the
city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gewe praised the police for preventing a seemingly inevitable
outbreak of violence Monday when thousands of angry mourners
buried the two victims.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that uniformed police officers, armed with
sub-machines guns, kept a distance from the mourners in an
apparent way to avoid provoking them into a riot.
</P>
<P>
"If they had rioted and destroyed vehicles or looted like they
had done before, we would have hit hard," one police official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The police killed two people in the first bloody riot since
Tanzania's independence in 1961 from the British colonial rule
last Friday when they tried to disperse a mob of some 2,000 near
the Mwembe Chai Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted last Thursday when the Moslems protested
the detention of their leader for attacking other religions by
destroying dozens of vehicles and stoned the approaching police.

<HEADLINE> Linked Exchange Rate Mechanism to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- "The linked exchange rate
mechanism has served us well for the last 14 years. It has been
the anchor for monetary policy and stable economic growth. It
should continue," Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He spent quite a few minutes speaking of currency stability and
monetary management when unveiling the 1998-1999 budget of Hong
Kong and also the first full budget of the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) at the Provisional Legislative Council this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been conducting a review
of the currency defenses since last October and a clear consensus
from the review is that the HK dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar
should stay, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Crucial to Hong Kong's prospects in the years ahead is the
stability of the currency," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
There is understandable public concern at the price paid for
defending the Hong Kong dollar: a sharp interest rate hike,
corrections in the stock and property markets and pressures
exerted on businesses and home buyers, Tsang admitted.
</P>
<P>
However, "the uncertainty and disturbance that would be caused
by a change in our exchange rate regime could destroy public
confidence in the monetary system. That would fatally damage Hong
Kong as the leading international financial center in the region,"
Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the loss of the stability that we have provided
in the region could also trigger a fresh wave of devaluation that
would wash back on us."
</P>
<P>
A free floating exchange rate would not be a panacea, Tsang
continued, adding that regional economies with floating exchange
rates have seen sharper falls in their asset values.
</P>
<P>
From the start of 1997 to early February this year, the value
of stocks in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea have
fallen by 62 percent, 65 percent, 76 percent and 54 percent,
respectively, in U.S. dollar terms and by 47 percent in Singapore,
compared to the drop of 22 percent in value in Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index.
</P>
<P>
The full report of the review is to be published within March.
The international Monetary Fund and overseas experts, local
academics, analysts, businessmen and market participants have been
consulted.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parliament Elections Won't Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Screening of candidates for the
Nigerian National Assembly elections would begin as scheduled on
March 5, no matter whether or not the parties have concluded
their primaries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the April 25 National Assembly elections and all
other elections will be held as scheduled, according to the
National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECOM).
</P>
<P>
The NECOM reaffirmation came amidst speculations that some
parties may not be able to meet the February 25 deadline for
party primaries from where the candidates are supposed to emerge,
New Nigerian reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission will soon released its guidelines for the
election, said NECOM Chairman Chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack in the
capital Abuja on Tuesday, quoted by the official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to him, NECOM has delineated 360 constituencies for
the House of Representatives and 109 constituencies for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Under the timetable for activities of the Nigerian military
administration's transition to civil rule program, the five
political parties should submit to NECOM their nominated
candidates for the National Assembly election before March 2.
</P>
<P>
The elections of governorship and president will be held on
August 1, with the president elected inaugurated on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The governorship election was originally billed for
July-September last year. It was rescheduled on ground that it
will create difficulties for civilian state governors to work
under a military head of state.
</P>
<P>
The current military government led by General Sani Abacha,
which came into power in November 1993, produced the three-year
transition program in 1995.

<HEADLINE> S. African Media Needs Improvement: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki complained Tuesday that the local media was
doing a bad job of covering the positive aspects of South
Africa's changing society, The Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said coverage of President Nelson Mandela's speech at
the African National Congress (ANC) Mafikeng conference in
December had demonstrated the deficiencies in South African
journalism.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three percent of the information in Mandela's speech
was not passed on to readers, Mbeki told a meeting of the
International Advisory Board of Independent Newspapers in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"The media concentrated on something like 17 percent of the
speech, mainly those sections that made critical remarks about
the press, the opposition and NGOs."
</P>
<P>
"How do we change the society if we don't even know about it?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
Positive aspects such as the fact that the amount of steel
sold in the first half of 1997 had equaled two-third of the steel
sold in the whole of 1996 was not fully understood or reported by
the South African media, said the deputy president.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the stories the media had until recently not
reported was the fact that crime had been dropping steadily since
1994. This was reported in The Star only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the reason this development was ignored for so long
was that there was a "pessimistic mind set" that said crime was
out of control.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that all severe crimes except rape
have stabilized or even been on the decline, but the crime levels
are still unacceptably high in the country.
</P>
<P>
He called for more transformation of the press so that
different types of voices could be heard, and said the quality of
reporting should be improved, perhaps by more training.
</P>
<P>
There was a trend for senior journalists to join management so
that they could get a better salary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's view of the media was even more negative. In an
interview with the SABC television last week, he said there was a
force in the media to help destabilize the country. He also
blasted the media at the ANC national conference.

<HEADLINE> UN Agencies Publish Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Two United Nations agencies
published here on Wednesday guidelines to protect human rights and
health where HIV/AIDS is concerned and offer assistance, not just
for people living with HIV, but for society in general.
</P>
<P>
Creating an environment in which there is respect for the human
rights of people infected with the virus or affected by it in
other ways (AIDS orphans, for example) will help them live a life
of dignity without discrimination, the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, and UNAIDS, a joint UN Program on
HIV/AIDS, said.
</P>
<P>
They stated that such an environment can also reduce the
numbers of people vulnerable to infection.
</P>
<P>
In a climate of discrimination, people are less likely to
present themselves for voluntary HIV testing and are driven
underground, the agencies pointed out, adding that those people
are thus denied access to treatment, care and support, hindering
efforts by public health authorities to control the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The measures proposed in the guidelines follow three broad
approaches:
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing awareness of the human rights principles
underlying a positive and sustainable response to HIV/AIDS;
</P>
<P>
-- Providing action-oriented measures to be employed by
governments in the areas of law, administrative policy and
practice that will protect human rights and achieve HIV-related
public health goals;
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing private sector and community participation in the
response to HIV/AIDS, including building capacity and
responsibility of civil society to respond ethically and
effectively.

<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade surplus rose to
121.7 billion marks (70.1 billion U.S. dollars at average 1997
rates) last year, a record since the 1990 reunification, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The result, the third highest Germany has ever achieved, is
compared to 98.5 billion marks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Germany's deficit in the current accounts dropped
to 10.1 billion marks from 19.8 billion marks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Germany's exports hit a record of 887.3 billion marks,
up 12.5 percent from 1996, while imports rose by 10.9 percent to
765.6 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The office noted that the country registered an increase of
17.2 percent in exports to Asia, despite the crisis there.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang Yam-kuen Wednesday unveiled the first full budget of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), which, in his
words, is essentially a balanced budget for 1998-99 in the time of
economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Tsang spent two hours presenting to the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) the Budget address, entitled "Riding out the storm,
Reviewing Hong Kong strengths".
</P>
<P>
He told the 60-strong legislature: "The main thought that has
shaped this Budget is that in this time of economic
uncertainty... the measures that I set out must aim to provide
comfort, bolster confidence and strengthen competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
"We might meet the objective in two ways," said the financial
secretary, "First, by reducing burdens on individuals and giving
them new incentives. Second, through measures that strengthen our
economy, that help to propagate competitive, enterprising business
activity."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the total expenditure for the next financial
year would amount to 248 billion HK dollars (32 billion U.S.
dollars). This figure is equal to the government spending of 233
billion HK dollars (30 billion U.S. dollars) plus 15.2 billion HK
dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars) outlays from the Capital
Investment Fund.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue for 1998-99 is estimated to hit 247 billion
HK dollars (31.6 billion U.S. dollars). With 11.7 billion HK
dollars (1.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of land fund added, the
fiscal reserves in the 1998-99 financial year will stand at 10.7
billion HK dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The surplus forecast for 1998-99 is prudent," said Tsang,
"What I am presenting is essentially a balanced budget for
1998-99."

<P>
As for the passing financial year, he forecast a surplus of 77
billion HK dollars (98.7 billion U.S. dollars). "That was the
exceptional and record level of government receipts from land
premiums and stamp duty in the first half of the financial year,"
he said. The accumulated fiscal reserves will hit 446 billion HK
dollars (57 billion U.S. dollars) on March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said: "Good reserves are vital to international
confidence in our finances and in the maintenance of the linked
exchange rate. They are fundamental to our economic prospects."
Meanwhile, he stressed that the SAR government has been increasing
support to the community even as the reserves have been
strengthening.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account outlays from government agencies such as
the Housing Authority, total public expenditure will reach 288.8
billion HK dollars (37 billion U.S. dollars) for 1998-99, a big
increase of 11.2 percent from the previous financial year.
Education, health, social welfare and housing are the major policy
areas that cut a big slice of the total public spending.
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side, Tsang proposed a series of measures to
reduce the burden on individuals ranging from salaries taxpayers
to home buyers and the needy. He also announced a string of
incentives for businesses, such as cutting corporate profits tax
to 16 percent from 16.5 percent, slashing Air Passenger Departure
Tax by half, and reducing hotel accommodation tax.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the gross domestic products (GDP) growth
would slow down to 3.5 percent in 1998 from 5.2 percent in
1997. he said that unemployment might go up slightly, and
inflation would edge down to 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the financial secretary reiterated: "Most of
all, we have adhered to our prudent fiscal policy and have
observed the provision of the Basic Law relevant to the Budget."
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the SAR shall follow the
principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in
drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance,
avoid deficit and keep the budget commensurate with the growth
rate of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The new financial year starts from April 1, 1998 and ends on
March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Travelers Check' Another Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- West African countries has
suffered another setback on their way toward a single monetary
zone in the sub-region as the launch of the must-awaited ECOWAS
travelers check billed for Tuesday was stalled.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) failed
last December to launch the regional financial instrument due to
disagreement of French speaking members countries.
</P>
<P>
The Francophone countries insisted that member countries owing
debt to the ECOWAS clearing system should settle the arrears.
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts to seal the rift in the past one and half
months do not seem to work. The scheme still failed to be
launched at a two-day ECOWAS meeting of Finance Ministers and
Central Bank Governors.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony Ani, this time however,
dismissed speculations that the failed launch had anything to do
with the disagreement.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental reason was "the inability of some heads of
state to arrive for the launching" in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the atmosphere of the meeting as "very conducive",
Ani disclosed neither the names of the heads of state absent nor
the reason of their absence.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of west African states, the umbrella Apex Bank
of the Francophone west Africa also denied any alleged
disagreements among the sub-regional body.
</P>
<P>
Ani said the meeting decided, among other things, the need to
launch the ECOWAS travelers check "without any further delay".
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Central Bank Governors were mandated to
meet in the next two weeks for the launching.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also called on member states in arrears of the
regional body's clearing system to settle the arrears "without
further delay".
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, these countries may be excluded from participating
in the scheme, Ani warned.
</P>
<P>
"There are two countries (Liberia and Guinea Bissau) that are
in arrears of about 20 million U.S. Dollars," according to him.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS travelers check is a new payment instrument to be
issued by member Central Banks to help facilitate the settlement
of both financial and commercial transactions within the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It is seen as the first step of ECOWAS toward achieving
economic integration and a single monetary zone by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong GDP Grows 5.2 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong economy grew by
5.2 percent in 1997 against the backdrop of the Asian financial
crisis, said Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen Wednesday
in his 1998-99 Budget address.
</P>
<P>
In the first full Budget of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), Tsang reviewed the economic
performance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1997 was an eventful year for the Hong Kong
economy, when the stock and property markets went through a period
of exceptional growth in the first three quarters. But the
regional financial turbulence changed the picture in the final
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic products (GDP) grew by 5.2 percent in 1997,
slightly above the five percent growth in 1996. Inflation
continued to moderate to 5.8 percent, the lowest for a
decade. Unemployment rate came down to 2.2 percent in the third
quarter, and eased back to 2.5 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
On the trade side, total exports of goods increased 6.1 percent
last year, re-exports moderated to 6.8 percent, and domestic
exports slowed down to grow by merely two percent.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said that tourism suffered badly last
year, bringing down the overall exports of services to zero
growth.
</P>
<P>
He contributed a particular section of his speech to economic
reform in China's interior area, saying that Hong Kong is
fortunate to have the mainland as its economic hinterland. "The
economy there continued to grow robustly, at around nine percent
in 1997, with near zero inflation and with little spill-over
effect from the regional financial situation," said Tsang.

<HEADLINE> Package of Tax Concessions Announced in HK Budget (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang Wednesday announced a package of tax relief
measures in the first full budget of the Special Administrative
Region to reduce burdens on the common people and help business.
</P>
<P>
The package will be seen as a serious attempt "to leave money
with those who have earned it, to confront uncertain times by
enhancing the competitiveness of our business and by reducing
burdens on individuals and families," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
The package will cost the revenue 13.6 billion HK dollars (1.7
billion U.S. dollars) in 1998-1999 and nearly 100 billion HK
dollars (12.7 billion U.S. dollars) up to 2001-2002, according to
Tsang, who delivered a televised budget speech to the Provisional
Legislative Council Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the harsher economic outlook in the year ahead,
concessions on this scale are affordable, thanks to the underlying
strength of our economy and our prudent fiscal management," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The historic budget, with the theme "Riding out the storm,
renewing Hong Kong strengths," is a balanced one with expenditure
standing at 248 billion HK dollars (32 billion U.S. dollars) and
revenue totaling 259 billion HK dollars (33 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On salaries tax, Tsang proposed to raise the basic personal
allowance by 8 percent from 100,000 HK dollars (12,800
U.S. dollars) to 108,000 HK dollars (13,800 U.S. dollars) and the
married person's allowance, also by 8 percent, from 200,000 HK
dollars (25,600 U.S. dollars) to 216,000 HK dollars (27,700
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget also made changes in the marginal tax structure from
which the middle class, in particular the "sandwich class," will
benefit most while the number of the high class who have to pay
the standard rate, at 15 percent, of salaries tax will be reduced
from 71,000 to 10,000.

<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Wednesday reiterated the Philippines' position on the issue
of U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq, calling on all parties
involved to resolve the conflict through peaceful negotiation.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly press conference, Ramos said the position of the
Philippine government, "just like the position of many other
countries in the Middle East, which are the countries directly
affected ... is to exhaust all peaceful diplomatic means."
</P>
<P>
Ramos said there is no need to push the panic button. However,
he admitted that the government is making some "quiet
preparations" to ensure the safety and welfare of some 600,000
Filipino workers in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine government is updating its contingency
plan and putting it in the proper context, adding that the
situation now in the Gulf is different from the invasion of Kuwait
by Iraq in 1990.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) Americans, Norwegins Share Golds, Daehlie MakesHistory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Americans and Norwegians
shared the limelight on the 12th day of the 18th Olympic Winter Games,
but it was Bjoern Daehlie who made history on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nikki Stone and Eric Bergoust completed an American sweep of the
freestyle skiing aerials in the morning, which propelled the U.S. gold
tally in Nagano to five.
</P>
<P>
Stone displayed a stable performance in the women's aerials,
beating China's Xu Nannan to win the title in 193.00 points.
</P>
<P>
Xu Nannan gave a near-perfect composition in the second round,
winning 99.40 points, which ensured a silver medal for China.
</P>
<P>
Colette Brand of Switzerland finished third at 171.83.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's event, Bergoust was no match to other 11
finalists. The American skiier collected 255.64 points from two
rounds, beating his nearest rival Sebastien Foucras of France by about
seven points. Belarussian Dmitri Dashchinsky was third at 240.79.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the hills and slopes, Bjoern Daehlie became the first
athlete in Winter Olympics history to win seven gold medals when
Norway edged Italy by 0.2 seconds in the men's 4x10km relay.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie, the gold medalist in the 10km and the silver medalist in
the 15km last week, also moved past cross country skiier Raisa
Semtanina of the former Soviet Union with his 11th career winter
medal.
</P>
<P>
Norway won the relay in a time of one hour, 40 minutes and 55.7
seconds. Italy was timed 1:40:55.9 and Finland took the bronze in
1:42:15.
</P>
<P>
In the men's biathlon 10km sprint, which was postponed to Wednesday
after its cancellation yesterday due to bad weather, Ole Einar
Bjoerndalen added the second gold for Norway, which increased its gold
total to seven.
</P>
<P>
Bjoerndalen got the title with a time of 27 minutes and 16.2
seconds. His teammate Frode Andresen was second at 28:17.8 and Ville
Raikkonen of Finland third at 28:21.7.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather played havoc to Alpine skiing, forcing the men's giant
slalom to be rescheduled for Thursday after overnight snowfall.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's competition also features women's figure skating short
program, which will see a fierce skating among American skaters Tara
Lipinski, Michelle Kwan, France's Vanessa Gusmeroli and Russians Irina
Slutskaya as well as Maria Butyrskaya.
</P>
<P>
Women's comeback hopefuls on the ice rink -- France's Surya Bonaly
coming off a tendon injury and China's Chen Lu coming off ankle
injuries -- are also medal contenders.
</P>
<P>
The short program is worth one-third of the total score. The
competition will conclude Friday with the long program.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's competitions also include the men's ice hockey
quarter-finals, with winners going into the semis.
</P>
<P>
After 12th day competitions, Russia remained the leading place in
the medal tally with eight golds. Germany and Norway were second at
seven golds each and the United States was the next at five.

<HEADLINE> Economic Review: China Rises to Unemployment Challenge (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
reached a crossroads in achieving a final solution to a growing
unemployment rate which presents an increasing threat to nation's
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the unemployment rate, which is
directly based on the number of registered jobless people, hit 3.1
percent in China's urban areas last year, with the figure
excluding unregistered unemployed workers such as the 10 million
people laid-off from debt-ridden state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While China's unemployment rate remains low when compared to
the worldwide average, the figure will rise as the nation
accelerates steps to reform the traditional enterprise system and
the economic structure, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the swelling ranks of unemployed resulted from
the country's industrialization process which led to an inevitable
conflict with the old economic system.
</P>
<P>
The economists added that an increasing number of bankruptcies
and mergers amongst state-owned sector will cause the unemployment
rate in the cities and towns to jump slightly in coming years.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment scheme, a state program to help unemployed
urban workers find new jobs will be critically important to
further development of the socialist market-oriented economy,
according to officials with the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the government has considered efforts to control the
unemployment rate as a major item on its agenda for economic
development since the initiation of reform some two decades ago.
The Chinese government initiative has generated some major
achievements over recent years.

<HEADLINE> Economic Review: China Rises to Unemployment Challenge  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fast-speed economic growth, especially in tertiary industry,
which includes the banking, insurance, real estate and tourism
sectors, has created new employment opportunities and greatly
enlarged the nation's ranks of workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to offering new service items, including community
and household services, the tertiary sector will be granted
priority in terms of state investments in order to take full
advantage of its role as an outlet for unemployment pressure and
its potential for high profits.
</P>
<P>
China will also adopt measures to shift labor-intensive
industries and primary processing enterprises from coastal regions
to underdeveloped inland areas in order to narrow the gap between
employment rates in coastal and inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment project China introduced three years ago in
some industrial cities has focused on providing technical training
and helping jobless people to find more job opportunities. The
project has effectively found new jobs for some 4.6 million
laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, most unemployed people are still inclined to depend on
the government, rather than trying their hand at the country's
booming labor market. The situation has resulted from the fact the
welfare, unemployment and medical insurance systems have not as yet
been fully perfected.
</P>
<P>
Experts underlined that the country should maintain the
unemployment rate at less than five percent between now and the
year 2000, a level which some consider alarming for a developing
economy.
</P>
<P>
China faces an arduous task if the current economic environment
remains unchanged, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel's Capital Inflow Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Affected by Asian financial
crisis and increasing risk in the foreign exchange market, overall
capital inflow in Israel dropped by 76 percent in the second half
of 1997, the Bank of Israel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Wednesday, the bank said the overall
capital inflow in the second half of 1997 shrank to 1.636 billion
U.S. dollars from 6.884 billion dollars in the first half.
</P>
<P>
But the total capital inflow of 8.52 billion dollars in the
whole year of 1997 was still up 39.82 percent over 1996 and was
comparable to the 8.828 billion dollars in 1995, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The bank explained that the change occurred because Israelis
stopped using foreign currency-linked loans and instead invested
in foreign currency-deposits.
</P>
<P>
These developments were the result of a reduction in the gap
between Israeli and foreign interest rates, the increasing risk in
the foreign exchange market following the widening of the shekel's
trading band against the basket of major foreign currencies, and
the negative effects on world exchange rate by Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the bank said that there was a considerable increase in
capital inflow on the part of foreigners, up to 2.2 billion
dollars from 1.5 billion dollars between January and June.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the financial sector investments by
foreigners totaled 2.1 billion dollars, compared to 1.4 billion
dollars in 1996. Transactions by foreigners on the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange doubled to 720 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
While the central bank's monetary policies have received
widespread criticism, Israel Discount Bank economists said that
the effect of Bank of Israel's monetary policies on the economic
growth rate in 1997 was comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
They said the major effects on the growth was a decline in the
construction because of the decrease in immigration, a decline in
tourism as a result of the deadlock in the peace process, the
removal of customs tariffs on imported goods to increase
competition.

<HEADLINE> Training Hard and Winning Golds  by Xinhua Sportswriter Zhou Jie, Liang Xiyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian team skiied a
little more than one hour and 40 minutes to win the men's cross
country skiing 4x10km relay, a normal victory in Nagano, but the gold
will make Bjoern Daehlie be remembered in history for long.
</P>
<P>
With the win in relay event, Daehlie put his name into the Olympic
record book with seven gold medals, an unprecendented mark set by any
athlete, male or female.
</P>
<P>
In Albertville in 1992, he won three golds; two years later in
Lillehammer in 1994, he bagged two more; and in Nagano, he grabbed
another two, becoming the greatest winter Olympian of all time.
</P>
<P>
Daehlie, 30, has swept all before him in a glittering career,
winning a welter of gold medal to establish himself as the finest ever
proponent of his discipline.
</P>
<P>
For Daehlie, distance, style and conditions could be no obstacles
to overcome and prevent him from becoming a true all-rounder, who
scored triumphs in the 15km free pursuit, the 50km freestyle, the 10km
classic and the relay.
</P>
<P>
Reason for the success? very simple, hard training.
</P>
<P>
To be a self-strict person and obsessive trainer, Daehlie would
take every condition and opportunity to training.
</P>
<P>
When the Norwegian ski team was on holiday in Hawaii as reward for
sweeping golds in Albertville Olympics, Daehlie was up in the early
morning to go running.
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, what marked me out from other youngsters was
that I wanted to train and train and train, come summer or winter.
Alone, at night, in the rain, whatever the conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his 1997 autobiography, Daehlie estimates that he covered
150,000 kilometers on skis, foot or cycling over the previous decade
-- the equivalent of almost four trips round the world.
</P>
<P>
The iron will and dedication brought glories to the Norwegian --
nine world championships golds, five overall World Cup titles, three
Olympic silvers, four world championships silvers, two world
championship bronzes, and the most important, seven Olympic golds.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Nagano, Daehlie put his aim at one gold in
Olympics. "If I manage to win one gold, it would be a fantastic
achievement. I'd be very happy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, with two golds in Nagano, he still remained calm. "I've not
been thinking about the record of seven Olympic titles. It's the
journalists who focus on it,"
</P>
<P>
"But it means something to me," he added,"I will appreciate it in
some years."

<HEADLINE> Nature Reserves Well Planned in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
set up 13 nature reserves to protect wildlife, special plants and
chilly natural environment on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
As a natural lab for research into geology and biology in
China, the reserves cover a total area of 326,000 square
kilometers or 27.1 percent of Tibet's area.
</P>
<P>
The Qomolangma Reserve, which was set up in 1989, was the
highest nature reserve in the world.
</P>
<P>
The state-class nature reserve covering Tingri, Dinggye, Nyalam
and Gyairong counties in southern Xigaze has varieties of tree
species such as fir, dragon spruce, Chinese hemlock, coniferous,
broadleaf trees as well as long-leaf pine and Himalayan ormosia trees.
</P>
<P>
In the forests of the reserve live long-tailed leaf monkeys,
Assamese macaques, Tar sheep, leopards and snow leopards, all
subject to national protection.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have discovered a fossil complex composed of the
three-toe horse, oak trees and spore pollen fossils in Gyirong,
which is evidence that the area rose abruptly after the late
Tertiary period.
</P>
<P>
The Changtang Nature Reserve, set up in 1993 in Shuanghu, Nyima
and Gerze counties in northern Tibet, is the largest zoo of its kind
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Covering a combined area of 247,100 square kilometers, it has
an average elevation of 5,000 meters. In the reserve, there are
Tibetan yaks, Tibetan antelopes, wild Tibetan donkeys and argalis,
all rare animals subject to second-class protection by the state.
</P>
<P>
In fresh-water and salt lakes in the reserve are found ducks,
cranes and fish unique to plateau lakes.
</P>
<P>
The Xainza Nature Reserve, located in Xainza County, Nagqu in
northern Tibet, is a black-necked crane zone.

Lakes here cover a total area of 40,000 square kilometers. Ice
water flows down the Kangdese Mountain into the lakes, where water
plants and animals thrive.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, home to black-necked cranes which are subject to
state first-class protection and one of China's seven reserves for
the black-necked crane, has the highest elevation and largest area
in China.
</P>
<P>
The Medog Nature Reserve at the turn of the Grand Cannon of the
Yarlung Zangbo River in southeast Tibet was set up in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Cannon has an elevation of 600 meters and features
plants that grow in humid areas in the Northern Hemisphere and in
tropical forests found in the northernmost part of the North
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 626.2 square kilometers, it is a museum of the
northernmost tropical forests in China. Rugged terrain and
frequent landslides make it impossible for the area to have a land
road that is open all the year round.
</P>
<P>
The Zayu Nature Reserve, covering 1,014 square kilometers in
Zayu County, Nyingchi Prefecture, is a zone of subtropical forests.
</P>
<P>
Part of the zone is 2,600 meters above sea level and there is
found the tropical ever-green broadleaf forest which is filled
with zhennan, camphor, sky-scraping Yunnan pine, palm and banana
trees and bamboo groves.
</P>
<P>
Another part with an elevation of some 2,600-3,200 meters above
sea level is home to the Chinese hemlock, oak and maple trees. In
the part 3,200-4,000 meters above sea level are the dragon
spruce and fir trees.
</P>
<P>
Animals found in the reserve include monkeys, leopards, lessor
pandas, forest must deer and red-billed lepothrix.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Arrives in Iran to Seek Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf arrived here Wednesday morning to seek Iran's
support for averting a U.S. military strike on his country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted al-Sahhaf as
saying that the goal of his visit was to discuss the ongoing
Iraq crisis with Iranian officials because Iran is the present
chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the Iraqi foreign minister would
encourage Iran to continue contacts with other countries and
international bodies to find a political solution to the standoff
between Iraq and the United Nations over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
This is al-Sahhaf's second trip to Tehran within a month. He
visited Iran last month to discuss normalization of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is under a threat of possible U.S. military strike
after it rejected U.N. arms inspectors to search several
presidential palaces suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the serious impacts of the U.S. military attack,
Iran urged the international community to find a political
solution to the Iraq crisis and called on Baghdad to comply with
all U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
With a strengthened diplomatic mediation of various countries,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Tuesday expressed optimism
for a peaceful end to the Iraq crisis, hoping that U.N
Secretary-General Kofi Annan would have a successful visit to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, Annan is expected to pay a visit to Iraq on Friday in a
last-ditch effort to solve the Iraq-U.N. standoff peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Southeast China Province to Balance Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province is seeking to balance its foreign trade gradually by
further increasing imports, Chen Zuwu, director of the local
foreign economic and trade commission, said today.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign trade grew rapidly during the last two
decades. During the first 11 months of 1997, the province
conducted nearly 17.8 billion U.S. dollars of foreign trade,
nearly 7.1 billion of which were imports.
</P>
<P>
The province will further encourage local state foreign-trade
companies to increase exports as well as more overseas-funded
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded businesses account for 66 percent of local
exports and are expected to lead the sector in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The province will make full use of the country's favorable
conditions, such as foreign exchange reserves and reduced tariffs,
to increase its imports. It will mainly increase the imports of
means of production and materials for daily use.

<HEADLINE> Economists Expect Recession in Hawaii's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Among Hawaiian economists,
some are worried over a possible recession in the local economy
due to cutbacks in Asian tourism and investment.
</P>
<P>
The 50th state of the United States, Hawaii is the one and only
in the country that has fewer jobs today than in 1991. Many local
residents are moving to the mainland in search of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Complaining of Hawaii's clouded business climate, some big
companies have pulled their operations out from the state
surrounded by the Pacific ocean, said media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Medium home prices have fallen from about 350,000 U.S. dollars
at the height to around 300,000 dollars today.
</P>
<P>
In an official annual speech last month, known as the "state of
the state" address, Governor Benjamin Cayetano acknowledged: "we
are in stormy waters."
</P>
<P>
But from the 1960s through 1980s, Hawaii's economy grew at a
rate of 4-6 percent annually, roughly twice the mainland's
pace. Foreign investment and spending fueled its economic engine.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, wealthy Japanese visitors drove around the
state capital of Honolulu's suburbs looking for houses and they
also paid outlandish sums for luxury hotels and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
As Governor Cayetano put it, "the red-hot Japanese economy
drove a hot economy here and people came to rely on it."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, when Japan's "bubble economy" became hard to carry on
and the Japanese canceled foreign bookings and liquidated foreign
properties to repay debts, Hawaii's plight began.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japanese investors have suffered great losses on
luxury projects, and the local construction industry has retreated
to employ about 22,000 workers -- a third fewer than in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The current downturn in Asia, particularly a slowdown in
tourism in the region, aggravated Hawaii's problems.
</P>
<P>
Tourism accounts for about a quarter of the state's economy,
and a third of its 6.8 million annual tourists are from Asia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect Korean arrivals to plummet as much as 80
percent this year. Business is similarly falling from Indonesia,
Thailand, the Philippines and other Asian countries. South Korea's
Asiana Airlines recently canceled all its flights to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Japanese arrivals fell only one percent last year, but Japanese
tourists are staying fewer days and spend less. That hurts the
state's recreational facilities, stores as well as hotels.
</P>
<P>
Local travel agents say they have not felt the full effect of
the Asian crisis on tourism, but in two or three months, the
hotels and shops are going to feel it. This, however, has created
a good bargain for mainland visitors, who may get discounts for
airfares, hotel rooms, rental cars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Many critics argue that economic reforms are critical to
Hawaii's economy. Last year, Governor Cayetano appointed a
commission of economists and business, labor and political leaders
to study Hawaii's economic revitalization.
</P>
<P>
In the same speech last month, he called for support to many
recommendations the commission offers, including tax reform,
deregulation and limited privatization.

As 1997 will be the first year to invigorate the state-owned
sector, Liaoning is expected to make a breakthrough in three
aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- The province plans to eliminate 360,000 obsolete cotton
spindles, which will mean the loss of 25,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
-- Some 170 large- and medium-size state-owned enterprises will
be transformed into multi-function, share-holding companies with
various ownerships this year. Two large enterprise groups will be
formed in the shipbuilding and petrochemical industries.
</P>
<P>
-- Practical measures will be taken to provide new jobs for
150,000 laid-off workers.

<HEADLINE> Armed Hutu Insurgency Loses Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) - The armed Hutu insurgency
behind the wave of violence that hit northwestern Rwanda in
recent months is on the wane, Rwandan army spokesman, Major
Emmanuel Ndahiro has said in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda News Agency Wednesday quoted Ndahiro as saying that the
intense political mobilization of local population coupled with
increased army operations against the Hutu extremists has started
to pay off.
</P>
<P>
"Those operations have pushed the enemy to resort to desperate
acts of terrorism against the local population in an attempt to
coerce them to support the insurgency," Ndahiro told Rwanda News
Agency which sent a special dispatch to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
Recent incidents are a clear testimony of the cruel methods
used by the armed criminals to terrorize local Hutu villagers who
have now started to turn against them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, an armed gang massacred six civilians in
Ngororero, Gisenyi Prefecture on grounds that they had tipped the
army about their activities, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The six civilians were unarmed Hutu residents. The criminals
beat them, cut off their noses, accusing them of being traitors,"
the spokesman underscored.
</P>
<P>
All these brutal massacres have roused strong anti-insurgency
feeling among the local population.
</P>
<P>
It is said that last Saturday, residents of Runinga village,
Kibilira commune in southern Gisenyi, netted three infiltrators
and disarmed them before beating them to death.
</P>
<P>
Despite this pressure on the insurgents, some isolated groups
of criminals continue the campaign of violence in parts of
Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu extremists, most of whom former Rwandan government
soldiers and the notorious "Interahamwe" militia, stepped up a
campaign of violence in northwestern Rwanda, said the report.
</P>
<P>
This campaign followed the 1996-1997 massive returns of over
one million refugees from former Zaire and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Develop Market Economy by Drawing Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Market in mind, the
Mongolian government is working to get more money, local or
foreign, to fuel the country's economic transition.
</P>
<P>
The efforts, said a Government News report Wednesday, were
highlighted by Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan at a
roundtable Tuesday on "government and business environment."
</P>
<P>
To encourage investment and business activities, Enkhsaikhan
was quoted as saying, his cabinet will continue to reform the
country's financial institutions and bring down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the government will propose lowering
business tax and privatizing state-owned businesses, and will
clear hurdles to direct foreign investment and private businesses.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to give domestic investors the same
preference as to foreigners, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Mongolia is switching from a planned economy to a
market-oriented one, the prime minister said, it is a priority on
the government's agenda to create a business-friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
One of the goals set by the government was to cut annual
inflation down to 20 percent in the near future and further below
10 percent by the year 2000, said Enkhsaikhan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Resettlement Program to Go Ahead: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
said nothing would stop it from acquiring all the land required
to fulfill its resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government announced to acquire about 1,500
farms or five million hectares of land to resettle landless
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Harare Tuesday night, Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said the government would
not allow any litigation to frustrate its program of resettling
thousands of land hungry people.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an application made by the National
Democratic Union (NDU) to the high court recently which sought an
order that the land acquisition act be declared unconstitutional
and therefore null and void.
</P>
<P>
NDU also appealed to the high court that the whole land
acquisition exercise be suspended pending the rationalization of
the compensation system in the act.
</P>
<P>
Kangai told reporters that the net effect of this order, if
granted, was to frustrate current efforts by the government to
acquire the land needed for the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it abundantly clear that this application will
not in any way divert us from our principled and unwavering
commitment to acquiring the total amount of land required for the
implementation of our national land reform program," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of reactionary interventions from any persons or
organization will derail the government from its land reform
program," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the acquisition of land for redistribution to the
historically disadvantaged people of Zimbabwe would continue.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement of the landless should start after crop harvests,
possibly by June or July, this year, he revealed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Spend $4m on houses this year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The National Housing
Authorities (NHA) is expected to spend 5.5 billion Kwacha (about
four million U.S. Dollars) this year on houses, Zambia Daily Mail
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local paper quoted NHA spokesman Juddah Mundunda as saying
NHA will spend one billion Kwacha on the maintenance of its
current stock of houses and 1.5 billion Kwacha to complete
partially finished houses and start new schemes from internally
generated and commissioned funds.
</P>
<P>
An additional external commission of three billion Kwacha is
expected from Shelter Afrique sourced by the Ministry of Local
Government and Housing of Zambia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three billion Kwacha will be used to construct 450 low
cost houses in the country.
</P>
<P>
NHA's policy now is to build more houses for sale than for
rent to encourage home ownership, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
For those who cannot afford to buy completed units, NHA will
sell them partially completed houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
NHA will sell serviced plots and house plans to the public as
a way of opening up more land for home construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Late in 1996 the government and the councils started to sell
their houses to their sitting tenants as part of government new
housing policy to encourage housing ownership.

<HEADLINE> Creditors Agree to Reschedule Kenya's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
concluded negotiations on the rescheduling of 70 million U.S.
Dollars external debt arrears with the London Club, the Daily
Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Kenyan Finance Ministry Tuesday said,
"the conclusion of these negotiations is a milestone as it marks
a positive turning point for Kenya in its relationship with the
international financial community."
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling will give Kenya a positive image in the eyes
of the donor community as this clears all outstanding arrears
Kenya had with its external creditors, it noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Kenyan government approached
its creditors of the Paris Club and London Club in 1993 in a bid
to reschedule its external debt arrears which had accumulated to
560 million Dollars at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club was
concluded in November 1994 and the deal with the London Club was
sealed on February 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the rescheduling include restructuring of the
principal amount over 10 years including a three-year grace
period.
</P>
<P>
A fixed rate of interest will be applied at 3.5 percent per
year for the first four-and-a-half years and LIBOR (London
Inter-Bank Offered Rate) plus 0.8 percent per year for the
remaining duration.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Exhibition of Traditional Paintings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China opens a grand exhibition
today in Beijing of its artistic tradition.
</P>
<P>
The Treasure Exhibition of Chinese Paintings collected by the
Palace Museum and China National Museum of Fine Arts features 140
water-ink paintings by the greatest masters since the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
Paintings by these masters are auctioned for tens of thousands
of U.S. dollars each on the international market.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for traditional Chinese paintings to be
exhibited on such a scale, and tight security measures have been
taken because of the works' combined value.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching works are from the Palace Museum, or the
Forbidden City of ancient emperors, the home to numerous precious
relics collected by various dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The show is a part of the exhibition series of 1998 China Year
of International Fine Arts, to show foreign art as well as
important Chinese paintings, Culture Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Major differences have existed between artistic traditions of
the West and the East, as one took root in ancient Greek
philosophy and the Renaissance while the other was a result of the
love for Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Both artistic traditions have developed unique ways of
discovering the secrets of the universe and earthly life,
accomplishing the greatest achievements according to their
national aesthetic criteria.
</P>
<P>
Culture Ministry sources say that although many precious
paintings have been smuggled abroad, Chinese museums remain the
most important repositories of oriental art.

<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's most important
painting depicting people's misery during the Japanese invasion in
the 1930s and '40s was given the title of "national treasure" in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The 26-meter-long, 2-meter-high "Refugees" was painted by Jiang
Zhaohe in 1943 and banned from exhibition by Japanese officers,
and was lost during the chaotic "Cultural Revolution" (1966-76).
</P>
<P>
The traditional Chinese water-ink painting was about 100
Chinese refugees trying to evade Japanese bombers.
</P>

Jiang (1904-1986) was a professor at the Central Academy of
Fine Arts, who successfully combined Western techniques and
concepts with Chinese tradition.
</P>
<P>
Culture Ministry officials say that it is the largest in size
and most important painting to reflect real life in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>

Museum of Fine Arts.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, Brazil Increase Energy Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Brazilian
minister of mines and energy, Raimundo Mendes de Brito, said
Tuesday that Brazilian imports of crude oil and other products
from Venezuela have reached almost 900 million U.S. dollars in
value.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel
Burelli Rivas, Mendes said his visit to Venezuela shows the
importance of cooperation in energy by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the second largest supplier of petroleum to Brazil
and these imports are expected to rise in years to come, Mendes
said.
</P>
<P>
In a world with an increasing trend toward economic
globalization, the Brazilian-Venezuelan cooperation was
complementary. Mendes said he hoped to seek bilateral cooperation
through his visit.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera met with the
Brazilian minister.

<HEADLINE> Chuan Gets Tough on Illegal Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai planned to set up a committee to investigate illegal
logging in the Salween National Park, northern Thailand, the
Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Having inspected the park and seen traces of illegal logging,
the prime minister said actions had to be taken even though the
state lacked the personnel and equipment to police the forests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six forestry officials have been transferred from
the park to inactive posts in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Salween ParK, near the Myanmar border, is one of many
encroachment spots nationwide, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand allowed to import Myanmar logs in 1996 to reduce the
market for illegal timber, but the initiative failed as Thai
timber was given Myanmar documentation and reimported.
</P>
<P>
The illegal logging in Salween Park came under spotlight after
Deputy Forestry Director General Prawat Thanadkha tried but failed
to donate 5 million baht (109,000 U.S. dollars) in cash to the
Thais-help-Thais Fund last week.
</P>
<P>
Chuan rejected the money after being warned that it might have
come from loggers illegally felling trees in Salween.
</P>
<P>
Prawat is now under investigation by both a committee of the
Agriculture Ministry and a police team.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Adjusts Border Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has adjusted its border
trade policy, using U.S. dollar for quoting prices and settling
accounts, according to the reports by official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar began border trade activities with neighboring
countries in late 1980s. The country stressed the need to adopt a
policy of turning the border trade into normal trade a few years
ago, however, the policy did not go into effect.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Deputy Commerce Minister Myo Tint as saying
that the authorities has issued directives to apply regular trade
procedures based on U.S. dollar in place of neighboring currency
in the border trade beginning last November 26.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that in importing goods from the other

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February, 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gross domestic
product rose 3.03 percent in 1997, reaching 862.4 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics, the increase represents 5,400 dollars in
per capita terms.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth is due mainly to a rise of 5.8 percent in
industry, 8.59 percent in civil architecture and 7.52 percent in
mining.
</P>
<P>
However, a director of the institute said these figures were
preliminary and the final ones would be published in May or June.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which was still lower than a former estimate of
3.5 percent, has been attained following a series of measures
taken to resist the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brazil achieved an economic growth of 2.9 percent in 1996 and
this year it planned to secure another increase of two percent
based on that of 1997.

<HEADLINE> European Nations Urged to help Southeast Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has urged the
international community, especially European countries to help
Southeast Asian countries to cope with their current monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
It seemed the international community had up until now not shown
any serious intention to help Southeast Asian countries in
overcoming their difficulties, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here Tuesday after a meeting of the Indonesia-Thai
Joint Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming ASEAN-European Meeting (ASEM) to be held in London
in April would be an appropriate forum to draw the attention of
European countries to the monetary crisis the Southeast Asian
economies are going through and to move them to extend a helping
hand, the minister was quoted Wednesday by Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
senior officials would hammer out a list of the aspects of the
crisis, which is to be the main topics for discussion at the ASEM
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He held that the economic crisis befalling the Southeast Asian
countries was one of the adverse impacts of a globalization
process which is multi-dimensional in its characteristics and
should be discussed in an international forum such as ASEM.
</P>
<P>
In international trade, an interrelated dimension between one
region and another cannot be separated since whatever happens in a
certain region will certainly bring a significant impact on
another region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian countries have been hit by the monetary crisis
since July last year. The value of their currencies against the
U.S. dollar has lost from 20 percent to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

NAGANO, Japan, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The men's giant slalom,

The overnight snowfall, which had reached a depth of two meters at
the race's starting point, forced the postponement. He added that a

make the course suitable by the original start time.
</P>

The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the U.N. Security

biological weapons and on allowing the U.N. Special Commission to

Iraq must immediately implement the U.N. resolutions on giving
U.N. inspectors full access to all suspected weapons sites in
Iraq, it said.

The crisis should be resolved through all political and
diplomatic measures, especially the efforts made by

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects Big Jump in Rice Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Rice Exporters
Association predicted that the export value of the country's rice
industry will reach 100 billion baht (2.2 billion U.S. dollars)
this year if the baht remains close to 45 to the dollar, the
Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast came after rice exports during December and
January skyrocketed in value by 124 percent to 19.24 billion baht
(4.3 million dollars), while in volume by 66 percent to 1.43
million tons, compared to the same period in the previous year,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Vorapong Pichpongsa, president of the association, attributed
the sharp rise to the depreciation of the baht and the drought
connected to the El Nino effect.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the United States Agriculture
Department, the world's trade of rice will rise to 21.7 million
tons, up by 16 percent or three million tons, from last year.
</P>
<P>
Demand for rice imports to make up for local shortages has
increased in Indonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh due to the
reduction of output caused by the El Nino effect there.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Indonesia will import two to three million
tons of rice and the Philippines 700,000 to 800,000 tons this year
to ease shortage, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This is a good opportunity for Thailand to earn more foreign
currency by exporting to those countries.
</P>
<P>
However, it also faces competitions from China, Vietnam and
Pakistan in the business, the newspaper added.

BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Cambodia are
looking forward to strengthening anti-narcotics cooperation by
establishing a bilateral committee at the policy-making level and
sub-committees at the technical level, Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sum Manit, secretary-general of Cambodia's national authority

</P>
<P>
Manit said that Cambodia's situation has stabilized while the
two co-prime ministers, namely First Prime Minister Ung Huot and
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, attached great importance to the
drug fighting.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's drug problem became serious in 1994 when the country
opened to a free market system following the general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to Manit, marijuana is the country's main source of
drug abuse.
</P>

Cambodia was also used as a transit route for narcotic drugs to

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Panama will speed up talks
this year to establish free trade agreements with Chile and
Mexico, a Panamanian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Minister Miguel Heras said that the signing of the
free trade agreement with Chile has to be done at the latest in
April and before the end of this year with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Heras said the main motivation for Panama to enhance commercial
relations with Chile, a member of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation Forum (APEC), was its increasing commercial ties with
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Products from China and Japan pass through the Panama Canal and
are exported through the Colon Free Zone, the largest tariff free
zone in western hemisphere which registered a commercial activity
of 11.7 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Heras said that the signing of the free trade agreement has to
be done before the summit of American heads of state which will be
held in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with Mexico, a member of the North-American Free
Trade Agreement, are well underway and four meetings have been
held between the two sides, Heras said.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian Minister was optimistic about the progress in
negotiations and anticipated a treaty with Mexico will be signed
before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement Rids Poverty of Mountain People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Wei Yingshi feels it is of a
world difference between his present life in a rich river valley
with the previous one in a desolate mountain area five years ago.
</P>
<P>
A resettlement scheme helped him build his new home in a mango
orchid only a few kilometers away from the Pingma Township of
Tiandong County. He grows 1,000 mango trees, which began bearing
fruits last year. Plus output of soybean and vegetables he reapt,
he has bought for his family bicycles and a television set--the
items he dared not dream of in the past.
</P>
<P>
Wei is among the 140,000 people living in rocky mountain areas
in the western part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region who
have been relieved of poverty with the help of the resettlement
plan introduced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Like many of the 10 million people living in these areas, Wei
used to have scarce arable land and no irrigation water. With a
per capita annual income of 170 yuan (20.48 US dollars), the 350
families of his village had not enough to eat for half of the
year, having to rely on government relief.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the 1970s, the people began looking for new
places to settle down in order to change their fate.
</P>
<P>
However, they met with difficulties in finding such a place
when land began to be contracted to individuals with the
introduction of rural reforms.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, government stepped in to render
help. Over the past years, local governments at various levels
have spent an average of 3,500 yuan to 4,500 yuan for resettling
one person. Plus World Bank loans and assistance from Hongkong,
the autonomous region has injected an estimated 600 million yuan
in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Under a revised plan, Guangxi will help resettle about 250,000
people by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Those who are still living in the rocky mountains are also
enabled a better life, because they can have more arable
land.

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises
in north China's Hebei Province yielded 7 billion yuan in
developing new products in 1997, 17 percent more than the previous
year's figure.

make up at least two percent of the annual sales income of the
enterprises while the annual input in high-tech development will
account for three percent of the sales income.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Endorses Policy on Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- No work permission will be
extended to illegal foreign workers and those who are not allowed
to work will be repatriated, the Thai cabinet meeting announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting, the government endorsed the policy on
illegal foreign workers, under which no illegal alien workers will
be given permission for new registration and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
Illegal foreign workers who can not be employed at the moment
will be put in order. They will no longer be able to work in
factories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet agreed to study further solution for
some sectors which have a shortage of workers and can not find
Thai labors, such as fisheries and construction.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting also vowed to strictly control the entry
of new illegal foreign labors, saying the seizure of illegal
employers and the conspirators -- their employers, government
officers and related person -- will be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
Alien workers who are not allowed to work will be repatriated,
the cabinet meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Facing pressure of higher unemployment, Thailand has begun
repatriating illegal foreign workers, which totaled 900,000.
</P>
<P>
So far, Thailand has 31,000 unemployed people as the labor
department registered.
</P>
<P>
But government officials said Thais who could not find a job
are at 1.2 million, or three to five percent of workforce. The
number is expected to mount to 2 million this year.

BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Three state agencies have

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Government to Trim Expenditures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government
announced Tuesday that it will reduce its public expenditures due
to a fall in revenues earned from petroleum exports.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum revenues will drop 1.8 billion U.S. dollars and
the public expenditures more than 2.5 billion dollars,
respectively, this year, Minister of Treasury Freddy Rojas Parra
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government does not adopt the measure, the
country will face an inflation rate of 25-45 percent which will
seriously affect the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
With the modifications to the public expenditures, the minister
said the budget for 1998 will be cut down 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the budget is aimed at preserving credibility
of the programs undertaken at a national and international level,
increasing confidence in the country's economy, maintaining the
production of the petroleum and non-petroleum sectors and fighting
inflation, Parra said.

<HEADLINE> Reliability of China's Large Power Generators Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The reliability of large-size
power-generating units used in China with capacities of more than
100 megawatts which are produced domestically has risen to more
than 86 percent, up 4.4 percentage points from 1992.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yanchang, vice-minister of the Electric Power Industry, said
in Beijing today that the enhanced reliability represents a marked
improvement in both safe operation and economic efficiency of the
country's large-size generators.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said that China has introduced a
reliability administration system aimed at solving common quality
problems, which has proved to be very effective.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, construction workers and power equipment
manufacturers work together on the installation and trial
operations of new generators. Both sides cooperate to solve any
defects during the trial period, especially those that might lead
to accidents.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister cited the latest statistics showing that by
the end of 1997 the country's total installed generating capacity
had reached 250,000 megawatts, of which almost 59 percent was
produced by large-size generating units with capacities above 100
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Lu added that the favorable change in the structure of
generating units signals rapid improvement in China's power
sector.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Have Little Impact From Dong Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's 5.29 percent
devaluation of the dong will have little adverse effect on
Thailand's export competitiveness, according to the Thai Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the baht's fall from about 26 baht per dollar to
45-47, the devaluation of the dong would have little impact,
Deputy Commerce Minister Photipong Lamsam was quoted Wednesday by
the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's agricultural exports, particularly rice, might feel
some impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is a major competitor of Thailand in export of rice,
seafood, furniture, garments and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Photipong said the dong's devaluation would reduce the buying
power of the Vietnamese and might result in fewer purchases of
Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's main exports to Vietnam are motorcycles and bicycles
and their parts, plastic products and resin, chemicals, fabric,
sugar and pharmaceuticals.

SOFIA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Two people have drowned and

<P>
The floods also triggered 46 landslides and destroyed 76 roads

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urges Peaceful Iraqi Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine Tuesday reiterated its
stand for solving the weapons inspection crisis in Iraq through
peaceful means instead of a military action.
</P>
<P>
To use force could only be regarded as an extreme step which
nobody wants to see, Viktor Nagaichuk, director of the Press
Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq must unconditionally comply with the relevant
United Nations Security Council resolutions to alleviate the
present situation.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine appealed to the U.N. and Iraq in a written statement on
February 5 to take a cautious attitude towards the crisis, and
solve all disputes through peaceful negotiations in accordance
with international laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
Nagaichuk stressed that Ukraine's stand on this matter was not
decided by "its relations with some countries, but by its national
interests."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is very concerned over the peace and stability in the
Middle East as the region is geographically close to the country,
Nagaichuk said.

<HEADLINE> German Investors Satisfied with China Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- German investors are satisfied
with their performances in China and predict they can fish higher
profits in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey reveals that 80 percent of the German investors
surveyed are content with the progress they have made in China,
while 94 percent said they would choose China again if they have
another investment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Respondents of the survey, which is conducted by a well-known
German consultancy firm with the help of German embassy in China,
included 134 German companies and 65 representative offices. The
investment they have been involved in China totals 1.33 billion US
dollars, accounting for over half of Germany's total investment in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey, completed in January, indicates 47 percent of the
German companies began making profits by the end of 1997 and the
proportion is expected to rise to over 58 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the respondents held that the primary
investment risks in China last year include intensified
competition and lack of high-caliber managerial personnels, while
only four percent thought the political stability could pose risks.
</P>
<P>
The most important factors leading to their success in China
include highly efficient sales networks, competitive edge and
loyalty of the staff, they concluded.
</P>
<P>
While 62 percent of the investors said they are drawn to China
by China's huge market potential, 65 percent mentioned the
strategic importance of the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that about 70 percent of the Germany
presence is in the developed and coastal regions including
Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Tianjin and Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Whitaker's Positive Drug Test Overturned by WBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Boxing
Association (WBA) on Tuesday overturned a positive drugs test
returned by former world welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Whitaker, who lost his World Boxing Council
(WBC) title to Oscar de la Hoya on points last year, was suspended

losing incomes and at least a two year suspension, had not tested
positive for the past two months.

<HEADLINE> New Development Trend of Commerce Sector Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese commerce experts have
identified major trends for the future development of China's
commerce sector.
</P>
<P>
One trend is the conglomeration of large department stores. The
experts attending a seminar on the reform of the commerce sector
believe that this strategic readjustment will enable the
department stores to remain as the main force of the commerce
sector.
</P>
<P>
The continued rapid growth of chain stores is another
phenomenon. Their competitive edge lies in the large scale and low
price, according to China Township Enterprises Daily.
</P>
<P>
The experts predict that the wholesale business will become a
very promising sector and the non-state retail business will
continue to expand.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that the commerce sector will flourish in
the cities in the central and western parts of the country,
following high growth in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The rural market will become a focus for competition, and sales
networks run by farmers will play a larger role, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Foreign Funds Coming into Hainan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost island
province, Hainan, had over 700 million US dollars worth of foreign
investment last year, a decrease of 10.6 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Contrasting with this decrease in actual foreign investment,
contracted foreign investment rose 3 percent to 281 million US
dollars, according to the provincial statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is China's biggest special economic zone and used to be
very popular with foreign investors. But, since 1995 and the
country's tight monetary policy and a cooling of the real estate
sector, foreign funds have been drying up.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Hainan approved 220 foreign-backed companies, 8
percent fewer than for the previous year. Of these, 151 are
solely-funded by overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The statistics bureau said in a report that 1997 saw an
increase in foreign investment in the province's agriculture,
commercial, food, and tourism sectors but a drop in the real
estate sector.
</P>
<P>
The province approved 18 real estate projects with overseas
investors involved, but in 1996, there had been 72 such projects.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong continued to be the leading overseas investor, but
the amount of investment is diminishing, and there's been a rise
in investment from Taiwan, the US, and Canada.

<HEADLINE> China Uses More Foreign Funds in Hydropower Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China has used a total of
3.692 billion US dollars of foreign funds in 23 hydropower
projects whose total generating capacity reached 18.84 million
kilowatts since 1980, the Beijing-based International Trade News
has reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Vice-Minister of Power Industry Zhao
Xizheng as saying that China has 376 million kilowatts in potential
hydropower resources, the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign-funded hydropower projects, 13 have been put
into production with a total capacity of 5.62 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao said the generating capacity of all existing
hydropower stations accounts for only 13.8 percent of the total
generating capacity of water resources, which is below the world's
average level.
</P>
<P>
According to the long-term development plan of China's
hydropower industry, the total generating capacity of China's
hydropower stations is expected to reach 70 million kilowatts by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
This development will provide great opportunities for foreign
firms in their cooperation with China in the hydropower industry,
Zhao was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> North China's CPPCC Actively Participates in Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The provincial committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
of north China's Hebei Province has been active in participating
in government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the past five years the provincial
committee has received 3,366 proposals and placed on file 3,242 of
them.
</P>
<P>
"Except for the five extremely complicated which are difficult
to solve within a short period of time, the rest have been
successfully dealt with, which has given a strong push to the
province's economic and social development," said an official with
the provincial committee.
</P>
<P>
The members of the provincial committee of the CPPCC focuses
particular attention on economic development, and have submitted
293 motions concerning reforms of state-run enterprises and the
country's opening-up drive.
</P>

motion on extricating state-run enterprises from their
difficulties, which received wide attention in the provincial

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects British Accusation over Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday rejected a
Britain's accusation in a document that Baghdad has always
obstructed the work of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
What has been stated in the British document is "untrue" and
full of "misleading materials," Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
The document is part of the effort of the British government to
mislead the public opinion in Europe and pave the way for a
possible attack on Iraq by itself and the United States, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. have vowed to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant free access to weapons inspectors with UNSCOM
charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction should diplomatic efforts fail to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The release said that despite the British accusation, UNSCOM
has still been able to destroy a large number of Iraq's
missile heads and chemical and biological weapon warheads.
</P>
<P>
It also dismissed as "totally baseless" a British allegation
that Iraq had threatened the life of UNSCOM arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
A report submitted by UNSCOM to the U.N. Security Council in
August, 1994 said that Iraq provided full cooperation in arms
inspections, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the security of UNSCOM inspectors is fully guaranteed
by the Iraqi side, and none of them has ever been threatened, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq concluded that the hostile propaganda of Britain is aimed
at sabotage the work of UNSCOM and offering a pretext for possible
military attacks on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Mutual Fund Sales Decline in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian mutual fund sales for
January are estimated at 3.1 billion dollars (2.1 billion U.S.
dollars), well behind the 5 billion sales a year ago, reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The January ice storm in eastern Canada is one of the reasons
behind the decline. Some fund managers said they had no business
from the Quebec area for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Another reason relates to competing products such as
index-linked guaranteed investment certificates. Some investors
could be looking at them as alternatives to mutual funds as a
result of modest upward rates, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Continued volatility in the stock markets is also a major
factor that made people think twice before deciding to increase
investments in the funds.
</P>
<P>
But Canadians are seeking investments to shelter within their
registered retirement savings plans, and mutual funds sales will
increased drastically in February.
</P>
<P>
Last February, mutual fund sales across Canada reached 10
billion dollars.

NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rallied for the
fifth consecutive session Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial
average up 28.40 to close at 8,398.50 and most of other market
indicators also gaining.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking pulled the Dow back from an early surge of 76
points which made the benchmark indicator to well surpass the
8,400 line.
</P>
<P>
The Dow reached 8,200 and 8,300 in the past two weeks with a
total gain of 217.98 points since the string of the rallies
started a week ago.
</P>
<P>
There was no business on Wall Street Monday because of the
President's Day in the United States. The last record close was
8,370.10 Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary calculations, advancing issues beat
decliners 9-8 with 1,574 up, 1,401 down and 502 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
</P>
<P>
Trading volume rose to 588.06 million shares from 531.03
million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list was up 2.67 to 1,022.76

<HEADLINE> Former Secret Service Officer Testifies in White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An ex-Secret Service
officer testified Tuesday before a grand jury here on what he
knows about U.S. President Bill Clinton's relations with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Retired uniformed officer Lewis Fox did not stop to take
questions from reporters as he left the courthouse, but his
attorney Mike Leibig told reporters, "We're not going to make any
statements or give any interviews now."
</P>
<P>
Service officials have opposed testimony by former or current
employees, citing the historical bond of trust between Secret
Service agents and the first family.
</P>
<P>
Also testifying Tuesday was Stephen Goodin, a former personal
aide to the president.
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is using the federal grand
jury to investigate whether the president had an affair with
Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it under oath in an
affidavit filed in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Fox reportedly told The Washington Post earlier this month that
he admitted Lewinsky, then a 21-year-old White House intern, to
the Oval Office in 1995, where she spent 40 minutes alone with the
president.
</P>
<P>
But former Secret Service agents and White House officials said
the presidential staff -- not uniformed officers -- admit visitors
to the Oval Office. Former agents also cited the lack of privacy
because of the large windows in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
Fox's lawyer said last week the retired officer could not swear
that Clinton and Lewinsky were alone together.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly denied that he had an affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House press secretary Mike McCurry expressed
regret Tuesday over an interview with the Chicago Tribune in which
he said he does not expect there will be "a simple, innocent
explanation" to allegations Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said he "speculated about matters that I don't know
anything about," and called the remarks a "lapse in my sanity."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, McCurry also said many in the White House do
not believe Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky or anyone else
because of the lack of privacy.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, a Virginia newspaper, The Richmond
Times-Dispatch, reported a former friend of Kathleen Willey has
admitted to lying in an interview about Willey's alleged romantic
encounter with Clinton in the White House.
</P>
<P>
The report said that John S. West, a Richmond lawyer for Julie
Hiatt Steele, said White House volunteer Willey asked Steele to
lie to a Newsweek reporter last spring about the alleged affair.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with Chinese Premier Li Peng at the Kremlin here Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two leaders pointed out with satisfaction
that major achievements have been made in various aspects in
substantiating and consolidating the strategic partnership between
China and Russia established in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that frequent meetings between leaders of
the two countries have greatly accelerated the development of
bilateral ties and that major progress has also been made in
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to adopt specific measures to further
tap the great potential of economic cooperation between the two
countries and raise such cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached consensus that the Sino-Russian ties are
a new type of state relations, which are based on mutual respect,
equality and mutual trust, non-alignment and non-confrontation and
not directing against a third party, and that such relations
embrace broad prospects for development as they conform to the
fundamental interests of the people of the two countries and
accord with the main tide of world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Li Peng briefed Yeltsin of the domestic
situation in China, saying that China now enjoys political
stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin briefed Li Peng of the domestic situation in Russia and
his visit to Italy not long ago.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said that the world situation and international
relations are now undergoing profound changes and readjustment.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the common stand adopted by China and Russia on
promoting the multipolarization of the world has been accepted by
more and more countries in the world and their proposal for the
establishment of a new political and economic international order
based on peace, stability, justness and rationality has received
broad support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
They also said that cooperation between their two countries in
international affairs has been effective. They agreed that their
two countries should continue as they did in the past to maintain
contacts and consultations on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two leaders also discussed in detail the
Iraq crisis and both expressed their profound concern with it.
</P>
<P>
They said that China and Russia, as permanent members of the
Security Council of the United Nations, both favor a peaceful
solution of the crisis through diplomatic means and oppose the
use of force as a way to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that Iraq should implement relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions comprehensively and that the state
sovereignty of Iraq should be respected.
</P>
<P>
They urged various parties concerned to exercise restraint to
solve the crisis and facilitate an appropriate settlement of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also shared the view that the visit to Iraq by
the U.N. secretary-general constitutes part of the diplomatic
efforts aimed at a political settlement of the crisis and
therefore should be supported by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier arrived in Moscow Tuesday afternoon to pay
an official and good-will visit to Russia and also to attend the
third regular meeting of the premiers of the two countries.

LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- British Airways is halting
flights to South Korea and Sri Lanka because of financial turmoil
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The thrice weekly service to Seoul will be suspended from March
until the market improves along with the service to Colombo, the
Sri Lankan capital.
</P>
<P>
Plans to increase flights to Tokyo from five to six a week have
been put on hold due to a fall-off in Japanese tourists and a
weaker yen.
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks were announced here Tuesday as BA gave details of
a summer program involving an 8 percent increase in capacity,
equivalent to an extra million seats.
</P>
<P>
BA tried to play down the Far East reduction, saying it
represented only 3 percent of the total Asia Pacific operation.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts fear that an industrywide movement of planes
from depressed Far East routes to the more attractive Northern
Atlantic market could trigger a price war.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Honored at Russian Banquet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Tuesday hosted a grand banquet to honor Chinese
Premier Li Peng, who arrived earlier Tuesday for a two-day
official good-will visit.
</P>
<P>
Proposing a toast, Chernomyrdin said Li's visit marks a good
beginning for top-level contacts between the two nations. "I
believe the current visit will help create a new atmosphere in
Russia-China relations and push forward the strategic coordination
partnership oriented towards the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, he said, he and Li officially inaugurated the
regular meeting mechanism between the two premiers, which has been
accelerated and achieved substantial results following the second
meeting in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister noted that the current third meeting
will serve to push forward the Russia-China economic and trade
cooperation at a "full speed."
</P>
<P>
He suggested the year 1998 be an "economic year" for the
Russia-China relations and the main task is to make every effort
to consolidate bilateral economic cooperation and make it
integrate with high-level political mutual understanding and
mutual coordination.
</P>
<P>
Russia will put into practice the major long-term projects,
including those on the fuel and energy industry, build the
infrastructure including investment, banking, information,
arbitration and transport, and attract more regions and cities in
both countries to take part, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the healthy progress of the Russia-China
economic cooperation has a good foundation and initiative progress
has been seen in the structural reform in the overall economic
links between the two neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
The modernized road of cooperation has been under way and the
ratio of barter trade is decreasing with the improvement in trade
balance, the prime minister said. "We should make even greater
efforts to this end," he added.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the role of regular meeting mechanism can in
no way be replaced, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Li said he met with President Boris Yeltsin and
had luncheon with him shortly after his arrival in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on many issues and reached an extensive
consensus, Li said, adding he also had a smooth talk with
Chernomyrdin and important results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved, he said, that the regular meeting mechanism
is an effective one, which conduces to enhancing bilateral ties in
a healthy, stable and coordinated way.
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen the Russian society stablized, economy
recovered, and the international status and impact continuing to
grow, the premier said, adding that the Chinese people feel glad
about that.
</P>
<P>
As for the China-Russia ties, 1997 was an important year and
through joint efforts, bilateral strategic coordination
partnership has been further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the signing of the joint statement for the world
multi-polization and establishment of a new international order,
and the agreement on arms reduction on the border between China
and its four neighboring nations, has exerted a far-reaching
impact on promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the demarcation is of great importance to the
security and stability on the eastern sector of the border between
the two countries, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation in various fields between the two countries
is being deepened and the inauguration of the nuclear power
project in Lianyungang city in eastern China's Jiangsu Province
has opened a new way of cooperation among medium-sized and large
long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
The series of document signed during the ongoing visit, Li
said, has offered a guarantee for the overall advancement between
the two nations, and the people-to-people contacts are increasing,
while consultations and cooperation on international affairs have
been tightened.
</P>
<P>
This autumn, President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin will hold a summit. This meeting will be of great
importance and serve to achieve new yet greater progress in
bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Bank Shuts UK Branches After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England has
instructed one of Pakistan's leading banks to restructure its
UK-based operations after learning that it had suffered financial
losses.
</P>
<P>
The intervention by the bank has, to date, led to the closure
of half of the United Bank's 12 branches and a reshuffling of its
senior management.
</P>
<P>
It was reported Tuesday that Michael Ainley, a senior manager
at the Bank of England, wrote to the United Bank's general manager
last March after the discovery of an alleged fraud in the bank's
Oldham branch.
</P>
<P>
Ainley requested that a new business plan for the bank was
drawn up and asked for the appointment of "suitably qualified
bankers with UK experience" to positions within the bank's
financial controllers office.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bank of England said, "The secrecy
provisions of the Banking Act prevent us from making any comment."
</P>
<P>
The United Bank was founded in 1959 by Agha Hasan Adedi. He

<HEADLINE> US Envoy: Use of Force Last Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- United States envoy to the
Middle East David Newton said here on Tuesday that Washington
considers the use of force as the "last option" to resolve the
crisis over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Military attack on Iraq is the "last option to pressurize Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein into complying with U.N. resolutions,"
Newton told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened military attacks to force Iraq to grant
full and unfettered access to presidential sites by the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But he voiced U.S. keenness on resorting to peaceful means to
solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. is ready to give enough time to
diplomatic efforts, taking the sufferings sustained by the Iraqi
people into account.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the idea of dismembering Iraq, saying that the
U.S. respects Iraq's sovereignty and does not seek partitioning
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, who is on a regional tour of Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon, Syria and Gulf Arab countries, said his trip is aimed at
explaining to Arab countries the dimensions of the Iraq crisis and
U.S. stance in this respect.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Busy Seeking Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has been engaged in busy diplomatic consultations to
seek a way of solving the current crisis relating to arms
inspections in Iraq, UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting with the ambassadors of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, he has been discussing the
matter with Iraqi officials and many world leaders, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"He continues to insist that there be a workable solution,
support of the (Security) Council for it and an indication that
Iraq is prepared to discuss it," said Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General "took note of the statement made in
Baghdad today by an official spokesman expressing Iraq's intention
to make any mission by him (Annan) to Baghdad a success," Eckhard
added.
</P>
<P>
Among the five permanent council members, China, France and
Russia are actively supporting an idea for Annan to take a
mediation trip to Baghdad. Britain is also praising Annan's peace
efforts, but the United States seems to want to put some strings
to the visit, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Waiting for the permanent five to arrive at a conclusion, Annan
has met with their representatives for three times since last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet them for the last time later Tuesday
before informing the 15-member Council on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of the permanent five met this morning for a new
round of consultations and a further meeting was arranged this
afternoon before their consultations with Annan.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said in the past few days, the Secretary-General has
had phone conversations with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,,
King Hussein of Jordan, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel
Meguid and Foreign Ministers of Italy and South Africa, in
addition to his contacts with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
Press reports from around the world show that many favor a trip
by the U.N. chief in the hope that a peaceful solution to the
crisis could be found.
