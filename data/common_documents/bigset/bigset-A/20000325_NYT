YANKS AND CLEMENS APPEAR TO GET A JUMP ON THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Roger Clemens has said that he wants to finish his
career with the New York Yankees, and two baseball officials
contend that there is an understanding that the team will give him
a two-year extension after his current contract expires in the
fall. That would mean Clemens would be tied to the Yankees through
the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 37, will be paid $8.1 million this season; he is in the
last year of a contract he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays before
the 1997 season. One official indicated that Clemens would receive
an extension in the range of $13 million to $14 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Yankees have informed the Detroit Tigers of their
interest in outfielder Bobby Higginson, and Gene Michael, the
club's top scout, has watched Higginson the last two days. But the
New York Mets appear to be the front-runners to get Higginson,
offering a package that could include outfielder Rickey Henderson
and the left-hander Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' two-year understanding has not been completed, and
specific terms within the deal are undetermined. The agreement may
have taken place as much as a year ago, when Clemens joined the
Yankees in a trade from Toronto. At that time, Clemens' leverage
was at its highest: he had won consecutive Cy Young Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trade, his agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks, had
asked the Houston Astros in contentious negotiations for an
extension worth about $27 million, a figure that is close to the
value of the understanding reached with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens went 14-10 with a 4.60 earned run average for the
Yankees during the regular season while battling injuries, but he
pitched well in two of his three postseason starts, including a
victory in the final World Series game against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have long had a similar two-year, $18 million
understanding with second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. Under his
existing contract, the Yankees will pay Knoblauch $6 million a
season for 2000 and 2001. At some point the two-year understanding
will become a two-year extension, tying Knoblauch to the team for
the 2002 and 2003 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have never made the Knoblauch extension official,
for reasons that may be related to the luxury tax and issues
personal to Knoblauch. It may be that the Yankees will not announce
Clemens' extension until after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees, who never got that close to pulling off
a trade for outfielder Jim Edmonds before he was traded from
Anaheim to St. Louis on Thursday, are monitoring Higginson, just in
case they feel the need to acquire another hitter. Higginson, 29,
has a .366 career average in Yankee Stadium, but he is coming off a
season in which his average plummeted to .239, and he has continued
to struggle this spring, batting around .200 with only two
extra-base hits in 43 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson is scheduled to earn $4.3 million this year and $5.2
million next year, a heavy price to pay for a questionable talent
at a time when the Yankees are already facing massive salary
increases for players like Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets might not be so daunted by the idea of acquiring
Higginson's contract, because they have been desperate to unload
Henderson all winter, shopping him to teams in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson would give the Mets better left-handed balance in
their lineup. Currently, they have six right-handed hitters and
only two left-handed hitters among their regular position players,
with Henderson scheduled to be the left fielder. &QL;

BUSH'S EDUCATION IDEAS CONTESTED AT ARKANSAS HIGH SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `rioters' to `screaming demonstrators' in 2nd graf,
and `minority children' to `minorities.')  
(With BUSH-EXCERPTS) 
(mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Visiting a high school here that was a
historic battleground in the fight to integrate public schools in
the South, Gov. George W. Bush faced open skepticism Friday from
several educators and a student leader who questioned his proposals
to improve education for minority and disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush traveled to Central High School, where federal troops were
deployed in September 1957 to escort nine black students past
screaming demonstrators, to say that while minorities were no
longer denied access to institutions of learning, they were too
often denied the same quality of education that more privileged
peers received. The Texas governor said that he wanted to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   But a few of the 10 participants in a panel discussion that he
staged in the school's library wondered aloud about the efficacy of
his prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The school's principal, Rudolph Howard, said that Bush's
advocacy of greater local flexibility in the use of federal
education funds would not necessarily do enough to help financially
strapped public schools meet the demands of paying teachers higher
salaries and repairing crumbling buildings. Vice President Al Gore
has proposed additional federal money for both of those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Howard began to make that case to Bush in the panel discussion,
then toughened and expanded his criticism in a conversation with
reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want something very tangible in place that would be
encouraging for those of us who have to carry the ball,'' Howard
said, adding that Bush's push for more local control and his plea
for high standards were ``pie-in-the-sky, hopeful kinds of things
that we have existed on for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to hear him say he's going to commit to something,''
the principal added. ``All these catch phrases are horses that are
not going to trot anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Williams, the student council president, said that
Bush's support of programs to allow students to use public money
for private education would divert resources and energy from public
schools and make it harder to provide the children who remained
there with an adequate education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really agree with the concept of it,'' Williams, who
is 18, told the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges illustrated the difficulty that Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, may encounter in
convincing some Americans that his vision for public schools is the
right one and that it is tailored with the neediest students in
mind. Those claims are cornerstones of Bush's presentation of
himself as a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, polls have shown that on the issue of education
Americans trust Democrats more than Republicans. But Bush is trying
to turn that around, and some polls released over the last two
weeks suggest that he and Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee,
are on relatively equal footing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance at Central High School, where 57 percent of
the roughly 2,000 students are black, demonstrated his confidence
in his ability to sell his ideas and his willingness to hash them
around even with likely critics.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was clearly after powerful political theater, not
polite public dissent, in staging the event at a place that he
called ``a symbol that prejudice may run deep, but goodness runs
deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   His scripted remarks at the start of the panel discussion took
in the sweep of the civil rights movement and included the comment
that the continuing gap in the achievement of white children and
black children perpetuated a divided society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the cause,'' Bush said, ``the effect is
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our common ground,'' he added, ``is found in our common
schools. And we must make those schools worthy of all our children.
This, I believe, is the next advance in the cause of equality, the
next frontier of civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's education proposals call for some enhanced
federal financing, they turn more strongly on giving states and
local school districts additional discretion and authority in how
they use existing federal money. Bush also envisions financial
incentives and punishments to motivate schools whose students test
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained failure would mean forfeiting some federal assistance,
which would be rechanneled so that parents could use that money to
help pay for private educational options or so that more charter
schools could be established.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists at Central High School largely concurred with
Bush's call for higher educational standards, his vision of an
accountability system and his advocacy of local control.
</P>
<P>
   But several seemed to want a much greater financial commitment
from the federal government, which Bush seemed wary of making.
</P>
<P>
   He told a middle school principal who had raised the issue of
teachers' salaries: ``I just caution you not to expect the federal
government to be paying teachers more money.'' Bush said that was a
local prerogative, which he strongly recommended.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Another top seed has been planted. This time, it
was the No. 1 team in the nation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Florida Gators used a deeper bench and an aggressive press
to upset top-ranked Duke 87-78 in an East Regional semifinal Friday
night at the Carrier Dome, making the Blue Devils the third No. 1
seed to exit the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (27-7) scored the final 13 points of the game after
trailing 78-74 with 4:01 to go. The Gators' bench outscored the
Duke reserves 35-4. Florida forced 22 turnovers by the Blue Devils,
who made only three of 19 shots from the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Brett Nelson came off the bench to lead Florida
with 15 points. He was one of five Gators to score in double
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a great win for us because Duke has been the
model of excellence over the last 20 years,'' said Florida coach
Billy Donovan, whose team advances to the Elite Eight for the first
time since 1994. ``People said we couldn't press them and we
shouldn't dare try, but that's the way we play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys did an excellent job of executing our
system, and I thought our zone helped us in the last three minutes
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's victory snapped Duke's 26-game East Regional winning
streak going back to 1986. Duke also lost for just the fourth time
as a top seed.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators played man defense most of the night until switching
to a 2-3 zone that Duke could not score against down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the shots we usually make,'' said Duke forward Chris
Carrawell, who finished with 16 points in his final college game.
``We took our shots and went out firing all our bullets. That's all
you can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Shane Battier led the Blue Devils with 20 points, nine
rebounds and four blocks, but Duke used only seven players and
seemed to tire at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Duke ends the season 29-5 after starting the year 0-2 with a
team that lost four key players from last season's team, which fell
to Connecticut in the NCAA championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys expect me to feel bad about this, you're crazy,''
said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. ``This may have been the most
gratifying year I've ever had as a coach. These guys fought like
crazy, and it's been an amazing year with a special group of young
men.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early in the game the Florida press was going to be
a problem for the Blue Devils, who had 12 turnovers in the first
half. The Gators managed to hold a 40-33 lead at the half despite
the fact Duke went to the free-throw line 16 times (making 11)
while the Gators shot only five free throws and made four.
</P>
<P>
   Duke came out strong to start the second half. A 7-0 Blue Devils
run tied it 40-40 in the first minute before Florida guard Justin
Hamilton sank a 3-pointer to stop the spurt. A baseline jumper by
Nelson put the Gators ahead 45-40.
</P>
<P>
   Things were starting to get rough when Florida forward Kenyan
Weaks was whistled for a technical foul after he elbowed Duke guard
Jason Williams under the chin while both players were scrambling
for a ball on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The game continued to seesaw, and Duke took a 60-58 lead when
Matt Christensen made a layup off a fast break, which was the first
basket of the game by the Duke bench.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finally started finding the range in the last eight
minutes of the game. After going 1-for-10, Williams made four
consecutive shots to help the Blue Devils take their biggest lead
at 72-66.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gators battled back and tied it at 74 when Teddy Dupay
converted a 3-point play as Duke center Carlos Boozer fouled out
with five minutes remaining. Boozer left with 11 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was big to get Boozer out of the game,'' Dupay
said. ``He is a real anchor for them inside, and it hurt them not
having him out there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A 3-point basket by Dupay made it 78-77 Duke before Florida took
the lead for good on a fast-break layup by Udonis Haslem.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators were ecstatic with the win, but they calmed down
quickly in the locker room, realizing there was more work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come here just to beat Duke,'' Weaks said. ``We came
here to win two games and get to the Final Four.''

HE'S NOT ELICITING ONLY COMPLIMENTS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ The way Mateen Cleaves handles a
basketball, he could pass for Harry Potter. It turns out, the
marvelous Michigan State senior is going to be the lead character
in a book. Only it's not going to be a fanciful piece of fiction
like the best-selling works of J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' mother, Frances, is writing a nonfiction book (the
working title is ``Player Haters'') about the scurrilous side of
college basketball. For four years, she has been keeping copious
notes on verbal batteries hurled at her son from hecklers in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The reader can expect an eyeful because Frances Cleaves has
gotten an earful over the seasons, this despite the fact her fifth
and youngest child has developed into arguably the best collegiate
point guard in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves can deliver the No.1-seeded Spartans to their second
straight Final Four with a victory today over a No.2-seeded Iowa
State squad that has a proficient point guard of its own in Jamaal
Tinsley.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old from Flint is glad for the competition, but he
wasn't going to let a pesky press trap him into turning the contest
into a backcourt duel between himself and Tinsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to run my team and that's what I'm going to do,''
Cleaves said Friday during a media session at The Palace, site of
today's Midwest Regional Final. ``I don't really go out to put on a
show or impress people. I just go out and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates don't always show the same fire. In the first half
of their third-round game against Syracuse on Thursday, the
Spartans got lax and appeared on the verge of getting waxed.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen took a 10-point lead into the intermission, during
which time Cleaves lit into his teammates so severely it's a small
wonder they didn't return to the court sporting burn marks.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans scalded Syracuse in the final 20 minutes to notch a
17-point victory. Cleaves contributed all 10 of his points in the
second half and finished with seven assists. He had silenced the
naysayers for yet another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be some doubters,'' said Cleaves, the
Big Ten all-time leader in assists. ``It's funny to me. When I was
growing up, I was always trying to go out and prove people wrong. I
don't get caught up in that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves has been written off because he's not a slick shooter,
because his past includes two alcohol-related scrapes with the law
and because he suffered a stress fracture in his right foot last
fall and missed the first 13 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is on all the offensive signs his mother has
confiscated and kept over the years. They provided the fodder for
her book, which she is doing with Cleaves' equivocal blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no choice but to back her,'' Cleaves said with a laugh
that let everybody in the room know that, hey, moms can do the
darndest things. ``I guess she just wants to tell about all the
negative stuff you hear people say and how people will try to tear
you apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves felt as if his soul had been shredded when his right
sole first shelved him. He could have taken his game to the NBA
after his junior year and suddenly he wasn't going anywhere it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid,'' Cleaves said. ``It was very tough for me. At
first, the main thing I kept saying is, `Why me?' The thing that
helped me out is I had a lot of positive people around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them was Spartans coach Tom Izzo. ``If he looked at
me and it looked like I was having a bad day, he'd call me into his
office and talk to me,'' Cleaves said of Izzo. ``Coach was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo returned the compliment. ``If you want to be really honest
about it,'' he said, ``about 90 percent of the players in Mateen's
situation would cheer for their team but secretly hope they didn't
do !ital!too!off! well without them. But I never saw an inkling of
that with Mateen.''
</P>
<P>
   What strangers see when they watch Cleaves play is magic (and
Magic Johnson, too, the former MSU guard whose assists record
Cleaves surpassed).
</P>
<P>
   ``That Cleaves is unbelievable,'' one onlooker said to another
after the Syracuse game. ``He's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cleaves, ``That's really a good feeling to hear people talk
about you like that. I'm just out there being myself.''

WELL WISHES AND A FEW TEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Jim Edmonds showed up at the Angels
spring-training complex on Friday morning to tie up some loose ends
and say his goodbyes. But he couldn't do it without letting out
some emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds walked into the clubhouse at 10 a.m., peeked out the
clubhouse door to look at his former teammates on the field and
then sat down to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a few players came in, one at a time, and wished him well.
When Garret Anderson came in, the two hugged, and Edmonds began to
cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like moving away from your family,'' said Edmonds, traded
Thursday to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher Kent Bottenfield
and second baseman Adam Kennedy. ``How do you react? It's hard to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Gary DiSarcina and Tim Salmon had reminisced
about playing with him in the minors, Edmonds' eyes welled up with
tears. He has spent 12 years in the Angels organization, and grew
up in Diamond Bar, only a few miles up the road from Edison
International Field.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the hometown-boy-makes-good potential of Edmonds'
career, his name has been mentioned in trade rumors for four years.
When it finally happened, Edmonds was floored.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bill Stoneman had told him only a few days
earlier that he expected Edmonds to play the season with the
Angels. But the deal with the Cardinals came up and just like that,
it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia pulled Edmonds from the game after
the sixth inning and sent him to the clubhouse. Edmonds was
supposed to play the entire game, but he didn't think anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any idea something was going on,'' he said. ''I
just thought I was coming out of the game. I learned anything can
happen in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said he has no hard feelings for Stoneman, saying he
didn't feel betrayed by the sudden turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just doing his job,'' Edmonds said. ''The reason he
reassured me the other day was so I could focus on baseball and do
my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was hitting .390 with the Angels this spring and will
get to play in a place many consider one of the best baseball
cities in the country. He'll get to hit in the same lineup as
Damien High grad Mark McGwire. The Cardinals are so loaded with
talent, Edmonds will probably hit fifth or sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy about being able to go to an atmosphere that's
pretty exciting,'' Edmonds said. ''But right now, I don't know.
It's just taking a while to sink in. I'm tired and exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was Edmonds' best friend on the team, and possibly his
only friend at times. And it is Anderson who will take over
Edmonds' spot in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Goodbye, and keep in touch,' '' Anderson said.
``I really respect him and he's a good friend. I want it to stay
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has been maligned over the years for his approach to the
game. He is so athletic and his style is so free and easy, other
players fumed, perceiving that he didn't care. But those who know
him best, know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the flair,'' right fielder Tim Salmon said. ``He banged
into walls a ton of times and made great plays, and somehow it
worked against him. He was so valuable over there. He'd give me
cues right before the pitch. He'd say, `Timmy . . . changeup'
because he'd read the catcher's sign and know what pitch was coming
and where it was going. He made my job a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds flew from Arizona to Florida Friday night and will join
his new club today. It's also a new league and a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a little bit sad for him to leave home,'' said
Paul Cohen, Edmonds' agent. ``He'll miss the guys and miss the
fans. But once he gets past the emotion of it, he'll be pretty
excited about the future. To be able to play with Big Mac in the
same lineup is going to be an incredible experience.''

   Negotiators for US Airways Group and its flight attendants union
continued talk- ing early Saturday morning as the 12:01 a.m.
deadline for the talks passed.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and the union had reported modest progress earlier
in the evening and at about midnight, Jeff Zack, a union spokesman
said that the two sides had agreed to continue talking beyond the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Nagin, US Airways's execu- tive vice president and
general counsel, said the chairman of the National Media- tion
Board had asked them to extend the talks past the deadline and the
two sides agreed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's management repeated Friday that if no agreement
was reached by the deadline, US Airways would suspend operations
beginning Saturday to avoid being whipsawed by the attendants'
planned partial strike.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting unorthodox tactics, the union's 10,000 flight
attendants have warned of a partial strike that would disrupt 49 of
the airline's busiest routes. Company officials fear that the
partial strike, which the union calls Chaos _ Create Havoc Around
Our System _ would tie the airline in knots and strand thousands of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday in Washington, Patricia Friend,
president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said that the
union was continuing preparations for a strike, adding, ``We've
been able to settle a large number of issues, mostly the smaller
issues, but the larger issues of pay and pension remain
unresolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's leaders and Rakesh Gangwal, the airline's chief
executive, were still negotiating late Friday in an undisclosed
Washington hotel with the assistance of Ernest W. DuBester,
chairman of the National Mediation Board. Officials from both sides
said that the talks were difficult because the airline is intent on
reining in its operating costs, the highest in the industry, while
the attendants want a large raise because they have not had an
across-the-board pay increase in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants have been bargaining with the airline
since 1996 and they became free to strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday
when a federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period expired. Under
federal law, President Clinton has the power to order the airline
and the attendants to continue normal operations for 60 days, but
officials for both sides said they doubted he would do that because
neither side had requested such intervention.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to step in, several labor leaders said, it would
upset the AFL-CIO, which was unhappy when he intervened in 1997 to
abort a pilots' strike at American Airlines, a move that unions
felt weakened the pilots' leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a shutdown of the nation's sixth-largest airline,
whether through a strike or the company's pre-emptive action, was
sowing tension and chaos in airports around the nation Friday as
thousands of passengers rushed to change their reservations or seek
refunds on their tickets. On a typical day, US Airways operates
2,200 flights carrying a total of 150,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a considerable amount of nervousness out there,'' said
Michael Pingrey, owner of Act Travel, a Washington-based travel
agency. ``We're working hard to get people on other flights, but
it's getting tougher and tougher. Everyone has been trying to get
onto other flights, but all the other flights are booked up now.''
</P>
<P>
   A shutdown would do the greatest harm to the East Coast, where
US Airways, with 36 percent of the regional market, has the largest
market share. The cities expected to be hit hardest are Charlotte,
N.C., where the airline has 320 daily departures, accounting for 90
percent of airport traffic, and Pittsburgh, where it has 264 daily
departures, representing 86 percent of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines has said that if US Air's New
York-Washington-Boston shuttle was suspended, it would add several
planes to the route, while Amtrak said it would add cars to its
trains to carry additional passengers on the New
York-Washington-Boston routes.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has arranged for other airlines and Amtrak to honor
its tickets if its operations are shut down. The airline advises
customers holding electronic tickets to call US Airways or a travel
agent, or to go to a US Airways counter, to get their tickets
reprocessed so that those tickets can be accepted at other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
that a shutdown would cost the airline $15 million to $20 million
in losses per day. But he said that the airline has more than $1
billion in cash on hand to help weather a shutdown, including a
$500 million credit line it recently drew down.
</P>
<P>
   To control its costs, US Airways is pressing the attendants to
accept a formula similar to one accepted by its other major unions,
a formula that would link the attendants' pay to the average of
their counterparts at the nation's four largest airlines plus 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airway's attendants have bridled at this, egged on by
union leaders who say that the formula put forward by management
would cut their pay and benefits. Resistance to the formula has
been fueled further by resentment toward the lofty compensation
received by US Airway's top executives. Stephen M. Wolf, the
chairman, received $34.2 million last year in salary, bonus and
stock option grants, several times that of his counterparts at the
top four airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that when they receive their large salaries
and bonuses and when the airline continues to prosper in a strong
economy, they expect us to take a pay cut and accept concessions,''
said Christopher Spangler, a $32,000-a-year flight attendant based
in Pittsburgh. Attendants' pay starts at $17,145 and rises to
$36,918 after 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials assert that their pay offer is generous
because it links the attendants not to their counterparts at
struggling companies, but to their counterparts at the industry
leaders: United, American, Delta and Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   US Air officials added that if the union accepted the parity
formula it would go far to restrain the airline's costs. These
officials added that if the attendants were to receive a higher
formula, then the airline's other major unions _ the pilots,
mechanics and passenger-service workers _ might demand to have
their contracts reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about who is right or wrong or who wins or
loses,'' said Lawrence Nagin, executive vice president and general
counsel at US Airways. ``It's about this company being competitive
and doing what's right for our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point has been the attendants' assertion that
management was pressuring them to accept the same version of the
parity formula as the pilots, and not a formula tailored
specifically to the attendants. But late Thursday the airline
announced that it was presenting different versions of the formula
to address the union's concerns while still enabling the airline to
restrain its costs.

   HOUSTON _ Vice President Al Gore cannot count on Texas for
electoral votes in November, but he can still bank on it for
Democratic money.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president attended a reception and dinner Friday night
in Houston that would raise more than $600,000 for the Democratic
National Committee, capping a week of fund raising in Washington,
Cincinnati and Detroit expected to raise an additional $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has called for an overhaul of campaign finance laws
and challenged Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, to mutually halt the raising of
large, unregulated donations of ``soft money,'' has shown no signs
of letting up his own prodigious fund raising. Gore is helping the
Democratic Party to raise $35 million in soft money during the next
few months to finance a spate of television commercials intended to
highlight the party's differences with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's back yard may seem an unusual place for Gore to raise
money, given the governor's popularity here and his strong ties to
the state's business community and to wealthy donors who make soft
money donations. But last year, in Dallas, Gore raised about
$500,000 during a reception and luncheon at the Fairmont Hotel as
part of a swing through Texas that raised $1 million for his
campaign, said Jess Hay, a Dallas businessman and longtime Gore
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   This is Gore's first money-raising trip to Texas for the
Democratic committee this year; he made none last year, party
officials said. President Clinton has raised $1.5 million for the
party in Texas over that time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can raise that kind of money by going into a
guy's home state against him, that's kind of unusual,'' said Ben
Barnes, a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas who is now
a lobbyist and is involved in technology venture capital projects
in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, noting that both events
were being held at the homes of lawyers, said, ``Al Gore is an
obstacle to meaningful lawsuit reform because he's beholden to
powerful personal-injury trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Houston event for Gore, according to officials at the
Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was a
$1,000-a-person reception at the home of Denman Heard, a Houston
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, Gore defended his soft-money fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side is always going to have more resources and yet
we've got to try to have a level playing field,'' he said. ``We all
know the system needs reform. But the people who need champions
fighting for them against powerful special interests cannot be
abandoned through unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a dinner held at the home of Lee Godfrey, a prominent
litigator who has previously played host at similar events, 33
people expected to donate $15,000 each dined on crabmeat parfait,
quail stuffed with squash, and pecan pie.

STOCKS MOVE LITTLE AS BONDS CLAIM THE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks go up, and stocks go down, but on Friday
stocks mainly went sideways.
</P>
<P>
   A volatile week on Wall Street ended with a whimper, as the Dow
Jones industrial average fell slightly and the technology-fattened
Nasdaq composite index crept closer to the record it set earlier in
March. The Dow was down 7.14 points at 11,112.72, while the Nasdaq
rose 22.42 to close at 4,963.03. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index rose slightly, 0.11 point, to 1,527.46.
</P>
<P>
   The real action Friday was in the bond market, with the price of
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling 1 7/32 to 103 19/32.
That drove the the yield, which moves in the opposite direction as
its price, up to 5.99 percent from 5.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that bond investors were worried by the report
that some members of the Federal Reserve, which sets short-term
interest rates, had argued for a half-percentage-point increase in
rates at the Fed's February meeting, whose minutes were just
released. The Fed has raised rates five times since June, most
recently on Tuesday when it pushed up a rate on overnight loans
between banks to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But each increase has been only one-quarter of a percentage
point. A larger increase would indicate that the Fed is
increasingly concerned about inflation, which is bad for bonds,
because they pay a fixed return.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, stocks and bonds move in tandem, with higher interest
rates considered bad for stocks because they drive up corporate
borrowing costs and make bonds more attractive as an alternative to
stocks. But stock investors shrugged off the latest rate increase,
confident that higher short-term rates would not slow the economy
enough to hurt corporate profits and that the Fed was almost
finished raising rates in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every increase that occurs, people feel that we're closer to
the ultimate time where the Fed's going to see the light at the end
of the tunnel,'' said Vernon Winters, chief investment officer of
Mellon Private Asset Management, which has $58 billion in assets.
``Maybe a half-point rise gets it over with even sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters said that this week's action had been very positive for
stock investors because it marked the first time this year that
stocks had risen across the board. He noted that the Wilshire 5000
index, which represents almost the entire U.S. stock market, broke
out of a narrow trading range and set all-time highs for the last
four days. Friday, the Wilshire closed at 14,751.64, up 17.39
points. For the week, the index was up more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there's been a thrust in the last week that has a
positive tone,'' Winters said. ``The values of all stocks went up
across the board, rather than just taking from one and giving to
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Big individual gainers Friday included IBM, which rose $6.125 to
$121.375, and Wal-Mart, up $1.50 to $55.50. The day's biggest loser
was Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which fell $7.50 to $72.50 after halting
marketing of Propulsid, a heartburn drug that has been linked to
heart problems and as many as 80 deaths. Propulsid sales, which
were almost $1 billion in 1999, could be just over $250 million
this year, analysts said. The drop wiped out more than $10 billion
in market value from Johnson &AMP; Johnson.

ACTOR CALLS FOR SUPPORT OF POSITIVE LATINO FILMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   North Hollywood, Calif. _ The price of cinematic glory for
Latinos runs about $8, preferably for a new film starring Jimmy
Smits and a San Fernando High School calculus whiz, Smits told
secondary students Friday in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Smits plays a washed-up prizefighter seeking the fame he was
denied in the jabs and uppercuts of his three sons in New Line
Cinema's ``Price of Glory.'' Friday, he urged more than 500
students from San Fernando High and 14 other Southland schools to
support the film and others that realistically portray Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta go those first couple of weeks that it opens,
because that really helps the next one that comes down the line,''
he said of the film, which also features San Fernando High senior
Ernesto Hernandez, who plays one of the sons.
</P>
<P>
   Smits called on Hollywood to produce more movies with
nonstereotypical portrayals of Latinos, such as his own ``My
Family, Mi Familia'' in 1995, and 1997's ``Selena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Between each of those films passed time, time where we were
not represented on the big screen,'' said Smits, who sported a
fisherman's cap and a gray textured sweater. ``Considering how many
of us there are in this country, in this city, in this state,
that's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by the 20-month-old Premiere Weekend
Club, a downtown-based nonprofit group that aims to promote films
with Latino themes and characters. Director Carlos Avila told the
students he collaborated with the group in making ``Price of
Glory,'' his first film, and even invited the club's president, Gil
Botello, to view a rough cut before he finished editing.
</P>
<P>
   Botello told the students that Latinos spent more than $1.5
billion at the box office last year, and urged them to bring some
of that economic clout to bear on the film industry's reluctance to
do Latino-inspired works.
</P>
<P>
   But the group also wants to work on studios from the inside,
Botello said, by encouraging young Latinos to work in the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the academy before the event, Smits grinned
when asked about Hernandez, who missed the movie's introduction
because his mother was ill.
</P>
<P>
   He recounted the persistence of Hernandez, who was plucked from
more than 1,000 young men who auditioned for the part of Johnny
Ortega, the youngest son of Smits' character. On each callback,
Smits recalled, Hernandez gave a sharper performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very proud of the work that he did,'' Smits said,
adding that he's also proud that success hasn't disillusioned
Hernandez, who is taking Advanced Placement calculus and other
rigorous courses at San Fernando High.
</P>
<P>
   The young actor already has turned down two roles, Smits said,
``one time because he was taking tests in school and he was
conflicted, and the other time he didn't really like the particular
script and what it said about Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, he's got all this going on, and he's got a nice little
conscience, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Perez, a 19-year-old senior and cultural arts commissioner
for San Fernando High's student government, said Hernandez's
success as an actor inspired him to seek work behind the scenes as
an editor.
</P>
<P>
   Perez recently produced a video about the life of Cesar Chavez
that will be shown at a school observance of the farm labor
leader's birthday Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that he's not the exception,'' Perez said of
Hernandez. ``He's a kid just like us.''

HIGH SCHOOL STAR COMMITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Birmingham High (of Van Nuys) defensive back/wide
receiver John Walker has become the second player to give USC an
oral commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Walker (6-feet, 170 pounds) is projected as a cornerback in
college. He follows Upland defensive end Jason Wardlow, who
committed earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Walker could be the latest recruit to also run track for the
Trojans, since he excels in the 110-meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   __ New role: USC coach Paul Hackett believes the lines of
communication are better in spring practices, because offensive
coordinator Hue Jackson is also working as the quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jackson handled the running backs while Ken O'Brien
was the quarterbacks coach. O'Brien quit last December after being
asked to work with the tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I was concerned about was that the guy
putting the offense together (Jackson) was not having a direct link
to (quarterback) Carson Palmer,'' Hackett said. ``It wasn't Ken
O'Brien's fault, he was fine, but Hue had to be with the running
backs all the time, so it was difficult for us last year.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Controlled scrimmage: USC will scrimmage for about a
half-hour near the end of today's practice, which runs from 11:30
a.m.-2 p.m. at Howard Jones Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be real simple,'' Hackett said. ``A lot of first-and-10
situations. It's a chance to get some snaps.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Busy schedule: The player with the most hectic schedule could
be wide receiver Marcell Allmond, who is also a prominent hurdler
and decathlete on the track team.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond is trying to juggle both sports and will miss next
weekend's scrimmage, along with the April 8 scrimmage at the
Coliseum to participate in track meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to track practice every day before football,'' Allmond
said. ``I'm doing both.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Lucais MacKay, who is also a top discus
thrower, will miss today's scrimmage to go to a track meet.
</P>
<P>
   __ Outside linebacker battle: The most-competitive position on
the team could be strongside linebacker, where senior-to-be Sultan
Abdul-Malik started last season before moving to defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Kori Dickerson, freshman Chris Prosser, junior college
transfer John Cousins and converted tight end Scott Huber are all
competing for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping at the end of each scrimmage, we'll get closer to a
decision,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   While weakside linebacker Markus Steele recovers from shoulder
surgery, reserves Henry Wallace and Darryl Knight are fighting for
the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Another position that needs to be filled is the holder for field
goals and extra points. Last year, senior John Fox handled those
duties. Cornerback Kevin Arbet, quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst and
free safety Ife Ohalete are all working at the position.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are also searching for a long-snapper. Linebacker
Zeke Moreno did it last year, but USC would prefer to have a
reserve handle the role. One of the candidates is former Westlake
High tight end Joe Boskovich.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shotgun debut: For the first time this spring, the Trojans
showed their shotgun formation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the debut,'' Hackett said. ``We broke it out a bit.
I don't know where we'll go, but we'll take a look at it.''

ANNAN EXHORTS U.N. COUNCIL ON `OIL FOR FOOD' FOR IRAQIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 5th graf with Holbrooke's status) 
(bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Friday that
the United Nations was in danger of losing a propaganda war with
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq if the ``oil for food'' program
intended to help Iraqi civilians suffering under sanctions is not
made more effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian situation in Iraq poses a serious moral
dilemma for this organization,'' Annan told the council. ``The
United Nations has always been on the side of the vulnerable and
the weak, and has always sought to relieve suffering, yet here we
are accused of causing suffering to an entire population.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a special daylong Security Council session to review
the organization's work in Iraq, during which the United States was
on the defensive against criticism that it is blunting the positive
impact of the program by blocking more than 1,000 import contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to such criticism, James B. Cunningham, the deputy
U.S. representative at the United Nations, announced Friday that
the United States was lifting its holds on 70 contracts worth at
least $100 million in the Iraqi sanctions committee, which reviews
Iraqi orders. The United States also formally introduced its
resolution doubling to $600 million the value of oil equipment Iraq
may import every six months. Since December, there have been no
limits on the oil Iraq can export.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the &UR;  &LR; U.S. representative, was not in the
Security Council Friday. He has played down the Iraq issue since
his arrival in August, showing little in- terest in a long-running
Clinton ad- ministration policy that has drawn rebukes against the
United States. He has turned the Iraq file over to Cunningham, who
is more famil- iar with the issue, having been posted here when
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, an invasion that led to the impo-
sition of international sanctions.
 &UR;  &LR; Cunningham offered several proposals for better supervision in
Iraq, so that U.S. suspicions about the ultimate use or
destinations of certain imported goods, including electrical,
scientific, telecommunications and oil equipment, could be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its current problems, Cunningham said, Iraq's oil
exports and food imports are reaching the levels that prevailed
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which led to
international sanctions and the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In a long speech accompanied by statistical material circulated
to council members, Cunningham continued to place much of the blame
for shortcomings in the oil sales plan on Saddam's government,
which, he said, refuses to expedite orders, share information or
allow inspections at many sites.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also took the Iraqis to task, saying people living under
sanctions are ``often victims both of their own government and of
the measures taken against it.'' The only way to end that, he
added, is for Iraq to comply with council decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The council is waiting to see if Saddam will allow the return of
weapons inspectors, the key to ending sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan expressed anguish over the position the United Nations
now finds itself in, with an uncooperative Iraq on one side and an
intransigent United States on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of losing the argument, or the propaganda war
_ if we haven't already lost it _ about who is responsible for this
situation, President Saddam Hussein or the United Nations,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During Friday's debate, several council members tried to shift
from past blame to future efforts to make the ``oil for food''
program work.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, speaking to reporters before
Friday afternoon's session, said there were numerous things the
council could do without further debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can speed the procedures in the sanctions committee,'' he
said. ``We can inject more cash into the U.N. program in Iraq. We
can start to stop the smuggling that is going on, the illegal oil
sales. We can increase the number of monitors looking at the
program's delivery in Iraq, and if we do that, we can bring down
the number of holds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, French and Chinese were most critical Friday of
the U.S. and British on Iraq. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian
representative, accused the United States and Britain of killing
more than 140 people and wounding hundreds more in attacks over the
no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any explanation that these strikes were not directed at
civilians does not hold water,'' Lavrov said. He called for an
early suspension of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, the Dutch representative and chairman of the
council's Iraqi sanctions committee, said that despite differences,
there was a council consensus that Iraq still has to convince the
world that it does not have dreams of creating prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is the only country in modern history that has not only
attempted to develop all categories of weapons of mass destruction
_ nuclear, biological and chemical _ but has actually used such
weapons, both against a foreign enemy and against its own
citizens,'' van Walsum said. ``In doing so, Iraq has placed itself
in a league of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, two issues lying at the heart of the debate on
Iraq had rarely been raised. One is the scarcity of verifiable
information beyond what is physically visible to United Nations
officials in Iraq _ whose appointments Baghdad can control in the
sense that it can reject nominees for relief positions, and whose
movements are frequently circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   All health and poverty figures the United Nations has to work
with are provided by the Iraqi government. Journalists cannot
report freely in the country, and the international news agencies
there must use Iraqi citizens for day-to-day reporting, which
usually amounts to no more than repeating what officials say in the
government-controlled press. Families of critics face wholesale
retaliation, diplomats based in Baghdad say.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi government decisions are often opaque, some United Nations
officials say. In some ministries, there appears to be little
planning for social development using what funds are available to
the government from its own resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the virtual absence of independent information-gathering in
Iraq, critics of Saddam say, the effects of sanctions can be
manipulated to influence public opinion inside and outside the
country, as a few speakers noted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, a diplomat in residence at the Council on
Foreign Relations, who was chief arms inspector in Iraq from 1997
to 1999, argues that sanctions worked when they were first imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got an immoral and utterly determined regime _ and
people are very frightened of Saddam _ sanctions might work
initially, depending not on how severe they are or how the
leadership reacts to them,'' Butler said in an interview Wednesday.
``They did, in the Iraq case, concentrate their minds for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, given this immorality and ruthless determination, the
longer the time sanctions are applied, the less and less effective
they become, to the point where they invert in their effectiveness
for two reasons,'' he said. ``One, they get busted through a black
market and two, the leadership is able to parlay this into a reason
for staying in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's exactly where Saddam is now,'' he said. ``Today
the regime is absolutely prospering through its black market
operations _ and the longer they go on, the leakier things become _
and he is successfully deploying them propagandistically. He's
saying, `Only I can protect you from all those bad people out
there, and that's why you've got to stick with me.'''

INTERIOR SECRETARY BABBITT TO ANNOUNCE YOSEMITE
ENVIRONMENTAL  PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt will
announce details of an ambitious new plan for cutting car traffic
and restoring natural habitat in Yosemite Valley at a San Francisco
speech on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to those familiar with the plan, Babbitt will endorse
major reductions in parking spaces in the valley, turning Yosemite
National Park's headquarters building into a museum, ripping up
some roads, removing three bridges and a dam along the Merced
River, and building three satellite parking lots outside the valley
and encouraging day visitors to take buses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new plan would make major changes in the ways
visitors can enjoy Yosemite, it does not go as far as a proposal
announced two years ago that would have banned most private cars in
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   That idea envisioned a fleet of shuttle buses carrying visitors
from outlying locations or some kind of parking facility near El
Capitan in an area called Taft Toe.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle bus idea has been greatly scaled back in the new
blueprint and the parking facility has apparently been dropped.
Both ideas ran into considerable opposition, and the 1997 plan was
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The new National Park Service document that Babbitt will outline
in Monday's speech at the Commonwealth Club instead hopes to reduce
summertime traffic jams in Yosemite Valley through a major cutback
in parking spots.
</P>
<P>
   Parking will be concentrated in the Yosemite Village area and
many parking lots in the eastern end of the valley will be torn out
along with roads through the Stoneman and Ahwahnee Meadows, two of
the most beautiful areas of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the park service hopes to slash car traffic by opening
three new lots with a total of 1,600 spaces. One would be on the
Highway 120 entrance to the park, near Crane Flat, the second would
be off Highway 41 near the Badger Pass ski area and the third is
planned for El Portal, on Highway 140.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors would be encouraged to park their cars at these
locations and ride shuttle buses into Yosemite Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The new blueprint _ technically called a preferred alternative
to the Draft Yosemite Valley Plan _ also reportedly calls for
tearing up parking lots near Yosemite Falls, removing a large and
homely toilet facility near the falls, tearing down the old
superintendent's residence, eliminating the old horse stables,
taking out some units of the Housekeeping Camp, and removing other
park service and concession facilities.
</P>
<P>
   However, the major effort is to strike a blow against
overcrowding. Eighty percent of the visitors to Yosemite come for a
single day only and 90 percent of them drive cars. On some summer
weekends, the valley that John Muir called ``incomparable'' has
been the scene of horn-honking traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service has been trying to solve this problem
for over 20 years with a series of plans that were announced with
speeches and fanfare, but never implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The last valley plan, unveiled at a news conference in Yosemite
on a glorious autumn day two years ago, had to be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the Park Service was sued by the Sierra Club and
forced to redo yet another of its plans. By then Babbitt himself
had become involved. He replaced park service veteran Stanley
Albright as Yosemite's superintendent and installed David Mihalic,
a manager with a reputation for action.
</P>
<P>
   Now Babbitt is taking the highly unusual step of introducing a
draft plan himself. The secretary ``has been interested in Yosemite
since he first took office,'' said Department of the Interior
spokesman Tim Ahern. ``Yosemite is one of the four or five most
beautiful places in the world, and he has fallen under its spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Others feel that the Clinton administration is attempting to
leave a legacy of environmental actions that are popular with its
core constituency, including the creation of roadless areas in
national forests and new national monuments in the southwest and
west together with new ways to enhance the visitor experience in
the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Park Service's Yosemite ideas have the
enthusiastic support of some environmental groups like the
Wilderness Society. Jay Watson, the society's regional director,
said he thought the new Yosemite plan would be ``a very big deal''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clear that the Park Service will make an effort
to substantially reduce car traffic in Yosemite.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Watson said he had not seen the plan, he was ``very
encouraged'' by what he had heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a big change, a dramatic improvement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other environmentalists may not be so enthusiastic. The draft
plan also contains some proposals dealing with expansion of
Yosemite Lodge, which has drawn fire from the Sierra Club and rock
climbers. The new plan is reportedly a massive document _ five
volumes, including one thick book of maps. The Park Service will
hold public hearings on the plan, some of them as far from Yosemite
as Seattle, Chicago and Washington, D.C.

CITY HALL MAKEOVER COST TRIPLES TO $299.8 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ The cost to renovate Los Angeles City Hall has
jumped an additional 10 percent, to $299.8 million _ nearly three
times the original price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton on Friday blamed the latest
escalation on a combination of factors, mainly that bids came in at
nearly $14 million more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lag in time on when we prepared our bids and when
they went on the street,'' Deaton said. ``They came in much higher
than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, officials decided to put in a new
communication system using fiber optics, at a cost of $4.5 million,
as well as a $9 million contingency fund to cover other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Vosburgh, a spokesman for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association, said he was not surprised by the increases for a
project originally estimated at $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an `Oh, God, what else is new?' type of thing,''
Vosburgh said. ``It strikes me they have already invested so much
in it that they can't get out now. It's like being in quicksand.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, started nearly two years ago because of damage from
the Northridge Earthquake, is scheduled for completion next year
with a planned move-in date of July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some changes from the way offices were laid out in
the past, an effort to bring some sense to a building whose
interior can be as confusing to navigate as some City Council
ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office will return to the third floor just off the
Rotunda, as it had been in the past, and mayoral staffers will have
offices on the second, third and mezzanine levels rather.
Previously they were scattered about the building on floors that
sometimes required two elevators to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council chambers will retain its site but with a new
look, so the council horseshoe will face out to the audience. Work
also is planned to improve the acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think if you stand in the back of the room, people will
actually be able to hear what is said,'' Deaton said.
</P>
<P>
   All council offices will be located on the fourth floor of the
building, rather than on various floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is make it easier for the public to
find the council offices rather than (be) wandering around,''
Deaton said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for making use of the entire building instead of
an earlier proposal that closed off floors above the 10th level.
This would allow the city to bring back some key departments such
as Planning and Public Works, which now are in office space six
blocks from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In regard to City Hall's plan to consolidate offices, Joel
Loomer, who is part of a group that owns property on Spring Street
and has the city as a tenant, said he was concerned about the
historic downtown area being abandoned by the city or its workers
and the impact it would have on the historic core area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city convinced the state to build the Ronald Reagan State
Office Building in the historic core with the promise it would
support the area,'' Loomer said. ``I wouldn't want to see a change
in policy.'
</P>
<P>
   Deaton said the city remained committed to the area but also
needed to consolidate its services at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the extra costs of fixing City Hall, the Ad Hoc
City Hall Seismic Committee recommended that an additional $170,000
be provided to repair an elevator at Van Nuys City Hall.

BUCHANAN, IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITES GATHER AGAINST WAR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ Conservative presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan and leftist author Alexander Cockburn are the strangest of
bedfellows in a unique anti-war conference this weekend in San
Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for tie-dye T-shirt-wearing protesters chanting
``Give peace a chance'' are going to be disappointed. The
conference, sponsored by Antiwar.com and the Center for Libertarian
Studies, is expected to attract about 200 people to the Villa Hotel
in San Mateo, where speakers will slam the United States for
``acting the part of a global bully,'' said Burt Blumert, a
spokesman for the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the deep American tradition of anti-intervention,''
Blumert said. ``Just like in Vietnam, the opposition comes from the
extremes of the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate
in 1996, the conference is a chance to talk about his party's
opposition to foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does war add to the size of government, but big
government leads to war, since war provides a way to enhance its
size and power,'' said Browne, who's seeking his party's nomination
again this year. ``To stop war-making, we need to reduce government
to a tiny fraction of its current size.''
</P>
<P>
   While ideological opposites like Cockburn, a columnist for The
Nation, and Buchanan, a former Republican seeking the Reform Party
nomination for president, travel very different political paths,
they have ended up at the same point when issues like last year's
bombing of Serbia are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the Left sold out to Imperialism,'' is the title of
Cockburn's lunchtime talk Saturday, while in a speech last night,
Buchanan made his own position clear.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Republicans and Democrats a trying to foist a
``neo-imperialist'' foreign policy on the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is best for America and the West, they tell us, is that
the United States should remain a superpower sheriff ... possessed
of the sole right to deputize posses ... to discipline evildoers
wherever our `values' are threatened,'' Buchanan said. ``I submit
that this foreign policy poses a great and growing danger to the
peace and security of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan called himself ``a proud ex-Cold Warrior who
supported every great anti-Communist initiative from JFK to Ronald
Reagan,'' he pledged that if elected he would pull all U.S. troops
out of Bosnia and Kosovo by year's end and bring all American
troops home from Europe by the end of his first term. That promise
drew loud applause from the standing-room-only audience last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not wish to isolate America from the world, only to
isolate America from wars _ the religious, ethnic and territorial
wars of less fortunate lands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's anti-war movement is anything but politically correct,
Blumert admitted. The semi-isolationist doctrines of Buchanan and a
number of other conservative scholars carry plenty of baggage
dating from the original ``American First'' movement before World
War II, an effort to keep the United States out of the war in
Europe that left its members branded anti-Semites and Nazi dupes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the body bags start coming home is the only time it's
easy to be anti-war,'' Blumert said.
</P>
<P>
   While Cockburn represents the political left at the conference,
most of the speakers are from the conservative edge of the
landscape and the crowd there reflected that. While Buchanan's
jibes at Democratic Vice President Al Gore drew laughs from the
audience, his suggestion that the Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
GOP nominee for president has shown ``neither an absorbing interest
nor an extraordinary aptitude for foreign policy'' brought a
similar response.
</P>
<P>
   The third party theme of the convention ran through the other
scheduled speakers. Lenora Fulani, a Reform Party member and
Buchanan backer who ran for president on the New Alliance Party
ticket in 1988, is a speaker, as is Browne, the Libertarian leader.
Ron Paul, a Republican congressman from Texas who was the
Libertarian presidential candidate in 1988, also is on the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The conference begins at 8:30 Saturday morning and continues
Sunday morning.

PROPOSAL TO BUILD SCHOOL STRIKES OUT WITH DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ The Los Angeles Dodgers threw a curve Friday to
the Los Angeles Unified School District's ``ideal'' site for a new
high school near downtown: the team's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Since the $200 million Belmont Learning Center was abandoned,
LAUSD officials have been looking for new sites nearby. But Dodgers
President Bob Graziano has informed the district that the team does
not believe the use of 16 acres of Parking Lot 23 would be
appropriate for a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district's suggestion to build a 2,000-person high school
... is fraught with extraordinary hurdles that make the concept
impractical,'' Graziano wrote in a letter to school officials
obtained by the Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a high school at the main entrance to Dodger Stadium
would create significant safety issues for our neighbors, our fans
and the prospective students. In addition, there are concerns over
traffic, construction and parking needs, freeway access,
environmental issues and scheduling conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said the Dodgers would be willing to help the district
with alternative sites, but it was unclear whether that would
include other parts of their property.
</P>
<P>
   The school board voted this year to abandon Belmont, the
nation's costliest school, which was built on a site oozing toxic
and explosive gases from abandoned oil wells. To replace the 4,000
student seats lost by that decision, the LAUSD is considering
replacement sites nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials said Friday that they could not comment on the
letter as part of an agreement with the school district not to
discuss the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Miller, chief operating officer for the district, said
school officials believe the parking lot remains the ideal
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need high school seats and we think Lot 23 is the best
site,'' Miller said. ``We will just have to continue our
discussions with the Dodgers on this or other sites they have
control of. We don't know what alternatives they are talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district has the power of eminent domain to take over
property for schools, although the Dodgers could slow down that
process in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get to that point,'' Miller said. ``We think
there is room for more discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   School board member Caprice Young said she was not surprised by
the baseball organization's position, adding that she welcomes
their help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take any 16 acres they can come up with,'' Young said.
``We are totally open to their suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, whose district is adjacent to
Dodger Stadium, said she believes the school district is wrong to
look at other locations until it resolves all the questions over
the Belmont Learning Center site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it isn't safe and can't be made safe, that's one thing,''
she said. ``No one would want to build there. But if it was a
political decision to stop construction, that's something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council entered the Belmont debate this
month, passing a motion that called for the city to withhold key
funding and building permits for new school construction in the
Belmont attendance area if the council is dissatisfied with the
district's plans to replace Belmont.

TRENDSETTERS BRING BACK A DILUTED ABSINTHE, ONCE TOUTED BY VAN 
 GOGH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Absinthe, the emerald-green liqueur that was popular in
fin-de-siecle Paris and is now enjoying a watered-down comeback,
contains a neurotoxin that may account for some of the addled
behavior of Vincent Van Gogh, scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Using lab mice to solve a century-old riddle, researchers
reported that a substance called alpha-thujone _ the active
ingredient in what some cognescenti call ``La Fee Verte,'' or ``the
green fairy'' _ can lead to the out-of-control firing of brain
cells.
</P>
<P>
   A similar misfiring is found in some forms of epilepsy. Other
symptoms long linked to absinthe consumption include addiction,
hallucinations and delirium.
</P>
<P>
   Many late 19th century and early 20th century creative geniuses
had a strong taste for absinthe, and became well-practiced in its
elaborate mystique and rituals _ typically involving perforated
spoons, water and sugar in a sidewalk-cafe setting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Van Gogh, other famous imbibers included Baudelaire,
Rimbaud, Verlaine, Toulouse-Lautrec and Picasso. Many immortalized
the beverage in paintings, notably Toulouse-Lautrec, who favored
diluting his in cognac rather than water, forming a deathly
concoction he called an ``earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears some of their more curious, if not
self-destructive, psychiatric symptoms may be explained by
absinthe's activity on a special type of receptor responsible for
controlling the excitation of brain signals.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the GABA receptor, it is a key component in the brain's
delicate system of self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy consumption of the high-potency liqueurs common in Van
Gogh's day ``would have greatly disrupted the nervous system,''
said John Casida, a professor of toxicology and environmental
chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Casida and colleagues at UC Berkeley and the Northwestern
University Medical School summarized their findings in the latest
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report on the same material is scheduled for Monday
during the national meeting of the American Chemical Society, which
convenes this weekend in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the latest findings explain Van Gogh's psychiatric
symptoms and more extreme behavior _ which ultimately led to his
infamous ear-slicing and suicide _ is a matter of conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gogh experts said Friday the new biochemical evidence
certainly sheds some important light on one of history's most
intensely creative periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old absinthe was bad stuff,'' said Dr. Wilf Arnold at the
University of Kansas Medical Center, author of the book ``Vincent
Van Gogh: Chemicals, Crises and Creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is finally a good scientific reason to explain the
toxicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Van Gogh appears to have suffered a congenital
condition called acute intermittent porphyria, whose psychiatric
conditions can be drug induced.
</P>
<P>
   Others who lacked such predispositions, including Van Gogh's
onetime roommate Paul Gauguin, may have been able to drink more
absinthe than Van Gogh with much less severe results, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Absinthe's active ingredient, which comes from an extract of the
wormwood plant, has been linked to psychiatric illness, convulsions
and even death since the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could determine just how the drug affected the brain. As
a result of health concerns, the drink was banned shortly after the
turn of the century in France and many other countries, including
the United States, where it is still outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   But today, green-colored absinthe beverages, some containing 55
percent alcohol, are sold legally in parts of Europe and Canada.
Their potency, however, is much reduced: less than 10 parts per
million of the active ingredient versus 260 parts per million in
``old absinthe,'' according to some recent studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite trendy in the U.K. at the moment,'' said Sue Hill,
office manager at a British absinthe dealer called Sebor Absinthe,
which advertises on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the company's Web site gets a steady stream of
orders, perhaps 20 or so daily, from would-be absinthe drinkers in
the United States _ part of an apparent worldwide surge in
retro-European-style tippling.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, herbal concoctions containing the same active
ingredient, including extracts of wormwood oil and cedarleaf oil,
are sold to control various digestive and liver symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dosages are supposed to be too low for any brain effects, but at
least one accidental poisoning has been reported recently in a
31-year-old man who eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Casida noted that many of the herbal medicines have not been
rigorously tested. The National Institutes of Health plans further
studies of products with alpha-thujone next year.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argue against outright prohibition, maintaining that
people who want the stuff will find it anyway, or can make their
own homemade versions with unpredictable results.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ By nature of its location, Central Texas doesn't often
feel the brunt of a hurricane. At the Erwin Center on Friday night,
however, one was going to make landfall one way or another.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only question was singular or plural.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of the breeze, the Tulsa Golden Hurricane blew
away the Miami Hurricanes 80-71 to advance to the South Regional
final Sunday afternoon as one of the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   With one more NCAA Tournament victory, Tulsa would go on to the
Final Four, quite an achievement for a small, private school that
plays in the lightly regarded Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what you call us, but in a lot of ways we are a
Cinderella,'' said Tulsa coach Bill Self. ``We got like two votes
in the AP preseason poll. But as the season's gone on, our players
have shown they can play with anybody. I don't mind being the
underdog. We play better when we think we're the underdog. We have
a little chip on our shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Hurricane, seeded No. 7 in the South despite what is
now a 32-4 record, used speed and defense to take down No. 6 Miami
(23-11) of the Big East Conference. Tulsa center Brandon Kurtz,
shut out in the first half, scored 17 points in the second half and
keyed a 20-4 run that put the game out of reach. Kurtz and Eric
Coley led Tulsa with 17 points each, and Kurtz had 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   As usually is the case, five players scored in double figures
for Tulsa. Greg Harrington added 14 points, Marcus Hill 13 and Tony
Heard 11.
</P>
<P>
   Miami put up a valiant fight after falling behind by 17 points
in the first half. The Hurricanes closed to 31-25 at the half and
took a 46-43 lead when Vernon Jennings hit a 3-pointer with 10:30
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Mario Bland led Miami with 17 points each. Johnny
Hemsley, the Hurricanes' leading scorer all season, was held to 13
points by Tulsa's tenacious defense.
</P>
<P>
   As it did in a second-round win last weekend against Cincinnati,
Tulsa took a big early lead, let it slip away in the second half
and then raced away in the final 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd make a run,'' said Kurtz. ``It reminded me of
the Cincinnati game in that we felt that we had worn Cincinnati
down with about six minutes left. Tonight, we took Miami's punch
and kept plugging away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa used its quickness and ball-hawking talent to force 13
Miami turnovers in the first half and 20 in the game. The teams
traded baskets in the early going, but Tulsa went on a 16-0 run
over a nine-minute span to go ahead 25-8.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:40 left in the first half, Miami had committed nine
turnovers and scored eight points _ numbers that add up to no good.
</P>
<P>
   During that run, Harrington scored five points, while Coley and
David Shelton added four each. In addition, Harrington and Coley
took turns holding down Hemsley, who had to work for every shot.
</P>
<P>
   But as was the case in its second-round win over Cincinnati,
Tulsa couldn't stand prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   When Miami's John Salmons scored on a short jumper with 6:10
left, Tulsa was ahead 25-10. However, Miami's Jennings and Hemsley
heated up, and Tulsa cooled off. Jennings scored eight points
before halftime, and James Jones hit a 3-pointer to trim the Tulsa
lead to 31-25.
</P>
<P>
   Except for 4-of-5 shooting from 3-point range, Miami would have
been further behind. The Hurricanes were only 4-of-14 on two-point
field goals and were outrebounded 20-14 by a shorter Tulsa team.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had no answer in the second half for Kurtz, a 6-11 senior
who scored eight points during Tulsa's 20-4 game-deciding run.
After a slam dunk put Tulsa back ahead 47-46 with 9:45 left, Kurtz
gestured toward the Tulsa fans and exhorted them to make more
noise.
</P>
<P>
   The fans responded, and so did Kurtz. He scored six of Tulsa's
next eight points as the Golden Hurricane lead grew to 63-50 with
4:45 left in the game. Tulsa hit its free throws down the stretch
to hang on for the win, its first in a Sweet 16 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with the way they keep fighting and
scratching,'' said Miami coach Leonard Hamilton. ``They were a step
quicker than us at the end. If they play that way, there's no
telling how far they can go in this tournament.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ This 2000 NCAA Tournament certainly will be remembered for
being so upside down, so backward, so inside out.
</P>
<P>
   Up has been down. High seeds have felt low. Big has been little.
And Friday night at the Erwin Center, there were a few strange
moments cropping up here and there.
</P>
<P>
   A giddy chant of ``TU, TU'' went up in the middle of the South
Regional, and the Aggies were nowhere to be found. Later, UT was in
the house, but nobody was flashing the Hook 'em Horns.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as you might feel the urge to lump all the goings-on
Friday with the other shocking developments of the 2000 Tourney,
don't.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa 80, Miami 71 was no surprise and no upset.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Tulsa team that has been redefining the term
``Self-ish'' all year and now might even have thrust itself into
the role of the favorite to make it not just to the Final Four but
to the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Two big pieces of clutter sitting between Tulsa and Indy were
dusted away Friday night, in much the same fashion as so many other
obstacles have been booted on their big Tournament run. With
defense. With speed. And with a bit of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific exhibition of defense and hustle that jammed
Miami into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Syracuse, N.Y., the Florida Gators _ a team that
Tulsa can beat _ ousted No. 1-seeded Duke, which was a team no one
figured to beat.
</P>
<P>
   The path to a remarkable 2000 story is clearing. What other
teams don't sweep away, the Golden Hurricane seems more than
capable of doing itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less what tag people put on us,'' Tulsa coach
Bill Self said. ``Cinderella? I just know we're still playing.
These players have shown they can play with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   They showed it with remarkable conviction Friday, scratching
past a team that shared the Big East title only one outing after
booting the former No. 1 team in the country, Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   If you're counting, the Golden Hurricane is now 32-4, with the
four losses coming by a total of seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Self has been selling this all-out scrambling,
fingernails-to-the-floor style of his all season. The Hurricane has
bought it and has swarmed opponent after opponent into submission
with an endless stream of fresh bodies and athletic moves.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Miami Hurricanes sold, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever saying that the other team had more
energy than we had,'' Miami coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``But
Tulsa did. There's no other way to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hurricanes regular-season leading scorer Johnny Hemsley,
whose 13 points Friday were five below his average and who hit just
four of 10 shots: ``I've seen pressure before. But I have never
seen a group of guys play together as well as they do or as hard as
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not since 1985, when Villanova won it all as a No. 5
seed, has a team seemed so in sync with the X's and O's come
Tournament time. Probably not since then has the whole bunch of
starters fallen into such a groove and looked so fluid,
particularly defensively.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's game, Miami had four turnovers in the first three
minutes and 20 for the game and hit just 39 percent of its shots
against a team that features only one player taller than 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration was written all over the faces of the Miami players,
even when they briefly took the edge 46-43 before the Hurricane
stripped away the game with its defense and a 22-5 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went pretty much as scripted,'' Self said. ``We got tired,
but I think we wore them out more.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of scripts, probably not since the 1988 Kansas Jayhawks
(a No. 6 seed) has a Tourney team seen so many things fall
perfectly in place for a big run.
</P>
<P>
   After taking out UNLV in its Tournament opener, Tulsa faced
Cincy, which had lost Kenyon Martin for the season. On Friday, the
Golden Hurricane was simply better than Miami, but Tulsa still
caught a break when Miami big man James Jones left early with a
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Now standing before the Hurricane and a trip to the Final Four
is No. 8 North Carolina, a young team that beat Tennessee on Friday
but, with 13 losses, isn't your classic Tar Heels powerhouse. And
if the Hurricane wants to dream beyond a Final Four appearance, the
road to the championship game also got easier with Duke's loss to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Villanova? Remember Kansas? Say hello to Tulsa.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ He stands around the side of the court in his
old gray sweatshirt and matching worn pants and looks like anything
but the next great thing.
</P>
<P>
   And to hear Larry Eustachy tell it, he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the message being delivered by his Iowa State
team.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, when Eustachy's Cyclones take on top-seeded Michigan
State and its green-and-white wave of a home-court advantage at the
Palace, at stake will be a spot in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And anybody who says they saw that one coming back in November
probably has a nose longer than Pinocchio's.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the preseason polls, Iowa State was picked to finish
last or near the bottom of the Big 12 Conference. Now, the most
improved and most surprising team in the country stands 31-4 after
turning out the lights on UCLA's high-wire act Thursday night in
the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones come at you with a truckload of defense and with an
offense that is as tough to stop as an advancing army. The tank is
Marcus Fizer, the 6-7, 265-pound junior who is a sure NBA lottery
pick. The trigger man is point guard Jamaal Tinsley, who slices and
dices better than anything advertised on late-night television.
</P>
<P>
   But Eustachy is the man drawing up the plays and employing the
strategies that have enabled Iowa State to make the assault. TV
portrays the coaches in college basketball these days as sideline
generals, the main event to watch as the players come and go so
quickly through the programs in such a constant hurry to strike
professional riches.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Knight is nothing less than the General at Indiana, even
going so far overboard with some of his antics to be described as
czar, dictator, king for life.
</P>
<P>
   Not Eustachy. To say he and Knight are cut from the same mold is
to say Rembrandt and the guy who put a fresh coat on your living
room are both painters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Eustachy recently took a big step toward Knight and the rest
of the big names in terms of salary, receiving a bump from $500,000
annually to nearly $1 million per season in a 10-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been happier,'' Eustachy said. ``Never, ever.
That's what happens when you get to a place you finally know is
where you're going to be. When I signed that deal, I was signing a
lifetime contract at a place I love, a place with tremendous
potential. I'll tell you, that is something that is very, very
reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Those should, of course, be reassuring words to the fans and
administration of Iowa State, hearing that the man who has them on
the verge of their first Final Four appearance since 1944 never
wants to call the moving van again. There is every reason to
believe Eustachy believes those words and says them with honesty
and conviction. Today.
</P>
<P>
   However, the truth of the matter is that in these days of
salaries spiraling up like financial cyclones, it is hard to
envision a coach of his caliber staying at such an out-of-the-way
place like Ames, Iowa, for the rest of his career. Sure, it could
happen. Jim Boeheim arrived on campus to enroll and play ball at
Syracuse in 1963 and has never left. But Boeheim is an anachronism,
and besides, Eustachy doesn't have the old school ties to Iowa
State.
</P>
<P>
   The previous coach who had the Cyclones fighting for a time for
national recognition was Tim Floyd, and he jumped when he could to
the post-Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls, even if it meant losing
every night. Because the money was huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me,'' said Eustachy, pointing to his sartorial
inelegance. ``How much money do I need? This is who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But it becomes a question not of need but of what is offered and
how big a spotlight is shined in a man's face and whether he is
attracted to the warmth.
</P>
<P>
   No one would blame Eustachy _ or any other coach _ for listening
to another offer if the athletic directors of Division I-A schools
want to dangle a sheik's riches. The ADs say they are just trying
to keep pace with the market, and yet they send the market higher
and higher all the time. Kansas State just hired Jim Wooldridge and
gave him $600,000 a year, even though his resume is limited.
</P>
<P>
   So what if someday a bigger name like Louisville comes along
looking for a replacement for Denny Crum, who is near the end of
the line and may have been nudged closer by a first-round NCAA
Tournament loss to Gonzaga? It so happens the Louisville AD is Tom
Jurich, who just happens to be an old high school pal of Eustachy's
from Arcadia, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The two also share a past in the Big Sky Conference. Jurich ran
the program at Northern Arizona while Eustachy was the coach at
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   This is what some schools do when they want to give their
programs a shot in the arm _ bring in a coach with solid
credentials and a track record, rather than the glory of mere name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm flattered that anybody would even think of me
in terms of a program like that,'' said Eustachy. ``But it's not my
kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here. The only place I'm interested in going is
Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy, content, full of everything he needs in Ames. But if
Eustachy gets to the Final Four, don't bet on it being where he
winds up. Other schools have gray sweatshirts.

NORTH CAROLINA TO FACE TULSA FOR FINAL FOUR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hang around and let the other team hang itself.
Pick up the pieces. That is what North Carolina did Friday night
against Tennessee, winning in stunning style, 74-69, before 16,731
fans at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier game here, Tulsa beat Miami, 80-71. The Golden
Hurricane (32-4) now plays North Carolina (21-13) on Sunday for the
South Regional title and a trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee led at halftime, 39-33, and the lead would have been
more if Carolina's Jason Capel had not scored a 3-pointer 3 seconds
before the buzzer sounded. Carolina picked up from there in the
second half despite losing its 7-foot center, Brendan Haywood. He
fouled out with 8 minutes 3 seconds left and Carolina trailing,
55-53.
</P>
<P>
   But Carolina guard Ed Cota provided all of the leadership the
team needed, controlling the game, driving for critical baskets,
including the one that tied the score, 64-64, with 3 minutes left,
and one that put Carolina ahead for good, 66-64, with 1:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tremendous win for us,'' said Bill Guthridge, North
Carolina's coach. ``I'm proud of the way my team hung in there. We
gambled with Brandon in there and that backfired, the then the team
bailed us out with tremendous play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cota, who finished with 11 points and five assists, said:
``Coach told us we were probably going to be behind a lot in this
game and to keep our poise. He was right and soon enough the game
turned our way and was ours.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is seeking the 15th Final Four appearance in the
school's history.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Tar Heels were outplayed. They won despite
failing to score any points off fast breaks. They won despite being
outrebounded, 38-34. They won despite being beaten at the free
throw line, 21-12. And they won despite making making only four
3-pointers, two fewer than Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very good team, very athletic and I had a feeling we
would play this game from behind,'' Guthridge said. ``The teams
that have beaten them have mostly come from behind. We just wanted
to keep it close and have a chance to win at the end. And one of
the ways we managed that was our team was the most fired up that I
have ever seen from this bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, Tulsa, unlike Tennessee, was able to finish
what it started. Tulsa, the champion of the Western Athletic
Conference, raced to a 17-point lead late in the first half. The
Golden Hurricane lost the momentum midway through the second half
but finished strong, using a late 14-0 spurt to ensure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa featured balance _ four of its players scored in double
figures, led by forward Eric Coley and center Brandon Kurtz with 17
points each. Kurtz added 10 rebounds, helping Tulsa outrebound
Miami, 41-37.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa led in nearly every key category: it shot 56 percent in
the second half; it won in points in the paint, 40-22; points off
turnovers, 23-15; second-chance points, 10-6; and fast-break
points, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hats off to Miami,'' Kurtz said. ``They played great defense
in the first half. But then we spread the floor, and things sort of
opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley added: ``We got the loose balls and we blocked shots. We
were able to win the little battles. We didn't get stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miami did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was probably faster than Miami wanted,'' Tulsa coach
Bill Self said. ``At the end, we were tired, but Miami was more
tired. Our four losses this season are all on the last possession
of the game. We've proven ourselves.''

OKLAHOMA STATE TOPPLES SETON HALL, WILL FACE FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE _ With its best player sitting on the bench in street
clothes, Seton Hall's improbable tournament run ended in dramatic
fashion Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen Holloway, a senior guard and co-captain who suffered a
severe sprain of his left ankle last Sunday against Temple, could
only watch the final excruciating minutes of the Pirates' 68-66
loss to Oklahoma State in the semifinals of the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (27-6), seeded third in the region, will face
Florida, which upset top-seeded Duke, 87-78, in the other semifinal
Friday night. Seton Hall, seeded 10th, finished its season at
22-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who defeated Oregon and Temple in overtime in the
first two rounds, led by a point at halftime, and the game was tied
at 53-53 with 8 minutes 7 seconds remaining. The teams traded
basket after basket, and with 2:23 left, Seton Hall trailed by
60-57 despite hitting only 7 of 34 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The final moments were filled with timeouts, fouls and strategy.
Two free throws by Seton Hall's Al Harris cut Oklahoma State's lead
to 60-59 with 1:09 left. But the Cowboys got the next two points on
a layup off an inbounds pass and Seton Hall's next shot fell short.
Two free throws by Joe Adkins gave Oklahoma State a 64-59 lead.
Seton Hall called timeout with 27.5 seconds remaining. On the
inbounds play, Ty Shine, Holloway's replacement, set up Greg
Morton's layup to cut the Oklahoma State lead to 64-61 with 17.4
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   A foul by Shine resulted in two free throws by Glendon
Alexander, both good, to increase the Cowboys' lead to 66-61. With
16 seconds left, Shine missed a 3-pointer, but Darius Lane put in
the follow shot to cut the deficit to 66-63 with 7.6 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys came out of a timeout, Shine fouled Alexander
before the inbounds pass. After Alexander made one free throw of
two, Kaukenas dribbled downcourt and hit a 3-point field goal to
cut the lead to 67-66. But Alexander was fouled again and sank his
first free throw to make it 68-66 for the Cowboys. After a timeout,
he went back to the line with half a second showing on the clock.
He missed the second shot and Seton Hall took the ball off the
rebound. But the buzzer sounded to end the game before the Pirates
could get off a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rimas Kaukenas led Seton Hall with 17 points. Lane had 16 and
Shine 11. For Oklahoma State, Desmond Mason had 16, Fredrik Jonzen
had 15 and Brian Montonati also had 15. Lane was 2 for 18 from long
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it really hasn't hit me,'' Holloway said of the end
of his career. ``It will hit tomorrow. I feel worse for my
teammates than I do for myself. We put forth a tremendous effort.
What a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tommy Amaker said: ``You can see it, smell it, almost feel
it. But we ran into a really good basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hitting our bodies, wearing us down,'' Lane said.
``We just got tired at the end. I thought we just ran out of time.
There wasn't enough time to get a miracle shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway sat on the bench, his left foot encased in wrappings.
He had cried on the bench Sunday after returning from the X-ray
room of the hospital in Buffalo during the second game against
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Shine came out cold Friday night, missing his first from outside
the arc in the first half. He did many other things well, including
grabbing rebounds and bringing the ball upcourt as the point guard
against the man-to-man defense of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gottlieb, the Cowboys' guard who finished with 12 assists
said he and coach Eddie Sutton were discussing the game afterward.
``Coach said, `Boy that was a struggle,''' Gottlieb said. ``It was
a war. Every team has to show up for a war like that. They were
undermanned. They are well coached.'' &QL;

SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Seton Hall's string of upsets came to an end
Friday night when Oklahoma State held off the Pirates down the
stretch and advanced to the East Regional final with a 68-66
victory in front of 31,681 spectators at the Carrier Dome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSU (27-6) will play Florida on Sunday at 4 p.m. to see which
team will advance to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led the final eight minutes of the game, but the two
teams never were more than five points apart in the second half.
OSU starts four seniors while Seton Hall had only one senior on the
floor Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is big down the stretch,'' said Oklahoma State
forward Desmond Mason, who led the Cowboys with 16 points. ``When
you get this far, everybody is playing their tails off, but
experience can make a difference in the final minutes, and I think
that was true tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall, the No. 10 seed, ends the season 22-10 after pulling
off two overtime upsets to reach the regional semifinal. But the
Pirates were playing against OSU without senior starting point
guard Shaheen Holloway, the team's leading scorer this season. He
tore a ligament in his left ankle in the second-round victory over
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaheen is a heck of a player,'' said Oklahoma State coach
Eddie Sutton. ``They lost a lot when they lost him.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup point guard Ty Shine scored 26 points last weekend
against Temple, but he was 4-of-16 from the field Friday and
finished with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys point guard Doug Gottlieb had a big night with 12
assists and only two turnovers, along with seven rebounds. OSU
center Fredrik Jonzen scored 15 points and grabbed seven boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led 60-57 when forward Brian Montonati went to the
line with 1:38 to go but missed two free throws. The big surprise
came on the other end when Seton Hall freshman Al Harris, a 46
percent free-throw shooter, made two attempts from the line to cut
it to 60-59.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were right there,'' said Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker.
``We could see it, smell it and almost feel it, but we didn't
capitalize. Oklahoma State is a seasoned team, and they made huge
plays at the crucial moments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys built their lead back to 64-59 on a layup by
Montonati and two free throws by Joe Adkins with 27.5 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was 67-63 and appeared to be over when Seton Hall guard Rimas
Kaukenas, who led the team with 17 points, banked in a 3-pointer to
make it 67-66 with 1.8 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates quickly fouled Glendon Alexander on the inbounds
play with only five-tenths of a second left on the clock. Alexander
made the first free throw and missed the second, but Seton Hall
could not get a shot off before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The first half had a bizarre ending when the Cowboys thought
they had taken a two-point lead as Mason took two steps across
midcourt and shot a 40-foot jumper that went through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   But the shot came after the buzzer, even though the scoreboard
clock had not expired. The clock on the stadium scoreboard was not
in sync with the clocks above the baskets by six-tenths of a second
because of a cable connection problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton argued the shot should count, but OSU went to the locker
room trailing 36-35. Maybe that anger helped inspire the Cowboys at
the start of the second half, because OSU scored the first six
points after the break to take a 41-36 lead on three baskets by
Montonati.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ORLANDO, Fla. _ Apparently, Hall of Fame-bound superstars are not a
requirement to succeed. Young, athletic players can, it seems, play
consistently hard and with hunger. A team built to be rebuilt can
win.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Rockets had any doubt _ and they did _ the Orlando Magic
rolled easily past them 112-96 on Friday to prove how much can be
gained through effort and intensity, athleticism and exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rockets worked to improve their draft lottery
position, the Magic just plain worked, increasing its lead for the
last Eastern Conference playoff spot to 1{ games over the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Shandon Anderson's career-high 35 points, the Rockets
lost for the ninth time in 10 games and are 5-19 since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just played harder than us,'' said Rockets center Kelvin
Cato, who was scoreless in 22 minutes. ``They just played harder
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had the usual reasons to be relatively impassive,
and a few new ones.
</P>
<P>
   They did have to play Thursday night and then travel. They were
limited by more injuries. With Hakeem Olajuwon making his second
visit to the injured list, Walt Williams was ordered to skip the
game with a bruised thigh. And Matt Bullard, activated Thursday,
was not ready to return from back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic displayed its usual high-intensity, scrambling
defense. And the Rockets found themselves a few shooters short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are forced to go with a small lineup, missing Walt and
Matt,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``The way they play, they are
going to double-team everything, give you spot shots. We didn't
have a bunch of those guys. We made a couple of minute runs at them
and just didn't have enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important game (for the Magic). They're really
focused on the playoffs. We have a built-in excuse with all our
guys out. We have to get over all that stuff and start playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic, having supposedly razed the roster to save up for a
free-agent spending spree, instead has gone on a playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic's John Wallace played with a bone spur bulging on top
of his foot; he takes the cast off only for games. But he still
pounded the boards for 14 rebounds in 25 minutes and set the tone
as the Magic outrebounded the Rockets 10-1 on the offensive boards
in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely hurting,'' Wallace said. ``I want to be out
there with my teammates. When you're not out there on the floor _
that's when the team has the most fun _ and I want to be a part of
that. I don't want to miss anything.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets playing much of the game with at least three of
their fleet guards on the court, the Magic consistently beat the
remaining big men up the court, outscoring them 31-15 in fast-break
points. Orlando had a 24-11 edge in second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of John Amaechi, Bo Outlaw, Monty Williams and
Wallace working inside, the Magic outscored the Rockets 52-34 in
the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were undermanned at almost every position,'' Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets might have been hurt and tired. But the only way in
which they could not match up was effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we need,'' Rockets guard Steve Francis said. ``We
need to be like that. We have to have it instilled in our heads and
have that be the mentality of our players once we decide that's how
we're going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Magic came at the depleted Rockets in waves,
getting double-figure scoring from four players off the bench, more
than the Rockets had total. And if depth wore the Rockets down, it
was not just because of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played harder than us,'' the Rockets' Cuttino Mobley
said. ``They played hard as a team, real hard. The guys know their
roles, and it makes it easier for all of them. They just played
harder than us, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   But after trailing by 20 points in the third quarter, the
Rockets went with every guard they could find _ and Carlos Rogers
in the middle _ and made a run.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson picked up the open shots left by the Magic's traps.
When he nailed a free throw and a trey, the Rockets were within 11
with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets stayed that close for another minute, then Pat
Garrity nailed back-to-back 3-pointers to push the lead back to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have some shooters out there, it changes the whole
scheme of defense on pick-and-rolls and all that stuff,''
Tomjanovich said. ``We didn't have any way to get anything off the
plays we run 70 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a day after they combined for 64 points, Mobley and
Francis faced constant double-team pressure and had to force shots
to shoot at all. They combined for 31 points on 9-of-31 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Rockets made just 39 percent of their shots. And
other than Anderson's 11-of-21, they connected on just 18 of 54
shots.
</P>
<P>
   But more than lament what they failed to do, the Rockets were
impressed by the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great what (Magic coach) Doc Rivers and those guys have
done with all the trades and things of that sort,'' Anderson said.
``They're in the playoff hunt with guys from all over. They're just
really playing and working hard. That's what it's about.''

LAKERS TRY TO MAKE IT INTERESTING

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether toying with their opponent or just toying
with the idea of a suspenseful game, the Lakers played Friday like
a team that could get away with a little too much relaxation. And,
hey, they can.
</P>
<P>
   They let the injury-depleted Phoenix Suns nearly erase a 12-
point, fourth-quarter lead, let them crawl within three points in
the last minute, let everyone believe a careless collapse was
possible.
</P>
<P>
   They let it go no further. Kobe Bryant scored 28 points,
including three free throws down the stretch, and the Lakers held
off the gritty Suns 109-101 at Staples Center, to extend their
latest winning streak to five and improve to 3-0 against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was their 12th in a row at Staples and improved
their home record to 31-4, matching the Indiana Pacers for best in
the league. They haven't lost at Staples since Jan. 22, to
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have won 24 of their last 25 and haven't lost to a
Western Conference opponent since Feb. 1, at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers with a game-high 40 points and
14 rebounds. Bryant struggled in his defensive assignment against
Penny Hardaway and was burdened by foul trouble throughout but hit
9 of 15 shots and added seven assists and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw scored 11 points to play the role of third scorer on
a night when Glen Rice made just 1 of 6 shots for two points.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by as many as 12 points early in the fourth
quarter, the Lakers let the Suns whittle it down to 89-84. But they
put a stop to that run, as O'Neal scored six quick points, and Shaw
_ subbing for the foul-troubled Bryant _ hit a 3-pointer to push
the lead to double digits again.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Robinson scored five quick points to bring Phoenix
within seven points, 98-91, but the Lakers pulled away again, on
another Shaw 3-pointer and an O'Neal layup that made it 104-93 with
2:59 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson scored 22 points for the Suns. Hardaway finished with
25.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix arrived minus injured starters Jason Kidd and Tom
Gugliotta, but Lakers coach Phil Jackson wasn't worried about
anyone underestimating the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the way I prepared for them,'' he said before tipoff. ``I
told them, I think they're a better team right now, which happens a
lot of times. They came out of a two-point deficit on Wednesday
night (at Sacramento, when Kidd broke his ankle in the first half),
and beat them by 18 going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they turned it up a notch. They will, they've got the
talent. They can replace players. They still have a bench. (Oliver)
Miller's back, and (Shawn) Marion's back and Penny (Hardaway)'s
back. And they didn't play us last time with these three players.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though Jason's gone, they've got guys that can step
in at least initially in a role like this and probably play very
well. In that regard, I think they will be well prepared. I
consider this a very difficult opponent and a good game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns hardly looked like an outmanned team in the first half,
scrapping again and again to stay within striking range and
settling for a respectable 51-45 deficit at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, the Lakers pushed their lead to seven or eight
points but never into double digits as the Suns kept plugging away
behind the offense of Penny Hardaway (12 points) and Clifford
Robinson (10 points).
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, who led from the opening tip, never let the lead
slip below two points either, as O'Neal scored 15 points in the
half and Bryant overcame early foul trouble to score 17 points on
7-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Lakers had their way, with the exception of Ron
Harper, who was blocked by the front of the rim on a first-quarter
dunk attempt that had the entire Lakers bench doubled over in
hysterics.

   Instead, the Tar Heels continued their surprising run in the
NCAA Tournament on Friday night at the Erwin Center, outscoring
Tennessee 17-5 down the stretch to claim a 74-69 win in the South
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Ed Cota, held scoreless in the first 17 minutes of
the second half, scored six points in the final three minutes. Cota
finished with 11 points, but he took over with the game on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out there trying to control the game, trying to have
patience,'' Cota said. ``I knew my time was going to come. My
teammates had faith in me, and I made some big plays down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, the No. 8 seed in the South, will play No. 7
Tulsa for the right to go the Final Four. With a win Sunday, the
Tar Heels would play in the Final Four for the sixth time in the
last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   None of those Carolina teams was anywhere near as surprising as
this year's, however. The Tar Heels were 18-13 before the NCAA
Tournament but have turned things around in the last 10 days. They
beat Missouri and Stanford last weekend and overcame a huge deficit
to beat Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tremendous win for us,'' said North Carolina coach
Bill Guthridge. ``The team bailed us out. Ed Cota, as he's done so
many times for four years, made some big plays. It was a thrill for
this team to advance this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee had a 62-55 lead with just more than six minutes left,
and 7-0 North Carolina center Brendan Haywood was on the bench with
five fouls. Freshman Joseph Forte, who led the Tar Heels with 22
points, scored five quick points to make it 64-60 with 4:25.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee froze up in the final minutes, getting only a
3-pointer by Tony Harris and a meaningless last-second layup by
C.J. Black, who led the Vols with 17 points. Harris was 1-of-10
from the field and 1-of-6 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for 35 minutes we played a very good game,'' said
Tennessee coach Jerry Green. ``But in the last four, five minutes
we started trying to make the hard play. While we were making the
hard play, they were making baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   As strange as it seems, North Carolina is the only team
remaining from the Atlantic Coast Conference. Duke, the ACC
regular-season champion and No. 1 seed in the East, was eliminated
Friday night by Florida.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (21-13) jumped ahead early behind Forte, who
scored 13 first-half points and helped the Tar Heels to a 20-15
lead eight minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Isiah Victor and freshman Ron Slay keyed a 15-3 run by the
Vols that made it 30-23 with just more than seven minutes left in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee threatened to run away with the game when Victor and
Slay combined for the Vols' final nine points of the half to make
it 39-31, but Jason Capel scored five quick points for North
Carolina. Capel's 3-pointer with three seconds left in the half cut
the Tennessee lead to 39-36.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is four inches shorter than North Carolina's Haywood,
Black scored the first six points of the second half to help the
Vols to a 47-40 lead. Black had to sit down with three fouls at
17:05, but the Tar Heels not only couldn't cut into the lead, they
fell behind 51-42 with 12 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood did slam one home and converted a standard three-point
play to pull the Tar Heels to 51-45. With that, Black came back
into the game, but North Carolina went inside to pull within 57-53
with 7:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Tar Heels were forced to play the rest of the way
without Haywood, who picked up foul No. 4 at 9:30 and fouled out 90
seconds later. Black, playing with four fouls, scored on a rebound
to make it 59-53 Tennessee, but the Tar Heels wouldn't go down
easily.
</P>
<P>
   With the game on the line, Cota took over. And once they had the
lead, the Tar Heels knew what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so proud and happy for our team to accomplish that,''
said Guthridge. ``Things didn't look very good for us tonight, but
the players did something I thought they were capable of doing all
season.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened earlier this season, when Carolina went 10-11
after starting the season 8-2?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to set everything (for the Tournament),'' said
Guthridge, smiling but perhaps knowing something more than the rest
of the college basketball world.

BOTTENFIELD HOPES TO FIND HIS SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The Angels acquired Kent Bottenfield and Adam
Kennedy from the Cardinals in Thursday's trade for Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   In Kennedy, they are getting a young second baseman who is
average defensively but has great potential offensively. In
Bottenfield, they are getting a pitcher who (a) won 18 games last
season, and (b) won four games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Angels must be asking themselves, which Bottenfield did
they get?
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield is confident he will be the pitcher that went to the
All-Star game last year, simply because he says he has learned how
to pitch. Gone is the blazing fastball. Say hello to Mr. Location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity to work with (Cardinals pitching coach)
Dave Duncan,'' Bottenfield said during a conference call Friday
afternoon. ``He taught me the mental aspects of the game. Pitching
is more than throwing hard. He taught me how to set hitters up, how
to prepare for each pitch, each hitter, each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to say I'm on his level, but I'm a Greg Maddux-
type pitcher. Guys will walk away and wonder how I got them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said his transformation as a pitcher was one of
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to understand the type of pitcher I was,'' said
Bottenfield, 31. ``I couldn't try to throw the ball by guys like I
did in the past. For a few years, I was banging my head against the
wall. I had to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said he talked with Angels reliever Mark Petkovsek,
a former Cardinal, on Thursday night and was encouraged about his
new situation. However, Bottenfield said it was difficult to leave
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a little bit of time to get over the shock,'' he said.
''I was quite happy there. I didn't expect it. I was told it wasn't
going to happen. Maybe that was my first clue. . . . I turned my
career around in St. Louis. It's no secret St. Louis is a great
place to play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Greene happy: Possibly the happiest Angel is Todd Greene, who
was in danger of being cut and losing a job. Instead, he'll make
the team as the primary DH and serve as a third-string catcher.
Scott Spiezio also will get some time at DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it in the past,'' Greene said. ``If I get consistent
at-bats, I think I can be successful. I know I can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hill struggles:Starter Ken Hill gave up seven runs and 10
hits in 4 innings Friday in the Angels' 8-4 loss to the San Diego
Padres. That was the bad news for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for them was that Ramon Ortiz (small tear in
shoulder tissue) pitched one inning and felt fine. He gave up a
home run to Carlos Hernandez on his second pitch but retired the
next three hitters on ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like home runs,'' Ortiz said. ``But I felt great. I
threw only fastballs and changeups. I'm a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is likely to get a start Monday or Tuesday.

STUMPEL HEATING UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jozef Stumpel doesn't look back now that his future is
bright once again.
</P>
<P>
   After injuries threatened to ruin another season with the Kings,
Stumpel has emerged as one of the club's hottest scorers heading
into tonight's matchup with his former team, the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's 3-2 victory over Philadelphia, Stumpel tied the
game on a goal with 2:15 remaining and won it 1:20 into overtime
with a second goal. He also assisted on Luc Robitaille's power-play
goal midway through the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kings move on to the Bruins, who selected Stumpel 40th
overall in the 1991 draft as an 18-year-old center from Slovakia.
They traded him with Sandy Moger on Aug. 29, 1997 for goaltender
Byron Defoe and defenseman Dimitri Kristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Boston for five years and I enjoyed it very much,''
said Stumpel, who now has 17 goals and 50 points in just 49 games.
``It is a great city to walk around in. But it seems so long ago
now, my life is in Los Angeles. You always remember the team you
came up with, but we are headed to the playoffs and that is the
greatest feeling of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, 27, has five game-winning goals this season, including
three in OT this month. Yet, for much of this season, Stumpel
seemed to be carrying the same tag he wore in Boston _ a soft
player who was injury-prone. He missed seven weeks after undergoing
abdominal surgery and another month with a muscle tear in his right
knee. Without him, the Kings went 9-12-1. The rest of the time,
they were 26-18-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question he has stepped up his game,'' Kings coach
Andy Murray said after Thursday's game. ``He was in a bit of a
scoreless streak (four games), but there is no doubt how valuable
he is to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he mixes it up inside and adds a different dimension to
our offense. That's what we've been seeing more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stumpel missed 18 games and the Kings finished out of
the playoffs. During his time with Boston, Stumpel was sidelined
with a bruised kidney, fractured cheekbone, sprained knee and a
separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When he was healthy, Stumpel scored, leading Boston with 55
assists and 76 points during the 1996-97 season. The Bruins, like
the Kings this season, were trying to get grittier and believed
Stumpel was expendable.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Kings, he led the team with 58
assists and 79 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons he has gotten hurt is because he is so
active around the net,'' said Dave Taylor, who made Stumpel one of
his first acquisitions after becoming GM in April 1997. But when he
is healthy, you can see what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Emerson out: Winger Nelson Emerson, acquired with Kelly
Buchberger from Atlanta at the trade deadline, is expected to miss
at least the rest of the regular season with a broken right index
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, 32, returned to Los Angeles after suffering the injury
in the first minute of the third period during Thursday's 3-2
overtime win in Philadelphia. He was examined by hand specialist
Harold Zemel on Friday and his hand was placed in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, who scored one goal in four games after the trade, will
be replaced by Craig Johnson on the Kings' makeshift first line.
Johnson had assists on both Stumpel goals after Emerson left the
game on a slash by the Flyers' Daymond Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson moved into the top unit after Ziggy Palffy went down
last week with a sprained right shoulder. Robitaille, the third
member of the line, now is playing more with Bryan Smolinski and
Glen Murray. Robitaille scored his 34th goal Thursday, his first in
10 games.

CELTICS FALL TO 76ERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Chins slumped on chests. Voices disappeared in
throats. Tears were seemingly the blink of an eye away.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been an interment, but it wasn't. It was worse.
The Celtics are still alive, and it's killing them.
</P>
<P>
   It's a foregone conclusion that they are trying desperately to
make the playoffs _ and probably won't. The mystery is why they'd
want to in the first place. How much agony can a team take?
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's dagger may be tougher to remove than all the
others combined. Turning abundant opportunities to prevail into
sawdust, the Celtics dropped a 117-115 double-overtime decision to
the resilient Philadelphia 76ers at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big heartbreaker,'' said coach Rick Pitino, looking as
if he'd just swallowed rotten calamari at his favorite North End
eatery. ``It's difficult, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is difficult, Pitino can only hope he never has to
experience intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' third straight loss was their second straight
crusher. But it made Wednesday's last-second, 109-106 demise at the
hands of Anthony Peeler and the Minnesota Timberwolves look like a
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   This one plunged the Celtics to the depths of despair _ and the
brink of playoff mortality. Shoved deeper into 10th place in the
Eastern Conference, they now trail the victorious Orlando Magic by
3 1/2 games and the Celtics have only 13 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   If they can bear to take the court again, which they're
scheduled to do Sunday at ninth-place Milwaukee and Tuesday at
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't seem to be going our way,'' said Paul Pierce,
who led Boston with 31 points. ``We fight and fight down to the
end, but we just can't finish it off. It's like we've got a curse
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you know demons are on the loose when Matt Geiger beats
you. Or when you let Matt Geiger beat you.
</P>
<P>
   The journeyman center was the 76ers' unlikely savior, dissolving
the last of the game's 26 ties when he grabbed and converted Kevin
Ollie's missed layup with 39.9 seconds left in OT, Part II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good rebound,'' said Geiger. ``I went to the hole in
case Kevin missed. He did and I was there. It was just a routine
play.''
</P>
<P>
   What was galling was that it exploited a routine lapse by the
Celtics, who squandered 5-point leads in the last 1 1/2 minutes of
both regulation (95-90) and the first OT (104-99) because they
couldn't protect the ball. Even more than crucial missed free
throws (five in the two extra sessions) it was their failure to
break serve that did them in.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Ollie was allowed to run free after Adrian
Griffin's layup off a feed by Antoine Walker (24 points, 14
rebounds) was typical. And fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to blame missed free throws and I'm not one to
blame missed shots,'' said Pitino. ``Transition defense has been
our Achilles' heel the whole year after we score. Kevin Ollie
should not be open on a breakaway in crucial situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was, and thus came undone the efforts of Pierce, Walker,
Kenny Anderson (18 points, 4-for-7 3-point accuracy), and Vitaly
Potapenko (18 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with great courage,'' said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   They also played with an alarming lack of purpose in the crunch.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Eric Snow (21 points, 8 assists, 5 rebounds) was able
to inbound the ball with 15 seconds left in regulation to Allen
Iverson (21 points on 7-for-25 shooting), who ignored the chip
fracture of his left big toe to set up Theo Ratliff (11 points, 14
rebounds) for the stuff that tied it, 97-97, and extended the
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   And that was why Aaron McKie countered Pierce's chest-thumping
19-foot jumper with 1.7 seconds left in the first OT and drilled an
18-footer that tied it, 107-107, and added another chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Just before that exchange, Anderson had missed his only free
throw of the night. ``If I make that,'' he said, ``then it doesn't
matter what McKie does. I could stay up thinking about that all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Better he should dwell on this admonition from his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never over,'' said Pitino, harkening back to his college
days at Kentucky when Duke beat his Wildcats in the Elite Eight as
Grant Hill and Christian Laettner combined on a last-second
court-length conversion. ``I can tell you that, just like with
Christian Laettner, it's never over. You have to play defense.
Can't give them shots. It's never over.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Anderson could try the valiant philosophical approach of
Walker: ``It was just a good game. All those excuses _ we just came
up short. That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. He didn't look as if he'd particularly enjoyed himself.

JORDAN: BRYANT'S D PUTS HIM OVER CARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Kobe Bryant's rapid growth as a defensive force
needed a stamp of validation, he got it Thursday from one of the
top authorities on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, comparing two of his supposed heirs _ Bryant and
Toronto's Vince Carter _ singled out Bryant as the better
all-around player. Defense was the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince doesn't play defense,'' Jordan told the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Kobe can play both ends. Right now he's a better
all-around player. And he's only 21? The kid hasn't even touched on
his greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant _ who has dominated at times against the likes of
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, New York's Latrell Sprewell and
Milwaukee's Ray Allen _ took the comments as a sign that he's
getting recognition for his hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of it, I take pride in it. It pushes me even
more,'' he said. ``It tells me that I'm improving. (Jordan) is
observing the game, he's watching the game as everybody else is. .
. . It's cool, I guess, to get recognition like that. It just shows
I'm heading toward the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jordan's evaluation of Bryant vis-a-vis Carter, Bryant
was nonchalant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter to me. It's a compliment, I guess,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said making the NBA All-Defensive Team is a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell yes,'' he said. ``Hell yes. Like now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Defensive Player of the Year, an award Jordan won?
``Eventually,''Bryant said, ``I'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I've been here, I think you guys know, when a
player lights me up, whether it was Allen or whoever it was, that
gets under my skin, you know what I mean?'' Bryant said. ``You
don't like that feeling too much. So you want to get better at it
and that was my mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has also lauded Bryant's defense but was
careful in responding to Jordan's assessment of the two young
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're different players for sure,'' he said. ``Kobe's more
of a playmaker right now than probably Vince is, and he's called
upon to do that role. I think it's too early to tell (who the
better player is). . . . They're young men that are still
developing their game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ KJ like MJ?: Jackson said it will be difficult for Kevin
Johnson, who rejoined the Phoenix Suns but skipped the trip to
L.A., to come back after two seasons in retirement. Jordan once did
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-four is really a tough age for guards,'' he said.
``Defensively, getting his legs underneath him and then the speed
of the game. To jump in at this time of the year, players are
playing at such a high level, the intensity and the quickness is
just really difficult to activate your nervous system and get up to
speed with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Rookie swingman Devean George missed Friday's
game because of the flu.

CANUCKS ROAST DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ For a team with playoff aspirations it was
embarrassing _ even pitiful. With two crucial points on the line,
the Mighty Ducks were simply sitting ducks for the Vancouver
Canucks who routed Anaheim 8-1 before 18,422 at GM Place on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of all but ending any playoff hopes the upstart Canucks
might have had, and maintaining or bettering their position in the
Western Conference standings, the Ducks went belly up _ much to the
delight of Vancouver's second sellout crowd of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The eight goals allowed equaled a season high and the Ducks, who
had given up only 14 in the previous seven games, managed to
accomplish that feat even though the Canucks had just one power
play _ on which they scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a hockey game,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said.
``It was a total team breakdown . . . it shocks me.''
</P>
<P>
   And well it should. After a tenacious effort in a 2-1 loss at
Edmonton, the Ducks, played like a team playing out the string, not
a group desperate to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest game of the year and we didn't show up,''
said defenseman Oleg Tverdosvky. ``We got outbattled on every inch
and I have no answers why.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim may have Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, but they were no
match for Vancouver's Peter Schaeffer. No joke. Schaefer was a
one-man wrecking crew against a Ducks team that was really only
competitive for the first 10 minutes of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year winger was on the ice for the Canucks' first
four goals, scoring the first two and assisting on the third. He
wasn't credited with an assist on the fourth, but made a long pass
that helped start a play that was converted by Matt Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's power-play goal 27 seconds into the second had offset
Schaefer's first-period goal, and the Ducks actually had some good
chances to take the lead, including Antti Aalto hitting the post.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 good minutes out of 60 doesn't get it done in these
desperate days and Anaheim, which finishes the season 0-2-2 against
the Canucks, rolled over and played dead the final 10 minutes of
the second.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer gave Vancouver the lead at 11:07 when he beat
Tverdosvky around the net and put a wraparound past Guy Hebert. It
was the first of four goals in 8:11 for the Canucks, who seemed to
be the more desperate of the two supposedly desperate teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier all but finished off the Ducks at 14:09 when
Schaefer easily won a race to a loose puck behind the Anaheim net
and centered to the Vancouver captain in the high slot. The goal
came just nine seconds after the Ducks had squandered a chance to
tie the game on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was window dressing as Cooke and Andrew Cassels scored
56 seconds apart in the final 1 minutes of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg mercifully pulled Hebert after Cassels' goal with 41.3
seconds left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved our butts in the first period,'' said Hartsburg. ``I
took him out to give him a rest. Todd Bertuzzi added two more
Vancouver goals in the final three minutes of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks arrived in Edmonton early Wednesday morning sharing
eighth place with the San Jose Sharks. They returned to Southern
California tied for ninth with the Canucks. They trail the
eighth-place Phoenix Coyotes, who they play Sunday, by three points
and Edmonton and San Jose by four with only six games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try to forget this and bring our best game
Sunday,'' said Tverdovsky, who realizes despite the embarrassing
nature of the loss that the Ducks' hopes remain alive, but
realistically only if they beat Phoenix at the Pond.

LATE HOOP BY MALONE SENDS SONICS TO THIRD HOME LOSS IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Karl Malone sauntered to the Utah Jazz bench late
in the fourth quarter, he threw a few jabs in the direction of
Olden Polynice. Malone's punches barely grazed his teammate's
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Figuratively, the Sonics felt every blow.
</P>
<P>
   When they wake up this morning, the ache of a painful 98-95 loss
to the Jazz Friday night at KeyArena will be real.
</P>
<P>
   Utah led 95-94 before Malone's 16-foot baseline jumper with 6.2
seconds left knocked the wind out of the Sonics' comeback attempt.
And when Vernon Maxwell's 3-point attempt to tie the score at the
buzzer bounced off the front of the rim, the loss inflicted a
couple of wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics dropped their third in a row in KeyArena. They also
fell to eighth in the Western Conference playoff standings.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's victory put the Sonics a half-game behind the
seventh seed. Sixth-seeded Minnesota won to move 2{ games in front
of the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my team that the NBA has a way of dealing you funny
challenges, and this is one of them,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sonics are in little danger of missing the playoffs _
they are 10 games ahead of the ninth-place team _ they are
staggering toward the postseason, which is about a month away.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz provided a taste of the week to come for the Sonics.
They were the first of five consecutive playoff-bound teams that
Seattle will face during the next nine days.
</P>
<P>
   After San Antonio on Monday, the Sonics host New York and
Sacramento before traveling to Portland. Each game now becomes
critical if the Sonics are to improve their playoff seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, though, was more about the team's psyche,
considering their recent struggles at home. They have dropped four
of five games at KeyArena _ all to teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's giving the effort and playing hard,'' said Sonics
forward Vin Baker, who did not appear inhibited by a bothersome
left hamstring. ``We've been losing some tough games. The one thing
we understand is we're not going to feel sorry for ourselves. A
couple of breaks here or there or a call or two here or there, and
we could have won these games.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's basket epitomized the Sonics' recent struggles at home.
</P>
<P>
   They can't seem to do enough to pull out a close game in their
building. Malone made the winning shot fading away because Sonics
center Horace Grant was so close the two could have been married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way that shot was going in,'' Grant said
afterward. ``But, wow, you have to give him credit. He wanted to
take the last shot, and I knew he was going to take it because you
could see he wanted it. If I had to do it all over again, I think I
would have put him on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably would not have mattered. Malone made 9 of 10 free
throws en route to a team-high 21 points to go with 12 rebounds. He
led five Jazz players who reached double figures in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton's 28 points and nine assists led the Sonics. Baker
added 25 points and Maxwell chipped in 18 points. Maxwell was
4-for-7 on 3-pointers before missing the game's final shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expects the Jazz to be in this situation,'' said
Malone, whose team won for the 12th time in 13 games. ``You know,
we're old and things like that. That's what they say. ... But it
says a lot about our team by going out and executing down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 83-83 and the score seesawed until Utah took
the lead for good after Baker split a pair of free throws with the
Sonics down 92-90 with 1:26 left.
</P>
<P>
   After a Malone jumper, Baker scored to get the Sonics within
94-93. But then Jeff Hornacek answered quickly when he lost Maxwell
and scored a backdoor layup with 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-point Sonics cushion to start the final frame was
hardly enough. Utah went on a 10-1 run to start the fourth and
stormed in front 75-74.
</P>
<P>
   After a 45-42 halftime lead, the Sonics led by as many as 10
points in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played with playoff intensity, evident by the
emotion and antagonism on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Several Sonics complained that Malone recklessly threw elbows to
the face after he grabbed rebounds. Maxwell received a flagrant
foul in the first half, and Westphal picked up a technical foul in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell even threw a forearm toward Hornacek after the final
buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking over where (Dennis) Rodman left off, maybe,'' Utah
coach Jerry Sloan said of Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   As imitations go, the Sonics would settle for just playing with
the results they had the first half of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've got to find ways to win here,'' Grant said. ``But
I believe if we keep playing hard like this, we're going to get
those wins.''

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PAKISTAN (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Facing the most
challenging task of his trip to South Asia, President Clinton
arrived here Saturday to warn the military leader of Pakistan that
he must defuse tensions with India over the disputed territory of
Kashmir. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-SCENE (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ At a men's store here in
Pakistan's capital, the owner keeps a small TV on a shelf. Saturday
the featured show was Bill Clinton, who had come to Islamabad for a
quick five-hour stop after five days in India. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   POPE (Nazareth, Israel) _ Cheered by a mixed local crowd of
Muslims and Christians, Pope John Paul II appeared for one
sun-dappled moment to have erased the religious rifts in this
ancient city as he came to celebrate Mass here Saturday. By William
A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-NOTEBOOK (Jerusalem) _ 16 minutes for Barak; Trying to find
the words; Some wistful words; Angry words and curses; A chorus of
critics. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-VOICES (Moscow) _ What does Russia want in its president?
Does it want a strongman or a man of the people? Does it want to be
led back to imperial glory, or simply, as Russians will say without
a hint of irony, to join the club of civilized nations? Do they
want a democrat, or has 10 years of democracy induced nostalgia for
Soviet-style transfers of power? By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WOMEN (Osaka, Japan) _ In one of her first public acts as
Japan's first woman governor, Fusae Ota was to enter the ring at
the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament this weekend and bestow prizes.
But there has never been a woman governor before. So, just a month
after taking office, Ota found herself battling not just the sumo
wrestlers' ban on women in their hallowed ring, but the centuries
of tradition that have accorded her sex a distinctly second-class
place in Japanese politics. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   With map
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-SOONG (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Ask people here who is the most
intriguing political figure to emerge from Taiwan's momentous
presidential election last weekend, and few name Chen Shui-bian,
the earnest opposition leader who ousted the Nationalist Party
after half a century of rule. Hands down, that distinction goes to
James Soong, a former Nationalist official whose independent
candidacy for the presidency drew 37 percent of the vote, just 2
points behind Chen. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   MADRID-AIRPORT (Madrid, Spain) _ Sixteen Madrid suburbs filed
suit on Feb. 16 against a planned expansion of Madrid's Barajas
Airport, built in 1931, arguing that it presented health and safety
dangers and would inhibit urban planning. But Spain's prime
minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has so far stood resolutely against
building a new airport, instead favoring extension of the existing
airport, which is just seven and a half miles northeast of the city
center. By Al Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-IRAN (Baghdad, Iraq) _ Even in a city that has weathered
countless barrages of missiles and bombs in recent years, the
mortar attack in a residential neighborhood of Baghdad this week
that killed four people and wounded 38 was unusual. The strike on
Tuesday, carried out by Iran, appeared to be in retaliation for
recent mortar attacks in Tehran that were attributed to an Iranian
opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, many of whose guerrilla
camps are just a few hours from Baghdad, along the border with
Iran. By Hadani Ditmars.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-STRIFE (Aba, Nigeria) _ Nigeria's recent politically
driven religious conflicts have claimed hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of lives and destroyed countless churches, mosques and
houses. President Olusegun Obasanjo has described these clashes as
attempts to undermine the nation's 10-month-old democracy, and many
Nigerians from different parts of the country agree that several
states' attempts to introduce sharia, the Islamic penal and social
code, have more to do with politics than religion. But the
conflicts are rooted in all-too-real hatreds and divisions. By
Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   OPEC-MEETING (Vienna, Austria) _ The OPEC oil ministers will
meet Monday. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-TRIMBLE (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ David Trimble
Saturday held off a surprisingly strong challenge to his leadership
of the Ulster Unionist Party but emerged with his authority and his
room for maneuver in conducting peace negotiations diminished. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   JOBS-RECRUIT (Kansas, Mo.) _ As the labor pool shrinks,
employers are increasingly recruiting from among the 36 million
people in the United States between the ages of 16 and 64 who had
not sought a job, or even thought about taking one. Among those
American corporations are trying to attract are students, retirees,
housewives and the urban poor. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-LAPTOPS (Winston-Salem, N.C.) _ More than 100 colleges
and universities across the country where a computer is now
required to matriculate. Not only has this created new forms of
in-class distraction and revolutionized campus communication, but
it has begun to transform teaching itself. By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBE-MISCARRIAGES (Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation, Wash.) _
The tiny tribe that lives here on a wind-battered, rain-swept spit
of land hard by the Pacific Ocean knows something about fighting
for survival. But the most difficult battle is for the women who
live here, who are up against an unseen foe, a killer that seems to
come and go over the years, though no one can even prove it exists.
For some reason, it is frighteningly difficult to give birth to a
living child here. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN-HUNTERS (Joelton, Tenn.) _ The purpose of The
Christian Sportsmen's Fellowship, an evangelistic organization
based in Atlanta, is to reach out to Christian hunters. Richard
Jordan, the president of the fellowship, said the organization was
trying to reach men who go hunting and fishing on Sunday morning
instead of going to church. By Emily Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   USAIRWAYS-ACCORD (Dateline TK) _ US Airways and its flight
attendants' union reached agreement on a tentative contract
Saturday, averting a threatened shutdown, officials said. (Summary
from wires.) &QL;

   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-VOTERS (Washington) _ Behind much of the political debate
in recent weeks, on issues from gun control to education, is an
intensifying struggle for the hearts of women, particularly
suburban mothers. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-ROGICH (Las Vegas) _ The chatter among Gov. George W.
Bush's advisers is that the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee might turn to Sig Rogich, an advertising and public
relations executive with a reputation for buffing the images of
big-name Republicans, for a political reconditioning job. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Republicans facing an abortion
battle; At the DNC, upheaval as usual; Poll suggests Bush has the

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ During Russia's abbreviated presidential campaign,
Acting President Vladimir Putin was on television practicing judo
throws and skiing down a mountain slope. Last week he flew top-gun
style in an Su-27 jet fighter to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But now the ``acting'' is nearly over, and the hard work of
governing Russia will, everyone presumes, soon begin for him. In
the three months since Putin was catapulted into power by Boris
Yeltsin's resignation, his most serious campaigning has been in the
prosecution of a brutal military operation in Chechnya, intended to
prove to Russians that he is the firm hand that can rebuild a
strong Russian state.
</P>
<P>
   But far more complex tests await him, assuming he wins election
either in the first or second round of the balloting that starts
Sunday. In either case, the real test will be his appointments,
policies and economic reforms. ``Everybody understands that we are
on the brink of disintegration if we fail this time with reforms,''
said Sergei Karaganov, a Russian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the economy to make Russia a strong state and laying
the groundwork for full-fledged democracy could still take decades,
but the signature of Putin's rule _ as another tough authoritarian
or as an enlightened democrat _ is likely to emerge in the opening
months of his presidency. Until now it has been impossible to
determine just what Putin means when he talks about a strong state.
So here are nine important tests, distilled from the views of a
number of experts, that may help with that definition.
</P>
<P>
   1. CORRUPTION _ Putin has said he seeks a ``dictatorship of
law.'' If he is to attain it, he will have to attack the corruption
that pervades the Russian economy from top to bottom. Millions of
Russians are waiting to see whether Putin makes sure that police
and prosecutors get the support to go after corrupt politicians,
governors and oligarchs as well as the Mafia-like gangs entrenched
in so many cities. Putin said he is prepared to recruit former
associates from the KGB to help root out corruption. One sign of
whether he is serious could be if a top oligarch like Boris
Berezovsky faced a thorough investigative scrubbing by an
independent prosecutor or anti-corruption commission.
</P>
<P>
   2. THE ECONOMY _ Russia's economy will not get back on its feet
without money. Today, Russians refuse to put their money in the
bank and banks refuse to lend to most businesses, fearing loans
will not be repaid. Pouring more international aid into a
dysfunctional market system is not the answer, experts say. So
Putin must instill trust in Russia's financial sector. To do that,
he must construct a national banking system that works, and the
business community is looking to him to act, as Franklin D.
Roosevelt did 67 years ago, to close and merge banks and to
inaugurate a new banking system under federal regulation and with
guarantees for depositors.
</P>
<P>
   3. ACCOUNTABILITY _ The cornerstone of any democracy is
accountability. In Russia, the institutions of accountability _ the
courts, the legislature and a free press _ are either corrupt,
desperately weak or overwhelmed by the power of the presidency. The
question now is whether Putin will try to invigorate them or weaken
them further. Newspapers and television networks are largely in the
hands of oligarchs, autocratic governors and other local bosses.
Putin could clearly break this ownership chain, but many
journalists fear that he may make matters worse by asserting more
central control and political influence over them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the absence of rational legal codes and a
well-developed legal profession, the work of judges and courts is
politicized or just for sale. So business executives and investors
are looking to Putin to initiate legal and judicial reform. He
could start by advocating a truly independent judiciary _ to show a
commitment to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   4. CRONYISM _ Cracking down on corruption will not be possible
without cleaning house with the many Yeltsin-era cronies associated
with graft, foreign bank accounts, money laundering and kickbacks.
In other words, Putin will be judged by the company he keeps as
president.
</P>
<P>
   5. TAX COLLECTION _ Billions of dollars in capital flee Russia
every year, mostly to avoid taxes, since Russian tax laws are often
more confiscatory than progressive. And Russians who make money
horde it in dollars at home and report as little of their income as
they can. So there is an enormous potential for taxation and for
investment in rebuilding the country. But Russians will not
repatriate their fortunes until a rational tax code that is fair,
just and predictable is implemented. One test: major tax
legislation could be introduced early.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ During Russia's abbreviated presidential campaign,
Acting President Vladimir Putin was on television practicing judo
throws and skiing down a mountain slope. Last week he flew top-gun
style in an Su-27 jet fighter to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But now the ``acting'' is nearly over, and the hard work of
governing Russia will, everyone presumes, soon begin for him. In
the three months since Putin was catapulted into power by Boris
Yeltsin's resignation, his most serious campaigning has been in the
prosecution of a brutal military operation in Chechnya, intended to
prove to Russians that he is the firm hand that can rebuild a
strong Russian state.
</P>
<P>
   But far more complex tests await him, assuming he wins election
either in the first or second round of the balloting that starts
Sunday. In either case, the real test will be his appointments,
policies and economic reforms. ``Everybody understands that we are
on the brink of disintegration if we fail this time with reforms,''
said Sergei Karaganov, a Russian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the economy to make Russia a strong state and laying
the groundwork for full-fledged democracy could still take decades,
but the signature of Putin's rule _ as another tough authoritarian
or as an enlightened democrat _ is likely to emerge in the opening
months of his presidency. Until now it has been impossible to
determine just what Putin means when he talks about a strong state.
So here are nine important tests, distilled from the views of a
number of experts, that may help with that definition.
</P>
<P>
   1. CORRUPTION _ Putin has said he seeks a ``dictatorship of
law.'' If he is to attain it, he will have to attack the corruption
that pervades the Russian economy from top to bottom. Millions of
Russians are waiting to see whether Putin makes sure that police
and prosecutors get the support to go after corrupt politicians,
governors and oligarchs as well as the Mafia-like gangs entrenched
in so many cities. Putin said he is prepared to recruit former
associates from the KGB to help root out corruption. One sign of
whether he is serious could be if a top oligarch like Boris
Berezovsky faced a thorough investigative scrubbing by an
independent prosecutor or anti-corruption commission.
</P>
<P>
   2. THE ECONOMY _ Russia's economy will not get back on its feet
without money. Today, Russians refuse to put their money in the
bank and banks refuse to lend to most businesses, fearing loans
will not be repaid. Pouring more international aid into a
dysfunctional market system is not the answer, experts say. So
Putin must instill trust in Russia's financial sector. To do that,
he must construct a national banking system that works, and the
business community is looking to him to act, as Franklin D.
Roosevelt did 67 years ago, to close and merge banks and to
inaugurate a new banking system under federal regulation and with
guarantees for depositors.
</P>
<P>
   3. ACCOUNTABILITY _ The cornerstone of any democracy is
accountability. In Russia, the institutions of accountability _ the
courts, the legislature and a free press _ are either corrupt,
desperately weak or overwhelmed by the power of the presidency. The
question now is whether Putin will try to invigorate them or weaken
them further. Newspapers and television networks are largely in the
hands of oligarchs, autocratic governors and other local bosses.
Putin could clearly break this ownership chain, but many
journalists fear that he may make matters worse by asserting more
central control and political influence over them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the absence of rational legal codes and a
well-developed legal profession, the work of judges and courts is
politicized or just for sale. So business executives and investors
are looking to Putin to initiate legal and judicial reform. He
could start by advocating a truly independent judiciary _ to show a
commitment to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   4. CRONYISM _ Cracking down on corruption will not be possible
without cleaning house with the many Yeltsin-era cronies associated
with graft, foreign bank accounts, money laundering and kickbacks.
In other words, Putin will be judged by the company he keeps as
president.
</P>
<P>
   5. TAX COLLECTION _ Billions of dollars in capital flee Russia
every year, mostly to avoid taxes, since Russian tax laws are often
more confiscatory than progressive. And Russians who make money
horde it in dollars at home and report as little of their income as
they can. So there is an enormous potential for taxation and for
investment in rebuilding the country. But Russians will not
repatriate their fortunes until a rational tax code that is fair,
just and predictable is implemented. One test: major tax
legislation could be introduced early.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   6. PUBLIC HEALTH _ Russia is a sick country, its social safety
net in tatters. A million more Russians are dying every year than
are being born. Rates of illness, reflecting poor nutrition and
reduced immunity to disease, are rising alarmingly. Prostitution,
alcoholism, drug addiction, HIV infection and tuberculosis prey on
hopelessness.Doctors and nurses are abandoning their profession to
earn more money as taxi drivers and store clerks. With an
impoverished national treasury, finding some way to rescue of
Russia's health establishment may be among the hardest tests for
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   7. CHECHNYA _ Probably the most familiar test before Putin is in
Chechnya. How Putin makes peace there will inform the world about
Russia's commitment to human rights and autonomy for Russia's
ethnic populations. Will he be a compassionate healer or a
punishing victor? He could give a signal by airing the results of
investigations into human rights abuses by the army and by Chechen
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   8. MILITARY STRENGTH _ The military that delivered ``victory''
in Chechnya will make demands on the new president to modernize the
Russian army _ if not to its former strength in the Soviet era, at
least into a competent and well-equipped fighting force. Putin is
already talking about pumping money into Russia's vast
military-industrial complex, but he will have to decide where the
limits are or he will fall into the same trap as his Soviet
predecessors, endangering Russia's economy. One test will be how
much he is willing to invest in new hardware _ missiles, tanks and
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   9. CENTRAL CONTROL _ Russia's regional powers have been pulling
away from Moscow's control for a decade. Governors and regional
economic czars, who control huge industries and resources, have
established trade and political relations with neighboring
countries and each other in survival strategies that put regional
interests first and national interests second. To keep Russia from
pulling apart, Putin will have to assert national authority in the
regions without appearing as a dictator, as he did recently when he
flirted with the idea of having governors appointed from Moscow. He
will have no choice but to work with the parliament to clearly
define local and national interests and the boundaries between
them.

   Let's start with a supportable thesis, and duly credit a master:
For pure listening satisfaction it's hard to improve on the
seductive intimacy of radio.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1977, Jean Shepherd held weeknight seminars on
WOR-AM in New York that were part Kabuki, part commedia dell'arte,
part Uncle Remus. In his flat, nasal Indiana twang, playing all the
parts, and the occasional kazoo, he oozed into the darkened
bedrooms of East Coast America on the battery power of cheap
Japanese transistor radios. The meandering stories he told _ they
always came back to the point,  &UR; always &LR;  _ were usually about him.
But they also seemed to be about us _ about the old man, family car
trips, the Catch-22 Army and a cast of playmates from childhood and
adolescence, through whom all the complexities of life on earth
would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   What was he? Social commentator? Cult leader? Or just a manic
kid from a blue-collar background discovering his subversive id in
the age of Eisenhower? It was Shepherd, after all, who alerted
America to the scourge of ``creeping meatballism,'' the postwar
rush to a conformist society where happiness meant cars with tail
fins and a refreshing, ice-cold bottle of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing department at WOR never deciphered his demographic
silhouette. The station fired him in 1977, over frustration with
his format. Shepherd continued to write books (``In God We Trust,
All Others Pay Cash,'' ``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories
and Other Disasters'') and went on to make films for public
television and delve into other broadcasting venues from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   His death last October at age 78 proved a catalyst for a
memorial by his admirers, among them the humorist Harry Shearer and
Art Silverman, associate producer of ``All Things Considered'' on
National Public Radio. With others they put together a two-hour
show of reminiscences as well as generous chunks from Shepherd's
programs. The result, ``A Voice in the Night,'' was broadcast last
Christmas Eve on KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in April, the program will be distributed to public
radio stations around the country to schedule as they wish. In New
York, WNYC-AM will broadcast the show May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an insatiable appetite for one-way conversation,'' said
Silverman, recalling some off-the-air encounters in which he felt
more like audience than companion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain among those who knew Shepherd, one that
may help explain why he worked alone, with rarely anything more
than a newspaper clipping in front of him.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Shepherd essays cannot easily be excerpted;
their point may not become evident until the very last moments of
the show, when his equestrian musical theme, ``The Bahn Frei

meatloaf and mashed potatoes _ came to taste his first plate of
escargot, and thus his first taste of the wider world: (END ITALICS

   At a certain age in life, when you're _ oh, I'd say _ roughly
between 15 and 19, possibly, although that, you know, is subject to
change, you really believe you know what it's about. You really,
seriously think you've got life by the you-know-what. And you
really know what it's about. And you can't figure out why all these
other people, usually older people, keep saying that things are not
what they seem to be. What do you mean they're not? They are. You
really believe it.
</P>
<P>
   And then, then, of course, as you get older, you begin to have
faint inklings, faint inklings of what an ignoramus you have been
up to this point in life. And it's just beginning to dawn on you
what an unbelievable ignorant slob you are now.

<P>
   Wouldn't it be _ wouldn't it be fascinating if we had preserved,
actually preserved, really preserved just, just the way he was, you
see, with his armor on and everything, a Roman gladiator? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me tell you this: that you will be just as great an
attraction 2,000 years from now. If we could preserve you, any one
of you _ even, even the nothingest of us, me, any of us, you know _
we'd be fascinating to a guy 2,000 _ here's a real 20th-century
man, just the way he was, sitting there with that funny look on his
face, kind of sad, obviously suffering from post-Ed Sullivan shock,
just sitting there with a limp old copy of TV Guide in his hand,
one shoelace open.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, you know how, like we really are, you know, with a hole
in the sock. The whole business. Sitting there. You'd be a real
specimen. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And after a thousand years, you'd be great. Really, you'd be _
you'd be famous, you'd be in a museum in a case. And after 2,000
years, you'd be bigger than the Rosetta stone. And you're nothing
now, you know that.

I'm worried, when I think of you guys voting. I'm really serious.
You know, they seem to think here in America that voting in itself
is a positive virtue. In fact, I heard one spot by some friendly
lady who does a program here on WOR that seemed to say in spite of
the fact you don't know anything about it, and don't let that stop
you, get out and vote, and thereby you will nullify the vote of
somebody who does know something about it.

   One of the secret desires that all kids have is to be invisible
and to, you know, to sneak somehow, nobody would see you, see. And,
well, of course, not only kids want to do that. But this is a kid
thing, and this leads to all kinds of things. For example, there
used to be a thing advertised in the back of Popular Mechanics, and
also Boy's Life, when I was a kid, and it said See-Through X-Ray
Eyes. Ever seen that thing? It said see through bones, and it shows
a hand that says look through and see your very own bones. This
see-through X-ray eye device enables you to see through anything at
will. Send 10 cents to Johnson &AMP; Johnson. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And about three months later this thing came back, this little
round tube, you know. And it's got what looks like frosted glass or
something on the end of it, see. And the instructions came with it,
a little smudgy piece of paper that showed a kid, you know, looking
through this thing, holding his hand up, and you can see the bones.
And it says the see-through X-ray eye device is very simply worked.
It is worked by placing it to your eye, as shown in diagram A, and
then holding your hand up to the light, as shown by diagram B. Then
if the light is properly adjusted, one will see the bones through
the eyepiece marked C in diagram D. End of instructions.

   We left 47th Street. I rode on a bus with maybe 200,000 other
people all riding on buses towards Washington, D.C. And one of the
great things that happened was not, oh, not more than 15 or 20
minutes after we got on the road with the bus, other buses started
to pass us in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   We had a very old, terrible bus. And you know, I'll tell you,
have you ever ridden on a bus, a crosstown bus, all the way to
Washington? I'm serious. A lot of people did. The bus that was with
us was a crosstown bus. They just took the crosstown sign out and
everybody sat on those plastic seats and went all the way to
Washington and back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I had talked with guys who were planning to go and arranging
this thing. I had all kinds of ideas in my mind about the way it
would be, just like all of us have ideas in our head about what
history is. I'm sure you have ideas about how it must have been
like to be in Germany in the '20s. Well, it wasn't. Not the way you
think it was.

   I think Americans are the only people in the world today, I
really do, who really, literally, spend most of their time _
whether it's in politics, whether it's in satire, art, fiction, you
name it _ breast beating, baring its soul and proclaiming to the
heavens how rotten it is. And of course everybody around agrees.
You go to England, you go to France, they all agree loudly, 'cause
it lets them off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   They've been plugging all day long, on the air, that you should
get out and vote. Well . . . this is one guy who says there's a lot
of you who shouldn't. I've heard a lot of you discuss politics and
I'm worried, when I think of you guys voting. I'm really serious.
You know, they seem to think here in America that voting in itself
is a positive virtue. In fact, I heard one spot by some friendly
lady who does a program here on WOR that seemed to say in spite of
the fact you don't know anything about it, and don't let that stop
you, get out and vote, and thereby you will nullify the vote of
somebody who does know something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, I'm just merely saying voting itself, friends,
is not a virtue, and if you don't know anything about it, stay
away. You're liable to get us all in trouble.''

   One of the secret desires that all kids have is to be invisible
and to, you know, to sneak somehow, nobody would see you, see. And,
well, of course, not only kids want to do that. But this is a kid
thing, and this leads to all kinds of things. For example, there
used to be a thing advertised in the back of Popular Mechanics, and
also Boy's Life, when I was a kid, and it said See-Through X-Ray
Eyes. Ever seen that thing? It said see through bones, and it shows
a hand that says look through and see your very own bones. This
see-through X-ray eye device enables you to see through anything at
will. Send 10 cents to Johnson &AMP; Johnson. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And about three months later this thing came back, this little
round tube, you know. And it's got what looks like frosted glass or
something on the end of it, see. And the instructions came with it,
a little smudgy piece of paper that showed a kid, you know, looking
through this thing, holding his hand up, and you can see the bones.
And it says the see-through X-ray eye device is very simply worked.
It is worked by placing it to your eye, as shown in diagram A, and
then holding your hand up to the light, as shown by diagram B. Then
if the light is properly adjusted, one will see the bones through
the eyepiece marked C in diagram D. End of instructions.

   We had a very old, terrible bus. And you know, I'll tell you,
have you ever ridden on a bus, a crosstown bus, all the way to

PINOCHET'S REVENGE: OLIVER NORTH, YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine that the year is 2005 and that Oliver North, the retired
Marine lieutenant colonel and former National Security Council
staff member in the Reagan White House, is on trial in Lebanon. He
has been arrested while vacationing in Switzerland on an
international murder warrant issued by Lebanon. The charge is that
he helped direct the 1986 bombings of Libya that killed 31 people.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had long sought his arrest, but in the end it was a
Lebanese judge who obtained it, by joining the case and requesting
that the Swiss authorities detain North and then extradite him to
stand trial in Beirut on charges of crimes against humanity and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine further that North is then convicted and the headline in
one American newspaper roars: ``Military Aide to Reagan Convicted
of Murder for Official Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The events have not happened, of course, but international legal
experts say that in the wake of the near-extradition of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet of Chile to Spain, it is no longer so hard to
imagine a situation in which a former high U.S. official could be
arrested while traveling and then tried in any foreign country, for
crimes alleged to have been committed anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the notion, the likelihood that any nation would
be so brazen is another matter. Issuing an indictment as a
propaganda ploy is one thing; indeed, Libya already has one out on
North. But these days, following through on it could subject the
Libyans to far more than a writ of habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   That is because a law of force still operates in the world, and
it is not hard to imagine another set of headlines: ``U.S. Demands
Release of North; Economic Sanctions Threatened; Warships
Maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth considering what might happen to someone like
North when thinking about the recent rulings _ and precedents set _
in the Pinochet case by the British House of Lords. In 1998
Pinochet, in London for medical treatment, was arrested after a
judge in Spain issued an international warrant based on charges
related to his actions while he was the leader of Chile. The Lords
ruled that he was not immune from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   If the British home secretary, Jack Straw, had not freed
Pinochet earlier this year because of his deteriorating health, he
would have had to face trial in Spain on charges of torture and
political killings during his 17-year rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Widely praised by human rights organizations, the rulings have
more quietly raised some eyebrows among former U.S. officials who
now wonder whether they too could some day be extradited _ let us
say, if the United States lost its position as the world's sole
superpower _ and tried any time any judge in the world accuses them
of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, North said, ``It limits my travel to certain
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   It has some legal experts asking: Could Henry A. Kissinger be
put on trial overseas as an architect of policy during the Vietnam
War, which included bombings of Cambodian villages and intensive
bombings of Hanoi?
</P>
<P>
   What about President George Bush or his secretary of state,
James A. Baker III? Could they be held responsible for deaths tied
to economic sanctions related to the Persian Gulf war in Iraq? Or
what about President Clinton? After he leaves office, could he face
trial for the bombings of a factory in Sudan that was mistakenly
believed to be a chemical weapons plant?
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans have argued against the expansion
of international criminal courts, which they say could hamstring
U.S. leaders who fear being prosecuted after they leave office for
official acts they committed. The legal rulings in the Pinochet
case rejected an argument that the general was immune from
prosecution by virtue of his official status, and legal experts say
the case also expands the power to criminally prosecute certain
human rights violations _ that occur anywhere _ to the courts of
every nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is restricted the travel opportunities for
people like Henry Kissinger, Wesley Clark and Bill Clinton,'' said
Michael Byers, a professor of international law at Duke University.
``We have reduced their options in traveling to rogue states and
their allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vieteretti, the managing director of Kroll Associates,
the New York-based international security firm that provides
personal protection, said his company is now much more concerned
``with a country's laws, its alliances and anything our clients may
have done to anger those nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some former U.S. officials said the FBI has warned
them not to travel to some countries, including some in Europe,
where there is a risk of extradition to other nations interested in
prosecuting them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Byers says that former U.S. officials do not need to
worry ``unless they are foolish enough to travel to some place like
Iraq.'' Experts say that the reason is simple. If, as the saying
goes, to the victor go the spoils, so too with history: the
triumphant get to tell the story of what happened and to name the
heroes, the pardonably mistaken and the villains when the conflict
has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political reality is that it is very remote,'' said
Jonathan Charney, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and the
editor of the American Journal of International Law. ``Why? Because
we are the superpower. It would be dangerous for another country to
do that economically, politically and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kissinger said he believed that the
``very complicated'' issues surrounding the Pinochet rulings needed
further study. But he added that he was not concerned. ``I don't
think the well-known people are as much in danger,'' he said. ``I
certainly don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   But North said that all it would take would be the slightest
change in the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was supported by the British when he was their ally in
the war against Argentina over the Falkland Islands. ``Here is this
person who aided and abetted their cause, helped bring about
democracy,'' North said. ``And now because of this political sea
change in Great Britain, now the country is going to turn him over
to a third-party country to have him prosecuted. That's
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Derian, the first assistant secretary of state for
human rights, said she could foresee the day when U.S. officials
would be prosecuted for acts similar to those that might be
attributed to Baker, North or Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a stretch right now with the current rules of war and
diplomacy, but I think it is going to come,'' said Derian. ``It
would be interesting to see what would happen if Kissinger went to
Cambodia, or they just put out an international warrant for his
arrest.''

   WASHINGTON _ As the cherry blossoms shimmered in the sun on
Friday, the capital was in a black tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a bad dream _ more vanishing Clinton White House
records, more congressional and Justice Department investigations
and, worst of all, more Dan Burton.

<P>
   The bargain-basement Torquemada of the House Republicans was
once more truffle-hunting for White House turpitude, vowing that he
would not rest until he discovered whether the abuse of power that
now confronts us is ``a glitch or an intentional glitch.''

<P>
   He is having hearings on why the White House couldn't find a
huge number of e-mails _ on subjects likely to include the '96
campaign finance scandal and Monica Lewinsky _ thousands to and
from the vice president's office.
</P>
<P>
   W. gleefully demanded to know why the Inventor of the Internet
was lost in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late last night, something incredible happened. A basket
of e-mail printouts was found on Janet Reno's doorstep. (The FBI is
checking reports that a man, about 6'1'', with a stiff gait and
wearing earth tones, was seen skulking away.) The basket was a
treasure trove, vouchsafing the attorney general a peek at the vice
president's hard drive:

Disappointed. Disappointed. Disappointed.

COMMENTARY: DEFICIT ATTENTION DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A long time ago, in an economic universe far, far away, people
cared about the trade balance. When the U.S. trade deficit passed
$100 billion for the first time, there was much wailing and
gnashing of teeth. Doomsayers warned of an imminent ``hard
landing'' in which a crashing dollar would precipitate economic
crisis. Even calmer types regarded the unprecedented red ink as a
warning sign.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the 21st century:
People lost interest in the trade balance. In January, the Commerce
Department announced last week, the United States set a new world
record: the biggest monthly trade deficit ever. (Is this a great
country, or what?) Measured as a share of GDP, last year's current
account deficit (the broadest measure of the trade gap) was wider
than ever before. But the markets couldn't have cared less. They
were more interested in the accounts of MicroStrategy (a
high-flying tech stock that lost two-thirds of its value in one day
when it adopted a new accounting standard) than in those of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways this lack of interest is a good thing. Obsession
with trade balances has historically been a source of bad economic
policies. It's probably for the best that state governments don't
know whether their trade with other states is in surplus or
deficit; their ignorance keeps them out of mischief. And not paying
attention is almost as good as not knowing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps we shouldn't be quite so indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment the U.S. trade deficit is good, not bad, for our
economy. It doesn't cost us jobs because we already have more than
enough domestic demand. We aren't having any trouble paying for
imports: The inflow of money from investors eager to buy into our
miracle economy has easily matched the outflow to pay not only for
all those Lexuses and BMW's, but for the suddenly more expensive
oil they burn too. And this inflow of capital helps keep stocks
high and interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, by any other measure the United States is performing
superlatively compared with every other major economy. We have the
highest growth, the lowest unemployment, the biggest budget
surplus. To focus on the trade deficit, you might argue, would be
like short-selling a rapidly growing company because it doesn't pay
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But just as even the newest of new economy companies must
eventually justify its existence by returning money to investors,
even the most successful economy must sooner or later export enough
to pay for its imports. Our current position, where we pay for many
of our imports by attracting inflows of capital _ in effect by
selling the rest of the world claims on our future exports _ cannot
go on forever. And as the late economist Herbert Stein declared,
``If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario is that the trade deficit will
eventually be reined in by a decline in the foreign-exchange value
of the dollar. The great dollar slide of 1985-87, precipitated by a
trade deficit that was actually smaller compared with GDP than the
deficit today, reduced the value of a dollar by 40 percent in terms
of German marks and Japanese yen. And there is no obvious reason
why the same thing can't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But if that is the way it will play out, at least some of the
money we are now pulling in is being brought in under false
pretenses. Right now foreign investors are willing to hold 10-year
U.S. government bonds, even though they pay only a slightly higher
interest rate than their European counterparts. Those investors
seem to believe, in other words, that today's strong dollar will
persist for another 10 years. But the size of our trade deficit
makes that unlikely. So foreign investors, and therefore the value
of the dollar, are arguably doing a Wile E. Coyote _ one of these
days they will look down, realize that they have already walked
over the edge of the cliff, and plunge. And when they do it will
come as a rude shock not only to them, but also to American
financial markets that have become accustomed to big inflows of
foreign money.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, you see, is that in economics, as in life, what you
don't pay attention to  &UR; can &LR;  hurt you.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN 'BAY-BEE' RUTH TOURED JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after Babe Ruth had settled into the Imperial Hotel in
Tokyo, there was a knock on the door. He opened it to see a
Japanese man in a kimono.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sign baseball?'' the man asked.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the Babe autographed that baseball, the man
pulled another out of his kimono. Then another. And another. And
another. By now the Babe's wife, Claire, and his 18-year-old
adopted daughter, Julia, were laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man must have had two dozen baseballs in the sleeves of
his kimono,'' Julia Ruth Stevens remembered. ``Daddy signed them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how many other baseballs the Babe signed on that
exhibition tour of Japan after the 1934 season with 13 other major
leaguers, including five other eventual Hall of Famers: Lou Gehrig,
Lefty Gomez, Jimmie Foxx, Charlie Gehringer and Earl Averill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved Daddy over there,'' Stevens was saying now from her
Sun City, Ariz., home. ``When we rode in open cars from the Tokyo
train station to the hotel, the Japanese people were waving little
American flags and yelling, `I love Bay-bee. I love Bay-bee.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese were expected to be chanting, ``Let's go, Mets''
when the folk heroes of Flushing arrived in Tokyo Saturday for
games Wednesday and Thursday with the Chicago Cubs that open the
National League season _ whether today's Babe Ruth, Mark McGwire,
likes it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese promoters had asked that the Cardinals and the Cubs
play two games there, hoping that McGwire and Sammy Sosa would slug
several home runs. Just as the Babe blasted 13 homers and batted
.408 while playing all 17 games on that 1934 tour.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals backed out last year when McGwire objected to
the long turnaround flights across the Pacific, and he's still
objecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're telling me that we're going to fly two teams over 16
hours to play two games,'' McGwire said the other day. ``There's no
purpose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire doesn't understand that there is a purpose: to globalize
the game, something Major League Baseball has been lax in doing.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Japanese, who have produced such major league pitchers
as Hideo Nomo, Hideki Irabu and Masato Yoshii, see what real
big-league games are like, games that count in the standings _ not
just a bunch of big-league all-stars against various Japanese teams
in a series of exhibition games that don't count.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese will appreciate the difference. Baseball was
introduced in their country in 1867 by an American missionary. On
an around-the-world tour in 1913, two teams featuring mostly New
York Giants and Chicago White Sox stopped in Tokyo for two games.
Over the years there have been nearly three dozen visits by big
leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 Connie Mack, the Philadelphia Athletics' owner-manager,
assembled an all-star team featuring the Babe that sailed from
Vancouver, British Columbia, on the Empress of Japan. And the
presence of the 39-year-old Bambino, who had played his last game
as a Yankee, served the purpose that McGwire doesn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some games attracted 50,000 to 60,000 people,'' Stevens said.
``Every time Daddy came to bat in those old open stadiums, the
people would stand and wave their American and Japanese flags.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, seven years before Pearl Harbor, some Japanese
resented the United States politically, but they cherished the big,
beefy Bay-bee who had hit 708 homers, including 22 for the Yankees
that season; he would hit 6 more with the Boston Braves before
retiring early in the 1935 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to one luncheon after another, one dinner after
another,'' his daughter said. ``Daddy didn't like the sushi, but he
loved the teriyaki _ beef, chicken, pork, lobster.''
</P>
<P>
   After the games in Japan, the Babe's team played in Shanghai and
Manila. Most of the all-stars then returned to the United States,
but the Babe, along with his wife and daughter, and his Yankee
teammate Lefty Gomez, kept traveling westward around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sailed from Manila to Singapore, Bali, Java,'' Stevens
said. ``Then across the Indian Ocean and through the Suez Canal to
the Mediterranean and Marseille, then to Paris by train, to London
and home on the S.S. Manhattan to New York. We were away four
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Tokyo and Paris in those years before worldwide
television, not many people recognized the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't well-known in that part of the world then and he was
a little taken aback by that,'' his daughter said. ``He's much
better known there now. My son, Thomas, a civil engineer, is just
back from Thailand and he told me he saw Daddy's picture there. In
sports bars.''
</P>
<P>
   And surely there are photos of the Cubs and the Mets adorning
the walls of the Tokyo sports bars now, but Sammy Sosa and Mike
Piazza should be forewarned: if a man wearing a kimono offers a
baseball to be signed, he may have another two dozen up his sleeve.

PLAYERS' OFF-FIELD VIOLENCE AN ISSUE FOR NFL AND UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the topic of off-field violence was raised during the
recent National Football League union meetings, it sparked a heated
debate that lasted hours. Eventually one player was able to shout
above the chaos, making a simple statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``One violent act _ you're gone,'' he said, ``that should be the
NFL's new motto.''
</P>
<P>
   The passionate arguments led to an unusual proposal. Currently,
if a player is convicted of a violent crime, he is subject to fines
and suspensions by the league. But there were a number of players
who wanted to go beyond that and proposed that the union add
additional fines and suspensions on top of any imposed by the
league. Thus, players convicted of committing violent crimes would
be punished twice, once by the NFL, a second time by the union.
After much debate, the resolution was voted down.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate shows how the NFL is considering how to deal with
off-field violence, an issue that came to the forefront after Ray
Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens and Rae Carruth of the Carolina
Panthers were both charged with murder within a four-month span.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees we have to do something,'' Gene Upshaw, the
executive director of the players association, said. ``What we
can't seem to agree on is what.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will be introducing several
initiatives, and the topic is expected to be discussed at the
owners' meetings that begin Sunday in Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's ideas _ which range from sterner punishment to
bringing in military leaders as advisers _ are sure to be debated,
even criticized, by the owners and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do not know if there is anything the league office can
truly do to help with this problem,'' the Ravens' owner, Art
Modell, said.
</P>
<P>
   The point man for Tagliabue, Harold Henderson, the NFL's
executive vice president, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the policies we have in place now are excellent,''
Henderson said, ``but we can always improve upon and better what we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent series of high-profile crimes has led to nationwide
criticism of the league and made it the butt of late-night comics'
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem has continued in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the police arrested Solomon Page, the Dallas
Cowboys' guard, on a charge of disorderly conduct and resisting
arrest after they said he was involved in a fight outside a bar in
Morgantown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mario Bates, the Arizona Cardinals' running
back, was arrested on charges of slapping his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8, the Miami Dolphins kicked running back Cecil Collins
off the team after a woman accused him of breaking into her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, Panthers running back Fred Lane was arrested in
Tennessee on drugs and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Indianapolis Colts' defensive back Steve
Muhammad was charged with beating his pregnant wife, who died days
later of labor complications.
</P>
<P>
   Before last season began, three players were involved in a bar
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The most highly publicized incidents were the two murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 14, Carruth was charged with murder after his pregnant
girlfriend, Cherica Adams, died of wounds from a Nov. 16 shooting
that Carruth is accused of masterminding and two friends with
criminal records are accused of carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, Lewis and two friends _ both with criminal records _
were indicted for murder after two men were stabbed to death
outside an Atlanta nightclub hours after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue first took on the issue when his violent-crime policy
was initiated in 1997. While the policy was hailed as proactive,
punishment often resulted only in counseling or fines. Recently,
Tagliabue has gotten tougher, suspending three players for the
first time in the policy's three-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Denard Walker was suspended for two games next
season after pleading guilty to assault on the mother of his son.
Two other players, offensive linemen Matt O'Dwyer of the Cincinnati
Bengals and Jumbo Elliott of the Jets, were suspended for two games
for their roles in a fight in a Long Island bar. Elliott has filed
an appeal. Tagliabue fined the Jets lineman Jason Fabini $14,000
for his role.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Tagliabue seems to be taking a harder stance, executives
close to him maintain he wants to do more. Tagliabue has sought
suggestions from high-profile players such as Michael Strahan of
the Giants, Cris Carter and Robert Smith of the Minnesota Vikings,
Tony Gonzalez of the Kansas City Chiefs and Robert Porcher of the
Detroit Lions. The commissioner has also spoken extensively with
Upshaw and established an in-house panel to come up with a plan.
The result has been more than a dozen proposals, including:
</P>
<P>
   _Establishing a waiting period before players that were arrested
for violent crimes in college could play in the league. The
specifics of this are not known, but a player with a history of
violence might be forced to endure a probationary period of a year
or longer before being allowed to enter the draft.
</P>
<P>
   _Standardizing the interview process of college prospects at the
Indianapolis Combine. Teams use interviews as one way of finding
out about a player's personal history. Some teams are better at
mining information than others, and anything deemed significant is
rarely shared. The NFL is considering having a standard interview
and making it mandatory that teams share all information.
</P>
<P>
   _Increasing the presence of team security officials in the
locker room and informing players if they have made bad choices of
friends or hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   _Requiring all teams to hire coordinators who would be
responsible for addressing all off-field matters and keeping
players informed about places that they should steer clear of.
Currently some teams, like the Jets, have full-time people filling
these positions. Other teams do not.
</P>
<P>
   _Creating an escrow fine system in which a small percentage of
each player's paycheck would periodically be put aside until he
leaves the game. If he stayed out of trouble, the player would then
get the money back.
</P>
<P>
   _Extending and enlarging a pilot program in which professional
players speak to college players about staying away from ills like
drugs, gambling and violence. The program, the NFL believes, has
dual benefits. College players who may later play professionally
are already hearing the right message, and professional players,
playing the role of mentor, are more likely to remain out of
trouble themselves.
</P>
<P>
   _Asking military leaders to speak to head coaches. ``The
military is adept at incorporating people from disadvantaged
backgrounds into an environment,'' Henderson said. ``They may be
able to teach us a few things about how to better do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _Starting a news media campaign that emphasizes the positive
deeds players do in the community, and encourage wives and
girlfriends to participate more in the various programs designed to
help players stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One recent union survey of the league's 1,600 players showed
that 90 percent could identify at least one at-risk teammate. That
is one reason why Tagliabue is considering the formation of team
committees. The idea is to compose a small group that would consist
of several players, security officials, and the club coordinator,
which would function as a an advisory board if an at-risk player is
identified. Then if a player starts exhibiting questionable
behavior, the board would address the player.
</P>
<P>
   This idea addresses what is being called in N.F.L. circles the
``entourage problem.'' Some players believe if Lewis had chosen his
friends more wisely, he would not be in trouble now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to surround yourself with people who want to
accomplish what you're looking to do,'' Jamal Anderson, the Atlanta
Falcons' running back, said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more important changes could be strengthening the
violent-crime policy. Currently, a player who is arrested for
committing a violent act receives mandatory counseling and a
subsequent conviction or guilty plea would result in a possible
suspension and fine.
</P>
<P>
   The league is acknowledging that some players who may be guilty
of a crime slip through the cracks _ maybe a judge looks the other
way or a player is able to use his celebrity to get out of an
arrest. Tagliabue is considering suspending a player who may not
have been legally found guilty, but the league, through its
investigation, discovers the player may have committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing such a rule would be difficult because it could
violate a player's civil rights. But these are the kinds of drastic
moves the league is beginning to think might be necessary to curb
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said: ``Paul is going to tell the owners: `We need to
take serious steps. You need to be involved. Character is as
important as talent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners may already be getting that message. The Denver
Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, said the recent trade of the talented
young pass rusher David Bowens to Green Bay and the release of
starting strong safety Darius Johnson were due to character issues.
Bowlen declined to specify what the issues were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have a good, solid player who is a good person than
a superstar who is a bad person,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: OF STICKS, SLASHES AND THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Worrell of the Florida Panthers sure shook up the National
Hockey League last week, when he failed to do what one normally
does when zonked on the head with a hockey stick. As opposed to
crumpling to the ice, semi-conscious, oozing blood, he remained
upright, alert and enraged.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell responded to being attacked by the Devils' Scott
Niedermayer with the infamous throat slash gesture _ not once,
twice, but three times. This infuriated the Devils and seemed to
set off some kind of demographics alarm, as if the NHL had for a
few mortal moments wandered into a neighborhood it did not wish to
be in. It did not punish Worrell, but was quick to make clear that
such imagery had no place and would not be tolerated in a clean,
wholesome sport like hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him get sticked across the head and see how he reacts,''
Worrell said of Niedermayer.
</P>
<P>
   Not to condone the slash as a matter of practice and principle,
but Worrell had a point. Had he really been out of control, he
might have just started whacking back.
</P>
<P>
   When Worrell, a French Canadian who is black (as was Marty
McSorley's Feb. 21st victim, Donald Brashear), responded after the
ensuing brawl by borrowing from the so-called culture of disrespect
that is more commonly ascribed to the African-American athlete, it
was as if a window opened and we had a clear look into the
dichotomy that exists in the sporting court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guy gets cracked across the helmet with a stick, three New
Jersey guys jump on him and he's the guy the officials grab,'' said
Bryan Murray, the Panthers' general manager. ``The slash on the
throat is not acceptable but everyone's focused on Worrell's
gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the truth if not the whole truth. Niedermayer was
promptly and correctly suspended by the NHL for 10 games. Yet once
again, a barbaric and criminal assault (according to the
authorities in Vancouver, in the McSorley case) was treated by
hockey advocates and the general public as an isolated act of
extremist behavior, an unfortunate crossing of the line, outside
the bounds of acceptable violence.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when Latrell Sprewell committed his indefensible
attack on P.J. Carlesimo, he became the great American pariah, the
human metaphor for an entire sport gone sour. His past was
dissected. His scowling visage was plastered everywhere but the
post office. He was the uncontrollable product of Generation X, of
black rage, a threat to our very athletic culture.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's ongoing violence, though legislatively reduced in the
past few years, is still tolerated as a culture all its own and
therefore exempt from the standards loosely applied elsewhere.
Players employed strictly as brawlers, whose very existence in
sports dominated by blacks would be the cause of national
convulsion, have been more than tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I asked a major executive who has had access to
both sports why hockey players have by and large been left alone in
their own violent vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting, dropping the gloves, has always been part of that
game,'' he said. ``Maybe we've just become conditioned to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And more. In the way the country celebrates its professional
wrestlers and make-believe mobsters, hockey goons have been
immortalized in film (``Slap Shot''), and have even been commended
by no less a mainstream authority than Sports Illustrated two years
ago for being ``a surprisingly honest and amiable bunch'' and for
abiding by the ``unwritten code of the NHL tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, that they are part of a white, violent culture
of respect.
</P>
<P>
   How the hate mail flowed when I wrote that exact phrase two
years ago, after taking my sons to Madison Square Garden for a
Rangers-Devils game. The older one, after weeks of paying close
attention to the Sprewell condemnations, had the good sense to ask
why in the world all the adults in the business suits were standing
and cheering as soon as the gloves were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those same people who can't wait to see a good hockey
fight would tell you they can't watch professional basketball
because of all the posturing and trash talking. Hockey, you hear,
is a fast, physical game, as if one played above the rim by huge,
superbly conditioned athletes is not.
</P>
<P>
   So if I explained that the NHL has preferred to keep a
manageable level of violence as it expanded to the American
sunbelt, it still begged the question of why people who condemn
every violent act or image in one sport will embrace it in another.
Why in hockey, the throat slash would be considered a graver
marketing threat than the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   It is pretty obvious why.
</P>

<P>
   Not since the 1970s, when grape workers and the anti-apartheid
movement were holy causes for millions of Americans, have so many
groups embraced the boycott as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In the most prominent boycott in years, the NAACP has called on
tourists and conventions to shun South Carolina to pressure that
state to remove the Confederate flag atop its Capitol. Also facing
an NAACP boycott, the Adam's Mark luxury hotel chain agreed last
week to pay $8 million, seek minority customers and give its
employees diversity training to get the boycott dropped and to
settle race discrimination lawsuits brought by some offended black
guests and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups have proposed a boycott of Paramount over a planned
television show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who has called
homosexuals ``biological errors'' and ``sexual deviants.'' Groups
seeking to restore democracy to Burma are sponsoring boycotts
against Best Western, Unocal, Suzuki and other companies that do
business there. Among the companies that labor unions are
boycotting is Kaiser Aluminum, which locked out 2,900 unionized
workers 14 months ago. And the Southern Baptist Convention is
pressing a boycott against Walt Disney Co., charging that it is too
sympathetic to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts,'' said Jeff
Faux, executive director of the Economic Policy Institute, a
research group in Washington. ``We have more of a consumer culture,
and people see themselves more as consumers today. While people are
participating less in the political process, as consumers they see
that one way they can exercise power is by where they spend their
money and where they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott takes its name from an economic war waged by Irish
farmers in the 1880s against an English land agent, Charles
Cunningham Boycott, who refused demands to cut rents during a time
of poor crops. Their subsequent refusal to work his land or sell
him goods forced him to return to England.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1880s American farmers were already shunning
railroads charging exorbitant rates. In 1885 alone, American labor
unions carried out 196 official boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   One boycott that made a profound impression on 20th-century
America was the Montgomery bus boycott, which came after Rosa Parks
famously refused to sit in the back of the bus in 1955 because she
was black. Since then, civil rights activists have repeatedly
embraced boycotts. Two months ago, the television networks agreed
to increase minority hiring after the NAACP threatened a boycott,
charging that few shows featured minority actors.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes boycotts, which require organization and consumer
awareness, fail. Most Americans do not realize that the United Farm
Workers' 1984 grape boycott remains in force. Begun when growers
refused to sign new union contracts, it has largely failed because
the union stopped promoting it when it failed to catch on. Union
officials say it remains in effect because lifting the boycott
would give a victory to the grape growers. In sharp contrast, the
original boycott called by Cesar Chavez in 1967 persuaded millions
of Americans to give up grapes and pressured California growers to
recognize unionized workers and raise wages.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts can hurt the very people they intend to help. When
anti-sweatshop groups threatened a boycott against apparel from
Bangladesh in the mid-1990s because many factories employed child
labor, the factories simply fired the children, pushing some into
begging and prostitution. Anti-sweatshop groups now generally
oppose boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's president, Kweisi Mfume, said his group never rushes
into boycotts. ``This is a trigger you don't want to pull until all
else has failed,'' he said. ``In the case of South Carolina, after
38 years of negotiating even the NAACP has a limit to its
patience.'' As a result, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce
says, more than 100 conventions and other events have been canceled
in the state, which has lost at least $18 million in tourist
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Hunter Jr., the chamber's president, said, the
boycott might backfire because it has caused some lawmakers to dig
in. ``One group of legislators,'' he said, ``has used the boycott
very effectively for not taking action, saying, `We're being
blackmailed. If we succumb this time, what are they going to ask
for next?''' The business community, Hunter said, has been working
to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for less controversial tools than a boycott to pressure
Paramount to drop its ``Dr. Laura'' plans, gay groups have deluged
the corporation with calls and e-mail. ``Paramount would never host
a talk show where someone said such nasty things about blacks or
Jews,'' said John Aravosis, who has organized the stopdrlaura.com
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Companies react to boycotts with either compliance or defiance.
After several groups boycotted Pepsi over its Burma ties, the
company stopped doing business there. ``When customers and
consumers contact us, we definitely listen,'' said David De Cecco,
a Pepsi spokesman, who added that the company's action was
consistent with American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Unocal has reacted differently to a boycott over its
investment in a natural gas consortium in Burma. ``We sympathize
with the boycott's goals,'' said Michael Thatcher, a Unocal
spokesman. ``We want to see democracy and economic improvement in
Myanmar. We feel that the way we're doing it is much more likely to
bear positive results than their way, which is to pull out and
isolate the country.''
</P>
<P>
   During the South Africa boycott, the apartheid regime made
similar arguments, saying sanctions were hurting the nation's
blacks in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Desmond Tutu rejected those arguments, saying,
``You get all sorts of people saying all sorts of things about
sanctions: That they will hurt the people you are trying to help.
Twiddle! It's baloney of the first order! Because you are speaking
about people already suffering, and you are saying you are trying
to find some way that is a nonviolent strategy for bringing about
the change that everybody says they want.''

   If Microsoft Corp.'s e-mail storage system had been as flawed as
the one at the White House, the software company might have been
spared many of the more painful moments in its continuing antitrust
battle with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of electronic messages that were supposed to
have been saved on White House computers may not prove any less
embarrassing for the Clinton administration than the vast e-mail
archive behind the government's antitrust case was to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Court filings disclosed last week that the Justice Department
has opened a criminal investigation into whether White House
officials suppressed e-mail messages subpoenaed in investigations
of the administration. Because of a glitch in the White House
electronic mail system, thousands of messages were not saved in a
way in which they could be conveniently searched to comply with
subpoenas dealing with campaign fund raising, Monica Lewinsky and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether White House officials who knew of the glitch
understood its implications and tried to cover it up. But whether
or not they did, and whether or not any of the missing mail is
relevant to the subpoenas, the investigation underscores the value
placed on e-mail as a particularly revealing window on the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And as it unravels, the case may once again highlight the
persistent assumption among e-mail users _ despite overwhelming
evidence to the contrary _ that their electronic correspondence is
private. (It may also highlight the misconception that historians
no longer have paper trails to follow.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Lt. Col. Oliver North unwittingly proved that
e-mail, so apparently ephemeral, is harder to expunge than paper
documents comfortingly run through a shredder. North thought he had
deleted electronic messages regarding his assistance in providing
arms to Nicaraguan rebels, but it turned out that he had neglected
to eliminate the back-up copies.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, a wave of court cases based on e-mail has mounted.
In the Microsoft trial, the credibility of company's chairman, Bill
Gates, was undermined when he flatly denied in his deposition what
he had previously written in electronic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Microsoft trial, many companies issued strict
policies governing employees' use of e-mail. Yet people continue to
send such messages that they would never commit to a written
document _ and save them. Henry H. Perritt Jr., dean of the Chicago
Kent College of Law, said, ``What the Microsoft case showed is that
people need to think about e-mail as a form of writing, as opposed
to a telephone call or a face-to-face conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   So why don't they?
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the seductive quality of computer
communication, which encourages the belief that words are
disappearing into the ether. ``In a public situation, you are
clearly aware of people listening,'' said Sara Kiesler, a professor
of human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. ``But
on a computer you have to monitor yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the apparently intractable human tendency to blab
electronically, several companies are proposing to fight technology
with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail, whose software handles most of the world's electronic
mail traffic, is working with others on a standard that would
enable senders to control whether their e-mail can be forwarded by
the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, appropriately named Disappearing Inc., is
developing an encryption system that would enable senders to set a
date when their such mail would no longer be readable.
</P>
<P>
   But there is concern that such features could also dampen
enthusiasm for a medium whose speed and simplicity has made it a
hugely popular form of communication. ``A hard problem is how to do
this in a way that doesn't take away from the trillion messages
that are being sent each day,'' said Greg Olson, president of
Sendmail. ``This is a very delicate evolution.''

   Cinema is a powerful medium that often serves as a giant mood
ring for the body politic, especially those films that earn Oscars.
``The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946) captured the bittersweet
hopefulness of post-war America. ``Mary Poppins'' (1964) was a
timely diversion for a nation smarting from the conflict over civil
rights. And didn't the country emerge from the contentious
Watergate era with a little ``Rocky'' (1976) in its soul?
</P>
<P>
   This year's Academy Award nominations include a melange of
comedies, dramas and absurd flights of fancy that once again speak
to the national psyche. Judging from the contents of these films,
the country appears to be a mess. As the winners strut to the
podium Sunday night, here's what that little man of gold might be
saying about America:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS LIVE FOR HEAD GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen Oscar nominations went to movies that demonstrate the
national obsession with nuts. ``The Sixth Sense'' puts forward the
notion that being dead is all in the head. ``The Matrix'' proposes
that the human mind is just a mainframe, and almost as complicated
as Windows 2000. ``Being John Malkovich'' says that the antidote to
empty-headedness is day-tripping in someone else's skull _
preferably a movie star's. Then again, ``The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow'' recommends the best no-frills remedy for being in a bad
head: decapitation.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S NO FAMILY LIKE A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
honored movies about tightly knit clans _ from the Von Trapps to
the Corleones _ by bestowing on them enough Oscar gold to gild the
Shrine Auditorium. This year, no less than 12 nominations have gone
to films about fractured families, either drowning in ennui
(``American Beauty''), wandering aimlessly (``Tumbleweeds'') or
desperately administering to unraveling family ties (``Magnolia'').
It was the kind of year that made the household friction in
``Ordinary People'' (1980) seem like a day at the Cleavers.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE IS LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   Of this year's nominees, only one movie, ``The End of the
Affair,'' is a bona fide love story, and an illicit one at that.
However, two of the five live-action shorts tell the tales of first
kisses and unrestrained ardor. The lesson this teaches is simple:
Passion and romance are fine _ just keep it short, OK?
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IN DOUBT, LIE
</P>
<P>
   As much as it is said that truth and justice are the American
way, this year's Oscar contenders confirm just the opposite _ that
the country is fascinated by secrets and lies. Fourteen Academy
Award nominations went to films that flaunt duplicity, whether
corporate (``The Insider''), sexual (``Boys Don't Cry'') or
political (``Election''). Matt Damon, meanwhile, embodies all that
is fraudulent about humanity in the nerve-racking thriller ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley.'' But he looks great, doesn't he?
</P>
<P>
   HEROISM IS DEAD
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the academy has exalted heroes _ from Mr. Smith to
Norma Rae to Babe the Pig. But this year, Oscar was hard-pressed to
come up with any character worth canonizing. Indeed, the only
candidates that come close to qualifying as role models include an
ape man (``Tarzan''), a plastic cowboy (``Toy Story 2''), a talking
mouse (``Stuart Little'') and a Cuban fisherman in the animated
short version of Hemingway's ``Old Man and the Sea.'' Whether the
furry-chested Austin Powers deserves to be added to the list is
your call.
</P>
<P>
   THE SLAMMER IS THE PLACE TO BE
</P>
<P>
   While two Oscar-nominated films feature leading characters who
set out to see the world _ either on a whim (``The Cider House
Rules'') or on a tractor (``The Straight Story'') _ twice as many
movies take place in a penitentiary (``The Green Mile,'' ``The
Hurricane,'' ``Life'' and the documentary ``The Wildest Show in the
South: The Angola Prison Rodeo''). Is this such a bad thing? Not
really _ but as any kid or studio marketing manager knows, prison
flicks produce some pretty lousy action toys.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS BEHAVIOR ISN'T REALLY AMERICA'S
STRONG SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this has been the nation's least attractive quality in
recent years. But that shouldn't bother anyone. In fact, if ever
Americans are feeling overwhelmed by the way their bad manners
appear to the rest of the world, they can comfortably heed the
advice of the Academy Award-nominated song from the ``South Park''
movie: ``Blame Canada.''

<P>
   For more than three decades, gun-control advocates have pressed
lawmakers for stiffer measures, but the gun lobby ensured that they
got nowhere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then about two years ago, two dozen cities and counties
nationwide began suing gun producers to recover the costs of
treating gun shot victims.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Faced with the lawsuits and the costs of litigating
them, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest firearms maker, recently
agreed to make changes in the way it makes and markets handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, cigarette makers had long frustrated public health
activists who sought national legislation aimed at restricting how
tobacco is sold, especially to children. Congress proved unwilling
to buck the tremendous lobbying power of the industry, and nothing
happened. But four years after state attorneys general nationwide
and wealthy plaintiffs' lawyers joined forces to sue the tobacco
companies, the companies reversed field and sued for peace.
</P>
<P>
   These two cases are emblematic of a shift taking place in how
Americans attempt to govern their own society. Over the last few
years, the legal system has begun to overtake the legislative
process as the vehicle to resolve contentious debates, particularly
over unpopular products, when Congress is unwilling to act. Both
the tobacco and firearms litigation, for example, were highly
organized assaults on specific industries.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, lawsuits had been brought by individuals against
both industries with little financial success or effect on company
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always cases out there, and they were going
nowhere,'' said Susan Koniak, a law professor at Boston University.
``But the law is moving the way it is because of the huge
consolidation of cases that are taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of concentrated legal firepower to set social policy has
stirred sharp debate. Some legal experts have decried such lawsuits
as abusive. Others view them as a problematic but necessary
counterbalance to the powerful control that companies and interest
groups can exert over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schuck, a law professor at Yale University, said that in
assessing whether to go to court or settle, ``a lot of time a
company has to make a judgment regardless of whether it thinks it
is right on the law.'' But in the case of Smith &AMP; Wesson, which
Schuck doubts would have lost a court case, legal right or wrong
was not the relevant calculation. The problem for the company was
simply that it didn't have the money to roll the dice. And that was
a reality its lobbyists were powerless to change.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as fundamentally unfair. Walter Olson, a senior
fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group,
described the type of lawsuits brought against cigarette companies
and gun makers as ``end runs'' around the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what litigation is supposed to be,'' said Olson.
``It gathers too much power in the legal system to litigate
everything we used to vote over.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree, calling the new legal activism an important
counterweight to the power and resources of corporations. ``We have
a political system that is shaped in a significant fashion by
powerful interest groups that spend their resources,'' said Deborah
Hensler, a law professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   She added that private litigation, because of the resources
wielded by wealthy plaintiffs' lawyers, now represents another
arena where political power resides.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the courts have long been used to shape social
policy. In the 1960s and 1970s, so-called impact litigation was
brought by civil rights groups and other activists to bring about
changes in public policies that legislatures were unwilling to
effect, like reforms in prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And major litigation against products like asbestos, breast
implants and defective birth-control devices like the Dalkon Shield
also traces back decades. In many of those cases, too,
manufacturers withdrew products from the marketplace even though
regulators had not ordered such actions.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest wave of litigation is fundamentally different,
legal experts said. First, its purpose was to change how cigarettes
and guns are sold, and thus consumed, rather than to eliminate
their use. Legal action, initiated largely by private individuals,
was being used as a tool of social engineering. But these suits
also mark a growing alliance between state and city officials on
one hand and private plaintiffs on the other.
</P>
<P>
   That merger confers on the lawyers political credibility and
quasi-public authority, while endowing the states and cities
frustrated by logjams at the federal level with the entrepreneurial
energies of the legal marketplace. The result is a two-track system
where issues stuck in Congress can now jump off that track into the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Hensler, the Stanford University professor, said she believed
that the development was a mixed blessing. While it does provide
for an increased form of legal activism, the private lawyers who
may end up steering such actions are not answerable to the public
they supposedly represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to ask the question, `Are these the right people to be
leading the charge on the private side,''' she said. ``In the end,
I do get to vote on my congressman, but I don't have any direct
power on the deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the recent wave of large-scale litigation to end.
Recently, for instance, some of the lawyers involved in state cases
against the tobacco industry filed lawsuits against health
maintenance organizations for failing to disclose that they gave
financial incentives to doctors who restricted medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jack Weinstein of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn has
overseen much of the recent wave of product litigation, including
major cases involving firearms and tobacco. Known as a judicial
activist, Weinstein said that he believed the courts would always
probably play a pivotal role in resolving social problems. ``We are
going to have government that takes responsibility or have the
private bar back them up where they are not doing a good job,''
Weinstein said.

   A New Culture War on Campus
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times at Eastern Connecticut State University.
One misstep, one infraction, one drunken dorm party, and a student
can find himself on a bus to Hartford for an evening of Aida or
Carmen or who-knows-what kind of caterwauling.
</P>
<P>
   Opera as punishment was the idea of Kirk Peters, the associate
dean of student affairs, who, himself an opera fan, tried to give
away 15 opera tickets last fall. He plastered posters all over the
campus in Willamantic, but got no takers. ``I couldn't get people
to go, and it was a freebie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during a disciplinary session with 10 freshmen men, he
came up with his diabolically brilliant plan. The 10 had hopped a
fence around a football field during a rainstorm and tore up the
field playing baseball. The standard punishment would have been 10
hours of community service, but he offered to cut off five hours if
they would go to the opera with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eight agreed, and off they went, not only to the opera but to
the pre-opera workshop. The reviews, predictably, were mixed. ``Two
of them absolutely loved it,'' Peters said. ``Four thought it was
just OK, and two said they'd rather pick up trash. They fell asleep
and said it was really tough to sit through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 60 students have taken the opera option, Peters
said. About 30 have turned it down. Most of the offenders are men
charged with alcohol-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not apologizing at all,'' Peters said. ``I feel a college
has a responsibility for raising standards.''

   Pope Speaks of Holocaust During Visit to Israel
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to remember,'' Pope John Paul II said at Jerusalem's
Holocaust memorial, ``to ensure that never again will evil
prevail'' as it did for the Nazis' victims.

   The First Amendment protects the right to speak _ and sometimes

   A New Culture War on Campus
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times at Eastern Connecticut State University.
One misstep, one infraction, one drunken dorm party, and a student
can find himself on a bus to Hartford for an evening of Aida or
Carmen or who-knows-what kind of caterwauling.
</P>
<P>
   Opera as punishment was the idea of Kirk Peters, the associate
dean of student affairs, who, himself an opera fan, tried to give
away 15 opera tickets last fall. He plastered posters all over the
campus in Willamantic, but got no takers. ``I couldn't get people
to go, and it was a freebie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during a disciplinary session with 10 freshmen men, he
came up with his diabolically brilliant plan. The 10 had hopped a
fence around a football field during a rainstorm and tore up the
field playing baseball. The standard punishment would have been 10
hours of community service, but he offered to cut off five hours if
they would go to the opera with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eight agreed, and off they went, not only to the opera but to
the pre-opera workshop. The reviews, predictably, were mixed. ``Two
of them absolutely loved it,'' Peters said. ``Four thought it was
just OK, and two said they'd rather pick up trash. They fell asleep
and said it was really tough to sit through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 60 students have taken the opera option, Peters
said. About 30 have turned it down. Most of the offenders are men
charged with alcohol-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not apologizing at all,'' Peters said. ``I feel a college
has a responsibility for raising standards.''

   Grisly Discoveries in Uganda
</P>
<P>
   The corpses of more than 150 people were found by the Ugandan
police buried under a building used by a doomsday cult involved in
a fire on March 17 in which 500 of its members died.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found about 40 miles from the church at Kanungu
where the 500 members of the cult perished when their church was
set ablaze, the police said. The police said the discovery shed new

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Behind much of the political debate in recent
weeks, on issues from gun control to education, is an intensifying
struggle for the hearts of women, particularly suburban mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties say the presidential race may well
hinge on whether Gov. George W. Bush, who has built his campaign
around a promise of ``compassionate conservatism,'' succeeds in
holding his own among women, who have voted heavily Democratic in
two of the last three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first tests may come on the issue of gun violence and
gun control, which pollsters say is a far more powerful issue among
women than among men. In a CBS News poll conducted Sunday through
Tuesday, 56 percent of the men said laws governing the sale of
handguns should be made more strict; 73 percent of the women did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 13-year-old son,'' said Christine Krisak of Berea,
Ohio, who wants stricter laws. ``I worry about what's going on in
school, what isn't going on in school, what's going on all around
us. But even if I didn't have a child, I think I'd feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 14, Mother's Day, a ``Million Mom March'' on behalf of
``common sense gun control legislation,'' endorsed by an array of
gun control, women's and religious groups, will be held here in
Washington and several other cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of a 6-year-old girl by a 6-year-old boy in Michigan
last month, the latest in a wave of school shootings, has added
force to the issue, pollsters say. In recent weeks, President
Clinton has engaged in a bitter debate with the National Rifle
Association over the need for stronger gun laws, and Vice President
Al Gore, along with other Democrats on the campaign trail, is
expected to hit the issue ever harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about keeping our children safe,'' said Ann F. Lewis,
counselor to Clinton and a longtime Democratic strategist. ``It's
not rhetorical, it's about children dying in school and our ability
to keep them safe. That is the bottom line for parents generally,
but felt even more strongly and acted on even more strongly by
women. There's a reason why we're having a Million Mom March.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see Bush's record on guns _ especially his signing of
a law allowing Texans to carry concealed guns _ as a real
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that other issues _ notably education _ loom
far larger for women. Still, Bush has taken pains to establish some
distance from the NRA and its harsh attacks on Clinton in recent
days. ``He'll agree with the National Rifle Association when he
thinks they're right, but won't hesitate to tell them when he
thinks they're wrong,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush.
Fleischer described the concealed weapons law as a help to women
who work at night, and indicated that Bush was happy to campaign on
his record of tough law enforcement _ particularly against people
who commit crimes with guns.
</P>
<P>
   The gun debate underscores how much the two candidates are
talking to women this year, 20 years after pollsters and
strategists recognized the ``gender gap'' _ the tendency of men to
lean Republican while women lean Democratic. The campaigning is
much more sophisticated than it used to be, in part because what
were once considered ``women's issues,'' like education, are now
near the top of the agenda for voters in general. Some analysts, in
fact, talk of the ``feminization'' of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of politics has moved to a very personal level now,'' said
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., who has studied her party's gender gap
for years. ``People tend to be concerned about what directly
affects them, like health care and education.''
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential race, gender politics has loomed large
because Bush signaled from the beginning that, as Fleischer puts
it, ``he's a different kind of Republican and it's showing up
particularly among women.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats talk of Bush's focus on women with a grudging
respect. ``From the beginning, he was planning to be a Republican
presidential candidate who could win the votes of women,'' Lewis
said. ``That's why he's photographed so much with children, why he
campaigned as a compassionate conservative, why he talked about
himself as a `uniter not a divider.' But he ran into a bump in the
primaries, and he had to take a hard right.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown a tightening race, with Gore having
gained substantial ground since fall. But Bush shows considerable
strength among women compared with recent Republican nominees.

<P>
   In the most recent Voter.com/Battleground 2000 poll, a
bipartisan poll released last week, Gore had a slight lead among
women _ 5 percentage points _but was 12 percentage points behind
Bush among men. Republican candidates tend to do well among
stay-at-home mothers, but this poll showed Bush with strong support
among mothers in general. Gore's strongest categories among women
were retirees, minorities and unmarried women.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, with the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press, also found that Gore was showing vulnerability among a
family-oriented group of women that Clinton cultivated very
successfully in 1996. In part, Kohut added: ``Clinton was blessed
with a very good opponent. Dole seemed a million miles away from a
35-year-old woman with kids. Bush doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strategists say that much of his appeal is his promise to
``uphold the honor and dignity of the office.'' But issues are also
obviously key _ particularly education. Both presumed nominees
opened their general election campaigns this month with advertising
on their education records; both were campaigning in schools this
week. Kohut said he believed Bush's high ratings on education _ 44
percent said he would do the best job on education, compared with
41 percent who said Gore would _ go a long way toward explaining
his strength among women.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the gun debate acquires added political
importance. ``Women are much much more pro gun control than men,
about 20 points more than men,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic
pollster. ``Since married moms are a key battleground, and these
women are very pro-gun control, this has the potential to be a
major wedge issue in congressional and presidential campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, said, ``Gun
control could be a more volatile issue than abortion and more
hurtful to Republicans than abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the contrast the Democrats hope for has yet to appear.
Recent polls have shown the presumed nominees getting roughly equal
approval for their handling of the gun issue, but Democratic
strategists say that will change once voters are informed of Bush's
record. In addition to signing a law allowing Texans to carry
concealed weapons, Bush signed legislation forbidding Texas cities
and counties from directly suing gun manufacturers to recover the
costs of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Krisak, who said she was deeply concerned about guns and school
violence, said she did not really know where the two candidates
stand on the issue, but would focus on it during the debates. For
now, though, she said, ``I like Bush. I know he has some things
about him, but I liked his father. I'm not voting for him because
of his father, but I think he comes from a good family.'' Still, on
the gun issue, she said, ``If they bring it out that he's handling
it poorly, it could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Riesdorph, a hospital dietary worker with two children
in Allegany, N.Y., said that where a candidate stood on gun control
would also make a difference in her vote. ``You always thought your
kids were safe in school,'' Riesdorph said. ``That's the one place
you thought they would be.'' Undecided in the presidential race,
she said she did not yet know the candidates' positions on guns.
</P>
<P>
   A big unknown, in both congressional and presidential elections,
is whether women's concerns on this issue, no matter how strong,
will determine a vote. As one Democratic strategist in the House
said, ``What's yet to be tested is whether the energy level on this
issue has changed,'' noting that the antigun-control forces have a
record of delivering on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., and a crusader for gun control,
whose husband was killed and son badly injured in the Long Island
Rail Road shootings in 1993, said she hopes the Million Mom March
shows that times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very hard to make sure it's not a Republican or
Democratic event,'' McCarthy said, but added she hopes it sends a
message that ``women vote,'' and ``you can take on the NRA and
win.''

A REVOLUTION IN EDUCATION CLICKS INTO PLACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ During his economics seminar the other
day, Sean Leary, a freshman at Wake Forest University, scanned
stock prices, browsed basketball updates from ESPN, checked his
e-mail, and perused pictures of ``beautiful girls'' on
www.acewallpapers.com in search of a new backdrop for his laptop
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Leary, who had already taken one economics course in
the fall, was bored by the discussion of marginal benefit and cost.
But no matter. This is a laptop classroom, where each student sits
behind an open machine, sometimes posting answers to the
professor's queries on a virtual chalkboard, sometimes, well, doing
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't skipped this class once,'' noted Leary, 18. ``Even
if there's something in class that's boring, there's other stuff
you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest is one of more than 100 colleges and universities
across the country where a computer is now required to matriculate.
(Some, like Wake Forest, have raised tuition and mail the laptops
shortly after acceptance letters.) Not only has this created new
forms of in-class distraction and revolutionized campus
communication _ e-mail is used to plan Saturday night outings as
well as to write responses to required readings _ but it has begun
to transform teaching itself.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gordon McCray, a Wake Forest business professor,
turned all of his lectures into a streaming video CD-ROM,
essentially doubling his class time by forcing students to watch
the lectures (or read a transcript) on their own, thereby freeing
class time for group exercises. Others have students do Web
research in class to supplement discussion or use software for
homework and quizzes that help tailor syllabuses to individuals.
Professors say that this way they are now serving a broader
spectrum of learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   The very hours of learning have also been extended beyond the
classroom through online discussion groups _ often including
experts in the field or alumni. Where only a handful of students
typically take advantage of once-a-week office hours, instructors
are now in constant contact with their students by e-mail, even in
the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just added on to the old curriculum _ it's a whole
new curriculum,'' said Bill Moss, a professor of mathematics at
Clemson University in South Carolina, where he started a laptop
project for 250 engineering majors this year. ``You've got old guys
like me who've been teaching for 30 years who've got to throw out
stacks of yellow notes and start a whole new pedagogy.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that computer literacy is now an essential part of a
liberal arts education, small colleges and professional schools now
scratch for spots on Yahoo's annual ranking of America's ``most
wired'' colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The first colleges to require computers were the military
academies, which started putting a desktop in every cadet's room in
1983. But the current wave began a decade later at the University
of Minnesota-Crookston, an outpost of 2,464 students on the western
edge of the state, and it has erupted over the last five years,
from Seton Hall in New Jersey to Sonoma State in California, from
the University of Virginia's business school to the tiny Shepard
Broad Law Center at Nova Southeastern University in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Now the trend is spreading to large public institutions: the
University of Florida in Gainesville, the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and Michigan State University have all
recently approved computer requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 80 percent of college students now bring a
computer with them to campus. Making it a requirement means the
cost can be factored in for financial aid; it also allows the
university to impose uniformity, which makes technical support much
simpler. In most cases, students pay about $3,000 for a laptop
fully loaded with software specially designed for the institution,
then trade it for a new model their junior or senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are also spending millions of dollars to upgrade
classrooms so there are plugs and Internet connections at every
seat _ though some are experimenting with wireless technology _ as
well as laser disc players and video screens up front. There are
added costs for expanded computer help desks, work-study jobs for
students who provide emergency technical assistance in dormitories,
and training for reluctant, old-fashioned faculty.

   ``The students believe we've given them an edge as they go out
into the marketplace,'' said Joseph D. Harbaugh, dean of the Nova
law school, where students use legal case-management software to
file their assignments and mock-bill their time. ``This has set us
apart as we go out into the market for students and for faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clemson, English classes keep their compositions in
electronic portfolios posted on the Web. At Western Carolina
University in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, literature
professors are able to use primary source documents in their
lectures, displaying Web images of the handwritten notes of a minor
British poet from an archive hundreds of miles away at Princeton
University. In Jonathan Zittrain's class on Internet and Society at
Harvard Law School, students respond each week to a question posted
on the Web, and the answers are automatically routed to another
student _ or, perhaps, the author of the pertinent article _ for
comments.
</P>
<P>
   At Oberlin College in Ohio, a class on the industrial revolution
is using university-owned laptops kept locked in a newly wired
classroom. One day they browse an online archive of correspondence
between spouses in 19th-century Pennsylvania, on another day they
analyze data from the 1870 census in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're experiencing something of the same sense of upheaval,''
said Gary Kornblith, the professor, aware of the irony of his
technique and his topic. ``I see a lot of parallels, and I hope my
students will see parallels.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Wake Forest, where the class of 2000 was the first to
receive laptops, only a handful of professors regularly use
computers in the classroom, but nearly all of them incorporate
technology into their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Patricia Dixon's Musical Protest in the Americas
class consulted Pete Seeger himself in an online chat (and later
corrected the professor by supplying Seeger's eyewitness view of
events).
</P>
<P>
   Rick Matthews, chairman of the physics department, said a
circuit-maker program has elevated his electronics class. Before,
students would draw a circuit, he would find a couple of mistakes _
probably miss one or two _ and give the paper, say, an 82. Now,
students can test the circuit to see whether current would actually
flow; everyone gets a zero or 100, because no one turns the
assignment in until it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homework before wasn't teaching them anything _ it was
merely documenting what they knew and didn't know,'' he said.
``Now, they're putting four times as much time in as they did
before, they're enjoying the homework more, learning 50 percent
more electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   David G. Brown spearheaded Wake Forest's computer initiative
while he was provost, and now is dean of the university's
International Center for Computer Enhanced Learning. Brown, an
economist, is a surprising spokesman for e-education: his computer
experience five years ago was limited to typing on a word
processor. Now, his syllabus is an interactive document featuring
color photographs of his students, his ``textbook'' is electronic,
and he grades essays online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is like the library,'' said Brown, who uses
laptops every day in class, having students type answers into a
chat room rather than raise hands, or prepare an instant
presentation doing Web research. ``It's an intellectual resource.
If you don't have it, you've got to dumb down your course, you've
got to dumb down your research.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   There is the astronomy professor at Wake Forest who posted his
lectures on the Web _ so most people stopped showing up for class.
And there are the students at Columbia University School of
Business who spend their time in class trading stocks _
occasionally interrupting the lecture with whoops of joy or sighs
of pain over their trades. And there is the incessant clicking on
campuses everywhere as students take notes on their machines or use
them to write exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't make up for a good teacher,'' said Heath Baumgarten,
20, a Wake Forest junior from Freeport, Maine ``It has changed the
social body. It's harder to meet people. A lot of people are inside
a lot now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first laptop class graduates from Wake Forest this
spring, Baumgarten said he, for one, plans to leave his computer
behind.

<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ Cheered by a mixed local crowd of Muslims and
Christians, Pope John Paul II appeared for one sun-dappled moment
to have erased the religious rifts in this ancient city as he came
to celebrate Mass here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As the gold-hubcapped popemobile passed through the streets
where Jesus is believed to have spent his childhood, the Israeli
Arabs who are today's Nazarenes waved yellow Vatican flags, hoisted
tots in commemorative papal baseball caps, and held up placards
welcoming the pope, ``Benvenuto Papa Carissimo.'' The pope, tightly
gripping the white handrail in his bulletproof encasement, blessed
the crowd to roars of approval.
</P>
<P>
   The pope proceeded on this Catholic holy day of the Annunciation
to the huge modernist Basilica of the Annunciation, built to
commemorate the moment here 2,000 years ago when Catholics believe
that the Archangel Gabriel told the Virgin Mary that she was to be
the mother of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The fortress-like structure, the largest Roman Catholic church
in the Middle East, is a 1950s creation of Italian architects and
Israeli civil engineers. It sits atop the sequential ruins of a
fourth-century Byzantine oratory, a grander 12th-century Crusader
church and an 18th-century Franciscan chapel. Deep below its
ancient foundations is a cave believed in Christian tradition to
have been Mary's family home.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims have received approval from the Israeli government to
build a mosque in the plaza adjacent to the basilica, causing
tension in the town, which has seen its Christian population shrink
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Muslims joined enthusiastically in the festivities
Saturday, though the crowd outside was dominated by Nazareth's
Christian minority. ``This is an expression of our joy at the visit
of his holiness the pope,'' said Saman Arslen, the director of a
40-member Islamic Scouts drum corps, as it pounded out a deafening
welcome to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit was seen here primarily as a gesture toward
Israel's dwindling number of Christians, who once dominated
Nazareth and the Galilee region. Local Christians worry that they
have become a minority within a minority, now barely 10 percent of
an otherwise Islamic Arab population in a state that is five-sixths
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians greeting the pope glared at the small group of
Muslims who had camped on a plaza where they plan to erect a mosque
next to the tomb of a nephew of Saladin, the warrior hero who
expelled the Crusaders in 1187. The Vatican strongly objected to
the project as an Islamic attempt to overshadow a traditional
Catholic pilgrimage site, and to remind the Muslim faithful of the
atrocities committed against their ancestors by the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians were not placated by the Islamists' handwritten
signs in English, Italian, Hebrew and Arabic welcoming the pope and
calling their planned mosque ``a symbol of harmony and
neighborliness.'' But the Muslims adhered to an agreement with the
police to keep a low profile, and they were silent and virtually
invisible as the papal motorcade cruised passed.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security was taking no chances. All roads to the town
center were blocked from dawn. Sharpshooters patrolled rooftops.
The blue-uniformed riot squads and olive-green army platoons along
the pope's route often outnumbered the families crowding the
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   But inside this heavily policed bubble, the mood was genuinely
celebratory and free of visible religious strains. Even the lapel
stickers worn for the papal visit by Israeli security forces _
``Mivtza Yedid Vatik,'' Hebrew for ``Operation Old Friend'' _
seemed to reflect the remarkably congenial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many stops on the pope's carefully scripted Holy
Land itinerary, the Nazareth visit was a genuinely indigenous
affair, with lots of hometown pride mixed with straightforward
religious fervor. There were no overt politics, no delicate
interfaith initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily to an invited congregation of area church leaders
and lay dignitaries, the pope delivered a traditional holy day
message venerating the memory of the Virgin Mary and avoiding even
indirect allusions to religious divisions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this day the eyes of the whole church turn to Nazareth,''
he said. ``I have longed to come back to the town of Jesus, to feel
once again, in contact with this place, the presence of the woman
of whom St. Augustine wrote: `He chose the mother he had created;
he created the mother he had chosen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pope spent 10 minutes praying alone in the sacred grotto
near the basilica Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his carefully apolitical sermon _ his only public
remarks here _ many Christians here saw his visit as an intentional
reminder to both the Muslim majority locally and the Jewish
majority nationally of the symbolic importance of Nazareth to the
Christian world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel with this visit that now there is someone who is
looking after us, when we felt that we had been forgotten,'' said
Robert Dirawi, a 37-year-old Nazareth-born Roman Catholic. When
Pope Paul VI visited Nazareth in 1964, Dirawi recalled, about
two-thirds of the town was Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is two-thirds Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Even Orthodox Christians, who often resent what they see as the
Vatican's attempt to claim primacy among the Christian churches,
said Saturday that they welcomed the pope's pilgrimage. ``It is a
visit to say that we are here, and that we have an identity,'' said
Rafleh Ghanadreh, a Greek Orthodox Christian from Nazareth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The senior Catholic clerics accompanying the pope were acutely
aware of the importance of the visit for the Christian minority.
``It is a source of great hope for them, and it will be a source of
strength for them to carry on their wonderful Christian
traditions,'' Cardinal Adam Joseph Maida, the archbishop of
Detroit, said as he waited to be escorted through an Israeli police
phalanx outside the basilica Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Even inside the basilica the issue was raised. Antoine Shaheen,
an Arab Christian and retired Israeli tourism official who took
communion from the pope Saturday, criticized the government for
``playing political games'' and rewarding the Muslims, who he said
had ``unilaterally occupied'' what was formerly a public square.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Christians are not against the building of a mosque in
principle, but we are against the way it is being done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth has for centuries been the Christian Arab center of
what is now northern Israel. But Muslim leaders note that from the
collapse of the 12-century Crusader kingdom until the early
20th-century British mandate, Nazareth, like the rest of the Holy
Land, was under uninterrupted Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This land does not belong to the Christians,'' says Ahmed
Zoebi, a leader of the ``mosque defense committee'' here.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one concern uniting Muslims and Christians here, it
was the lack of any visible economic benefits to their town from
the pope's long-awaited visit. Mayor Ramiz Jaraisy, who is
Christian, complained that the Israeli government had spent just
$250,000 sprucing up his old city center, in contrast to the
millions spent on the Old City district of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   And few tourists have arrived in the pope's wake, complained
Marwan Maharu, a Muslim pastry-shop proprietor, displaying a cash
register ticker from Friday with just $95 in total sales. ``They
come for five minutes, see the basilica, and then go to Tiberias or
Tel Aviv to drink their coffee,'' he said.

<P>
   Remember Clairol's catchy slogan from the 1950s, ``Hair color so
natural, only her hairdresser knows for sure''?
</P>
<P>
   In recognition that hair stylists may know more secrets about
their clients than merely cosmetic ones, new programs are being
established by community-based organizations and state agencies to
help hairdressers identify signs of domestic violence. These
programs are trying to take advantage of the bond that often exists
between hairdressers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Each year 3 to 4 million women are beaten in their homes,
according to the Justice Department. In 1998, the latest year for
which data are available, homicide figures gathered by the FBI
showed that 32 percent of the women slain in this country are
killed by their husbands, former husbands, boyfriends or former
boyfriends. If stylists can spot the signs early, they could refer
abused women to social service agencies and support groups.
</P>
<P>
   The New London Rotary Foundation in Connecticut awarded Susan
O'Toole of the Women's Center of Southeastern Connecticut a $1,000
grant last summer to teach hairdressers how to recognize domestic
violence and sexual assault. Participating salons post hot line
numbers, display brochures and make referrals to social service
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Boyd-Frenkel, domestic violence ombudsman for the
attorney general of Nevada, is working with the state board of
cosmetology to develop a training program for cosmetology teachers
and school administrators, who would earn continuing education
credits.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevada's program does not turn stylists into crisis workers.
Instead, according to its training brochure, it teaches them how to
ask the right questions. The brochure warns the hairdresser when
dealing with her client: ``Don't offer advice. Especially, do not
advise her to leave, without knowing how dangerous such a choice
might be for her.'' The brochure also emphasizes the importance of
confidentiality, saying, ``A slip to another client or to another
stylist can result in increased danger to the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn-out hair or a bruised eye may signal abuse, but more subtle
warning signs may come out in conversation. One Nevada hairdresser,
Boyd-Frenkel said, told of a client who said: ``My husband doesn't
want me to see my friend anymore. He says she is putting bad ideas
in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotional abuse, intimidation, control, jealousy,
overpossessiveness and constant monitoring,'' she said, can be as
sure signs of domestic violence as physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapists are not particularly thrilled to cede any
ground to hairdressers. ``Hairdressers are being placed in a role
that they have little training for,'' said John Reid, a clinical
psychologist practicing in San Antonio. ``They may get in over
their heads in terms of the therapeutic relationship and issues
like transference and countertransference. Plus, taking on this
role could get them smack dab into the family dynamics if the
husband finds out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics note that confidentiality _ a legal duty for
physicians and therapists _ is merely professional etiquette for
hairdressers. They might be too neutral and nonjudgmental in the
interest of maintaining a business relationship.
</P>
<P>
   These misgivings are not confined to therapists. An editorial in
the Las Vegas Review-Journal in February blasted the Nevada
program, invoking the notion of the slippery slope, asking whether
bartenders will be the next group required ``to take government
courses on how to snitch out their customers'' to enforce laws on
domestic violence or child support.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one person's slippery slope is another's vista of
opportunity. The Women's Center of Southeastern Connecticut hopes
to extend its training to bartenders, as well as taxi drivers and
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, hairdressers have been taught to advise their
clients of the importance of mammography and breast
self-examinations. In Los Angeles, city administrators have held
luncheons with hairdressers to hear what their clients think about
city life. In Nashville, Shears United, a program of a local AIDS
organization, uses beauty parlors to discuss HIV prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Although the phenomenon of the hairdresser, bartender or
personal trainer who acts as a ``paid friend'' may be the result of
today's social isolation and the anomie that arises with far-flung
families, television and the Internet, it is hardly new. A number
of articles on the subject were published in the 1970s. In
``Hairdressers as Caregivers'' (American Journal of Community
Psychology, 1979), the psychologist Emory L. Cowen and his
colleagues wrote that the jobs of ``informal agents'' like
bartenders, barbers, beauticians and cab drivers ``bring them into

<P>
   Remember Clairol's catchy slogan from the 1950s, ``Hair color so
natural, only her hairdresser knows for sure''?
</P>
<P>
   In recognition that hair stylists may know more secrets about
their clients than merely cosmetic ones, new programs are being
established by community-based organizations and state agencies to
help hairdressers identify signs of domestic violence. These
programs are trying to take advantage of the bond that often exists
between hairdressers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Each year 3 to 4 million women are beaten in their homes,
according to the Justice Department. In 1998, the latest year for
which data are available, homicide figures gathered by the FBI
showed that 32 percent of the women slain in this country are
killed by their husbands, former husbands, boyfriends or former
boyfriends. If stylists can spot the signs early, they could refer
abused women to social service agencies and support groups.
</P>
<P>
   The New London Rotary Foundation in Connecticut awarded Susan
O'Toole of the Women's Center of Southeastern Connecticut a $1,000
grant last summer to teach hairdressers how to recognize domestic
violence and sexual assault. Participating salons post hot line
numbers, display brochures and make referrals to social service
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Boyd-Frenkel, domestic violence ombudsman for the
attorney general of Nevada, is working with the state boacosmetology to develop a training program for cosmetology teachers
and school administrators, who would earn continuing education
credits.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevada's program does not turn stylists into crisis workers.
Instead, according to its training brochure, it teaches them how to
ask the right questions. The brochure warns the hairdresser when
dealing with her client: ``Don't offer advice. Especially, do not
advise her to leave, without knowing how dangerous such a choice
might be for her.'' The brochure also emphasizes the importance of
confidentiality, saying, ``A slip to another client or to another
stylist can result in increased danger to the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn-out hair or a bruised eye may signal abuse, but more subtle
warning signs may come out in conversation. One Nevada hairdresser,
Boyd-Frenkel said, told of a client who said: ``My husband doesn't
want me to see my friend anymore. He says she is putting bad ideas
in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotional abuse, intimidation, control, jealousy,
overpossessiveness and constant monitoring,'' she said, can be as
sure signs of domestic violence as physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapists are not particularly thrilled to cede any
ground to hairdressers. ``Hairdressers are being placed in a role
that they have little training for,'' said John Reid, a clinical
psychologist practicing in San Antonio. ``They may get in over
their heads in terms of the therapeutic relationship and issues
like transference and countertransference. Plus, taking on this
role could get them smack dab into the family dynamics if the
husband finds out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics note that confidentiality _ a legal duty for
physicians and therapists _ is merely professional etiquette for
hairdressers. They might be too neutral and nonjudgmental in the
interest of maintaining a business relationship.
</P>
<P>
   These misgivings are not confined to therapists. An editorial in
the Las Vegas Review-Journal in February blasted the Nevada
program, invoking the notion of the slippery slope, asking whether
bartenders will be the next group required ``to take government
courses on how to snitch out their customers'' to enforce laws on
domestic violence or child support.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one person's slippery slope is another's vista of
opportunity. The Women's Center of Southeastern Connecticut hopes
to extend its training to bartenders, as well as taxi drivers and
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, hairdressers have been taught to advise their
clients of the importance of mammography and breast
self-examinations. In Los Angeles, city administrators have held
luncheons with hairdressers to hear what their clients think about
city life. In Nashville, Shears United, a program of a local AIDS
organization, uses beauty parlors to discuss HIV prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Although the phenomenon of the hairdresser, bartender or
personal trainer who acts as a ``paid friend'' may be the result of
today's social isolation and the anomie that arises with far-flung
families, television and the Internet, it is hardly new. A number
of articles on the subject were published in the 1970s. In
``Hairdressers as Caregivers'' (American Journal of Community
Psychology, 1979), the psychologist Emory L. Cowen and his
colleagues wrote that the jobs of ``informal agents'' like
bartenders, barbers, beauticians and cab drivers ``bring them into
contact with interpersonally distressed people.'' Interviews with
90 hairdressers defined the atmosphere of what the authors called
the ``beauty parlor surround'' and revealed that most hairdressers
enjoyed dealing with their clients' personal problems, gratified at
the trust placed in them. One of the survey respondents even
claimed he could infer the emotional state of his client from the
condition of her hair. The psychologists were skeptical,
dismissively so, noting the hairdresser ``offered no dandruff
counts, oil density or sheen measures _ no `objective data'
whatsoever'' to bolster his claim.
</P>
<P>
   But the insight that comes from pounds of journal articles can
be gleaned from a wisp of fiction. Dorothy Allison got it right in
her novel ``The Cavedweller'' (Dutton, 1998), when she described
hairdressers as ``priestesses of appreciation and encouragement.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For seven years now, Bill Clinton has been chanting
the mantra that countries that invest in education and focus on the
Web are far more likely to prosper than those that measure their
power in kilotons and argue over bleak pieces of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   He made the case again last week in India and Pakistan while his
top aides were delivering variations on the theme in Beijing. A
third major flash point, the Middle East, was on his agenda for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument that seemed so reasonable just a few years ago
_ that plugging into a dynamic world economy will bring prosperity
and tame nasty nationalistic tendencies _ is proving a hard sell as
Clinton races around the globe in the last 10 months of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most economically isolated nations, like Pakistan
and Syria, see no hope of catching up with their more economically
advanced competitors, and those well on the road to global
competitiveness, like India, China and Israel, believe more than
ever that their economic potential must be married with military
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Take India's Parliament, which swooned when Clinton talked
excitedly of the booming software houses of Bangalore and when he
predicted that, as India makes the inevitable choice between ``the
hand loom or the hyperlink,'' its standard of living could sextuple
in the next two decades. Yet as soon as Clinton suggested that
India's economic progress is being undercut by its nuclear testing
and territorial battle over Kashmir, his hosts got their backs up.
</P>
<P>
   Just because our future is etched on a silicon chip, they shot
back, in effect, don't think we're about to give up the Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, meanwhile, hard-liners were using the election of an
independence-leaning president in Taiwan to bolster their case that
it was time for ``economic integration'' with the world to take a
back seat to the assertion of China's sovereignty over what they
see as a breakaway island. It is still unclear whether the generals
will retake the upper hand from those who argue that the real
business of the Communist Party is business.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Syria's president, Hafez Assad, whose waffling on
a peace accord with Israel prompted Clinton to schedule a
face-to-face meeting Sunday in Switzerland. For years now Clinton
has been sketching out his vision of the Middle East's economic
potential if only it could stop arguing over security and
territory. But now a great deal of that vision hinges on his
ability to persuade a reclusive and ailing Syrian leader
increasingly preoccupied with creating a family dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those disputes, of course, is driven by its own
emotional history of ugly conflict. But they all serve to
illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the
market when nationalistic impulses flare up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans often see a rigid tradeoff between economic
success in an age of globalization and increasing your old-style
military power,'' said Paul Bracken, a Yale professor whose book
``Fire in the East'' (HarperCollins, 1999) explored the growing
nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East. ``The rest of the
world doesn't see it that way. And in fact, their growing
nationalism is a counterweight, in their minds, to the other
strains they are feeling as their worlds are changed'' by
borderless competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism isn't the only factor at play. All three flash
points are made more complex and unpredictable by the fact that
nervous authoritarian regimes are facing off against some variety
of democracy _ a mix that can produce political miscalculation when
one side misunderstands how the other makes its decisions. Witness
how China's heavy-handed threats, aimed at intimidating Taiwan's
voters, backfired to the point that the Taiwanese elected the
candidate who until recently had talked of asserting independence.
</P>
<P>
   And in each dispute, Washington's own motives are suspect.
Americans often view themselves as neutral arbiters, only seeking
to spread peace. But from Delhi to Shanghai to the Persian Gulf,
suspicions are greater than ever these days that the sole military
and economic superpower is using its ``neutral'' role to create a
world that plays to Washington's commercial and geopolitical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Why has a seemingly persuasive argument _ that it's wiser to
invest in education and broadband networks than in nuclear
reprocessors _ run up against such opposition both in unplugged
nations and in the most plugged-in?
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and Syria are good places to start. Both are about as
disconnected from the world economy as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   But, while both countries harbor enormous reservoirs of native
talent, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the leader of Pakistan, and Assad in
Syria understand the nature of the poison pill: if they took
Clinton's advice, the medicine that would be good for the country
would eat away at their own holds on power. Among major
authoritarian regimes at the turn of the century, only China's
Communist leaders have made the bet that they can loosen controls
on the economy, allow in the Internet and still exert iron control
over the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   So Pakistan holds on to nukes for the same reason that NATO did
in Europe: as a guarantee against a much larger force across the
border. Add to that nationalistic pride. But what about India?
Doesn't it see that a nuclear arms race drains resources that could
be better spent conquering new cybermarkets?

   ``It's exactly the opposite,'' says Jeffrey Garten, dean of the
Yale School of Management, who as a top Commerce Department
official peddled a lot of Clinton's networks-not-nukes message.
``In the first half of the 20th century, countries wanted
well-rounded power. The Cold War, though, created an odd sense that
only a couple of countries would be both economic and military
powerhouses. Now the pendulum is swinging back.''
</P>
<P>
   So India wants both. As does Israel, and both China and Taiwan.
Indeed, countries look at the one nation that was supposed to
exercise ``soft power'' through economic and technological prowess
alone _ Japan _ and they see a pitiful excuse for a superpower.
Once the economic magic went away, so did the global diplomatic
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between analog and digital nations is worsened
when the former are authoritarians and the latter are some variety
of democracy. This has long been a problem in the Middle East.
Assad's rhetoric regularly frays the fragile coalition keeping
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in power in Israel. Nothing new there.
But Barak has long promised that any peace deal with Syria will be
put up to a national referendum in Israel, and that means final
adoption could be unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   But for real miscalculation, pop back and forth between Beijing
and Taipei. China's leaders have what one senior U.S. official last
week called a ``near-perfect ability to miscalculate'' the effects
of their words on the Taiwanese electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Maochun, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who
specializes in cross-straits relations, was sitting in a noisy
Taipei restaurant earlier this month when the television broadcast
a warning to Taiwan from China's premier, Zhu Rongji. The mainland,
he said, was willing to ``spill blood'' to prevent independence.
``People stood up and yelled'' in the restaurant, Yu said, making
vivid the backlash that was felt throughout Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a man as sophisticated about the world as Zhu, China's
leading economic reformer, make such a blunder?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communist Party, when it comes to big problems, is
elitist,'' says Yu. ``It is accustomed to sitting down behind
closed doors with a Nixon or a Kissinger and solving a problem. Now
it is faced with a whole different kind of foreign policy
challenge. And they can't handle the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Democracies miscalculate, too. It was India that inflamed the
long-running sore with Pakistan two years ago when it uncorked
nuclear tests. Some Indian elites now concede that the nuclear
grandstanding _ a great crowd pleaser at home _ paved the way for
the rise of General Musharraf in Pakistan, who had engineered some
of the horrors in Kashmir, then took command in a coup. Now, U.S.
officials believe, he figures that if the war at the top of the
world gets splashed on enough front pages, India will be forced to
accept what it has long rejected _ outside mediation from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The general may be proved wrong, but maybe not. With not much to
do at home, Clinton is moving from hot spot to hot spot, arguing
that all involve areas in America's strategic interest. The problem
is that Clinton envisions himself as an umpire, while the rest of
the world sees Washington as a player with its own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   There is suspicion in Beijing, for example, that America is
using all its weapons _ from the Seventh Fleet to its influence
over the World Trade Organization _ to contain China's power. The
Indians share a similar suspicion, even as they flocked to shake
Clinton's hand.
</P>
<P>
   And so for all the happy talk, the Indians had no intention of
signing on to Clinton's non-proliferation agenda. After all, they
said, that other great symbol of democracy _ the U.S. Senate _
rejected the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last year, proving
that even the most powerful economy on earth wasn't willing to
forgo its nuclear options.
</P>
<P>
   So why, they asked, should they?

signing on to Clinton's non-proliferation agenda. After all, they
said, that other great symbol of democracy _ the U.S. Senate _
rejected the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last year, proving
that even the most powerful economy on earth wasn't willing to
forgo its nuclear options.
</P>
<P>
   So why, they asked, should they?

   WASHINGTON _ ``They call us the fathers of soft money,'' Bob
Farmer says, and he's not preening. Neither is Bob Mosbacher, the
other hangdog dad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Farmer, the top money man for Michael Dukakis and the
Democratic Party, and Mosbacher, finance chairman for George Bush
and the Republicans, were the kings of campaign fund-raising. More
than that, they earned a place in political history by starting the
first national programs to raise soft money, the large,
unrestricted gifts to the two parties by wealthy individuals,
corporations and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them have lived to feel some regret over their fiscal
ingenuity (though not, it must be said, the victories it
contributed to). Today, Farmer says it's high time Washington
passed campaign finance reform legislation. ``Obviously, money in
politics is totally out of control,'' he says. Mosbacher agrees
that ``it's gotten totally out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's about to get worse, predicts Jeffrey Birnbaum, author
of ``The Money Men'' (Crown Books), a forthcoming book about
political fund raising. ``There will be far more soft money than
ever before,'' he says. Experts on campaign finance agree, some
estimating that during the 2000 elections the two parties could
collect as much as $500 million in soft money contributions. That's
up from $262 million four years ago, when there were widespread
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum says that the Clinton-Gore money team has taken soft
money to a new level. ``At one time in the Democratic Party, it was
time to celebrate if they got a $50,000 check,'' he says. ``Now a
host of wealthy Democrats are expected to fork over $100,000 or
more every year.'' The Republicans, Birnbaum adds, ``are hungry for
victory, having been out of the White House for eight long years.''
More than 50 wealthy Republicans have joined the Regents, which
costs them $250,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the sidelines, Farmer and Mosbacher sound a little
like those physicists who came to regret having invented nuclear
weapons, which set off the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1988, Farmer says, he feared that the Republicans, who
held the White House, would raise so much money they would swamp
the Democrats. So he came up with the idea of asking wealthy
supporters to write $100,000 checks to the Democratic Party. They
got a fancy name, the Democratic Trustees, and although the money
they gave went into party coffers, most of it was spent to help the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned about the Democrats' program, Mosbacher says, he
worried about being outpaced, so he promptly copied their idea,
calling the Republican version Team 100. Mosbacher says Vice
President George Bush didn't like the idea. ``He moaned and
groaned,'' Mosbacher recalls. ``He foresaw it as something that
would be perceived as someone getting clout for making a big
contribution.'' But he went along with Mosbacher's argument that
the Republicans would be ``left in the lurch'' if they left the
soft money field to Farmer. That year, Farmer recruited 130
Democratic Trustees, while Mosbacher drew 267 members to Team 100.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1988, soft money played an insignificant role, though it
was permitted by a loophole in the post-Watergate federal election
laws passed in 1974, which allowed unrestricted donations to
political parties for party-building activities, like voter
registration drives. Legal challenges to close the loophole have
failed, much to the benefit of presidential candidates, to whom
direct contributions from individuals are limited by law to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The soft money reaped by the two parties in 1988 was a pittance
compared with today, when almost every political leader, from
President Clinton on down, reserves large blocks of time for wooing
big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Farmer says. ``They are all spending all
their time on the phone asking for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has challenged Gov. George W. Bush not to
accept soft money, but even as he issued his proposal, his party's
largest benefactors were invited to a series of lunches. In
Manhattan last Wednesday, for example, Gore raised more than
$700,000 for his party from about 75 donors at two lunches. The
Republican Party will also raise huge amounts of soft money to
support Bush, who has already raised more than $70 million in hard
money for his presidential campaign, an unprecedented sum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, $100,000 donations have become commonplace. And some
of the high rollers from 1988 are rolling higher today. Richard T.
Farmer, an Ohio executive who was one of the original Team 100
members, gave $445,000 to the Republican Party last year. Carl
Lindner, another Ohio executive who was one of Farmer's big
supporters, gave the Democratic Party $270,000 last year, according
to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bob Farmer and Mosbacher, now that they no longer spend
their days raising money, favor campaign finance reform. But they
doubt that Sen. John McCain's bill to ban soft money or the other
proposals now debated in Congress would work. Farmer, who served as
President Clinton's consul general to Bermuda and now runs a
high-tech company in Miami, would like legislation mandating free
or discounted television time for presidential candidates.
Mosbacher, chairman of a Texas energy company, thinks that if
corporate soft money is banned, independent spending by labor
unions must be constrained.
</P>
<P>
   But neither option, Farmer says, will shut the door on soft
money. ``The problem with campaign finance reform,'' he says, ``is
that every time you close one loophole, you open others.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous jet-stream winds over the northern tier of states and
southern Canada will promote rapid weather changes over the next
few days. A broken area of showers will move quickly off the New
England coast Sunday morning. In its wake, breezy and cooler
weather will sweep into the Northeast. Clouds and a few wet snow
showers will linger from the Adirondacks to southeastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will erupt in a sultry air mass from eastern Texas
and Oklahoma to the interior Gulf Coast states. High-level winds
from the northwest will deliver colder air at 15,000 feet above the
southern Plains later Sunday. The strong vertical temperature
difference will set the stage for potent thunderstorms and a few
tornadoes Sunday afternoon and Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A few showers will precede a cold front in the northern
Mississippi Valley on Sunday. The front will cause deteriorating
conditions in the interior Northeast on Monday and Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seeds of Drought
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of summer drought are often planted early in the year. The
winter had the least rainfall on record in Jackson, Miss., a
reflection of exceptional dryness in much of the Southeast.
Reliable predictions for those areas of the nation that will have
drought this year are difficult because patterns of spring rainfall
can markedly alter the drought probabilities. But in many past
years, unusually dry areas at the start of the growing season have
a greater risk of summer drought.

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Brothers Martinez
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove will not soon forget the Pedro Performance. In a
season filled with memorable Pedro performances, the one against
the Cleveland Indians last October was the piece de resistance. It
was Pedro Martinez at his most resourceful and absolute finest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely amazing'' was how Hargrove described it, five
months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that Pedro Martinez showed me last year was not so
much that he put it on the line for his team,'' Hargrove said. ``It
was that Pedro went out and threw the ball 86, 87 miles an hour and
was just as dominant a pitcher as he was throwing 95 miles an hour.
Not a lot of power pitchers can do that, but Pedro did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' presence in the playoffs and, as it turned out,
Hargrove's job, were on the line when Martinez entered the fifth
game of the division series as a relief pitcher in the fourth
inning. Martinez would ordinarily have started that final game of
the playoff series or the previous one for Boston, but he pulled a
muscle in his back in his opening-game start and was not available.
</P>
<P>
   But with the score tied, 8-8, after three and a half innings,
Martinez became available. He pitched the final six innings,
allowing no hits or runs, walking three and striking out eight as
the Red Sox won, 12-8.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is the leader of a starting rotation that has the
potential to be very good and very deep this season. Not many teams
can boast of such a unit. But this staff comes with a caveat:
Except for Martinez, the rotation offers no guaranteed winners.
Each of Pedro's pitching pals has a question mark attached to his
arm. If the pitchers come through, the Yankees could find a huge
Red Sox roadblock between themselves and another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our players,'' Jimy Williams, Boston's low-key manager,
said when asked about his pitchers. ``How well we're going to do I
don't know. We got some kids who like to compete. We got some good
arms, guys who know how to pitch. Can Ramon sustain what he did at
the end of last year? He's shown good arm strength here so far. He
feels good about himself. When you have those injury situations,
you take one start at a time and build on it hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, Pedro's older brother, returned to the major
leagues late last season, 14 months after rotator cuff surgery.
Gambling that he could return, the Red Sox signed him last year as
a future performer. He started four times for them in September
(two victories, one loss, a 3.05 earned run average), then twice in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   His big brother, a winner with Los Angeles, who just turned 32,
has the prospect of an open-ended victory total _ if his arm
remains strong and he remains healthy. Consider where the Red Sox
could go if the Martinez brothers were to match the 49 victories
the Dean brothers (Dizzy and Paul) gained for the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1934, or the 47 they had the next season or even the
38 the Perry brothers (Gaylord and Jim) earned for Cleveland in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero has not been injured, but Joe Kerrigan is trying to
nurse him back to good pitching health nevertheless. Kerrigan is
the Red Sox pitching coach who held the same job with Montreal when
Fassero was building an attractive career there.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox signed Fassero as a free agent, believing his 4-14
record and 7.38 ERA with Seattle last year were an aberration,
coming only two seasons after a 16-9, 3.61 season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any secret to a turnaround, Williams said:
``Oh, I don't know any secrets. A change of uniform, change of
ideas. Joe Kerrigan was with him before. John Cumberland is in the
bullpen. If they can help this kid, he could be a big plus for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they don't know which Fassero they will get, the Red Sox
can't be certain about Tim Wakefield. If his knuckleball flutters
the way he wants it to and his fielders catch the ball behind him,
he could approach the 16-8 record he had in 1995 or the 17-8 he
produced two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the No. 5 spot in the rotation. It will go to one of
two youngsters, both of whom made good impressions last season.
Brian Rose, a 24-year-old right-hander, beat the Yankees in his
first two starts six days apart. Juan Pena, a 22-year-old
right-hander, made only two starts before suffering a shoulder
ailment, but in those games he allowed only one run in 13 innings
and won them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose and Pena are trying to establish themselves as major
leaguers,'' General Manager Dan Duquette said. ``Rose has a little
more experience. But they both look like they're capable of
helping.''
</P>
<P>
   The one who doesn't make the rotation for the start of the
season will be a short ride away in Pawtucket, R.I. A far more
veteran pitcher will be waiting in the on-deck circle, too. Bret
Saberhagen, who has vast experience at coming back from injuries,
is working his way back from a torn rotator cuff. He has been
throwing on the side and hopes to be ready around June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courage that kid showed with a torn muscle in his shoulder
trying to play the game is about as good as it gets,'' Williams
said. ``Shows a lot of heart. A lot of kids who had this injury, it
would be monumental. But because of what he's already gone through
it ain't quite so big. The guy knows how to pitch. He knows what
he's doing in a game, what he means to our team as a pitcher. He
helps the rest of our staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Genius of Maddux
</P>
<P>
   Before there was Pedro Martinez, Atlanta's Greg Maddux dazzled
everyone who faced him or watched him pitch. He still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what he does better than anyone I've seen since
Catfish Hunter,'' said Phil Garner, the Detroit Tigers' manager,
who saw Maddux pitching for the Braves when he was managing the
Milwaukee Brewers. ``He watches everything. He can see what hitters
are doing. He knows when to throw it in and he knows when to throw
it away. That's his genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skill is that he can do that when he wants to, but his
genius is that when he throws the ball he can see what the hitter
is doing. He knows absolutely where to go with it. He's a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Astros Need Their Rest
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell has played every one of the Houston Astros' 162
games in three of the past four seasons. Craig Biggio has missed a
total of four games in the past four seasons. Larry Dierker, their
manager, said he would like them to take a few more days off this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about it,'' Biggio said. ``Last year we didn't
have that luxury to take off days, because we had everybody hurt. I
told him I'd take some more off days this year. It depends on when
you get them. You don't want an off day in the middle of a week,
like a Wednesday night game. You want one like on a travel day and
a day game. The older you get, you don't bounce back as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell said the amount of rest he gets will be up to Dierker.
``That was his intention last year, but we lost so many guys to
injuries I didn't have time to take off,'' the first baseman said.
``I was tired in August a little bit. I think everybody's tired in
August.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Biggio said he would not want to take 20 days off
in any season. ``That's not going to happen unless I have an
injury,'' he said. ``I'll take a couple more days off this year.
I'm not down on that. In the long run you will feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell was one of five players who played 162 games last
season. The others were John Olerud with the Mets, Sammy Sosa with
the Chicago Cubs, Andruw Jones with Atlanta and B.J. Surhoff with
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A Million-Dollar Memory
</P>
<P>
   His career highs in home runs (38) and runs batted in (112)
certainly pleased Jay Bell, but the Arizona Diamondbacks' second
baseman was most impressed with the career-high 132 runs he scored
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the one place that I really put emphasis on my game
is runs scored,'' Bell said. ``From the two hole, that is one thing
I have to do. Driving in runs is a bonus; scoring runs is
mandatory. With everything that happened last year, the home runs,
the RBI's, those things are great. But if those go down a little
bit, no big deal. With runs scored I want to maintain what I did
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 33, in his 12th year in the major leagues, Bell had the
season of his life. He had never hit more than 21 home runs, driven
in more than 92 runs (and that total was his only one exceeding 71)
and scored more than 102. But he was an offensive force in the
Diamondbacks' 100-victory, division-championship season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take a long look at what happened last year,'' Bell
said. ``What was fun for me was the one at-bat where I won the lady
a million dollars. That's probably the thing I looked at more often
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell referred to the grand slam he hit July 11 against Jimmy
Haynes of Oakland in an inning that was used for a promotion. If an
Arizona batter hit a grand slam, a designated fan would win $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ironic how everything happened,'' Bell said. ``Going up
there, knowing the situation, bases loaded, two outs, pretty good
hitter's count and hitting a home run. It was exciting. The
individual stuff was fantastic, but I didn't think about it much.
The grand slam and the team success we had, when I did think about
the season, that was the focus.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A HOMECOMING ACROSS THE PACIFIC 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For one epic year, Bobby Valentine embraced Japanese
baseball, thinking he was importing his American ways. He wound up
realizing there are other ways to play this game.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the New York Mets has now returned to his other
baseball home, with all the exuberance of a child waking up on a
birthday. This week, Valentine is proudly leading his team on a
road trip that may be the next step toward a stronger bond between
the baseball continents. Saturday night at a news conference here,
Valentine, speaking in Japanese, said he was glad to be back.
</P>
<P>
   Monday and Tuesday, the Mets and the Chicago Cubs will play
alternate exhibitions against the Seibu Lions and the Yomiuri
Giants, and on Wednesday and Thursday, the Mets and the Cubs will
play regular-season games against each other. This will be the
first time a so-called major league game has ever been played
outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will be an ordeal for the players, some of whom are not
amused. Mark McGwire was so opposed to it that he blocked the
Cardinals from taking part, and has criticized the venture as being
driven by money. Valentine concedes that the Pacific Ocean will be
a major block to interleague play, but he said, ``Eventually
they'll have medicine to deal with jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the Americas are already linked in the fertile mind of
Valentine, the first American manager ever imported to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure lasted one year, 1995, but his love for Japan was
just beginning. He mingled. He questioned. He won. He lost. And he
brought things home with him.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent spring training in Florida, Valentine held what he
called ``shag-free practices,'' meaning his pitchers do not loll
around the outfield, shagging flies during batting practice. This
is a direct benefit of Valentine's year as the manager of the Lotte
Marines in the Chiba prefecture of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we get into the weight room or the video room,'' he said.
``We try to use the time more beneficially.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliche from Americans is that the Japanese place too much
stock in the 1,000-grounder workout that leaves players bowed and
bloody.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, people prepare as a group,'' Valentine said. ``Their
practices are very long, almost to the point of monotonous. I think
they do it to excess, but we were not practicing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Japan as a celebrity, having managed six years for
the Texas Rangers and one year with the Mets' Norfolk farm club. He
was a new link between the two continents in a sporting
relationship that began in 1867, when American merchants and
sailors brought the game here. In the second half of the 20th
century, the Japanese began hiring American players.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Yonamine, born in Hawaii of Japanese descent, played 13
years in Japan, spoke the language fluently, and managed the
Chunichi Dragons to a pennant in 1974. Joe Lutz, who had once
coached in Cleveland, managed the Hiroshima Carp briefly in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Don Blasingame, the veteran second baseman from the United
States, played three years with the Nankai Hawks of Osaka, stayed
to coach and manage them for over a decade, and in 1979-80 managed
the Hanshin Tigers. The popular Blazer tried to buck the system by
not overworking his pitchers and playing what he felt was a
consistent lineup, but he resigned after little more than a season.
</P>
<P>
   Never had Japan recruited a manager directly from the United
States until Valentine was courted by the management of Lotte, a
department-store empire with roots in Korea. The general manager
was Tatsuro Hirooka, a former star shortstop and championship
manager _ ``one of the first players to move into management, a
very proud man, impeccable dresser, from the old school,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine argued with umpires until he realized he was getting
nowhere, since he did not speak Japanese and also because a temper
is decidedly counterproductive in that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fit in in Japan,'' Valentine once said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He studied the language via a computer program, with the side
result of becoming hooked on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also noticed the way Japanese bunters do not waste motion by
squaring and pivoting but rather tap the ball from the more natural
batting stance. He has found resistance in teaching that technique
to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was fascinated by the rituals _ the organized
cheerleading sections, often organized by the corporations that own
the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear 10,000 strong, waving flags, doing the wave, blowing
trumpets, it's disconcerting at first,'' Valentine said. ``But it
is part of the game, it's part of the culture. They love sumo
wrestling, and now they have soccer, but for a long time baseball
was their only team sport, so they took parts of all our team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Lotte, they Americanized their game,'' Valentine
added. ``They got rid of the big, heavy drum. They would sing `Take
Me Out to the Ball Game' in the seventh inning, which was neat.
They had songs for the individual players. They made great puns on
the two languages. There was a guy named Iya Omura, so they would
sing `Old MacDonald Had a Farm' and they would chant `Iya-Iya-O.'
It was kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also had fun trying to personalize the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was riding the trains with the fans, talking to kids, all my
idle time out in public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles when he recalls the numerical approach, how in pregame
meetings his coaches would predict the score, saying it felt like a
6-1 game. To the American ear, that sounded impossible, given the
inconsistencies of pitching, but the coaches were serious.
</P>
<P>
   In Lotte, Valentine had a three-year contract to transform Chiba
Lotte from ``second-class citizens,'' but while the Marines
finished second behind Seibu in his first season, he and Hirooka
were already at odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hired me, he fired me, we had a falling out at the end,
regretfully,'' Valentine said the other day. ``It's the only
blemish on my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese baseball has stayed with him. He has gone back on
scouting and good-will missions and has been welcomed by Shigeo
Nagashima, the great third baseman who now manages the Yomiuri
Giants, the Yankees of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine questions the traditional view that the Japanese are
too small to hit for power. Also, competition has narrowed the
baseball gap between nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, if you were behind Nagashima with the Giants,
you stayed in the system forever,'' Valentine said of the Japanese
farm system. ``Now it's loosened up. As some Japanese players come
to the U.S., that develops more exceptional young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine praised unrelated players named Matsui: Kazuo, a
shortstop with Seibu ``who rivals Rey Ordonez in the field,'' and
Hideki, an outfielder with the Giants ``who hits for power and
average, the kind of player any manager would love.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we only had three non-Americans, the way they do, I believe
the Japanese league would be stronger than ours,'' Valentine said,
acknowledging the impact of Latin American stars like Sammy Sosa,
who will be a star attraction this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' manager does not foresee ``a true World Series'' in
the short run, but adds, ``What we are doing is the closest thing
to it _ two American teams playing two Japanese teams just before
the season, not just all-star teams. The real thing. I'm going to
play these games like World Series games.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, he plans to go out and mingle. Many players may
regard this expedition as a pain in their sleep cycle, but for
Bobby Valentine, this is a homecoming, deeply anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sleep on the plane home,'' he said.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ They don't make them much tougher than Siberian
bulldozer operators, so it follows that Roman Khasanov, a
30-year-old excavator from the flat, treeless permafrost of
Yakutia, has little use for politicians who feel people's pain. By
his way of thinking, it was Mikhail Gorbachev and his squishy
notions of perestroika and glasnost _ restructuring and openness _
that brought Russia to ruination in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he took off the handcuffs, he should have done so
slowly,'' Khasanov said as he sat, nursing a vodka hangover with
ulcer medicine, on a train bound to a Mongolia construction job.
``Because now people don't know what to do with their freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he believes Russia needs Vladimir Putin, the acting
president and the man who slapped the cuffs back on Chechnya's
rebels. Putin has the muscle to reimpose order on a chaotic nation,
and come the presidential election Sunday, Khasanov declared
earlier this month, ``I will vote for him with three hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But almost a continent westward, in the Volga River town of
Samara, Boris Fursov says Putin's muscular submission of Chechnya
is reason enough by itself to deny him the presidency. In Soviet
times, he said, maybe one man could impose order. In a democracy,
it is an entire nation's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you the truth about Putin,'' Fursov said over a
snack of bread and apple-and-currant preserves in his two-room
apartment. ``There is an element in his behavior that to my mind
pushes us back in time. And for my son and for my grandson, I would
prefer that they have an open and democratic road to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Fursov, a retired Soviet army officer who devoted much of his
career to the Cold War, says he will vote for Grigory Yavlinsky, a
member of Parliament who is, by most measures, the most
Western-oriented of Russia's presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   What does Russia want in its president? Does it want a strongman
or a man of the people? Does it want to be led back to imperial
glory, or simply, as Russians will say without a hint of irony, to
join the club of civilized nations? Do Russians want a president
who will bind them to Europe and the West, or do they want a
nationalist? Do they want a democrat, or has 10 years of democracy
induced nostalgia for Soviet-style transfers of power?
</P>
<P>
   What pollsters say Russians clearly want is Putin, although his
intentions remain, so far, largely a blank slate. The last
pre-election samples (polling here ended, as the law requires, a
week before the vote) gave Putin as much as 57 percent of the
backing among people who said they planned to vote in the election
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The closest of his 10 rivals, the Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov, drew only about 25 percent; Yavlinsky, the Yabloko party
leader, was third with about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Putin needs only 50 percent of the vote to escape a two-man
runoff, which would take place on April 16. With an additional
expected flood of pro-Putin ballots from the military and some
prisoners, who already have voted, he seems likely to avoid a
second election with room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   But saying the Russians want Putin as their president says
precious little about how or where they want him to lead. For
Putin's brief campaign has cast him as all things to all people: a
brutal warrior against Chechens; a dog lover who cries at funerals;
a supporter of basic rights; a supporter of a crackdown on
politically unruly journalists; an architect of a new rapprochement
with the West; an architect of an anti-Western alliance with China.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the war in Chechnya, a gamble that paid off royally among
voters thirsting for some symbol of national strength, Putin's
actual policies _ as opposed to promises _ have been few and
uncontroversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters are in a situation where they know all the other
candidates, and they know the others aren't suitable,'' said Otto
Latsis, a political analyst and deputy editor of the newspaper
Noviye Izvestiya. ``Putin they don't know. But they also don't know
many things which would push them away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, pollsters and analysts say, Putin, a 47-year-old
former KGB agent who took over as acting president last New Year's
Eve after just four months as prime minister, has managed to remain
remarkably popular precisely because he has religiously shunned any
one ideology. In a nation that, ideologically speaking, has been
exhausted by the brand of Wild East capitalism allowed under
Yeltsin, and before that by the brutal excesses of communism, Putin
has captured the none-of-the-above vote. And it is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Communist
Party is doomed to lose at the polls, at least in its present
incarnation. Its base of support is about 25 percent of the
electorate. The Communists are more popular than Putin only among
voters over 60; below that, their support dwindles almost in lock
step with age.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Western democrats of Yavlinsky's stripe are even worse off,
topping out at perhaps 15 percent of voters, by and large the
young, experts say. Ultranationalists like the flamboyant
legislator Vladimir Zhirinovsky claim perhaps 5 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the voters, like Khasanov, the bulldozer
driver, are united less by strong political beliefs than by the
lack of them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They are like Valery Khubalov, the general manager of a candy
factory in Kazan, the Tatarstan capital a night's train ride due
east of Moscow. Urbane and fluent in English, an occasional
presence at Harvard seminars, he says he backs Putin in the hope
that he will make both federal and regional officials stop abusing
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy is ``in my bones,'' Khubalov said. But ``I have
finally come to the conclusion that we have to go more slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Or like Georgi Vasilevsky, a 59-year-old architect at Terminal,
a St. Petersburg engineering company that was a top-secret Soviet
military complex and has now shrunk from 1,200 workers to 100,
making roughly $35 a month each.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ``is a decisive leader,'' he said. ``I'm sick of the
lawlessness and chaos that plagues Russia. He's the man who can
take on the oligarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or like Inna Kremert, a 32-year-old St. Petersburger:
unemployed; mother of two; foster mother to the infant daughter of
a cousin who recently died.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, Kremert worked at a bank in neighboring
Latvia, where persecution of Russians is persistent; now she
subsists, barely, with pay from odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   She wants one thing, and one thing only, from the next Russian
president: a better life. And she thinks Putin, a native of St.
Petersburg, stands the best chance of delivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to worry about the time in 10 years when my children
will be adults,'' she said this week. ``Where will they live? How
will they buy apartments?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To make life better in Russia, first and foremost it must be
made safe and secure so people can live without fear from crime, so
they will be able to find work and feed their children,'' she said.
``Putin has shown himself to be a man of action; just look at
Chechnya. Maybe he's used too much force. But he's decisive in
tackling problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, Russia's voters do broadly share some
desires. One is that they are democrats _ a word with a sprawling
definition, but one still rooted in a comfortably Western demand
for the right to think and do as they please.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentage of people who do not rely on the government but
only on their own abilities is growing constantly,'' Georgi
Satarov, president of the Information Science for Democracy
Foundation, said in an interview. ``People don't want to part with
freedoms they have already gained. But they also do not want the
style of power they have already witnessed for the last decade, the
past four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Another common desire is, quite naturally, the longing for a
better life _ by which is meant, for the most part, the sort they
see on ever-present television imports or in their increasingly
frequent trips to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russian nationalism has rocketed since last year's clash
with NATO over Yugoslavia put the nation's shrunken role in world
affairs on exquisitely painful display. And Russian disdain for
Western protests against brutality in Chechnya is a direct reaction
to that snub.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, said Igor Bunin, who directs the Moscow-based
Center for Political Technologies Foundation, ``the deep-seated
orientation of Russian society is completely different. It is to
enter European civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority of the population,'' he said, ``the Western
model is a kind of paradise in the future, a star in the distance.
We want to be just as civilized as them, the same kind of
civilization as in Europe. All the sociological polls show that
this is the main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Russia's third presidential election, it is those
conflicting desires on which Putin seems to have gained a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   If voters have a question, it is whether Putin can keep it after
he becomes a democratically elected president, and has to begin
making the tough decisions that seem destined to fragment the vast,
motley collection of interests that has invested in him so far.
</P>
<P>
   Nonna Oznobikhina, 61, a professor at a Vladivostok teachers
college, is trying to wring Marxist ideology out of an education
system that still uses Soviet-era textbooks. She says that she and
her husband, Yuri Sibirtsev, a biologist, are supporting Putin
``with great hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does inspire trust,'' she said. ``I like how he behaves in
public. There is a certain quiet dignity in him, especially in the
way he talks to foreign politicians. But who knows? This is Russia,
and he might turn into something unexpected.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Unable to find enough workers in the booming
economy, American corporations are trying to expand the labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, employers had met their labor needs by hiring
people who were already employed or at least wanted to work. But as
this pool shrinks, employers are increasingly recruiting from among
the 36 million people in the United States between the ages of 16
and 64 who had not sought a job, or even thought about taking one.
</P>
<P>
   Students are one target of this stepped-up recruiting, and so
are the urban poor, retirees, housewives, men and women mustering
out of military service, the handicapped, women coming off welfare
and illegal immigrants not already counted in the labor force.
People already working are being recruited to moonlight in second
jobs, and part-timers are adding hours more easily than in the
past. To get workers, some companies even relocate to pockets of
relatively high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   One thing companies are only rarely doing is offering
significant pay raises. Instead, they are using incentives like
flexible hours, subsidized transportation, child care, store
discounts, free meals, family outings, tuition subsidies and, in
one case here, an $80,000 softball field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are in uncharted territory,'' said Lawrence Katz, a
Harvard University labor economist. ``The last time we had such
tight labor markets, in the 1960s, the baby boomers were beginning
to take jobs, and they fed the labor pool. We don't have them
today, and we really don't know how many people we can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical target of the new recruiting efforts is Conrad Bell, a
junior at the DeVry Institute of Technology here. Bell did not need
a job. Living at home, he had enough pocket money, and the first
payments on his school loans were still in the future. But when a
notice went up on a school bulletin board that H&AMP;R Block was hiring
students skilled in computers to trouble-shoot problems called in
from Block offices around the country, Bell applied and got one of
the jobs. ``Most of my friends now work,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The company has gone out of its way to accommodate the
23-year-old student, juggling schedules so that he can carry four
courses and still work 25 hours a week. Between semesters, he
worked on Tuesdays, then switched to Mondays to attend Tuesday
classes. Nearly 200 other students hired for the tax season get
similar flexible treatment at Block's new technology center here.
</P>
<P>
   The economy may ride, or fall, on the question of how many
Conrad Bells join the work force. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, argues that the pool of people still available to
take jobs has dwindled to the point that employers will have to pay
more in wages to compete for workers and then will push up prices
to cover the higher labor costs. Citing this inflationary danger as
one reason for their actions, the Fed's policy-makers have moved
interest rates up a quarter percentage point five times since last
June to slow the economy, with the latest increase coming last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan's estimate of the number of people still available
for jobs relies on the Labor Department's monthly employment
surveys, which do not count as available the people who say they
are not interested in working. Many of these people are now being
recruited, including Bell, who was busy being a student until he
saw the H&AMP;R Block poster and popped into the labor force. In
addition, the Fed chairman's concerns about inflationary labor
shortages do not reflect the extent to which workers are settling
for intangible benefits, rather than higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly inflationary wage increases are not evident in
national wage statistics or in the Kansas City metropolitan area,
where the unemployment rate of 3.2 percent is nearly a percentage
point less than the nation's 4.1 percent and employers are offering
all the new lures, short of big raises.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case at Block's recently opened
technology center. A quarter of the 800 people working there in the
tax season are students like Bell, who is earning $11.54 an hour,
barely up from last year's rate. Another 200 are low-skilled
customer call-center operators, some of whom commute by municipal
bus from an impoverished neighborhood nearby. H&AMP;R Block has put the
new center, and its jobs, near enough for the operators to get to a
job, one that pays $8 to $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been pressured to raise wages because of the labor
shortage,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni, the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Even some officials in the Clinton administration, despite its
hands-off policy regarding the Federal Reserve, are challenging the
Fed's view that an inflationary labor shortage is developing.
Martin Bailey, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said, ``We don't see wage pressure coming from the labor
market at this time.'' More bluntly, the labor secretary, Alexis
Herman, declared in a recent interview: ``I tell everybody Alan
Greenspan is a wise man, and I don't comment on Fed policy. But
this is a balanced economy that can continue to perform at a very
solid and steady pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference lies in how the experts tally the number
of available workers. Herman counts at least 13 million people
across the nation available for jobs, including 3 million part-time
workers who have told surveyors from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
that they would take more hours if they could get them.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's more conse2vative estimate of 10 million people
available for jobs leaves out the part-timers. He focuses on the
nearly 6 million people who are listed as officially unemployed
because they are actively looking for work, as well as 4 million
others who tell the bureau's surveyors that they have not looked
for work lately but would like a job or might like one in the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's estimate of 10 million would-be workers has declined
from 13 million in January 1996. But both his estimate and Herman's
miss those who are not thinking about working but can be lured into
jobs. The great majority of them are the 36.3 million working-age
civilians who are busy in other activities and see themselves as
not available for work, unless, like Bell, a company's lures change
their mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City's poorest neighborhoods, the statistics miss
hundreds of families ``who don't respond to surveyors or answer the
door or any of that stuff, but want jobs,'' said Clyde McQueen,
president of the Full Employment Council.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The council is a publicly subsidized organization that tries to
get people in poor neighborhoods into jobs, mainly by training them
and then paying for transportation, including bus fare to H&AMP;R
Block's new center and similar job sites. ``The first thing people
here want to know,'' McQueen said, ``is what is the shift time,
does the bus get there and what happens if I have an emergency at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Kansas City is the sweep for new workers more on
display than at Station Casinos, a gaudy, Las Vegas-style hotel and
casino complex that is the biggest of the four casinos along the
Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos opened in 1997, and almost overnight 5,000 new jobs
appeared in greater Kansas City, a considerable impact on a work
force that then numbered 916,000 and now numbers more than 965,000.
The casinos initially bid up wages, offering low-skilled workers
$7.50 to $9 an hour. That drained people from other employers,
including customer call-center operators at Sprint, then earning
less than $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of folks to the casino boats,'' said Mary M.
Hogan, manager of Sprint's call center in suburban Lenexa, Kan.,
``but it is not an issue now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has raised its starting pay to $8.25 an hour. It has also
eased the wage pressure by employing more college students and
offering them nonwage benefits like flexible part-time schedules
and tuition subsidies of $5,250 a year if they stay at least that
long. Station Casinos, employing 2,120 people, has also
soft-pedaled wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more we compete on the whole package,'' said John V.
Finamore, president of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from health insurance, that package includes a child care
center, 10 percent discounts at local merchants, free meals once a
month served by executives, gifts at Christmas, a talent show for
employees and their families and, most recently, the softball
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are soft labor costs that are much more easily absorbed
than fixed wage increases and can be shed more easily,'' Finamore
said.
</P>
<P>
   To find workers, Station Casinos uses specialized employment
agencies that recruit immigrants from Latin America, Africa,
Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere. Ninety employees came out
of retirement and 270 others work at the casino as a second job,
often as weekend blackjack dealers earning $15 an hour, most of it
in tips. For a while, the casino's vans brought people from poor
neighborhoods to work in the hotel, but now a municipal bus _ known
as the Casino Cruiser _ makes the run every half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compete on wages,'' Finamore said. ``All you do is
raise the bar across the city.''

SPORTS COLUMN: COACHES CORNER, OLD AND NEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Just before Friday's regional semifinal game
between Oklahoma State and Seton Hall, Eddie Sutton and Tommy
Amaker made the customary walk to midcourt to shake hands. Sutton,
the 64-year-old Oklahoma State head coach, smiled at the
34-year-old Amaker and said, ``I've been coaching longer than you
are old.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker admitted that Sutton's quip caught him off guard. ``He
was trying to intimidate me,'' Amaker laughed. ``Trying to rattle
me, but I didn't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State squeaked out a 68-66 victory to advance to the
regional championship game. But the victory had less to do with
Sutton's age and experience, than with the swollen left ankle of
Shaheen Holloway, Seton Hall's senior point guard,
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Sutton faces the University of Florida coached by the
34-year-old Billy Donovan. On Friday, Donovan defeated Duke coached
by the 53-year-old Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about playing against teams coached by Amaker
and Donovan, Sutton smiled. ``It makes me feel a little older than
I want to feel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan played for Rick Pitino at Providence. Donovan remembered
his own NCAA tournament odyssey in 1987 when Providence reached the
Final Four. He didn't savor the moment then but is relishing every
moment this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy every game a lot,'' he said. ``Because, you know what?
I don't know the next time I'm getting back here. That's the thing
you realize its so fragile; it's so fragile that you'd better enjoy
it while you're here''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker made the same point after his team lost to Oklahoma
State. Players, he said, young people in general, always feels
there's a tomorrow. That's what makes the NCAA tournament so
devastating to the losers: there is no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a chance, you better get it while you're there
because you may never get back,'' Amaker said. ``It's very
difficult to advance and survive in this tournament _ no matter how
good you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan and Amaker are now the sages. They preach and lecture,
tell their players to savor the experience of reaching the Round of
16, playing in the NCAA tournament. With so many players leaving
school earlier the value of the experience is missed altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys when they are here for a year don't really
understand, `` Donovan said. ``They get a little taste, but they
don't realize what its all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battier, and Carrawell,'' he said, referring to the Duke
seniors Shane Battier and Chris Carrawell, ``understand what it's
all about because they've been through it for so many years and
they understand what the preparation's like to get there. Sometimes
you have guys that are young, they stay for a year or two and
they're gone. They never understand what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker and Donovan entered college the same year _ Amaker at
Duke and Donavon at Providence. Amaker was Krzyzewski's assistant
for nine seasons, Donovan was on Pitino's coaching staff at
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's staff replaced Eddie Sutton's in 1988 in the aftermath
of a recruiting scandal that wound up with Kentucky being placed on
probation. The old pillars of the college coaching industry are
being reinforced and replaced by new pillars. Donovan and Amaker
are part of a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's changing; when I say its changing, I think the
profession is changing,'' Donovan said. ``I look at myself 11 years
ago being with Coach Pitino. College basketball has changed because
Dean Smith has retired, John Thompson has retired, you have a lot
big, big figures who, when you look at institutions the coach comes
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's changed. With players leaving and going pro, with all
the recruiting and how crazy everything is, I think a lot of
athletic directors are going with young, energetic, vibrant guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said he wondered how the Suttons and Krzyzewskis have
carried on season after season and doubted that he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you right now: There's no way in my mind I
ever think I could ever coach as long as Dean Smith,'' Donovan
said. ``I may not have the opportunity to do that _ they may get
rid of me. But there no way I could physically handle at this
level, coaching until I'm 55, 60 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said he doesn't think the new crop of young coaches will
stay in the business for lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be surprised if they coach that long; they should be able
to make enough money to where they don't have to,'' he said. ``When
I started out, I made $4,500 the first year I coached, teaching
five U.S. history classes, assistant football coach, head
basketball coach in high school _ $500 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker said he can't see being a lifer, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marvel at the people who have been in this business that
long,'' he said. ``You look around guys have been doing it 20, 25,
30 years, 40 years. This is the end of my third year and I feel I'm
wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   But every coach feels that way at the end of a long season. Then
they look up and five years have passed, then 10, then 20 years.
Finally, one day Amaker will walk to mid-court to shake hands with
an opposing head coach and playfully remind him that he has been
coaching longer than his rival is old.
</P>
<P>
   Amaker laughed at the thought of it but conceded the
possibility. Once the game is in your blood, getting it out is next
to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a loss your feelings are different,'' he said. ``If we
had won this game tonight I would have said `I want to do this
until I'm a hundred.'' &QL;

   In Havana, everything waits. Forty-one years after Fidel Castro
came down from the hills to claim Cuba's then-vibrant capital, the
island has become, says photographer Stephen Crowley, ``a giant
waiting room.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, Cuba has lost its place in the
superpower confrontation and lost its life-sustaining subsidies
from the Soviet Union. Virtually no Latin American governments look
admiringly on Castro or his regime anymore. Instead, 11 million
people live out the tail end of a revolution, on an island cut off
and no longer of vital interest to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   So Cubans have made lives out of waiting. They wait for a house
to move into, for their turn at the bread line, to buy newspapers
that later in the day will be used as toilet paper. They wait for
dollars, for a visa to the United States, for a ride, for a package
with life-saving medicines, for the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There is neither joy nor community in their desuetude.
Contemplating the length of another day, people sit on the curb or
listlessly stand next to each other, isolated, wrapped up in their
own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the harsh tropical light, only the architecture seems
alive. The sensuous curves of Art Deco and the concrete and steel
of a later era are unexpectedly fluid. Whole buildings seem to
change by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the people of Cuba, together, yet alone, wait as if
suspended in time, in the calm before the storm. &QR;

ATTENDANTS UNION IN TENTATIVE DEAL WITH US AIRWAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Airways and its flight attendants union reached a tentative
agreement Saturday morning, more than three hours past a strike
deadline, preventing a shutdown of the United States' sixth-largest
airline that would have snarled tens of thousands of travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached shortly before 3:30 a.m. after a marathon
eight-day round of negotiations, was announced at a Washington
hotel, and when word went out to attendants gathered at vigils in
cities like Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C., the workers whooped
with joy.
</P>
<P>
   The accord gives the airline's 10,000 flight attendants a
substantial raise, which was one of the main demands of the
Association of Flight Attendants, while US Airways said the deal
helped advance its primary goal, to keep its costs competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the deal, Lynn Lenosky, the union's chief negotiator,
said, ``The contract is a five-year agreement flight attendants can
be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers with US Airways reservations expressed relief that
their trips would not be turned topsy-turvy by a shutdown during an
especially busy season, when many schools and colleges are on
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lotstein, who was at La Guardia Airport in New York at 8
a.m. Saturday to fly to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for a golfing trip,
said: ``I am thrilled to be down here. We have been up all night
trying to find out what's happening. It's been a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the agreement would give the attendants a 5
percent cash bonus when the agreement is ratified and a 5 percent
raise when the contract is signed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the attendants will receive 2 percent raises 18
months into the contract, and additional 2 percent raises after 30
months and 42 months.
</P>
<P>
   Several flight attendants interviewed said they were pleased
that for the first time they would get special holiday pay. Under
the agreement, the attendants are to receive time and a half for
working New Year's Day, Memorial Day and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zack, a union spokesman, acknowledged that the agreement
contained some work-rule changes on complex issues like scheduling,
which the airline sought to increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline says it's cost-competitive,'' Zack said. ``That's
what we wanted to help them achieve. The flight attendants I've
spoken with say it's a very fair, very good agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual pay for the flight attendants ranges from $17,145 for
new attendants to a maximum of $36,918 for those with 14 or more
years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, US Airways said: ``The AFA leadership and the
company's management worked extremely hard to put in place an
agreement that works for our flight attendants and allows the
company to compete in the marketplace. We are very pleased that we
were able to do so and that there will be no interruption in
service or inconvenience for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to discuss details of the agreement
or what the company gained in the accord. In the days immediately
after a tentative agreement is reached, company officials often
hesitate to talk about what they gained for fear of angering union
members and thus making it harder to obtain ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The union's executive council now has to review the agreement
and decide whether to recommend it to the rank and file. If it
does, the flight attendants will be asked to vote on the accord,
with the entire ratification process expected to last up to 45
days.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening an unconventional strategy, the flight attendants
had said that if there was no agreement by 12:01 a.m. Saturday,
they would wreak havoc on the airline by disrupting 49 of the
airline's busiest routes. The airline has 2,200 flights a day
carrying 150,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of this strategy, called CHAOS, for Create Havoc
Around Our System, was to maximize disruption, while allowing most
flight attendants to continue working and drawing salaries. The
union said it would not disrupt every flight on those 49 routes but
would pick its spots, shutting them down on some days and letting
them fly on others.
</P>
<P>
   But airline officials responded with an unorthodox strategy of
their own, saying that if no agreement was reached by the strike
deadline, the airline would shut down its operations instead of
being whipsawed by the union's planned partial strike.
</P>
<P>
   A strike or a shutdown would have hurt the eastern third of the
nation most, because the airline has 36 percent of the region's
market and has hubs in Pittsburgh, Charlotte and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   David Castelveter, an airline spokesman, said operations had
returned to normal Saturday. ``Operations are going well,'' he
said. ``It's business as usual. We're operating a full schedule.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers holding reservations for Saturday's flights said
they had stayed up into the middle of the night to learn whether
their flights would depart.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Driver of Albany, N.Y., said she had called the airline's
800 telephone number every half-hour until 3:30 a.m., when the
recording informed her of the settlement. She was in a joyous mood
when she flew Saturday from Albany to Greensboro, N.C., to visit
friends.
</P>
<P>
   During a stopover in Charlotte, she said: ``I feel great. All my
plans were on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Galbreath, who was worried about her plans to fly
Saturday from Charlotte to her home in Little Rock, Ark., said she
was delighted that there was a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know if we'd be able to get back,'' she said
Saturday morning at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. ``I
got up at 4 o'clock, and the news was on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' last contract expired in 1996, and the
two sides have held sporadic negotiations since. But on March 17,
negotiators, led by Lenosky and the airline's chief executive,
Rakesh Gangwol, began meeting for intense negotiations at the
Wyndham Washington Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest W. Dubester, chairman of the National Mediation Board,
joined the talks to prod the two sides to resolve their dispute.
His board had ordered a 30-day cooling-off period that barred the
union from walking out until 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the middle of the week, we were pretty much going around
the clock,'' he said in an interview Saturday. ``We had different
folks together at different times. It's analogous to shuttle
diplomacy. Sometimes have a full negotiating committee, sometimes
just the top two people.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law gives President Clinton the power to order the
airline or the union to continue normal operations for 60 days, but
labor experts said he was not considering such an order, for fear
of angering the AFL-CIO in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said on Friday that they were briefing the
president on the talks, and on Friday night the White House issued
a statement saying that Clinton ``urges the two sides to stay at
the table and redouble their efforts to reach an agreement as soon
as possible. They owe that to each other and to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had pressured the union to accept a formula, known
as ``parity plus one,'' that had been agreed to by the company's 10
other unions, including the pilots, mechanics and ticket agents.
That formula would link the attendants' pay to that of their
counterparts at the nation's four largest airlines, plus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lenosky, the union negotiator, criticized that formula and
rallied attendants against it, insisting that it would reduce their
wages and benefits. After the agreement was reached, neither side
was calling the agreement a ``parity plus one'' formula; instead
the two sides were calling it a ``cost-competitive formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Pask, a flight attendant for two years, said Saturday at
the airport in Rochester, N.Y., that she was pleased by the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud to stand behind the people who had been doing
this for 30 and 40 years,'' Pask said. ``I'm glad we didn't have to
walk out, for the customers' sake, but it was important to keep
this a professional and serious career.''

A LITTLE SHOP IN PAKISTAN TUNES INTO CLINTON ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Cotton Terminal is a men's store here in
Pakistan's capital. The owner keeps a small TV on a shelf, wedged
between a stack of khaki trousers and another of blue jeans.
Usually, the set comes on only for a big cricket match.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday the featured show was Bill Clinton, who had come to
Islamabad for a quick five-hour stop after five days in India. He
was to address the nation on state television.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very painful thing for us, five hours in Pakistan
and only five days in India,'' said Wasi Nayib, one of the
employees at the small shop. ``India is our adversary, and Bill
Clinton should have been fair to both sides. But we will watch him
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In itself, this was unusual. Most Pakistanis did not tune in. It
was presumed that Clinton would be speaking in English in a nation
where people are far more likely to speak Urdu, Punjabi and Pushto.
Many believed the speech would merely be an opportunity to see an
important man moving his lips.
</P>
<P>
   But Cotton Terminal is an upscale store in the Jinnah Super
Market. And most workers and customers felt they knew enough
English to catch about half of what was being said. At noon, they
began viewing the Pakistani state television station, PTV, which
had cameras at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans prefer the Indians because the Indians have more
money,'' Nayib said seriously, a remark that drew the approval of
the 10 other people around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the PTV announcers were upbeat. If Pakistanis felt slighted
about the brevity of Clinton's visit, the state newscasters gushed
with praise for the American president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a musician as well as a politician, you know,'' Naveed
Shahzad, one of the announcers, said as the television screen
showed a still-empty runway.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-host agreed, ``Yes, he is a very versatile man.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at the Cotton Terminal considered most of this patter
to be nonsense, but there was not much competition for their
attention. The main roads had been shut down by soldiers with
automatic weapons. The key security force was the army's 10th
corps, the same outfit that had been central in the Oct. 12 coup
that brought Pakistan military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Most civilians stayed home, unable to get to their jobs or
schools. The streets were eerily quiet, as if it was a holiday:
Bill Clinton Day. Some storekeepers at the usually busy shopping
plaza had begun their own game of cricket on the walkway outside
their shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when is he coming already?'' Nayib said glumly to his
friends in the store.
</P>
<P>
   But then the announcers began getting excited. A plane had
landed, which they dubbed Air Force One, and they began talking in
awe about how the aircraft is a fully equipped flying office.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here he is!'' proclaimed Shahzad, a well-known
commentator, as people began exiting the big jet. ``President
Clinton is distinguished by his height and the shock of gray in his
hair,'' she said. ``One can see him moving leisurely toward us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this was merely the press plane and the announcers had
mistaken a tall reporter for Clinton. Ten minutes later, a smaller
plane set down, lowered its staircase and men in dark suits began
slowly stepping down to the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it's no mistake,'' Shahzad said enthusiastically.
``He's here! There's so much energy in the air, it's almost
crackling.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this was merely a decoy plane transporting a few
low-level officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's not coming,'' said Usman Ghani, one of the people
watching at the store. ``Maybe he's afraid Osama bin Laden is
waiting on the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 12:39 p.m. the president did arrive, traveling in an
executive jet as part of elaborate security precautions. ``Here's
our hero,'' Nayib said sarcastically to his friends, who then broke
away from their chores.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inevitably, just as one would expect in the United States,
some wise guy raised his palms toward the television and feigned
puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Monica?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Some moments later, a wrinkled, bent-over man came into the
store, a long white beard flowing from his face and a set of prayer
beads moving through his fingers. His name is Haji Shaukat Ali, 70,
and he was a friend of the store's deceased owner. He is regarded
as an elder, and the younger people wanted to know what he thought
of the president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   He considered this question carefully. ``As Muslims, it is
mandatory for us to show him hospitality,'' he said. ``But he is
not here to help us. He is here for his own agenda. And we do not
need him. Americans are not the superpower. The only superpower is
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the people in the store nodded with approval.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the visit, a poll by Gallup Pakistan had measured
opinions about the visit. Only 24 percent thought anything fruitful
would emerge from Clinton's meetings with the nation's military
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Americans had now tilted to India over Pakistan, 25
percent said yes; 57 percent said America is not really a friend of
either. Of those sampled, 71 percent thought there was a chance of
war with India; 47 percent expected the war to go nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for the Clinton speech seemed interminable. He was
supposed to talk at 4 p.m., but that hour came and went and even
the PTV punditry _ journalists and scholars _ ran out of things to
say. As people waited for the American president, the television
station ran a documentary about wood carving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very late,'' one of the store clerks complained. ``Maybe
he did bring Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 5:30, the speech was broadcast. To people's
surprise, PTV provided a simultaneous translation in Urdu. The shop
became very quiet. There were no more Monica jokes. A foreigner was
telling their nation some difficult things about the threat of
nuclear war and the loss of democracy and the awful consequences of
economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The speech lasted less than 15 minutes, and when it was over, no
one said anything for a long while until the silence became
awkward.
</P>
<P>
   At last, a man named Tariq Hameed spoke up. ``Clinton is
right,'' he said simply.
</P>
<P>
   And again everyone nodded.

   GLOBALIZATION-CONFLICTS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For seven years,
Bill Clinton has tried to offer the world's conflict-prone nations
a new commitment to globalization as the cure for an old fear of
Armageddon. He made the case again last week racing through South
Asia. It proved a hard sell. Meanwhile, events in two other
flashpoints _ the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait _ were also
testing the Clinton mantra, which seemed so reasonable just a few
years ago: that sharing in global prosperity will inevitably tame
old nationalisms and make the world safer. Each of those disputes,
of course, is driven by its own history of conflict. But they all
illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the
market when nationalistic impulses flare up. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOFT-MONEY-REVIEW (Washington) _ In 1988, Bob Farmer, the top
fund-raiser man for Michael Dukakis and the Democrats, and Bob
Mosbacher, finance chairman for George Bush and the Republicans,
launched the first national programs to raise soft money _ the
large, unrestricted gifts to the two parties by wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions. Both Farmer and
Mosbacher have lived to regret their fiscal ingenuity and now favor
campaign finance reform. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUITS-TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The legal system has begun
to overtake the legislative process as the vehicle to resolve
contentious debates, particularly over controversial products when
Congress is unwilling to act. Both the tobacco and firearms
litigation, for example, were highly organized assaults on targeted
industries. Previously, lawsuits had been brought by individuals
against both industries with little financial success or effect on
company policies. The use of concentrated legal firepower to set
social policy has stirred sharp debate. Some legal experts have
decried such lawsuits as abusive. Others view them as a problematic
but a needed counterbalance to the powerful control that companies
and interest groups can exert over Congress. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS-SOCIETY-REVIEW (Undated) _ This year's Academy Award
nominations include a melange of comedies, dramas and absurd
flights of fancy that once again speak to the national psyche.
Judging from the contents of these films, the country appears to be
a mess. Some thoughts on what that little man of gold might be
saying about America. By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   BOYCOTTS-REDUX-REVIEW (Undated) _ Not since the 1970s, when
grape workers and the anti-apartheid movement were holy causes for
millions of Americans, have so many groups embraced the boycott as
a weapon. ``The times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts,''
says Jeff Faux of the Economic Policy Institute. ``We have more of
a consumer culture, and people see themselves more as consumers
today. While people are participating less in the political
process, as consumers they see that one way they can exercise power
is by where they spend their money and where they don't.'' By
Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   HAIRDRESSERS-WIFEBEATING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Remember Clairol's
catchy slogan from the 1950s, ``Hair color so natural, only her
hairdresser knows for sure''? In recognition that hair stylists may
know more secrets about their clients than merely cosmetic ones,
new programs are being established by community-based organizations
and state agencies to help hairdressers identify signs of domestic
violence. These programs are trying to take advantage of the
special bond that often exists between hairdressers and their
clients. By Jeff Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL-REVIEW (Undated) _ The White e-mail case case may
highlight the persistent assumption among e-mail users _ despite
overwhelming evidence to the contrary _ that their electronic
correspondence is private. (It may also highlight the misconception
that historians no longer have paper trails to follow.) People
continue to send sensitive e-messages that they would never commit
to a written document _ and save them. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-GURU-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ From 1956 to 1977, Jean
Shepherd held weeknight seminars on a New York radio station that
were part Kabuki, part commedia dell'arte, part Uncle Remus. In his
flat, nasal Indiana twang, playing all the parts, and the
occasional kazoo, he oozed into the darkened bedrooms of East Coast
America on the battery power of cheap Japanese transistor radios.
The meandering stories he told were usually about him but they also
seemed to be about us. What was he? Social commentator? Cult
leader? Or just a manic kid from a blue-collar background
discovering his subversive id. Excerpts from a recent radio
tribute.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EXTRADITE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The initial rulings against
Chile's Gen. Augusto Pinochet caused some former U.S. officials to
wonder whether they too could some day be extradited _ let us say,
if the United States lost its position as the world's sole
superpower _ and put on trial any time that any judge in the world
accuses them of human rights violations. Imagine, for instance,
that Oliver North is arrested while vacationing in Switzerland and
then extradited to Lebanon for his role in the U.S. bombings of
Libya in 1986. By Jayson Blair.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Vladimir Putin's most serious
effort since assuming the leadership of Russia has been prosecuting
the brutal military operation in Chechnya, intended to prove that
he is the firm hand that can rebuild a strong Russian state. But
far more complex and difficult tests await him on that very score.
His real challenge will be the appointments, the policies and
economic reforms he undertakes to bring Russia back from the brink
of disintegration. By Patrick E. Tyler.

CLINTON ASKS PAKISTAN TO TREAD LIGHTLY IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ In an effort to defuse tensions in a
region that he has described as the most volatile in the world,
President Clinton on Saturday asked the military leader of Pakistan
to show restraint in Kashmir, where Pakistan and India most
recently battled last summer, and to reopen a dialogue with his
Indian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than an hour and a half with Gen. Pervaiz
Musharraf, Clinton received no assurances, said a senior
administration official who participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke no new ground on Kashmir,'' the official said after
the session. ``We heard no new assurances from the general.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India, the world's two newest nuclear powers,
regularly skirmish in Kashmir, which has been the main issue
between overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India since the
two nations were created from the British Raj in 1947, and the
status of the Himalayan territory was left perilously unresolved.
The Clinton administration believes that incursions by
Pakistani-backed militants into Indian-held Kashmir have the
potential to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, battles in the mountainous Kargil region of Kashmir
were regarded as the first direct combat between two nuclear powers
_ fighting that was halted after Clinton persuaded Pakistan's then
civilian prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to back down. Three months
later, Sharif was ousted by Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who decided to come to Pakistan after intense
disagreement within the administration, spent barely six hours in
this country, arriving from an extensive five-day tour of India
under some of the most elaborate security precautions ever devised
for his travels.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on when he would return Pakistan to democracy at the
national level, Musharraf offered no timetable, the administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   After his apparently grim meeting with Musharraf, Clinton made a
direct appeal to the Pakistani people in a live television
broadcast in which he addressed them as friends of the United
States. Instead of looking toward a future of economic collapse and
potential war, the people should choose the path of economic
security and peace, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the right vision rooted in tomorrow's promise, not in
yesterday's pain, with a new dialogue, not destruction, Pakistan
can fulfill its destiny as a beacon of democracy in the Muslim
world,'' Clinton said. If Pakistanis choose this path, he promised,
``The United States will walk with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said the president had stressed to
Musharraf that there could be no military solution in Kashmir by
incursions across the Line of Control, as the border between
Pakistani- and Indian-held territory is known.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked specifically for ``restraint, respect for the
Line of Control, rejection of violence and return to dialogue,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much movement on other issues, either.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked the general to take action against terrorist
groups operating in Pakistan and to help pressure the Taliban
government in Afghanistan to bring to justice Osama bin Laden, the
terrorist who the United States believes is responsible for the
bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The general, as he has in the past, said he would work with the
Taliban leadership on the Osama bin Laden case, the official said.
But so far, the general has failed to fulfill his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters as Clinton was leaving Islamabad,
Musharraf said he and the American president got along very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of 45 minutes, we spoke for two hours,'' he said.
``He's a golfer and I also am a golfer. He told me he is a 12
handicap, and I would like to challenge him on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The general noted that he had discussed terrorism with his
visitor, but did not go beyond previous declarations that he
``denounced terrorism in all its forms.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Taliban, the general said he assured Clinton ``that I
would like to engage the Taliban in Afghanistan and take up the
issue of any sanctuaries for any terrorists or training that might
be going on in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of nonproliferation, the general pledged that
Pakistan would not be a source for the export of nuclear
technology, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   As the official ticked off the list of items on the president's
agenda with the general, it was clear there was a recitation of
long-held views on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said the official: ``We've made an effort to make our
position clear at the highest level. We didn't expect to come in an
hour and persuade the leadership of the wisdom of our position.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one point of the hotly debated stop in Pakistan, White
House officials said, was to try to keep the lines of communication
open. Should the situation deteriorate sharply in Kashmir _ as the
administration fears _ Clinton is now in a better position to deal
directly with Musharraf, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the administration will be able to argue that Clinton
tried his best, by coming here, to avert a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also brought up the trial of the former prime minister,
Sharif, who is accused of hijacking, treason and attempted murder.
If convicted, Sharif could face the death penalty, and Clinton on
Saturday asked the general not to execute him. In reply, the
general explained that he was not a vindictive man but that the
matter was up to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As he had in New Delhi, India, Clinton made clear to the general
that the United States would not mediate in the Kashmir crisis, the
White House official said. This was also a message that Musharraf
did not want to hear: Unlike the Indians, the Pakistani leader
would like the Kashmir dispute to be settled by international
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The signals from Musharraf in the days before Clinton's arrival
were not promising. The Pakistani leader missed an opportunity to
send a positive message on his national day on Thursday when he
made a major speech.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of announcing that local elections would be held this
year, as he had indicated earlier, the general pushed the date back
to next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the general has consistently talked in recent weeks about
the Islamic militants in Kashmir, who the administration says are
backed by the Pakistani regime, as freedom fighters committed to a
jihad, or holy war. The administration regards several of these
groups as terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan asserts that Kashmir, with a large Muslim majority,
should have the right to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan.
Secular India claims Kashmir as one of its states.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions behind the issue were vividly on display in some of
the banners along the route taken by Clinton's motorcade. ``You
were fair in Kosovo,'' said one, referring to NATO's bombing
campaign to deter Serbian repression against Kosovo's largely
Muslim Albanian majority. ``Why not in Kashmir?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is politically untenable for a Pakistani leader to appear as
though he is bending to an American diktat. Sharif's decision to
pull back from the Indian side of the Line of Control last summer
is thought to have been one factor behind his ouster in October by
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the general stands another, perhaps even tougher,
commander, Gen. Mohammad Aziz, the chief of general staff of the

   Clinton arrived from Bombay, India, under elaborate security
precautions. At the Bombay airport, he walked to the door of a
military C-17 aircraft, shook hands with dignitaries as though he
were going to board that aircraft, and then slipped around the
front of the plane to board an unmarked, smaller white jet that was
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This aircraft, an Air Force version of a Gulfstream, known as a
C-20, flew Clinton, his national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and several other
advisers to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   From the Islamabad airport, Clinton drove in a motorcade through
deserted streets to the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's unmarked plane was accompanied by another Air Force
Gulfstream, which was painted with the familiar blue and white of
Air Force 1 and marked ``United States of America.'' This was the
decoy plane with Secret Service agents on board and it arrived
first, followed soon after by the president's plane. Many of
Clinton's staff and reporters covering his trip were flown in on a
military C-17 aircraft.

EVIDENCE SHOWS UGANDA CULT HELD AN EERIE PRELUDE TO FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUTOMA, Uganda _ At least some of the 153 people killed at a
secluded cult compound in southwestern Uganda died several weeks
before hundreds of followers of the doomsday cult died in a raging
inferno in their church eight days ago, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, set at the end of a narrow dirt path, was set on
fire just hours before the church inferno on March 17 in which at
least 330 people died. The fire at the compound gutted the five
small dwellings on the site and scorched much of the surrounding
earth in an eerie prelude to the catastrophe that then unfolded in
the village of Kanungu, where the cult, known as the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, made its home.
</P>
<P>
   The fire here, and the discovery of the bodies of people who
were killed apparently weeks or even months ago, have bolstered the
growing sense among investigators that what happened in the Kanungu
church was, on some level, a carefully orchestrated act by the
cult's leader, Joseph Kibwetere, and some of his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we prove that they are dead, we want them to answer
charges of murder,'' Assuman Mugenyi, the chief spokesman for the
National Police Service, said Saturday in a telephone interview
from Kampala, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly overwhelmed by their grisly discoveries, police
officials said that international help for the underequipped
Ugandan police force would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find clues about the cult and about what happened at
Kanungu, investigators have been combing other sites where the cult
operated. When they arrived here on Thursday, an investigator
spotted unnatural depressions in the ground in three places.
</P>
<P>
   When diggers began excavating the ditches on Friday, the toll
was staggering: 153 bodies _ 20 in one grave, 45 in another, and 88
in the third, Mugenyi said. Of the dead, 59 were children, and
everyone, it appeared, had been killed, he said. Some of them had
been strangled and others had been slashed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the massacre at Kanungu, in which everyone died at once,
the killings here appear to have occurred at the very least over a
period of weeks, Mugenyi said. ``Some of them looked a bit fresh,
with blood and hair still on them, but others had been decaying for
some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site here, set at the end of a narrow dirt path, was used by
the cult for inducting new members and introducing them to its
ways, a senior police investigator said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place for indoctrination,'' Terense Kinyera, the
regional head of criminal investigations for the Ugandan police,
said Saturday after meeting with other investigators here. ``People
were brought here for a few days before being moved to Kanungu.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found here were examined by medical investigators and
then buried en masse in a grave dug on the edge of one the
buildings, not far from their original resting places. Saturday,
empty boxes of surgical gloves used in the grizzly recovery
littered the site.
</P>
<P>
   With staffing limited and rough terrain making travel to the
scenes difficult, investigators have been slowed in their search
for evidence and limited in what avenues of inquiry they can
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week after the Kanungu fire, investigators were only
beginning to search another of the cult's sites, in the neighboring
village of Bushenyi. And investigators will never have the type of
forensic evidence that could have been gleaned from examination in
a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But removing the bodies would have been an enormous logistical
challenge, even for a police force with far more staff and
resources than the Ugandans can muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big problem for us because our police force is not
fully equipped,'' Mugenyi said. ``If we could get some
international assistance, we would welcome it. We need some
experts, especially on homicide, to help reinforce our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty to 30 investigators are assigned to the case, he said,
and ``even those resources are not enough for them to do thorough
work.''

INDIAN FORCES KILL 5 SUSPECTED IN SIKH MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, Kashmir _ In a shootout with Islamic militants Saturday,
Indian soldiers killed at least five men suspected in the killing
of 35 Sikhs in Kashmir last week week.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers cordoned off Pacharthan Pathribal, a village 50 miles
south of Srinagar, and opened fire on a pair of houses where seven
militants were believed to be hiding, police said. The militants
returned fire, and in a two-hour gun battle five rebels were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Police later blew up the houses where the two remaining
militants were hiding, but did not immediately know whether they
escaped or were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The government has identified Hizbul Mujahedeen, one of a dozen
groups fighting to separate Kashmir from India, as one of two rebel
organizations responsible for the massacre of villagers in Chati
Singhpura, about five miles from Pacharthan Pathribal.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir's director general of police, Gurbachan Jagat, said
information that led the authorities to the militants' hideout was
provided by a member of Hizbul Mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   Jagat said the militants appeared to be foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certain that they were the killers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the massacre on Monday, gunmen shot 35 Sikh men after
separating them from the rest of the villagers. The shootings took
place as President Clinton was about to begin a state visit to
India, with the declared objective of trying to reduce tensions
between India and Pakistan. Kashmir is divided between the two
nations, with both claiming the Himalayan territory in its
entirety.
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, suspected militants shot and killed five
people in Budan, 120 miles north of Jammu, the winter capital of
Indian-controlled Kashmir, late on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the militants entered two adjoining houses in the
village and began firing at the residents. Two men and three women
were killed. Three people were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The militants later escaped into a nearby forest, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, police said.

   BONFIRE _ It is one of the most venerated of Aggie traditions:
the annual burning of the Texas A&AMP;M bonfire. But even as it has
evolved into a mainstay of A&AMP;M life, university officials have
always insisted that it is a student endeavor. But documents over
four decades highlight nagging safety problems that the bonfire
posed _ and that never seemed to be resolved. Texas A&AMP;M University
officials have insisted they had no reason to believe that the
bonfire would ever collapse. But more than 10,000 pages of
documents released after the deadly 1999 collapse show that chronic
safety risks went uncorrected for at least four decades, partly
because of ineffective oversight by university officials. (Gamboa,

transatlantic trip from England, all because of his long-ago
insistence on being treated with respect. Yet, for the Kings of
Albany, Preston King's homecoming was the latest in a long line of
journeys _ both literal and metaphorical _ in search of dignity for
themselves and others. These travels are a theme of a rich family
history. They have taken generations of Kings along country roads,
across the continent, over oceans and beyond racial barriers. The
first steps were taken when Clennon Washington King, who would
become the patriarch of a remarkable family, set off on foot from a
Florida Panhandle hamlet called Two Egg determined to reach

year with a farm family in this rural region, and report on a way

 &HT;    
 &HT;    A changing way of life for tobacco farmers
 &HT;    By Mary Schulken
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.C. Spring comes to the farm in rows as neat as
pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   Red and green tractors slice fallow ground with sharp blades,
turning up a promise repeated every year.
</P>
<P>
   Another beginning. Another season on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell what kind of tractor grandpa has,'' W.C. Moore tells his
two grandsons, who are bouncing around an easy chair in the living
room of a white farmhouse set back off highway 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red'' one 4-year-old offers in a string of words that are not
quite clear to adult ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Deere'' says the other tow-headed 4-year-old, a fact the
first boy loudly disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa and Grandmama smile from opposite ends of a long blue
couch, legs crossed toward each other. Their faces tell it plainly:
They would rather be having this conversation than doing anything
else on an unseasonable March morning.
</P>
<P>
   It is an everyday scene in this pleasant room, banter between
grandchild and grandparent, repeated as their lives play out within
easy reach of each other on this farm that is the center of their
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a rare scene, too. And becoming more rare with every
day that passes.
</P>
<P>
   More flue-cured tobacco is grown in Pitt County, North Carolina,
than anywhere else in the nation. The culture and the economy are
rooted in tending the leaf, and in the self-reliant way of life
such labor demands. Yet as court rulings, public opinion and
pressure from Washington alter the fortunes of tobacco, change has
made its way into the fields.
</P>
<P>
   There will be fewer and fewer lives like the ones Betty and W.C.
Moore of Bethel live, shaped and bound by the rituals of passing
seasons on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   A GOOD LIVING
</P>
<P>
   Sunny week-day mornings with kids are nothing new in the
150-year-old house the Moores share near Bethel. They've spent
almost all the days of their 40-year marriage here, near each
other. He has worked the fields and the tractors. She has worked
beside him, and balanced the books. Both have tended the family.
Their three grown offspring live barely out of sight: one up the
road, another across the field, a third beyond the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Grandchildren come and go nearly every day in this house where
peanut butter and jelly and peaches are shared at lunchtime and
grandpa tests the biceps of growing boys between bites. A framed
picture over the kitchen counter says ``Farming is everybody's
bread and butter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made us a good living so we don't have to
penny-pinch,'' Betty says. ``In that time he and I have been able
to spend a lot of time together, a lot of quality time, because we
were here on the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Family is the focus of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to get up and go off in the morning to a job
and then we'd have to wait for daddy to come home in the
afternoon,'' she said. ``That, I thought, was something worth no
amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   You can feel the measure of that closeness in the Moore's easy
give and take with their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collin, where did you get that name?'' William Collin Moore
asks his namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Collin, blue-eyed and impish, shrugs his shoulders, says
nothing, grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don' know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody obviously didn't teach you very well,'' says Betty,
giving Grandpa a look.
</P>
<P>
   Like most farmers in this rural region or North Carolina,
tobacco is the Moore's cash crop. It has paid most of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them smoke. But they do not believe the federal
government should keep people from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our choice,'' says W.C. ``It's anybody's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   And they do not think growing tobacco is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing out of all this that bothers me is that we're doing
the same thing as our fathers and grandfathers did and it's always
been a hard, decent living,'' says Betty. ``All of a sudden it
becomes corrupt and you have a stigma on you.''
</P>
<P>
   TENDING THE LAND
</P>
<P>
   W.C. Moore has a place he calls an office in the metal building
that houses the farm operation. And he has a place in his home
where he studies maps of the land he tends, and does planning.
</P>
<P>
   But the cab of his white and blue Ford F250 diesel pick-up truck
is where he manages what goes on in the fields, connected by a cell
phone and a business band radio. On a spring day the radio crackles
with questions from his five full-time employees. After a winter of
maintaining equipment inside the farm's metal building, his workers
are out in the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two tractors discin' land and one guy rippin' tobacco
land,'' he says. ``And we're cutting ditchbanks, clearing brush,
getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore rides uneven dirt paths through fields, stopping to
inspect damage from beavers and progress with the plow.
</P>
<P>
   He is tall and lean, and slightly stooped when he stands.
Wrap-around shades protect his vision from constant sun. When the
shades come off, the eyes behind them are brown, and more than a
little merry. His uniform is standard, depending on the weather:
Blue work pants and a plaid short-sleeve shirt on warm days, blue
corduroys and a long-sleeve flannel shirt when it's cool. There's a
tractor on his belt buckle, and a boast that ``Agriculture feeds
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unit one,'' the radio spits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead four'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you want me next?'' asks a man on a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That field up by North Pitt (high school)'' Moore replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``10-four.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers vary from year to year, but Moore plants close to
100 acres of tobacco, 90 acres of cotton, 300 acres of corn and
wheat, along with soybeans and peanuts. Some of it is on land he
owns, some on the farms of others he tends. The Wainwright farm,
where W.C. and Betty live. The Brown farm. The Ward farm. The Vann
Taylor land.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on a farm near Falkland, and worked off the land only
briefly, at a supply store, as a new husband in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmin' has been good to me,'' he says. ``But, now, I mean I
had to work for it. It wasn't give to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes what he does. He sticks to careful decisions. And at a
time when many others are being forced to turn in the plow, he
makes adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard at times,'' he said. ``But you do have your freedom,
you're kind of your own boss to a certain extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore tells about his wife Betty's two sisters, and how they
swore as young girls they would not marry a farmer, or farm.
Neither did. One lives in Chicago. The other married a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't done any better, I thought, than I have,'' he
said. ``I'm not saying I'm on cloud nine, but we have done some
things we wanted to do. We've never been in debt for a lot of
things we didn't have to have, other than debt for the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's routine takes him by crossroad stores like the one at
Whitehurst Station, where he kids with men he sees almost every
day. His usual is a short Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates he owns about a thousand acres, but isn't sure. Yet
he readily knows the details of how each scrap of land came to be
under his care.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly widow who needed the money for her increasingly
costly care. An heir who had no use for the family farm. A neighbor
who stepped down from the tractor. One deal sealed the
old-fashioned way, with a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many folks will take a handshake these days,'' Moore says.
He is pleased to be someone whose word is honored in the circles he
keeps.
</P>
<P>
   And he takes pains to see to the needs of the people whose
property he farms. Keeping strangers away from a fishing pond, and
cleaning up pecan trees blown over by hurricanes. For Moore,
tending land is a trust that requires such things.
</P>
<P>
   TENDING THE BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   The sign on the sliding door to Betty Moore's back stoop warns
visitors. But it doesn't prepare them for what's inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me about my grandchildren,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, almost every conversation in this house turns to
family.
</P>
<P>
   Grandchildren skitter through the house and yard, part of the
scenery. They go to grandmama for snacks and hugs, and to have a
kindling-size splinter removed from a small palm. Betty knows what
they do every day, even when they are not at her house. And her
children, too are close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Reginia every day, and Randall most every day.'' she
says. ``He comes in for breakfast. ``I don't see Myra every day
because she works in Greenville, but we do a lot of talking.''
</P>
<P>
   On the farm, Betty worked the fields until a few years ago. She
still works the finances and is a certified public accountant. That
means keeping up with a cash flow of as much as a half-million
dollars and balancing the crucial timing of loans, supply purchases
and payments due.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does the bookkeeping. She tries to pay the bills. And keep
up with the government,'' W.C. says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And be grandmama,'' Betty replies.
</P>
<P>
   She is short and trim, but round in places. She frets about
clutter in her house, but does not pass up conversation with a
visitor _ or a grandchild _ in honor of straightening up. Smoky, a
well-fed 15-year-old cat with silver hair, ghosts her steps.
</P>
<P>
   Betty's voice and manner are easy. But she speaks her mind,
particularly about the county's efforts to zone part of the farm
they live on and about plummeting regard for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many people that ride around, they have no idea
that peanuts grow in the ground,'' she says, ``they think they're
supposed to grow on trees like pecans.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty grew up on a farm. Her father ran a country store near the
crossroad of Penny Hill. The land has offered her a good living and
nurtured deep roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know of any other life that could give that much
coverage for a family,'' she says. ``And that's what I had seen in
my growing-up time.''
</P>
<P>
   `A DYING BREED'
</P>
<P>
   It's getting harder and harder for the farm to sustain a family
in the way it has the Moores.
</P>
<P>
   In Pitt County, where more flue-cured tobacco for cigarettes
grows than anywhere else in the nation, the decline of the leaf has
hit especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   Unprecedented cuts in federal tobacco quotas, disastrous
flooding in 1999 and depressed export markets have imposed unusual
hardship. This season will be a make-or-break year for a greater
number of farmers than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique season I think because of the fact that
usually there would be some aspect of agriculture which would lift
up the others,'' says Mitch Smith, Pitt County director of the
state Cooperative Extension Service. ``Well, we don't have that
now, we've lost half our (tobacco) quota since 1997, all of our
grain prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Each December U.S. tobacco manufacturers announce how much leaf
they expect to buy the next year. The federal government then sets
quotas that determine how much leaf farmers will be allowed to sell
at auction. For the last two years, quotas have dropped _ 28
percent for 1999, and another 18 percent for 2000. The cuts came
alongside a multi-billion dollar settlement of a lawsuit states
like North Carolina filed against tobacco companies to recoup the
cost of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces, too, have pressed farmers in the county that
tobacco built.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, floodwaters from Hurricane Floyd covered 58 percent
of the county. The fields still bear the scars. So do farmers'
pocketbooks. Many, like the Moores, carried over debt from
operating loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Moores lost 175 acres of cotton to floodwaters, and some
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even harvest half the peanuts; it was wet we
couldn't get 'em,'' W.C. said. ``We lost right smart corn, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You tighten your belt,'' Betty said. ``The lending institution
makes it better, and right now they will work with you, but now if
it gets any tighter I don't know what they'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, there were some full-time 550 farmers in Pitt
County. Now, only 450 hands-on operators remain. Most of them are
like the Moores. They have made it through a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got your 55-60 year-olds who have been in it and who
continue to borrow money and make decisions,'' Smith said. ``Then
you've got a small group of 15-20 producers in their late 30s and
early 40s who agonize over their future but nevertheless have
agreed to stay in it until something goes defunct.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects those numbers to dwindle even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported in November 1999 that North
Carolina could lose 15-20 percent of its tobacco farmers this year.
Smith's forecast is similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten to 15 percent in Pitt County are in the situation where
they could easily liquidate this year and not farm any more,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever comes, we will farm,'' Betty says. Yet the Moores
know the life they have enjoyed on the land will be more elusive
for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   W.C. recalls a recent conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day a truck driver came out to the shop for some
stuff and he said 'let me touch you. I'm gonna go home and tell my
boy I touched a dyin' breed.'''

 &HT;    Innovations in farming tobacco
 &HT;    By Mary Schulken
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.C. _ In their infancy tobacco plants look like tiny
shamrocks.
</P>
<P>
   As many as a million plants have taken root in the warmth of
W.C. Moore's greenhouse, snug in Styrofoam seed crates, resting on
a bed of water. They were sowed in mid-March, and in April, when
the threat of a hard freeze is past, they will be transplanted in
the field, the first crop of a new century.
</P>
<P>
   The green fuzz sprouting in the seed crates doesn't look like
much. But with an average price, the half-million pounds of leaf it
will grow into could net $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouses like Moore's 30- by-300-foot structure are big
innovations in farming tobacco. Yet like most breakthroughs, they
are expensive. Today it costs around $30,000 to set up a
greenhouse, said Mitch Smith, county director of the Cooperative
Extension Service. In 1991, Moore was one of the first growers
around to make that investment.
</P>
<P>
   It has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Tending seedlings in a hothouse is nothing like working
old-fashioned tobacco beds, where seeds were sowed in the ground
under plastic. It takes fewer people and makes setting out tobacco
_ one of the most back-breaking parts of raising leaf _ much
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say to Betty this is the only thing I spent money on
she never complained about,'' W.C. says. ``With beds it took 28
people to set out (tobacco in the field.) Now it takes eight. And
you don't have that mental thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the big changes that we made that worked very
well,'' Betty says.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the mercury has barely reached 60, the thermometer
inside reads 95 degrees. Plastic curtains around the bottom of the
house are open, letting cooler air drift over the 10-day-old
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Managing a greenhouse is a precise business. The seedlings are
watered by sprinklers and the temperature carefully regulated. At
night, the cold requires heaters. In the daytime sunshine demands
ventilation. And the young plants must be mowed with a lawn mower
adapted to a mechanical mount overhead. That forces them to grow to
a uniform size, and that is best for transplanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you mow 'em about twice you come in here and it looks
like a yard,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco seeds have changed, too.
</P>
<P>
   They used to be little brown specks. Now the pod is inside a
tiny ball of clay that is green and round, resembling the balls of
sugar used to decorate cakes and cookies. Crush one, and you find
white powdery stuff. The germ of North Carolina's cash crop is all
but invisible.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Trail Blazers Have Time to Heal
</P>
<P>
   In Joe Kleine's 15-year career, he could not remember a
regular-season game more hyped and anticipated than the one between
the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Vying for home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, the
teams came into the game tied with the National Basketball
Association's best mark at 45-11. ``The greatest regular-season
game in the history of the NBA,'' bellowed Bill Walton, the NBC
analyst and the former Blazer center, before the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen anything like it,'' Kleine, Portland's reserve
center, said of the buildup. ``I don't want to blame that game on
everything that happened, but obviously it had something to do with
it. It was like everything just came to a standstill for one
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the beleaguered Blazers. They have not been the same
since, going 5-5 since that defeat. Portland has lost four of six
at the Rose Garden after winning 16 straight. They blew
fourth-quarter leads to Minnesota and Detroit. Toronto recently
beat the Blazers on their home floor by 19 points, their worst loss
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   As the Blazers prepared to entertain the Knicks on Sunday, the
question was: could they find their rhythm and heart before the
Lakers run away with the Western Conference championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 82 games, it's inevitable that no matter how good you
are, sooner or later you're going to hit a funk during the year,''
said Kleine, who has played on six teams, including a championship
team in Chicago. ``Very rarely does a team not go through one. You
lose your way and eventually you find it again. But sometimes to
find it, you need a good slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Dunleavy added: ``Certainly when you have a big loss,
there is a residue to it. But more than that, we've really missed
Brian Grant. Especially his toughness and rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a power forward, was activated last Friday after missing
most of March with an injury in his foot. He also had off-season
knee surgery. Instead of Rasheed Wallace being the anchor off the
bench, Grant has been forced into a starting role.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers also lost Arvydas Sabonis last week after the center
severely sprained his right foot. He is expected to miss two to
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, the Blazers were unanimously tagged as
favorites to succeed the San Antonio Spurs as champions. In some
quarters, the Spurs were picked to repeat, and the Lakers were seen
as a greater long-shot than any Eastern Conference team. But
mostly, Portland was the team spoken of most highly.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had the talent, experience and, most of all, the
depth. Acquiring Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf
during the off-season not only took oodles of Paul Allen's money
but also the maneuverability of Bob Whitsitt, the team president.
</P>
<P>
   After ridding themselves of Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, the
Blazers' $50 million starting lineup was not as much about cash as
it was cachet. And for the first four months, the Blazers seemed
polished and poised, on the cusp of distinguishing themselves from
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually the problems began to surface. If it was not
Wallace blowing a gasket and leading the league in technical fouls,
it was poor decision-making on offense. Portland's lack of a
genuine go-to player at the end of a game has also been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the biggest reason for their shortcomings is clear to see on
the court: at the moment, the Blazers are not mentally or
physically strong enough to compete for a title. It's not just
Wallace; many Portland players think all of humanity is out to get
them after a questionable call. They do not play through the
whistles. Instead of saving their nasty disposition for their
opponents, they direct it at the referees.
</P>
<P>
   Having already won 50 games, the Blazers are the second-best
team in the league. They are not in grave danger and have a few
weeks to fix the leaks. But less than two months ago, Portland was
considered a lock to wind up in the conference finals and dispatch
the Lakers. Now, they are just another slumping NBA team struggling
to find its identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely still have a chance to get there and win it,''
Kleine said. ``You can't say that about a lot of teams. But it's
not going to be easy. The problems we have are fixable. We, as a
team, complain too much. We've got to be a lot tougher, mentally
and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy said: ``My wish was to have us healthy by now. That
didn't happen. So we just have to find a way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Carter Conspiracy
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago, Vincesanity was the catch phrase used to
describe the sweeping popularity of Vince Carter, and how the
All-Star forward of the Toronto Raptors had made the casual fan to
again pay attention to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But then Butch Carter invoked a number of conspiracy theories
that could thwart Toronto from keeping his star player under
contract. At one point this week, the Raptors coach accused both
the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League of tampering
and the NBA of possibly trying to steer Carter toward an American
city after he become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Sun actually spoke with a highly placed league
official who essentially told the newspaper that the NBA would be
better off if Carter ended up on a team in the United States. It
was an anonymous quote that a league spokesman referred to as
``moronic'' and ``stupid'' and not at all indicative of the
league's stance.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter apologized for his comments after he was chastised
by general manager Glen Grunwald. But he added, ``I think there are
forces out there that have been and will be destructive to our
situation in Toronto. I don't think it will be anyone in the league
office.''
</P>
<P>
   For simple economic reasons, the league needs high-profile
players in its major markets. Yet the notion the NBA wants Carter
anywhere else than Toronto is a bit shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors, regardless of their locale, are currently helping
resuscitate NBC's sagging NBA ratings. If Toronto could somehow
negotiate its way through the Eastern Conference finals and into a
championship showdown with the Lakers, neither the network nor
commissioner David Stern would fret. They would be overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   The immediacy of the Internet and television almost negate
modern, big-market hyperbole. Witness the phenomenon of the
Sacramento Kings over the past two seasons. In the old days, Vince
would have had to go to Hollywood or Madison Avenue for maximum
exposure. Now, they go to him.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the NBA is so concerned about its Canadian presence that
the team owners recently unanimously rejected the ownership
application of Bill Lurie, the St. Louis billionaire. After all the
efforts that went into North American expansion, they did not want
Lurie transplanting the Vancouver Grizzlies to the Midwest until
that NBA market was deemed a failure over a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   If Carter's appeal could truly cut into the consciousness of a
hockey nation over the long haul, would not investors in Ottawa or
Montreal eventually give credence to NBA teams in their own cities?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the main issues fought for and won by owners in
the last round of bargaining was more restrictions on player
movement. They want people to stay with their teams. Continuity _
Michael in Chicago, Larry in Boston, Magic in L.A. _ is still a
valued asset in the NBA. Unless Vince Carter _ and only Vince
Carter _ wants to play somewhere else, he will remain a Raptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Children of 76ers
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunleavy has been watching his son, Michael, play for Duke
in the NCAA tournament. Harvey Catchings has been watching his
daughters, Tamika and Tauja, play for Tennessee and Illinois in the
women's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years ago, the two fathers were teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take all the players' kids off that team, you'd have a
pretty good team right there,'' Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 1976-77 Philadelphia 76ers fell to Bill Walton's
Portland Trail Blazers in the finals, but they should also be an
All-Genetic Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Catchings and Dunleavy, that 76ers team featured Henry
Bibby, whose son, Mike, starts at point guard for the Vancouver
Grizzlies, and a reserve forward with a decent vertical leap, Joe
(Jellybean) Bryant, father of Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Doug Collins, whose son, Chris, starred at Duke,
and Steve Mix, who has a daughter playing college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those amazing coincidences,'' said Pat Williams,
the general manager of that Sixers team. ``I can't remember a team
of players whose children turned out to be so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens Like Knick Trio
</P>
<P>
   And you thought it was just fed-up adults who wanted Patrick
Ewing to stop shooting so much and make way for the new generation.
According to Inside Stuff, the teen magazine of the NBA, Latrell
Sprewell, Allan Houston and Marcus Camby were named the league's
top trio _ the three teammates who work the best together on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The three Knicks edged out Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
Glen Rice; Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell; Chris Webber,
Jason Williams and Vlade Divac; and Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway
and Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   The voting actually was not done by kids. Rather, the magazine's
editorial board made the selections.

<P>
   ABA, Nigeria _ In a corner of this city in Nigeria's Christian
heartland, where every other car seems to affirm the driver's love
for Jesus, Muslim migrants from the north had managed to become
landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The corner was known as Ama Hausa, or gathering place of the
Hausas, who make up one of the country's three main ethnic groups,
along with the Ibo and Yoruba. But after Ibo rioters destroyed this
street corner in Nigeria's recent religious conflicts, graffiti
scrawled on a wall of the gutted mosque reclaimed the land: Ama
Ibo.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Hausa have since packed up their belongings and
left for the north. Many headed to Sokoto, at the country's
geographic and cultural opposite end, where a similar exodus was
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   In Sokoto, the historic site from which a Muslim holy war
succeeded in spreading the religion through West Africa two
centuries ago, many Ibo were seen at the main bus station
scrambling to buy the $15 tickets that would take them back to Aba
and other cities in southeastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's recent politically driven religious conflicts have
claimed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives and destroyed
countless churches, mosques and houses. President Olusegun Obasanjo
has described these clashes as attempts to undermine the nation's
10-month-old democracy, and many Nigerians from different parts of
the country agree that several states' attempts to introduce
sharia, the Islamic penal and social code, have more to do with
politics than religion.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflicts are rooted in all-too-real hatreds and
divisions, like the abyss between Sokoto and Aba. These hatreds and
divisions are staggeringly complex, fueled by the misrule and
corruption that have left most residents of one of the world's top
oil producers in poverty. What is more, these rifts have been
encouraged and exploited by the country's rulers, from the British
to the military governments to the European and American oil
companies that pump crude in the Niger delta, an area largely
abandoned by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps of garbage, some of it on fire, littered the main road in
Aba on a recent day. The garbage contractor had been dismissed for
corruption, and a new contract had yet to be awarded. Nationwide,
the unreliable national electricity system collapsed recently,
plunging the Nigerians who could not afford generators into
darkness and forcing Obasanjo to declare an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   As Ibo were killed in the north and thousands returned here, the
events recalled those leading up to the Biafran Civil War. Three
decades ago, following massacres of Ibos in the north, the ethnic
group tried to secede from the rest of Nigeria. The war was one of
the most brutal in Africa's postindependence history _ a million
died _ but a successful postwar reunification policy knitted
greater ties among Nigerians. With the recent surge in hatreds, it
is unclear whether those ties are stronger than the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried when I heard what had happened to my people,'' the
Rev. Prince Benny James, 29, an Ibo and associate pastor at the
Living Church here in Aba, said of the recent killings of Ibo in
the north.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of reprisal attacks against Muslim Hausa in Aba,
James sheltered 10 Hausa who escaped eventually. But on the first
morning, James said he was present at an attack against some Hausa.
He did not participate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somehow I was happy these things were being done to
them,'' he said. ``In my heart, I was saying, `Yes, do that to
them! Go ahead! Go ahead! Right!' I gave my support by being there.
If I had not enjoyed it, I would have returned to my house.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals began attacking the Hausa after corpses of Ibo killed
in the north were brought back to Aba. But what began as a battle
between Muslims and Christians in the north became an ethnic witch
hunt here, as Ibo searched for anyone who might be a northerner.
</P>
<P>
   At James' Living Church, the security guard, Andy Petei, 25, hid
in a hole under the altar for three days after some youths came
looking for him. Neither Muslim nor Hausa, Petei is a member of an
ethnic minority from a north central state. He had nevertheless
become a target because he was from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said I may be Hausa,'' said Petei, a Christian.
Religion is one of the great fault lines in Nigeria, an ambitious
creation of British colonialists. Ethnicity is another. But
Nigeria's divisions are so treacherous because the cleavages can
shift from one region to another, from one day to another.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all Ibo are Christian; almost all Hausa are Muslim. The
Yoruba, on the other hand, are divided almost evenly between Muslim
and Christian. And the Islam practiced by the Yoruba is a much more
easygoing variety than that practiced by the Hausa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Hausa, Islam is a total way of living,'' said Julius
Okolo, an Ibo and professor of political science at Usman dan Fodio
University in Sokoto. ``For the Yoruba, it's not a total way of
living. The cultural aspects of the Yoruba are stronger than
religion, whether it's Christianity or Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yoruba Christians and Muslims marry each other without a
second thought. It is not unusual for Yoruba to have members of
both faiths in their families; some even practice both religions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But among northerners, being a Christian Hausa is considered a
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seen as people who have sold out,'' said Emman Usman
Shehu, who heads an organization for Christians in Sokoto. ``In the
north, once we have left Islam, where the political, social and
economic aspects are all tied up, we become classless citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, the commercial capital in the Yoruba southwest, deadly
clashes between Yoruba and Hausa have occurred in recent months.
But in the recent riots in the northern city of Kaduna, some Yoruba
seemed to have escaped injury because of their religion or
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Suraj Najimu, an 18-year-old student and a Yoruba Muslim, said
he was surrounded by a group of Hausa youths ready to assault him.
``But after I recited some Koranic passages, they let me go,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Muslim street in the predominantly Christian slum of
Kaduna, Christians destroyed all the houses except a few belonging
to Yoruba. Most of the Yoruba were Christian. But even one who is
Muslim, Shehu Garba, was spared, apparently because in this
particular instance, ethnicity was more important than religion.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has said that he wants to avoid taking the issue of
sharia to the Supreme Court, which would rule clearly on the
matter. A political solution, he said, ``will end up without any
victor or vanquished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No victor, no vanquished'' was the slogan adopted to reunite
Nigerians after the Biafran Civil War _ a policy regarded by many
historians as one of the most successful reconciliation attempts in
recent history. And indeed, over the years, despite all of
Nigeria's fissures, the country has grown more interdependent.
</P>
<P>
   The building of more roads, increasing urbanization and economic
exchanges have all pushed ever more Nigerians to leave their
historic home regions for other parts. Many of these Nigerians fell
victim to the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   James, the associate pastor here, said he personally knew a
Hausa man who was killed here. ``He was married to an Ibo woman,''
he said.

GOVERNOR BUTTS HEADS WITH SUMO BAN ON WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSAKA, Japan _ In one of her first public acts as Japan's first
woman governor, Fusae Ota, weight 97 pounds, was to enter the ring
at the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament this weekend and bestow prizes
on competitors up to five times as hefty.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since 1953, it has fallen to the governor of Japan's
second-largest prefecture, a tough commercial region 250 miles
southwest of Tokyo, to award the prizes at the spring sumo
competition. But there has never been a woman governor before. And
so, just a month after taking office, Ota found herself battling
not just the sumo wrestlers' ban on women in their hallowed ring,
but the centuries of tradition that have accorded her sex a
distinctly second-class place in Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years of custom dictate that women may not enter the
dohyo, the 15-foot diameter ring of sandy clay in which the sumo
wrestlers grapple. At first, Ota aggressively challenged the rule.
Eventually, after a tense standoff with Akebono, the 500-pound
heavyweight of sumo wrestling's governing body, she backed down,
agreeing that her male deputy would present prizes in her place,
but vowing to pursue the matter again next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the advocates of equal opportunity, the affair was cause to
ponder just how far Japanese women have come, despite Ota's
election victory _ after her male predecessor was forced to step
aside over charges of sexually harassing a 21-year-old female
campaign worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all so elated over Governor Ota's victory, not only
because she was the first woman, but also because she was the best
qualified candidate for the job,'' said Kiyoko Yamanaka, a woman
who is a member of the Osaka prefecture's legislature. ``But this
sumo confrontation was like being splashed with a bucket of cold
water. We suddenly realized that basically nothing had changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of Japan's legislators are women, and the
country, which has the world's second-largest economy, ranks 140th
among all nations in terms of participation of women in politics,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Japan Sumo Association said that banning
women from entering the sumo ring had nothing to do with sexism but
rather was an age-old tradition that should be honored. Sumo's
ancient roots are entwined with Japan's indigenous Shinto religion
that detests defilement, especially death and blood. Sumo wrestlers
toss salt into the ring in a ritual meant to purify the ground at
the start of each match.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the sumo association is perfectly justified in
maintaining its own traditional culture at a time of constantly
changing views on values and history,'' Katsuo Tokitsukaze, the
association's chairman, told Ota, according to local news reports
of a telephone conversation in which he convinced her not to press
her case. But Tokitsukaze left the door open for further
discussions, saying, ``It is also important to hear others'
opinions on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ota, a former senior official of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, declined to be interviewed for this article,
citing a busy schedule of budget meetings with the prefecture
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Yamanaka, who described herself as a feminist legislator, said
that the sumo association's tradition was problematic because it
perpetuated the notion in Japan that women were unclean and
therefore not as worthy as men.
</P>
<P>
   She cited other examples of traditions that have excluded women,
including one at Mount Ominesan in Nara prefecture, which for
religious reasons has been off-limits to women for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 female teachers climbed the mountain last year,
much to the consternation of local priests who said the women had
``trampled underfoot the faith of believers.'' The teachers union
later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   In a public opinion poll conducted recently by the newspaper
Asahi Shimbun, 47 percent of people surveyed said that Ota should
be allowed inside the ring, while 37 percent backed the sumo
association and the remainder were undecided. Forty-eight percent
of the men and 45 percent of women polled sided with the governor,
while 39 percent of men and 35 percent of women supported the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the stadium where the tournament is being held, sumo
fans voiced differing opinions on the issue. ``Tradition is often
difficult to explain, but no one is trying to hurt women or deprive
them of something by keeping them out of the ring,'' said Shigehiro
Yonezu, a businessman. But his daughter, Kiyo, 25, disagreed. ``No,
papa, you have to understand that this tradition was created by a
male-dominated society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a time when the popularity of sumo
wrestling is declining, especially among young Japanese, and the
sport's credibility has been damaged by charges of bout-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, there are empty seats at major sumo
tournaments, which have traditionally been sold out. Faced with
hard economic times, many Japanese are unwilling to shell out the
$50 needed for a decent seat.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings are also declining. More Japanese have come
to prefer baseball and soccer, and the $100 million-a-year sport
now faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Many people still recall an incident in 1991 that was a severe
blow to sumo's reputation. In grade school, boys and girls practice
sumo together. A 10-year-old girl became the champion in Tokushima
prefecture but a boy who came in second place was awarded the medal
and allowed to attend the national championship.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the sumo stables, where wrestlers rise every morning at the
crack of dawn to practice, there were no words of support for Ota's
effort to step inside the ring. ``I'm all for women's rights but
the dohyo is a place where only men fight and if a woman steps
inside I'm not going to wrestle there anymore,'' said Dejima, a
360-pound champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must understand that we've devoted our lives to these
traditions, which encompass so much more than just keeping women
out of the ring,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Makiya Saito, Ota's husband, said that his wife was very
surprised and upset over what he said was the sumo association's
narrow-mindedness. ``On the surface it seems like a ridiculous
issue, but it has big significance,'' Saito said. ``It shows just
how backward Japanese society is when it comes to women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Saito, who refers to himself as Japan's ``first husband,'' said
that since his wife's election, Japanese men keep asking him ``what
kind of man are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to tell Japanese men that I am secure enough in my
manhood to support my wife and fulfill my official duties as
husband to the governor,'' said Saito, who operates an optical lens
company.
</P>
<P>
   Norio Tsuboi, a popular television announcer, offered a comical
solution to the problem: ``We should strap the governor into a
harness that hangs from the ceiling of the stadium and gradually
lower her into the ring, stopping just before her feet touch the
ground.''

ULSTER LEADER HOLDS ON, BUT POWER DIMINISHED IN UNIONIST PARTY
VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ David Trimble Saturday held off a
surprisingly strong challenge to his leadership of the Ulster
Unionist Party but emerged with his authority and his room for
maneuver in conducting peace negotiations diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, the province's most prominent Protestant politician,
defeated the Rev. Martin Smyth with 57 percent of the vote of the
ruling Ulster Party Council. Although the result ensured his spot
at the top of the province's largest party for another year, it
also indicated deepening division among members over going forward
with the steps aimed at sharing power with the Catholic minority
outlined in the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth, a 68-year-old former grand master of the traditionally
hard-line Orange Order, had only sprung his insurgency on Thursday,
yet still managed to attract the support of 43 percent of the
voters for his move to oust Trimble, 55, a Nobel Peace Prize
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Shouts of ``resign'' were heard inside the Royal Ulster
Society's Kings' Hall when the result of the secret ballot of the
805 delegates was announced, and a group of Smyth's backers charged
out the front door punching the air in jubilation. But Trimble's
supporters said afterward that he had no intention of stepping
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we would have liked the margin to have been much
more comfortable,'' Michael McGimpsey, a Trimble ally, said grimly,
``but this is a period of extreme tension, nerves and worry for the
party, and there would have been an element of protest votes in
there. I don't believe he would consider resignation having just
been endorsed by almost 60 percent of his ruling council.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry McDonald, author of a new biography of the Ulster Unionist
leader, said he believed Saturday's vote left Trimble ``completely
restricted'' at a time when Britain and Ireland, the sponsors of
the peace plan, and the United States, the principal foreign
backer, are urging flexibility in trying to get back up and running
a power-sharing home rule government that was put on hold last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Assembly, with Trimble as first minister
and members of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, in executive positions, was suspended on Feb. 11
by Britain when the IRA refused to make expected moves on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates said Saturday they were particularly angered by
Trimble's suggestion in Washington March 17 that he would be
willing to take the party back into a government with Sinn Fein
without prior disarmament. Smyth told a news conference on Friday
that the statement had prompted his sudden bid for the leadership
and showed that Trimble had strayed too far from the party's
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Trimble had not expected Smyth's move, he seized upon
it as a way of trying to unite the notoriously quarrelsome party
behind him and to end internal carping over his moves to reform the
party and make it a force for change. ``I want an end to the
campaign which undermines our positions,'' he said on the eve of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes were dashed today as opponents also forced
through a motion binding Trimble to a fixed bargaining position on
the highly charged issue of policing. The motion linked any return
to power-sharing government by the Ulster Unionists with the
retention of the name Royal Ulster Constabulary for the province's
force.
</P>
<P>
   This is a potentially huge setback for Trimble, since the
British and Irish governments accepted a principal conclusion of an
international commission last year headed by former Hong Kong Gov.
Chris Patten that the name must be changed if the force is ever to
attract Catholic recruits. The force is presently 90 percent
Protestant, and the British and Irish governments believe it must
gain the support of Ulster's Catholics if any peace agreement is to
stick and home rule to function.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Johnston, a delegate who supported Smyth, said Trimble's
opponents would stage another leadership challenge with a more
formidable candidate if he made any more concessions to Sinn Fein.
``I think he's finished,'' he said, adding that strategists who had
been doing telephone canvassing for Smyth had not anticipated
getting more than 35 percent of the vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Six of the ten other Ulster Unionists in the British Parliament
with Trimble voted against him Saturday, including Jeffrey
Donaldson, 37, a man who has long had his eye on the leadership and
who poses a more serious threat to Trimble than Smyth. Trimble was
also opposed by the 120 members of the Orange Order on the council.
</P>
<P>
   All of them are declared opponents of the April 1998 peace
settlement that was hailed at the time for its promise in resolving
a Catholic and Protestant conflict that has accounted for 3,600
deaths in the past three decades. What progress there has been
since then has repeatedly come to a halt over the issue of
disarming the IRA and paramilitary Protestant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have maintained cease-fires for more than two years,
but the Ulster Unionists argue that a surrender of weaponry is a
necessary condition for any resumption of a power-sharing
government. Sinn Fein says it cannot satisfy that condition, and
the talks are stuck there.
</P>
<P>
   In a daring move last November, Trimble persuaded his party to
enter a government with Sinn Fein, even though there had been no
weapons turnover. One consequence of Saturday's vote is that he
almost certainly will not be able to be so bold in the future.

OPEC NATIONS GIVE NO SIGN THAT OIL FLOW WILL INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Despite unusually public pleas by the Clinton
administration for relief from high oil prices, there were few
signs of support for a big increase in oil production as ministers
from petroleum-exporting countries arrived here Saturday for
crucial meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is scheduled to consider an increase in output, members
of the 11-nation cartel remained divided and were girding for
grueling negotiations throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is too early to decide now,'' said Obaid bin Saif
al-Nasseri, the United Arab Emirates' oil minister, as he entered
his hotel early Saturday afternoon. ``We have not discussed all the
possibilities and all the options. My recommendation is to wait for
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the most important disagreements are between
Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two largest producers within OPEC. Saudi
officials have been pushing for an increase in production of
between 1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has repeatedly argued for much smaller increases, and its
position has hardened as oil prices have retreated from recent
highs of more than $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has also lashed out at the United States, where lawmakers
are pushing for sanctions against OPEC countries and where
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has lobbied OPEC countries in a
whirlwind tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC should not opt for a big increase under political
pressure,'' said Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh, on the
country's state radio before departing for Vienna Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that a rash increase could lead to a ``catastrophe,''
Zangeneh said OPEC nations ``must move with the market and seek
stability. We hope OPEC will make a decision based on economic
justifications, not political.''
</P>
<P>
   In a further indication that OPEC leaders will agree on only
modest increases, Reuters news service quoted an unnamed official
from a Persian Gulf state as saying that the leaders were ``near an
agreement'' to increase production to the levels envisaged by the
Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But that in itself would not necessarily have much impact on oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the crucial question is whether the increase comes
on top of or merely substitutes for the cheating on oil quotas that
is already taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts estimate that OPEC countries and the four
nations that joined in the production cuts one year ago _ Mexico,
Russia, Oman and Norway _ are already overshooting their target of
23 million barrels a day by about 1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC leaders agree to increase quotas by 1.5 million barrels
but clamp down on cheating, the net effect would be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the increase comes on top of the current overproduction,
most analysts believe, the impact on oil prices will be modest and
the reduction in gasoline prices no more than a few pennies a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Verleger, a veteran oil economist at the Brattle Group in
Newport Beach, Calif., noted that inventories of crude oil have
declined to dangerous new lows at the same time as an acceleration
in global economic growth is expected to increase demand.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency, a research agency in Paris
financed by oil-consuming countries, has predicted that worldwide
demand for oil will climb by 4 million barrels a day, to 75 million
barrels, from now to the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   If worldwide inventories are not restocked, Verleger argued,
consuming nations could find themselves under increasing pressure
to turn to Iraq. Iraq, which remains under U.N. sanctions, is
allowed to produce as much as it can under tight restrictions on
what it is supposed to spend the revenue on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't increase inventories now, we may need Iraq's oil
by Christmas,'' Verleger said.
</P>
<P>
   But even non-OPEC countries are extremely worried that any big
increase in production will send prices plunging back to the levels
of just one year ago _ $11 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Olav Akselsen, Norway's oil minister, politely rebuffed
Richardson on Thursday after meeting with him in Oslo, Norway.
Richardson has been traveling widely in recent weeks to urge
oil-rich nations to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging the need for some sort of increase,
Akselsen said Norway did not support rolling back all of the
production cuts that sent oil prices from a devastating nadir of
$11 a barrel to the current level of about $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total suspension of today's production regulations will have a
negative impact on the market and work against price stability,''
Akselsen said in Oslo on Thursday. ``Both too high and too low oil
prices will lead to more instability.''

AT AIRPORT IN MADRID, PROTESTERS IN PAJAMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The victory of Jose Maria Aznar and his
conservative party in Spain's elections this month could be bad
news for Jesus Coca and other residents of the upscale subdivision
of Ciudad de Santo Domingo, who say life in their neighborhood is
increasingly sullied by the noise of airliners overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Madrid suburbs with a combined population of 350,000
people filed suit on Feb. 16 against a planned expansion of
Madrid's Barajas Airport, built in 1931, arguing that it presented
health and safety dangers and would inhibit urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   But Aznar, who won re-election on March 12, has so far stood
resolutely against building a new airport, instead favoring
extension of the existing airport, which is just seven and a half
miles northeast of the city center. The Spanish government ranks it
as the fifth-busiest airport in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Neither continuous media complaints about airport delays nor
colorful protests against the noise have so far persuaded the
conservatives to heed calls for a new airport farther from the city
center and an immediate ban on flights to Barajas between 11 p.m.
and 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Aznar's government has added a third runway and a
new control tower. Plans call for two more runways and an
additional terminal by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gracia, chairman of the state-run engineering company
that is helping to plan the expansion, defends it as economical,
saying it will cost $3.5 billion, or just a third of the projected
cost of a new airport.
</P>
<P>
   That is small comfort for the bands of protesters who started
monthly demonstrations at the airport last May to highlight what
they say is their plight.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Monday, nearly 40 adults and three children marched
through Barajas at around 10 p.m., dressed in blue and yellow
pajamas and red bathrobes, but not because of the frequent flight
delays that induce some passengers to sleep in the terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called Pajamas in Action, lighted on the nighttime
attire as a way to plead their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No noise!'' they chanted. ``Enough already!'' And they waved a
large banner that proclaimed: ``Dreams are for everyone. Don't
steal them from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dark-suited airline employees in the nearly deserted
terminals chuckled at the spectacle. But those who favor expansion
seem unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not do anything for them, because what they say is not
true,'' Gracia said. ``I live in the center of Madrid and have more
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, the European Union will require its members,
including Spain, to permit only flights by the quieter latest
generation of jets by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Coca, who said he had lost sleep and suffered stress since the
airport's third runway began service in late 1998, is skeptical.
Passenger jets flying low over his $600,000 eight-bedroom home on
their landing approach to the airport 11 miles away have changed
his life for the worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife wants to sell the house,'' said Coca, 42, lamenting
that they would take a loss because of the airplane noise. ``I feel
like I've been stepped on, as if I had no rights.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coca, computer systems manager for a Spanish insurance company,
and some of his neighbors in Ciudad de Santo Domingo, which has 800
homes, have fought the airport expansion for a year. Lately they
have joined residents from other neighborhoods in the pajama
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed flights and airport noise, regularly reported by the
Spanish news media, were not big issues in the recent election
campaign, although all sides _ the opposition Socialists, and
Aznar's conservatives _ want to reduce the congestion at Barajas
Airport, which was used last year by 27 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid's passenger load is due to increase to 42 million in
2007, although government officials admit that the airport has been
at saturation point for several years. According to the Association
of European Airlines, 48 percent of flights last year were delayed
at least 15 minutes, and sometimes for hours, the second worst
record in Europe after the much smaller Malpensa Airport in Milan,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government insisted that only a third of the flights
were delayed in 1999 and it mainly blamed the airlines, Europe's
saturated air traffic control system and poor planning by the
former Socialist government.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's state-run carrier, Iberia, and other airlines put much
of the blame on the state-run airport authority. Aznar's government
apparently has a plan to fix that too: Two national newspapers that
are considered close to the government reported last week that the
administration intends to begin privatizing management of Spain's
43 airports, including Madrid's, as early as this spring.

RUNNER-UP IN TAIWAN NOW HOLDS MOST CARDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Ask people here who is the most intriguing
political figure to emerge from Taiwan's momentous presidential
election last weekend, and few name Chen Shui-bian, the earnest
opposition leader who ousted the Nationalist Party after half a
century of rule.
</P>
<P>
   Hands down, that distinction goes to James Soong, a former
Nationalist official whose independent candidacy for the presidency
drew 37 percent of the vote, just 2 points behind Chen. With no
party organization to speak of _ and the full weight of the
Nationalist machine against him _ Soong won 4.6 million votes,
carrying Taipei and most of northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Soong's remarkable insurgency hastened the downfall of President
Lee Teng-hui, who was forced to resign as chairman of the
Nationalists. With Lee's departure, Soong has emerged as a man with
a multitude of options. He could try to win control of his old
party. He could lead a new party that was formed last week in his
name. Or he could play the field for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very strong voices within the KMT asking me to come
back,'' said Soong, 58, using the initials for the Chinese name of
the Nationalist Party, Kuomintang. ``But I don't think I should
take advantage of the situation for my personal interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts suppress grins at such declarations of
sincerity. They recall that before Soong was a political renegade,
he played the role of hard-nosed party operative _ including a
stint as government information director, during which he clamped
down on the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Soong was a party hack from the moment he joined the KMT
until the moment he was thrown out,'' said Shelley Rigger, an
expert on Taiwanese politics at Davidson College in North Carolina.
``But he has assembled an enormous base of popular support.''
</P>
<P>
   Soong's support has the potential to transform politics on this
island. Historically, Taiwan's top leaders, from Chiang Kai-shek to
President Lee Teng-hui, have ruled with sweeping powers. Although
Lee helped introduce democracy over the past decade, he also built
the Nationalist Party into a juggernaut that was all but impossible
to stop in a national election.
</P>
<P>
   While Chen Shui-bian finally defeated it, he did so only because
Soong split the traditional Nationalist vote. Soong noted that
together, he and the Nationalist candidate, Lien Chan, drew more
than 60 percent. That, he says, makes him a force for Chen to
reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be the supervisor and watchdog,'' Soong
declared in an interview in the dining room of a gracious house
that he said belonged to his mother. ``The KMT was humiliated; they
have no credible person to do it. So I have to play that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Soong made his name as a retail politician. As the provincial
governor of Taiwan, he boasted of visiting nearly every village on
the island. Since the election ended, Soong has kept up a
dawn-to-dusk travel schedule that looks suspiciously like a
campaign. He says he is merely thanking his supporters. But he
notes, ``People are greeting me like a hero, not like someone who
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Soong's maneuvering has other implications for Chen. The
Nationalists still control Taiwan's legislature, with 117 of the
225 seats. If Soong were to throw his weight behind the just-formed
New Taiwanese People's Party, analysts believe he could lure 50 to
70 seats from the Nationalists. That would vault Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party into the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If James Soong joins this new party, it will be very solid and
powerful,'' said Lo Cheng-tien, the deputy secretary general of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Soong was able to rejoin the Nationalists,
he could bring most of his supporters back under the party's
banner. That would enable the Nationalist Party to retain its
majority in the Legislature, where it could thwart much of Chen's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts predict that despite his popularity,
Soong will not be invited back. ``There is still strong opposition
to him right now, because the election was so bitter,'' said Ma
Ying-jeou, the mayor of Taipei, who is regarded as one of the
Nationalist Party's rising stars.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that a mob of angry Soong supporters massed in
front of the Nationalist Party headquarters every day last week to
howl for Lee's resignation. Soong denied he was behind the
protests. But the image of his partisans hurling rocks and eggs at
the building may stick.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Soong could not resist a jab at the demoralized
Nationalists. ``I told them if I was behind it, it would not be
such a small demonstration,'' he said with a grin. ``Why should I
have 20 or 100 people? I can mobilize half a million people in
Taipei.''

   NAZARETH, Israel _ Cheered by a mixed local crowd of Muslims and
Christians, Pope John Paul II appeared for one sun-dappled moment
to have erased the religious rifts in this ancient city as he came
to celebrate Mass here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many stops on the pope's carefully scripted Holy
Land itinerary, the visit here Saturday was a genuinely indigenous
affair, with lots of hometown pride mixed with straightforward
religious fervor. There were no overt politics, no delicate
interfaith initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   As the gold-hubcapped popemobile passed through the streets
where Jesus is believed to have spent his childhood, the Israeli
Arabs who are today's Nazarenes waved yellow Vatican flags, hoisted
tots in commemorative papal baseball caps, and held up placards
welcoming the pope, ``Benvenuto Papa Carissimo.'' The pope, tightly
gripping the white handrail in his bulletproof encasement, blessed
the crowd to roars of approval.
</P>
<P>
   He then proceeded on this Catholic holy day of the Annunciation
to the huge modernist Basilica of the Annunciation, built to
commemorate the moment here 2,000 years ago when Catholics believe
that the Archangel Gabriel told the Virgin Mary that she was to be
the mother of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The fortress-like structure, the largest Roman Catholic church
in the Middle East, is a 1950s creation of Italian architects and
Israeli civil engineers. It sits atop the sequential ruins of a
fourth-century Byzantine oratory, a grander 12th-century Crusader
church and an 18th-century Franciscan chapel. Deep below its
ancient foundations is a cave believed in Christian tradition to
have been Mary's family home.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims have received approval from the Israeli government to
build a mosque in the plaza adjacent to the basilica, causing
tension in the town, which has seen its Christian population shrink
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Muslims joined enthusiastically in the festivities
Saturday, though the crowd outside was dominated by Nazareth's
Christian minority. ``This is an expression of our joy at the visit
of his holiness the pope,'' said Saman Arslen, the director of a
40-member Islamic Scouts drum corps, as it pounded out a deafening
welcome to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was seen primarily as a gesture toward Israel's
dwindling number of Christians, who once dominated Nazareth and the
Galilee region. Local Christians worry that they have become a
minority within a minority, now barely 10 percent of an otherwise
Islamic Arab population in a state that is five-sixths Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians greeting the pope glared at the small group of
Muslims who had camped on the plaza where they plan to erect the
mosque next to the tomb of a nephew of Saladin, the warrior hero
who expelled the Crusaders in 1187. The Vatican strongly objected
to the project as an Islamic attempt to overshadow a traditional
Catholic pilgrimage site, and to remind the Muslim faithful of the
atrocities committed against their ancestors by the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians did not appear to be placated by the Islamists'
handwritten signs in English, Italian, Hebrew and Arabic welcoming
the pope and calling their planned mosque ``a symbol of harmony and
neighborliness.'' But the Muslims adhered to an agreement with the
police to keep a low profile, and they were silent and virtually
invisible as the papal motorcade passed.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security was taking no chances. All roads to the town
center were blocked from dawn. Sharpshooters patrolled rooftops.
The blue-uniformed riot squads and olive-green army platoons along
the pope's route often outnumbered the families crowding the
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   But inside this heavily policed bubble, the mood was genuinely
celebratory and free of visible religious strains. Even the lapel
stickers worn for the papal visit by Israeli security forces _
``Mivtza Yedid Vatik,'' Hebrew for ``Operation Old Friend'' _
seemed to reflect the remarkably congenial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many stops on the pope's carefully scripted Holy
Land itinerary, the Nazareth visit was a genuinely indigenous
affair, with lots of hometown pride mixed with straightforward
religious fervor. There were no overt politics, no delicate
interfaith initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily to an invited congregation of area church leaders
and lay dignitaries, the pope delivered a traditional holy day
message venerating the memory of the Virgin Mary and avoiding even
indirect allusions to religious divisions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this day the eyes of the whole church turn to Nazareth,''
he said. ``I have longed to come back to the town of Jesus, to feel
once again, in contact with this place, the presence of the woman
of whom St. Augustine wrote: `He chose the mother he had created;
he created the mother he had chosen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pope spent 10 minutes praying alone in the sacred grotto
near the basilica Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his carefully apolitical sermon _ his only public
remarks here _ many Christians here saw his visit as an intentional
reminder to both the Muslim majority locally and the Jewish
majority nationally of the symbolic importance of Nazareth to the
Christian world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel with this visit that now there is someone who is
looking after us, when we felt that we had been forgotten,'' said
Robert Dirawi, a 37-year-old Nazareth-born Roman Catholic. When
Pope Paul VI visited Nazareth in 1964, Dirawi recalled, about
two-thirds of the town was Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is two-thirds Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Even Orthodox Christians, who often resent what they see as the
Vatican's attempt to claim primacy among the Christian churches,
said Saturday that they welcomed the pope's pilgrimage. ``It is a
visit to say that we are here, and that we have an identity,'' said
Rafleh Ghanadreh, a Greek Orthodox Christian from Nazareth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The senior Catholic clerics accompanying the pope were acutely
aware of the importance of the visit for the Christian minority.
``It is a source of great hope for them, and it will be a source of
strength for them to carry on their wonderful Christian
traditions,'' Cardinal Adam Joseph Maida, the archbishop of
Detroit, said as he waited to be escorted through an Israeli police
phalanx outside the basilica Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Even inside the basilica the issue was raised. Antoine Shaheen,
an Arab Christian and retired Israeli tourism official who took
communion from the pope Saturday, criticized the government for
``playing political games'' and rewarding the Muslims, who he said
had ``unilaterally occupied'' what was formerly a public square.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Christians are not against the building of a mosque in
principle, but we are against the way it is being done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth has for centuries been the Christian Arab center of
what is now northern Israel. But Muslim leaders note that from the
collapse of the 12-century Crusader kingdom until the early
20th-century British mandate, Nazareth, like the rest of the Holy
Land, was under uninterrupted Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Zoebi, a leader of the ``mosque defense committee'' here,
made the point plainly. ``This land does not belong to the
Christians,'' he said.

HOPES AND PROTESTS SURROUND POPE'S VISIT TO ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ There with the pope, in a red-tiled Italian
convent's guesthouse overlooking the misty Sea of Galilee as dusk
approached, the worldly realities of nasty Israeli politics seemed
delightfully far away.
</P>
<P>
   But ``chik-chak,'' as the Israelis say for right away, it was
over for Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Inclement weather had delayed the start of the pope's day, so
Barak ended up with but 16 minutes in his compassionate company _
albeit 16 minutes likely to give a leader of any religious
background some faith.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the pope walked slowly down to the Church of
Beatitudes, to pray and read from the Sermon on the Mount, at the
very site where Jesus supposedly blessed the poor in spirit. Barak
had no time for such contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   An open microphone caught him confiding to the pope as he
prepared to hurry away. He apologized for cutting short their time
together. But the sirens were about to sound for the start of the
Jewish Sabbath, a time when all work stops in the religious Jewish
world, and all public evidence of it for those politicians who
depend on religious parties' support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go now, we can't break the laws of Shabbat. We have
to keep our government together,'' Barak told the pope. He rushed
to a waiting helicopter. When it landed in Tiberias, where he was
to spend the night, a security agent sent a relieved message over a
walkie-talkie: ``The parcel has arrived _ three minutes before the
Sabbath!''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Find the Words
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the long red carpet sat two rows of strictly
Orthodox rabbis, most of them elderly men in black frock coats,
black hats and long white beards. On the other, facing them, were
two rows of Catholic prelates in cassocks, red sashes and red
skullcaps, with crucifixes dangling from their necks.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 minutes they waited together as the pope met privately
with Israel's two chief rabbis. Eyes were averted, throats cleared.
It was probably the largest high-level meeting of Catholic and
ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders ever, many said.
</P>
<P>
   How to make small talk after 2,000 years?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray tried. ``You know the tailor who made
my very first cassock was Jewish,'' he said. ``And I have Jewish
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope finally emerged and walked down the carpet.
Surprisingly, the rabbis mobbed him. Some, as Etchegaray had done
with them, sought a common bond, however awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him in Polish that I am one of the few Jewish children
who survived the Holocaust from Poland,'' said Rabbi Yosef
Glicksberg, chief rabbi of the city of Givatayim.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly interfaith dialogue, but it was a start.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wistful Words
</P>
<P>
   Two elderly Palestinian woman, wearing traditional embroidered
dresses and head scarves, stood patiently for hours on Wednesday to
catch a glimpse of the pope's visit to their refugee camp. Even
after he left, they remained in the streets despite the chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that was it,'' said one, Um Moussa. ``We barely
saw him. Maybe he will take tea with Abu Amar and then come back,''
she said, using the nom de guerre of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, we were happy to receive him,'' said the other,
Um Bader. ``We do not know what will happen as a result of this
visit, but maybe he will help us. He pities the poor Palestinian
people, that is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can he help us in returning to our homes?'' said Um
Moussa. ``Mine is a mall now. The big Malha mall, where the movie
theaters are and the fancy shops. That's where I used to live. So
it's hopeless for me, the dream of return. Not even the pope can
take down such a mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Um Bader put her hand on her friend's arm, interrupting. ``We
have seen him passing by. It is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Um Moussa nodded in agreement. ``There is no joy in our hearts,
no delight in our days. So it was an opportunity, a break in the
routine.''
</P>
<P>
   They continued to wait, arm in arm, as night descended.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Angry Words and Curses
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope's visit, much attention was paid to posters in
an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood that called the pope
wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the religious Jewish community, however, insisted
that such neighborhoods were indifferent, not hostile, to the
visit. The posters, they said, were the work of a fringe group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many secular Israeli journalists thought the sentiment
existed and wanted to illustrate it. Channel Two television, on the
night of the pope's arrival, showed chilling footage of a midnight
rite in a cemetery in the northern town of Sfad, a home to
Kabbalist Jewish mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   In the eerie ceremony, a man identified as a Kabbalist placed a
mortal curse on the pope as others blew a ram's horn. He called the
pope a ``hater of Jews'' and put him in the company of Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Hafez Assad, the Syrian
president, who were also cursed.
</P>
<P>
   The scene alarmed Israelis, since it recalled curses on Yitzhak
Rabin, the former prime minister who was assassinated by an
extremist Jew in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the police detained the man, Meir Baranes. Concerned
spokesmen for the religious community sent urgent messages to the
foreign media: The man is considered ``a mentally unbalanced
individual'' and unrepresentative of the Orthodox community, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the police placed a researcher for the television
program under house arrest. He was suspected of staging the
ceremony, and paying the participants.
</P>
<P>
   And a Chorus of Critics
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit did not magically erase millennia-old religious
tensions in the Holy Land. But it did create some strange
bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   An extremist right-wing Jewish group called Kach, Christian
biblical scholars such as the Rev. Jerome Murphy O'Connor, and
environmentalists all protested what the Israelis did to the Mount
of Beatitudes in preparation for the pope's huge outdoor Mass on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They paved paradise _ or at least relatively virgin terrain _
and put up a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   After much prodding and the threat of lawsuits, Israel promised
to return the site to its unspoiled condition. All it would take,
officials said, was some planting and maybe a couple of
springtimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we know?'' Moshe Fogel, the government's spokesman,
said. ``This is the first time the state of Israel ever put on a
Mass.''

<P>
   SHOALWATER BAY INDIAN RESERVATION, Wash. _ The tiny tribe that
lives here on a wind-battered, rain-swept spit of land hard by the
Pacific Ocean knows something about fighting for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Shoalwater tribe fight the heavy erosion that
over the decades has eaten more than half of the 1-square-mile
reservation created in 1866 when President Andrew Johnson signed an
executive order removing the tribe from nearby villages. And they
fight for economic survival, their latest battle a feud with
federal marshals over the number and type of slot machines they may
keep at a casino that is their main source of income.
</P>
<P>
   But the most difficult battle is for the women who live here,
who are up against an unseen foe, a killer that seems to come and
go over the years, though no one can even prove it exists. For some
reason, it is frighteningly difficult to give birth to a living
child here.
</P>
<P>
   The worst year was 1998, when all but one of nine known
pregnancies on the reservation ended in a miscarriage or
stillbirth. Since then, eight pregnancies have lasted 12 weeks or
longer, and half of them have ended in miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around the village and you start asking yourself,
`Where are the children?''' said Lisa Shipman, who had a stillborn
son in 1990 and whose sister-in-law, Vernita Norman, has miscarried
three times and recently left the reservation, in fear, when she
became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Shipman and her husband, Michael, finally had happy news last
April when a healthy daughter, Kaylee, was born. ``This was
everybody's pregnancy,'' she said. ``She is the community baby.
Everybody dotes on her. But you still wonder, where are all the
others? Where is the next generation coming from?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that neither tribal leaders nor federal
investigators can answer for sure. The national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, called in after the 1998 calamity to study
the alarmingly high rate of fetal deaths, issued a report this year
that confirmed the fears of the tribe, one of the smallest, with
204 members, and poorest in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's study pegged the miscarriage rate after an
established pregnancy at 50 percent to 67 percent, roughly three to
four times the expected rate. But while such a cluster of health
afflictions is disturbing, the study cautioned that it was dealing
with such a statistically small sample that a definitive problem
could not be proved _ nor, as is the case with other federal
studies here, did it find a cause.
</P>
<P>
   The killer could be lurking in the environment. Pesticides are
routinely sprayed on cranberry bogs north of the reservation, on
forestland to the east, and even into Willapa Bay, to control
parasites that attack the oysters that are a big industry in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a genetic flaw, though marriage among tribal members
is rare and several of the miscarriages have been experienced by
nontribal women married to Shoalwater men. It could stem from
poverty and poor diet on the reservation. Alcohol or drug abuse are
often a factor in miscarriages, but the federal study found no
evidence of either problem here.
</P>
<P>
   And several women on the reservation, with the miscarriage
problem so well-known, talked of the meticulous care they took
during their pregnancies, down to drinking bottled water and even
avoiding any food grown here or plucked from the nearby sea. Still,
there were miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it could be just an awful run of chance, though
no one seems to believe that is the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would almost be easier to take if it was just a random
occurrence, just a stretch of terrible luck,'' said Gale Taylor,
the tribal health director, a non-Indian who had a miscarriage in
1997. ``That would be nice because you think, well, it could stop.
The fact of the matter is, though, every day I'm waiting for the
other shoe to drop. One month here, we lost four pregnancies. It
was like a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribal chairman, Herbert Madzu Whitish, who also owns a
convenience store on the reservation, said he was frustrated by the
lack of answers and worried about both ``the generation that is
missing here'' and the women on the reservation who wanted to bear
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid of pregnancy,'' Whitish said.
``Instead of it being the most joyous time of their lives, it's
like they're on pins and needles, worrying that something is going
to happen.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tribe concluded there was a serious problem when its records
showed that from 1988 to 1992, at least 10 of 19 pregnancies had
ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.
</P>
<P>
   A clinic was built, largely with federal dollars, to provide
more immediate care and monitoring of pregnancies. State and
federal environmental reports found high levels of three pesticides
in the drainage areas of the cranberry bogs, but did not find the
tribe's drinking water to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem slipped from public attention when the tribe had
several healthy births from 1993 to 1996; by 1998, though, the
level of miscarriage was at its highest in memory, and the fear
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything I thought I could possibly do to have a
healthy baby,'' said Kim Zillyett, the business manager at the
tribal clinic here, who has miscarried twice in the last two years
and is expecting a baby in May _ an event she alternately views
with joy and worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over till he's out,'' Zillyett said, referring to a
boy whom she and her husband plan to name Teegan, an Irish name
they found in a baby book. ``It's not over until he's here and he's
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, which was created a century and a half ago when
several bands of Lower Columbia Chinook Indians were put together
after refusing to sign a treaty with the U.S. government and live
on a reservation with the rival Chehalis Tribe, ``is not going down
without a fight,'' Whitish said.
</P>
<P>
   It has applied for federal money for more extensive
environmental testing of reservation land and greater monitoring of
all pregnancies. It has an extensive grief-counseling program,
including a series of art projects in the log-frame tribal center
here that allows the Shoalwaters to express grief over the tribe's
mysterious affliction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are survivors,'' said Dr. Kristen M. Swanson, a
professor of family and child nursing at the University of
Washington, an expert on dealing with miscarriage who has been
invited by the tribal council to study the community's response to
the miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a lot that they've had to survive,'' Swanson
added. ``And the chairman has been very clear whenever I've met
with him that they will do all they can to get through this. In a
lot of ways you have to stand in admiration as to how the tribe has
not let this roll over them. They've gone to the Centers for
Disease Control, they've gone to the universities, they've gone to
the Indian Health Service, they're fighting for what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet there remains enormous frustration that no one has a
clear answer for why the problem has arisen. ``When the recent
report came out, I was glad that, yes, they recognized there were
significant problems,'' Whitish said. ``But they didn't offer much
in the way of any kind of answers. I guess I got caught up in the
TV version. I thought the investigators could ride in here and give
us the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the tribal health director, is also dismayed that she
cannot give certain answers when women on the reservation ask how
to improve their chances of a healthy pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have to tell people that maybe the water they drink
is the cause, or just walking on the beach is a cause, or that
maybe there's no cause at all, that's frightening,'' she said. ``A
lot of women feel, if you want to stay pregnant, get the hell out
of the reservation. It's hard. We're losing our land on one side,
and we're losing our babies on the other. It's not a great way to
live.''

BAGHDAD CALLS ATTACK RETALIATION BY TEHRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By HADANI DITMARS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Even in a city that has weathered countless
barrages of missiles and bombs in recent years, most aimed by
American or British forces, the mortar attack in a residential
neighborhood of Baghdad last week that killed four people and
wounded 38 was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The strike on Tuesday appeared to be carried out in retaliation
for recent mortar attacks in Tehran that were attributed to an
Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, many of whose
guerrilla camps are just a few hours from Baghdad, along the border
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iran has struck at the group's bases outside Baghdad in
the past, the attack last week was the first on a civilian area of
the capital in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Since a cease-fire in 1988 ended a brutal eight-year war between
Iran and Iraq, relations between the two have remained tense and
each country harbors dissident groups fighting to topple the
other's government.
</P>
<P>
   As in Iran, where civilians in Tehran have twice been hit in the
past three months in mortar attacks claimed by the Mujahedeen
Khalq, ordinary people last week took the brunt of the tit-for-tat
violence that still plagues the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi news agency said the government held Iran
responsible for the mortar attack and reserved ``the right to
retaliate.'' Iraq said it had shot down a pilotless Iranian
reconnaissance plane over the southern part of the country, the
second in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, too, has said it holds Iraq responsible for attacks by the
Mujahedeen Khalq, which claimed responsibility for a mortar strike
on March 13 on a residential complex in Tehran that injured four
people. The group has also been blamed by Iran for a similar attack
in residential Tehran near the president's office in early
February.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the United States, which lifted some sanctions
against Iran this month, made public a satellite photograph of what
it said was a sprawling complex intended as a base for the
Mujahedeen Khalq 40 miles outside Baghdad. The photo was
declassified, it said, to prove that Iraq was supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   At Kindi Hospital in Baghdad, the details of who carried out the
attack last week and why were of little interest to the victims'
being treated there, or to their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tuesday's bombs fell, my children thought it was the
Americans,'' said the hospital director, Dr. Sarmad al-Kassar. ``I
tried to explain, but they have been so traumatized that they now
think every explosion is a bomb from America.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassar, who was trained in Glasgow, said he was concerned about
his children's psychological health, as much as anything. ``If I
have to leave for the hospital at night, they start screaming and
worry that the Americans are attacking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the recovery ward, the wounded residents of the apartment
building, many of whom are Palestinian immigrants, took the attack
as another in a series of life's hardships.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who said she was 30, lay serenely in a hospital bed,
the bone in her left leg shattered by the shelling. Her 9-year-old
daughter, Sarah, lay in a bed next to hers, with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in
Jordan, but moved to Iraq with her husband, a construction worker,
in 1990, when Iraq had one of the region's most developed
economies. Their plans for a better life were thwarted, however,
with the Persian Gulf War and the decade of American and U.N.
sanctions, clamped on Iraq that year for its invasion of its
southern neighbor, Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she said, she thought the blast that injured her on
Tuesday was caused by a gas heater. After a second missile hit,
however, when she saw friends and family lying wounded on the
ground, she thought it must be an American attack. When taken to
the hospital, she was told it was Iranian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranian, American,'' she shrugged, ``What can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite bed, Afifa Muhammad, 60, who was also wounded in
the shelling, was recovering from surgery on a shattered fibula.
Seven of her relatives were also wounded. The ones who were not
hovered near the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister explained that Muhammad was born in Haifa in 1940 and
came to Baghdad in 1948. A few seconds later, Muhammad herself,
still groggy from the surgery, interrupted. ``But this is my
home,'' she said. ``Iraq is my country now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added that her sincere hope was that there would be
``peace in Iraq, peace in Palestine and in the whole region,'' and
emphasized her point with a sweeping gesture that, even in her
weakened state, seemed intended to encompass the entire room and
even the world beyond.

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ In an effort to defuse tensions in a
region that he has described as the most volatile in the world,
President Clinton on Saturday asked the military leader of Pakistan
to show restraint in Kashmir, where Pakistan and India most
recently battled last summer, and to reopen a dialogue with his
Indian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than an hour and a half with Gen. Pervaiz
Musharraf, Clinton received no assurances, said a senior
administration official who participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke no new ground on Kashmir,'' the official said after
the session. ``We heard no new assurances from the general.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had expected little if any immediate
progress from the talks with Musharraf, and the White House
official made clear that none was made beyond the mere dialogue
itself. Pressed on terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons and
when he would return Pakistan to democracy at the national level,
the general offered nothing new, the official indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India, the world's two newest nuclear powers,
regularly skirmish in Kashmir, which has been the main issue
between overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India since the
two nations were created from the British Raj in 1947, and the
status of the Himalayan territory was left perilously unresolved.
The Clinton administration believes that incursions by
Pakistani-backed militants into Indian-held Kashmir have the
potential to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, battles in the mountainous Kargil region of Kashmir
were regarded as the first direct combat between two nuclear powers
_ fighting that was halted after Clinton persuaded Pakistan's then
civilian prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to back down. Three months
later, Sharif was ousted by Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who decided to come to Pakistan after intense
disagreement within the administration, spent barely six hours in
this country, arriving from an extensive five-day tour of India
under some of the most elaborate security precautions ever devised
for his travels.
</P>
<P>
   After his apparently grim meeting with Musharraf, Clinton made a
direct appeal to the Pakistani people in a live television
broadcast in which he addressed them as friends of the United
States. Instead of looking toward a future of economic collapse and
potential war, the people should choose the path of economic
security and peace, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the right vision rooted in tomorrow's promise, not in
yesterday's pain, with a new dialogue, not destruction, Pakistan
can fulfill its destiny as a beacon of democracy in the Muslim
world,'' Clinton said. If Pakistanis choose this path, he promised,
``The United States will walk with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said the president had stressed to
Musharraf that there could be no military solution in Kashmir by
incursions across the Line of Control, as the border between
Pakistani- and Indian-held territory is known.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked specifically for ``restraint, respect for the
Line of Control, rejection of violence and return to dialogue,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much movement on other issues, either.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked the general to take action against terrorist
groups operating in Pakistan and to help pressure the Taliban
government in Afghanistan to bring to justice Osama bin Laden, the
terrorist who the United States believes is responsible for the
bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The general, as he has in the past, said he would work with the
Taliban leadership on the Osama bin Laden case, the official said.
But so far, the general has failed to fulfill his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters as Clinton was leaving Islamabad,
Musharraf said he and the American president got along very well.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, no photographs of the two leaders together,
and the general _ as planned _ held a news conference alone.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he had given Clinton assurances that
Pakistani-backed infiltration into Indian-held Kashmir would cease,
the general replied: ``There were no assurances, because there was
no question. We are not involved in sending any kind of people
across the Line of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Taliban, the general said he assured Clinton ``that I
would like to engage the Taliban in Afghanistan and take up the
issue of any sanctuaries for any terrorists or training that might
be going on in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of nonproliferation, the general pledged that
Pakistan would not be a source for the export of nuclear
technology, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   As the official ticked off the list of items on the president's
agenda with the general, it was clear there was a recitation of
long-held views on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said the official: ``We've made an effort to make our
position clear at the highest level. We didn't expect to come in an
hour and persuade the leadership of the wisdom of our position.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one point of the hotly debated stop in Pakistan, White
House officials said, was to try to keep the lines of communication
open. Should the situation deteriorate sharply in Kashmir _ as the
administration fears _ Clinton is now in a better position to deal
directly with Musharraf, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the administration will be able to argue that Clinton
tried his best, by coming here, to avert a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also brought up the trial of the former prime minister,
Sharif, who is accused of hijacking, treason and attempted murder.
If convicted, Sharif could face the death penalty, and Clinton on
Saturday asked the general not to execute him. In reply, the
general explained that he was not a vindictive man but that the
matter was up to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As he had in New Delhi, India, Clinton made clear to the general
that the United States would not mediate in the Kashmir crisis, the
White House official said. This was also a message that Musharraf
did not want to hear: Unlike the Indians, the Pakistani leader
would like the Kashmir dispute to be settled by international
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The signals from Musharraf in the days before Clinton's arrival
were not promising. The Pakistani leader missed an opportunity to
send a positive message on his national day on Thursday when he
made a major speech.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of announcing that local elections would be held this
year, as he had indicated earlier, the general pushed the date back
to next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the general has consistently talked in recent weeks about
the Islamic militants in Kashmir, who the administration says are
backed by the Pakistani regime, as freedom fighters committed to a
jihad, or holy war. The administration regards several of these
groups as terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan asserts that Kashmir, with a large Muslim majority,
should have the right to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan.
Secular India claims Kashmir as one of its states.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions behind the issue were vividly on display in some of
the banners along the route taken by Clinton's motorcade. ``You
were fair in Kosovo,'' said one, referring to NATO's bombing
campaign to deter Serbian repression against Kosovo's largely
Muslim Albanian majority. ``Why not in Kashmir?''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   It is politically untenable for a Pakistani leader to appear as
though he is bending to an American diktat. Sharif's decision to
pull back from the Indian side of the Line of Control last summer
is thought to have been one factor behind his ouster in October by
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the general stands another, perhaps even tougher,
commander, Gen. Mohammad Aziz, the chief of general staff of the
Pakistani army, who Clinton administration officials assert was the
brains behind the fighting in Kargil last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived from Bombay, India, under elaborate security
precautions. At the Bombay airport, he walked to the door of a
military C-17 aircraft, shook hands with dignitaries as though he
were going to board that aircraft, and then slipped around the
front of the plane to board an unmarked, smaller white jet that was
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This aircraft, an Air Force version of a Gulfstream, known as a
C-20, flew Clinton, his national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and several other
advisers to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   From the Islamabad airport, Clinton drove in a motorcade through
deserted streets to the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's unmarked plane was accompanied by another Air Force
Gulfstream, which was painted with the familiar blue and white of
Air Force 1 and marked ``United States of America.'' This was the
decoy plane with Secret Service agents on board and it arrived
first, followed soon after by the president's plane. Many of
Clinton's staff and reporters covering his trip were flown in on a
military C-17 aircraft.

<P>
   JOELTON, Tenn. _ It was taking a while for Ralph Wilkerson to
get around to eating all the squirrel meat that had been in his
freezer since he and his son brought it home from their hunting
jaunts last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot about two dozen squirrels in the woods behind our
house back in August and September,'' said Wilkerson, 62, a
projects manager at Odom's Tennessee Pride Sausage.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night, Wilkerson and his 24-year-old son, Jason,
were able to use the last of their bounty to help support an
organization for men just like the Wilkersons, men with a deep
Christian faith who also enjoy hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilkersons brought two casserole dishes full of squirrel
dumplings to Thursday night's fund-raising dinner in the gymnasium
of the Joelton First Baptist Church. The buffet meal, called a Wild
Game Tasting, benefited the local chapter of the Christian
Sportsmen's Fellowship, an evangelistic organization based in
Atlanta that reaches out to Christian hunters.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 men, women and children in this small town about
30 miles north of Nashville came to the gathering, which featured
such concoctions as elk chili, doves in brown gravy, deer sausage
and barbecued black bear.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jordan, the president of the fellowship, said the
organization was trying to reach men who go hunting and fishing on
Sunday morning instead of going to church. The group uses hunting
and fishing, Jordan said, to ``connect with men through activities
they like to pursue as hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1994, the fellowship, with the motto ``On Target to
Catch Men for Christ,'' has nearly 300 local affiliates in the
United States, Jordan said. It publishes a magazine called ``The
Christian Sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not put on hunting and fishing events,'' Jordan said.
``We put on events, such as the wild-game banquets, that have
hunting and fishing themes, where men can share their passions for
hunting and fishing with each other and with their families. But
the real point of all we do is to build relationships and to
present the gospel of Jesus Christ. It's a way of building a bridge
with outdoorsmen. We use hunting and fishing illustrations to
convey the love of God in terms many men can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   At most of the fellowship-sponsored events there are keynote
speakers. At Thursday night's dinner, Steve Chapman, author of ``A
Look at Life From a Deer Stand,'' spoke and sang about balancing
the time a man spends fishing and hunting with the time he spends
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman tours the country with his wife, speaking and singing to
groups about Christianity and hunting and honoring family. ``Men
mentoring men was a lost art in this country for many years,'' he
said. ``So I'm just reminding them of things they already know.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke at a wild-game dinner in Pennsylvania a few
weeks ago with 1,000 pounds of wild game and 1,600 people attending
over two nights. ``I've been noticing,'' he said, ``that churches
are using game dinners as outreach tools to men more and more in
the past four or five years. It started in the South, but now it is
all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Balmer, a professor of American Religion at Barnard
College, said the Christian Sportsmen's Fellowship was part of the
``pattern of what is called muscular Christianity, various
initiatives that have been launched to attempt to make Christianity
more palatable to men.''
</P>
<P>
   Balmer said the group was similar to better-known organizations
like Promise Keepers or the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
``Usually these organizations draw on two themes,'' he said. ``One
is the militaristic rhetoric of `We're engaged in a battle against
dark forces.' Another theme is athleticism as an evangelistic
strategy. The rhetoric is about running the race, and often sports
figures are used to endorse their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the group emphasizes both of those themes. In his talk
at the Wild Game Tasting, Chapman said, ``There is a moral battle
that needs to be fought and won through Christ. Too many young men
in our culture do not know that.'' And in its magazine and other
official literature, Steve Bartkowski, a former quarterback for the
Atlanta Falcons, is showcased as the fellowship's national
spokesman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the fellowship purports not to have a political agenda,
every year the group sponsors a Sportsmen's Prayer Breakfast at the
National Rifle Association's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart and soul of the fellowship is expressed at events
such as Thursday night's dinner. The evening ended with an auction
of hunting-related paraphernalia, including one of the most popular
items that the group offers: the Camouflaged Bible. The New
International Version is a pocket-size edition of the New
Testament, along with Psalms and Proverbs, bound in a durable
green, tan, black and brown camouflage-design cover.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time Michael Boble, 29, had attended one of
the group's events. ``I enjoyed the fellowship with the other men
here,'' he said. ``In some other hunting organizations you'll hear
foul language and there will be lots of drinking, but this was much
better, more Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cruise, 27, a fellowship member, said, ``People may see
this as redneck or Bubba. But you've got very educated people who
are hunters. I'm working on my doctorate in ministry. I hunt for
the solitude of it, more than I hunt for the deer.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who think that eating squirrel and bear is exotic,
Cruise answered: ``To me it's no stranger than eating raw fish. I
like my food cooked. You're not ever going to see me at a sushi
bar.''

IN CHELSEA PARK, ANOTHER JOLT TO BUMPY LIFE OF SOVIET DISSIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some Soviet dissidents became international symbols
of human rights in the 1980s. Nikolai Tolstykh, like thousands of
others, served his political imprisonment in obscurity. Confined
for years in labor camps for anti-Soviet propaganda, Tolstykh was
nearly 40 and estranged from his wife and son by the time a thaw in
the Cold War cracked open his cell door and sent him to America.
</P>
<P>
   He had studied medicine, psychiatry and law in the Soviet Union.
But in New York City, where his name became Tolstich, his broken
English and bad health left him struggling in temporary jobs as a
home health aide. He was depressed, friends said, and he drank. In
late 1998, a decade after Mikhail Gorbachev ordered him freed,
Tolstich entered a Manhattan homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he still cut a professorial figure on Dec. 6,
when he sat down on a bench in a Chelsea park at noon in a light
rain. A thin, neatly dressed man of 51 with short hair and a
goatee, he had beside him a briefcase holding a Russian-English
dictionary, a book of philosophy and a few personal items,
including a hairbrush.
</P>
<P>
   But two New York City police officers had reason to suspect he
was homeless. His bench was one of a dozen in the park on Ninth
Avenue and 28th Street across from the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen,
where 1,000 homeless people eat daily. Sure enough, when the
officers demanded identification, Tolstich produced a homeless
shelter ID card.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstich said they ordered him to put his briefcase on the
ground, stood him against a tree, frisked him and searched his
pockets, according to an affidavit he signed on Dec. 29. Then they
issued him a summons for a violation _ ``obstructing park bench'' _
because he had the briefcase on it.
</P>
<P>
   This month, lawyers for the homeless added Tolstich's affidavit
and summons to a 1997 federal class-action lawsuit that has
challenged the constitutionality of the Giuliani administration's
crackdowns on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But Tolstich himself has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He was last seen at the 30th Street Men's Shelter in Manhattan
on Jan. 7 _ three days before his court date to contest the
violation. Letters from his elderly mother in St. Petersburg
collect at the social service agency where he received his mail.
And after fruitlessly searching the jails and shelter system, his
lawyer and Soviet emigres who know him say they are worried that
Tolstich may have found the revival of old fears unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, he wrote: ``I now associate that park not only
with the experience I had on Dec. 6, but also with my experience in
the Soviet Union. There, because it was a totalitarian state, the
police could treat anyone the way the police treated me on that
day. On Dec. 6, I felt treated like somebody in the Soviet Union,
because I am homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokesman, Lt. Stephen Biegel, would not
comment on the case because a judge has not ruled on it. But he
said that the police received many neighborhood complaints about
homeless people spreading belongings on park benches. Park
regulations prohibit the use of a bench in a way that interferes
with its availability.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the nonprofit Urban
Justice Center, who met Tolstich at the soup kitchen's legal
clinic, said that during the month Tolstich prepared his affidavit,
he was sober and reliable, keeping three appointments. The former
dissident, who studied in Leningrad at the prestigious Academy of
Arts and at the Medical Institute before being sent to hard labor
in prison camps, was in a workfare job at the time, records show,
cleaning doors on Wall Street in exchange for weekly relief of
$11.25 and $32 in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Lasdon said that he was thrilled to have a man with such a
history join the lawsuit. He told Tolstich the park bench violation
was likely to be dismissed, but warned that a failure to appear in
court would generate an arrest warrant. He noted that the police
had been raiding shelters to round up homeless people with
outstanding warrants. For now, no warrant has been issued for
Tolstich, because the clinic's lawyers have won three adjournments
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   To the fraying circle of former Soviet dissidents, Tolstich's
case is an emblem of how the post-Communist world has forgotten
their sacrifices. ``A lot of them have come to no good end,'' said
Edward Kline, the president of the Andrei Sakharov Foundation.
``They haven't found a place for themselves in the West and they
can't really go back _ they're unwanted in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Yarim-Agaev, a former dissident leader, said that young
Russians in both countries shook their heads at political activism
and asked, `` `Why would anybody do that instead of making money?'
Nobody in that generation remembers that there was even a Cold War
or Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it likely, as Tolstich's Jan. 10 court date drew near, that
memories of being locked up overwhelmed him? ``Of course, yes,
absolutely,'' said Yuri Fedorov, a veteran of Soviet political
imprisonment and president of the Gratitude Fund, a charity that
helps Soviet dissidents. ``He's not a very strong man,'' Fedorov
added. ``He used to be a very good man.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Soviet exiles placed Tolstich's name on a list of
political prisoners, with only the barest facts of his case.
Veterans of those days read volumes between the lines of his entry:
1980-83, imprisoned under fabricated criminal charge. Arrested
spring 1985, Article 70. Publication of his works abroad. Tried
December 1985-January 1986. Political camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yarim-Agaev said that fabricated criminal charges were
especially commonplace in 1980, during a three-year campaign by the
KGB to eliminate dissent. After rounding up all the visible
activists, he said, the secret police arrested little-known
dissenters and put them with criminals. ``That is part of the
tragedy of Nikolai,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The works that got Tolstich in trouble are long forgotten _
probably articles in the Russian-language press of Europe, experts
say. But they were enough for charges under Article 70, which
outlawed ``anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.'' Pretrial
detention was harsh in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), whether in a
KGB prison known as ``the gray house,'' or in Kresty, the infamous
czarist-era fortress with punishment booths that only had room for
a man to stand.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction under Article 70 meant punishment in a political
labor camp, with even more severe physical conditions and limited
interaction with the outside world than in the criminal camp, said
Yarim-Agaev, who called it ``the second circle of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolstich was one of 200 political prisoners released by decree
of Gorbachev in late 1987, and among those expelled from the
country, his affidavit said. Within days of arriving in New York,
he came to the Center for Democracy in the USSR in Manhattan, which
Yarim-Agaev had founded in 1985. Later, Tolstich contributed
articles to various publications including Novoye Russkoye Slovo,
the major Russian language newspaper in New York, others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote a lot,'' Yarim-Agaev recalled. ``He was _ he is a
very cultivated and educated person, a person with humanitarian
inclinations.'' But adjustment to a foreign country was difficult
after years in a prison camp, he added. ``A person after that
hardly feels full of energy for new labors and new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dissidents had imagined that coming to America would feel
like coming home. Instead, they found what Catherine A.
Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International League for
Human Rights, calls ``a constant disconnect'' between their ideals
and reality. And when the Soviet Union collapsed into economic
chaos, gangsters and old KGB hands seemed to get rich and powerful
on U.S. aid, former dissidents said, while their kind slid into
impoverished irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Democracy was disbanded in 1991. For a few years,
Tolstich's acquaintances saw him at birthdays and funerals of their
old circle, but eventually lost track of him. By the mid-1990s, the
downward slope of his life steepened into a succession of unstable
living arrangements and short-lived jobs that he later listed for
his lawyer: mechanic's assistant, clerk, security guard.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, acquaintances said, Tolstich roomed in a squalid
ground floor apartment in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn with
Boris Khurgin, a newspaperman described by former colleagues as a
brilliant poet who drank himself to death at 48.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot summer night a week after Khurgin's death in 1995, a
colleague was sent to their apartment to look for poems to save.
What he found was a wake without end in two tiny, barely furnished
rooms where several men sat half-naked, sweating and drinking vodka
with ``terrible, bluish faces.'' One was Tolstich.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, Tolstich briefly entered the city's shelter
system for the first time, returning in late 1998, Department of
Homeless Shelter records show. But last year, when Fedorov
encountered him again, he was pulling his life together. He said he
had been living for months at the 30th Street shelter and attending
an alcohol treatment and counseling program for Russian immigrants
run by the Educational Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he quit the drinking and tried to find a job,''
Fedorov said. ``It was true. I asked him, `Why didn't you call me
when you had a problem with this?' But he said, `I was ashamed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov last saw him on Dec. 28, at a nursing home where they
visited another former political prisoner, who was dying of cancer
at 58. Friends say that they believe that Tolstich was shaken by
that man's death a few days later, and that it might have
contributed to his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, a few worn-looking men rested in the part
of Chelsea Park where the police had stopped Tolstich. There is a
small patch of asphalt surrounding a World War I memorial to ``the
soldiers and sailors of Chelsea.'' The site of the former
dissident's humiliation resonated with some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dissidents are like soldiers,'' Yarim-Agaev said. ``They're
veterans of the war for human rights. Even Nikolai, I would not
consider a failure _ he has already won his struggle. He deserved
to live decently the rest of his life for what he already
accomplished.''

ONCE A GANGLY KID, RODDICK IS A MUSCULAR PROSPECT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb.)  (jt) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla., _ As a Lilliputian youth tennis player, Andy
Roddick learned how to win matches by scrappiness and guile. Then
he began to grow _ a foot in two and a half years, to 6 feet 2
inches. Soon, with the help of a weight-lifting program, he was
blasting serves and forehands past opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he was a complete player, able to blend power with
textbook resilience and craftiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's been kind of a blessing that I was small my whole
life until recently,'' said Roddick, now 17 and on the threshold of
a pro career. ``I was a scrapper, pusher, everything. I'd do
anything to win a match. You learn that if your game is not on,
you've still got to find ways to pull out matches.''
</P>
<P>
   His rapid emergence in the tennis world has almost mirrored his
growth in stature. Ranked 27th nationally in the 16-and-under group
in 1997, he became No. 1 in '98. He felt ``gangly'' the next year
during his main growth spurt, but since then he has more than made
up for it. He now stands as the world's top-ranked junior _ the
first American to achieve that lofty status since Brian Dunn in '92
_ after a mercurial rise from No. 17 since December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fighter and he has a very big heart,'' said the
Frenchman Tarik Benhabiles, his coach since August. ``The tougher
it is out there, the more he likes it. He's not afraid to stay out
there three or four hours if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 ranking earned Roddick a wild-card berth in the main
draw of the prestigious two-week Ericsson Open _ formerly the
Lipton Championships _ and he came up with his first professional
victory by defeating Fernando Vicente, 6-4, 6-0, on Friday, earning
a match against Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't his professional debut. That came in late February at
the Citrix Championships in Delray Beach, Fla., where he lost to
Italy's Laurence Tieleman, 7-6 (8-6), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot,'' Roddick said after a practice at the
Ericsson tournament site. ``When you've got chances, you have to
take them. They're just not going to roll over and die for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Between these two tastes of the professional life, Roddick, a
native of Omaha, Neb., who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., won his last
four juniors tournaments _ the Eddie Herr International, RADO
Orange Bowl International, Australian Open Juniors and Banana Bowl
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Banana Bowl, a clay-court event in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that
attracted the world's top juniors, allowed Roddick to conquer an
unfamiliar surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted a situation that went against his nature,''
Benhabiles said. ``The balls were heavy and there were many bad
bounces because of the courts, but he adjusted. He showed that
mentally he is very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him, it's not like there is only one solution. He can
play different styles and on different surfaces. That's going to
make him a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the next breath, Benhabiles tempers his remarks by
calling the pro circuit a ``jungle, full of good players.'' He's
clearly hoping to make Roddick understand how much quality talent
he will face, without affecting his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Buchholz, tournament chairman of the Ericsson Open and the
only other American besides Roddick to win the Australian Open
Juniors in more than 40 years, saw Roddick lose his composure, then
regain it, in a three-set victory over Germany's Max Abel in the
Orange Bowl International.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at juniors, one of the things you ask yourself
is, `Does he have the guts?''' Buchholz said. ``You can have all
the shots, but if you don't have the mental capacity, you're just
another top junior who never made it on the pro tour. This kid has
the shots and the mental ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Roddick, who has grown an inch since December, is not as
belligerent on the court as, say, Jimmy Connors or John McEnroe.
But no one would call him shy about challenging calls that he feels
are questionable, a stark contrast to his demeanor off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will see me on the court and say, `I can't believe that
was you,''' he said. ``I just tell them: `On the court you have to
go for it. You've got to be mentally tough every second you're out
there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roddick began going with his parents to the tennis courts at age
4 and started taking private lessons at 6. At 8, according to his
mother, Blanche Roddick, he made an unusual tournament debut: after
pleading with her for a year to play, he teamed with a 70-year-old
woman to finish second in doubles in their category at a country
club event in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all he's done, he still has fond memories of doing
that,'' his mother said, chuckling softly. But mostly young Roddick
drew inspiration from his brother John, who is six years older and
who was then on his way toward becoming a standout at the
University of Georgia. Only last year, Andy beat his brother, who
is now an assistant coach at Florida State University, for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to just follow John to the tennis courts,'' said Jerry
Roddick, their father. ``It was easy for him to pick up a racket
and just start playing.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Andy, who is several months from graduating from the
Boca Raton Preparatory School, often practices on the court in his
parents' back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always played tennis because I enjoy it,'' Roddick said.
``It used to be more of a fun thing with me. But then I really
started to improve. I decided to go for it.'' &QL;

METS AND CUBS ARE GRATEFUL MCGWIRE SAID NO TO TOKYO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Fresh off their planes Saturday, the Mets and the Cubs
showed strong support for their long haul across the Pacific to
open their regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Players and officials from both teams were asked to respond to
recent remarks by Mark McGwire that the historic trip was based on
``greed'' by baseball. McGwire, who holds the record for most home
runs in a season, 70 in 1998, vetoed the Cardinals' participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Mark McGwire, and I also want to
thank him for saying no because I got to go,'' said Mark Grace, the
first baseman for the Cubs, the team that replaced the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will work out Sunday, play exhibitions against the
Seibu Lions and Yomiuri Giants, powerful Tokyo-area teams, Monday
and Tuesday, and then play each other Wednesday and Thursday. They
expressed enthusiasm, well aware of McGwire's strong comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get that stuff about greed,'' said Bobby Valentine,
the Mets' manager. ``That's a very limited thought. This is much
bigger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had said marketing and merchandising and payments from
Japanese sponsors had spurred the trip. Commissioner Bud Selig
disagreed, saying: ``If this were done for the money, it wouldn't
be worth it. When you see the passion and excitement for baseball
over here, you realize our responsibility goes beyond the United
States and Canada. I believe in social responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said this competition between the American and Japanese
teams, before the start of their seasons, was a step toward a World
Cup-style tournament. He noted that ``nearly one fourth of all
major-league players come from outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had said international competition did not ``turn my
crank,'' but the players at a press conference Saturday seemed
excited. Some other players resent the trip. Rickey Henderson, whom
the Mets may be trying to trade, spoke out against the trip weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The players speaking at the upscale New Otani Hotel were clearly
going along with the program, including Mike Piazza, John Franco,
Robin Ventura and Mike Hampton of the Mets and Grace, Sosa and Jon
Lieber of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third time here, and I am glad to be back,'' said
Sammy Sosa, who chased McGwire in epic home-run duels the past two
seasons. ``The people in Japan have a lot of class. I'm glad to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came over here in 1992 and had a great time,'' Grace said.
``I hit against Hideki Nomo when he pitched for Kintetsu, and I
realize a lot of Japanese and Korean players are talented enough to
play in the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace, who has volunteered to visit an American military base
Sunday, interrupted his remarks to introduce a familiar face
sitting in the front row of the press conference _ Ernie Banks,
long known as Mister Cub, who had flown here to sing ``Take Me Out
to the Ball Game'' during Wednesday's seventh-inning stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out, you'd think trips to Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh were different,'' Banks said in a private conversation.
``This is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks was seeking out Japanese journalists to get a translation
of his famous slogan ``Let's play two,'' which he had uttered every
day, except when the Cubs were indeed playing a doubleheader, at
which point he lobbied for three games.
</P>
<P>
   Several Japanese-speaking journalists said Mister Cub could be
comfortable saying, ``Ni shiai, yarou'' _ or, very loosely, ``Two
games, let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   On this evening in Tokyo, the Mets and Cubs seemed in agreement.
Mark McGwire was not here, and they were. There are two exhibitions
against Japanese teams looking to prove something. And there are
two National League games that will count, forever. Mister Cub
could have represented this group if he had said, ``Let's play
four.''

SURVEY ON GAYS RINGS TRUE TO MANY IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)  (jw) 
 By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Although senior Pentagon officials in
Washington expressed surprise at an inspector general's survey that
found widespread harassment of gays in the armed forces, halfway
across the country the results were viewed Saturday as nothing new
by some current and former servicemen living near this city's many
military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the 71,570 military personnel surveyed in the
Pentagon's report, which was released on Friday, said they had
heard derogatory remarks made about gays and 37 percent said they
had witnessed or experienced an incident of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it `barracks justice,''' said Dennis Dunn, 40, who
retired as a staff sergeant from the Army last fall after 19 years
of service. ``If people found out somebody was gay, they were gone.
If they weren't kicked out for just being gay, then some other
reason would be found to get rid of them. Either way, they were
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Dunn said, the penalty for being identified as
homosexual took an uglier turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone was gay and got left in the unit for a while, there
would be a `blanket party,' '' he said, ``where they'd grab the guy
during the middle of the night, wrap him in a blanket, and pound on
him with socks stuffed with bars of soap.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said there were rules associated with such attacks,
established by platoon or unit leaders who organized them, such as
no hitting in the head, face, or groin. ``But that was mostly so
there wouldn't be any evidence that could be reported,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he joined the service in 1980 until he retired
with a medical discharge, Dunn said, he heard of dozens of such
`blanket parties,' although he would not say whether he had
participated in them.
</P>
<P>
   And, Dunn said, little changed after the Clinton administration
started its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all just a show for the media,'' he said of the
policy. ``It didn't change anything. It just made the unit
commanders more cautious about how they kicked people out.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of those interviewed on Friday about the Pentagon
report said they thought that attitudes had changed over the years,
not so much because of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, but
because of a broader acceptance of gays in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton just opened up the closet door and let all
the skeletons out,'' said Carlos B. Palos III, 44, who served in
the Army from 1975 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed while having dinner with his son, Carlos Jr., who
recently enlisted in the Air Force, Palos said that during his
military career, homosexuality was rarely discussed but was
punished whenever discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two guys caught in my unit in Germany in 1977 that were
court-martialed and dishonorably discharged, but it was all kept
pretty quiet. These days, they put it on the front page of the
newspaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palos' 19-year old son said that during his brief four months at
an air base near Del Rio, Texas, he had seen no signs of
discrimination. ``Sure, you know some people are probably gay, but
that's their business as long as they leave you alone. The younger
guys just don't care that much about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's military it's just not that big of a deal. People
are just more used to the idea of gays in the service,'' said Allen
Decker, 24, an information specialist who served on six different
posts before arriving at the air station here.
</P>
<P>
   But, still, Decker said, if someone were openly gay, ``The
commanding officer will always just get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy specialist on leave from a 7th Fleet assignment in Japan,
who spoke on the condition of not being identified, said that while
his superiors would tolerate no discrimination or harassment by
fellow servicemen, anyone who was openly gay disappeared from the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the first line of defense, the tip of the spear, and
discipline out there is pretty tight,'' said the 24-year-old Navy
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   To Dunn, the inspector general's report offered only
confirmation of what most people in the service, he says, already
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do these things to placate the media and the
higher-ups, the politicians,'' he said, ''But nothing will change.
It's the Army. Nothing ever changes the Army.''

 &HT;    New game plan for gambling addicts
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. _ When it comes to gambling, most people can
walk away at any time. Win or lose, it's just another form of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But there are those who can't heed the call to fold 'em up. They
are hooked, like an alcoholic or a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone at Shreveport's Center of Recovery, known as CORE,
gambling is a pathological addiction that requires acute treatment.
Before coming here for a 30-day stay, one north Louisiana man was
so distraught by his compulsion to go to casinos that he played
Russian roulette with a loaded gun. A Franklin, La., man had tried
one last time to pretend to his wife that he'd lost his money in a
robbery. An Abbeville, La., mother of three had cashed $1,500 in
bad checks and lost it in a video poker machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here in all states of disarray,'' said Reece
Middleton, executive director of CORE.
</P>
<P>
   CORE, which opened last summer, is one of the few inpatient
facilities in the nation specifically designed to treat gambling
addiction. And it is the only one that is state funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an amazing step _ the Louisiana folks have recognized
that there is real need for a broad spectrum of services for
gambling addicts,'' said Keith Whyte, executive director of the
National Council on Problem Gambling. ``Most states that have
legalized gambling only fund a help line.''
</P>
<P>
   There are between 57,000 and 100,000 so-called pathological
gamblers in Louisiana, according to a study by the University of
New Orleans. That's about 2 percent to 3 percent of the population,
higher than the national average of 1 percent to 2 percent. Among
Southern states that have conducted similar studies, Louisiana and
Mississippi, which both have riverboat casinos, have higher rates
of gambling addicts than Georgia or Texas, which have no casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state made a decision to have a lottery and other forms
of gambling, and I think it's to the state's credit that the
legislature recognized there would be an increase of people with a
problem,'' said Alton Hadley, who heads the state's Office for
Addictive Disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana spends $1.5 million annually in prevention and
treatment of problem gambling. It funds a 24-hour hotline and
outpatient treatment programs in 10 regions around the state.
Almost a third of that goes to CORE, which has 18 beds that are
free for Louisiana residents. The money for the center comes from
taxes on riverboats, the lottery and video poker machines. The
state receives $580 million annually in taxes from gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling foe C.B. Forgotston objects to public dollars being
spent to treat a problem introduced by the state when gambling was
legalized a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that did not exist, and now it's a burden on
taxpayers,'' he said. ``When people decide to gamble, they should
be responsible for the damage they do. Now, the taxpayer _ me _ is
asked to pick up the pieces. They should require the casinos to pay
for this, over and above the taxes they pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the funding comes at a time of budget cuts within the
Department of Health and Hospitals, the umbrella agency for the
Office for Addictive Disorders. Hadley's budget was cut by $1
million, forcing him to cancel plans for a new methadone clinic for
heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte said gambling addiction is undertreated nationwide and
exists even in the three states that have no form of legalized
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   This center is cheaper than not treating these people,'' he
said. ``It's cheaper than having them bottom out, go on welfare or
become homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents of CORE see the program, which uses the 12-step
method developed by Gamblers Anonymous, as a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think you should be able to stop on your own,'' said a
53-year-old woman from Breaux Bridge, La., who requested anonymity.
She started gambling in casinos in 1994 and would lose hundreds or
even thousands in a night. She would hide the mounting debt from
her husband, stalking the mailman so she could get the credit card
bills. ``People say, 'Why don't you just stop?' I hate that.
Wouldn't I stop if I could? This is a godsend. It really is.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Sig Rogich has such a reputation for buffing _ in
some cases salvaging _ the images of big-name Republicans that
former President Bush summoned him from a post as ambassador to
Iceland to try to rescue his re-election drive in 1992. Four years
earlier, Rogich had conceived the legendary Bush commercial that
featured a helmeted Michael Dukakis riding in a tank.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogich's prowess at crisis management is celebrated far
beyond the political world. Three years ago, Mike Tyson, the former
heavyweight champion, turned to him for public relations tutelage
after Tyson gnawed on Evander Holyfield's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hired me after he bit the guy,'' Rogich recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the chatter among Gov. George W. Bush's advisers is that
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee might turn to
Rogich, an advertising and public relations executive, for a
political reconditioning job. Even in victory, the Texas governor
is trying to add gloss to his image after his battering in the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday in his Las Vegas office, with a
panoramic view of the hotels and casinos where he has been a
fixture for years, Rogich (pronounced ROGUE-ish) heaped praise on
Bush. He said the White House was the governor's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this master at stage managing politicians was not timid
about reviewing discouraging episodes in the Bush campaign that had
weakened the governor's public persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``In campaigns it's the little things that you've got to pay
attention to if you're going to be successful,'' said Rogich, who
counts the singer Wayne Newton as among his close friends and has
served as state boxing commissioner and once owned a slot machine
company. ``Churchill said, `Little things bring empires down.' I've
always believed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich prefaced his comments about the Bush operation by saying
repeatedly that he did not want to ``second guess'' the team in
Austin. Still, he suggested that had he been managing Bush's public
presentation, as he did with the elder Bush in the White House,
there would have been fewer lapses, and perhaps a crisper message.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly distressed by the Bush campaign's decision
early this month to allow the candidate to appear before millions
on David Letterman's show on a satellite hookup from St. Louis.
Bush drew devastating reviews for cracking second-rate jokes,
grinning nervously and looking downright mirthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never let the president go on a satellite,'' Rogich
said. ``It doesn't make sense. First of all, the audience is
clapping when you're standing so you don't respond to it because
you're delayed. When he's laughing because he has said something
funny, the audience is finished with the laugh. It's not smart. You
need to get on there in person, be part of the show, stand up and
do a high-five if that's what it calls for _ and sit down. You
never do the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Rogich is not tapped for a formal role, he already
carries significant influence with the Bush family: He checks in
with former President Bush every week or so. He said he got to know
Gov. Bush ``quite well'' during the 1988 campaign. And he does not
hesitate to dispense tips to the candidate directly or in e-mail
notes to the chief strategist, Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Rogich would not reveal what those pointers are. But he said the
Bush campaign needed to be more aggressive at defining the governor
_ and highlighting his most captivating qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George Bush that I knew was a fun guy to be around,'' he
said. ``He's got a nice sense of humor, a nice way about him and a
deep compassion. Now, they need to get on message. They need to
talk about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich made clear that he did not have much use for Bush's
``Reformer with Results'' slogan, which the campaign unveiled in
the wake of Sen. John McCain's upset in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably appropriate at the time,'' he said. ``I'm not
sure it stays in play.'' Picking his words carefully so not to
sound too dismissive, he said, ``Some of the themes we've done in
the past have a little more poetic side to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamenting the absence of the rallying cry of ``compassionate
conservatism'' that for so many months had been the Bush campaign's
signature, Rogich said: ``That's a terrific slogan. The word
compassion is something that is important in people's lives. You
could almost drop `conservative.' That's how good the word is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich also confessed that he was bewildered by Bush's failure
to be more magnanimous to McCain and his followers in a recent
interview with The New York Times in which the governor allowed
that he had learned no lessons from his vanquished rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to naturally reach out to bring your enemies, or
opponents, into the fold,'' he said. ``The smart candidates reach
out a little more. It's all about winning: At the end of the day,
there's a column that says, `Won' or `Lost.' I just would have
liked to have seen a little more harmony at the end of it. But
you've got to remember that McCain didn't reach out, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its imperfections, Rogich, who is 55, said the Bush
campaign should hardly feel desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a second expansive wave of talent that comes in
to take part,'' he said. ``So I think those problems take care of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was critical that the campaign broaden its inner
circle, explaining: ``This is not a training ground. This is the
big leagues. They've got six months now to put this package
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Might his services be part of that second wave? ``It's not
really something I'm thinking of doing,'' he said. ``But I'm going
to be there to help them in any way I can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Told that his name seems to keep resurfacing among Bush
advisers, he said: ``I'm flattered. But they've done pretty well
without Sig.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rogich, hardly out of the picture, is keeping an especially
close eye on Vice President Al Gore. While Gore has provided ample
grist for damaging commercials from the Bush camp, he said there
was nothing as potent as Dukakis in a tank, an advertisement that
ridiculed the former Massachusetts governor and, many believe,
contributed to his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that they've made gaffes that I've seen per
se,'' Rogich said of the Gore camp. He said of Gore: ``I think he's
articulate. He's very smart. He's sincere. He's a little over the
top on certain issues but he comes at them from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich said that unlike Bush, the vice president ``comes across
too cold and is tough to warm up to.'' Rogich does give Gore credit
for shedding his blue suits for casual apparel and favoring earth
tones. ``Changing the dress a little bit was a smart thing to do,''
he said. ``It just lightened him up.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the time President Bush was wearing an unsuitable
tie when he was about to address the House about the Persian Gulf
War: ``I said, `Take my tie!'''
</P>
<P>
   That blue tie is now framed at the entrance to Rogich's office.
There is also a note from President Bush about the tie: ``It just
sent the right message to Saddam Hussein. Thanks, Sig.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about doing something about the attire of the younger
Bush, who favors off-the-rack suits? ``Everybody keeps asking me
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the governor is really a product of the East Coast,
Rogich, who favors Italian suits and Hermes ties, added, ``Most
Eastern people do need a little help.''

   NEW YORK _ On a day of solemnity and outrage that degenerated
into violence, Patrick Dorismond, the unarmed son of Haitian
immigrants who was shot to death in a confrontation with the police
last week, was carried across Brooklyn, eulogized as a martyr and
laid to rest Saturday by 15,000 anguished mourners and angry
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the funeral, there were brief clashes between
protesters and police. At least four officers were injured and two
people were arrested. Witnesses described scenes of tense
confrontation and tumult: bottles smashing on the street, American
flags burned and a rain of curses falling on police and an absent
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   As a hearse carrying the body of the slain 26-year-old security
guard led a procession of cars and a predominantly Haitian crowd of
3,000 marchers on a three-mile procession from a funeral home in
Marine Park to a church in Flatbush, the sobs of grief mingled with
screams of hostility against the police and shrieked demands for
justice and the resignation of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But the noisy procession up Flatbush Avenue was nonviolent until
it neared Holy Cross Church on Church Avenue, where the funeral was
to be held, shortly before noon. Thousands more people stood on
sidewalks, penned behind metal police barricades. Then, it
appeared, the pent-up feelings of the day, and of more than a week
of anger over the shooting and the characterization of the victim
by the mayor, came surging out.
</P>
<P>
   Police barricades were shoved down all along the block. At least
two officers fell under the metal stanchions and were injured, one
with a broken nose, the other with a broken leg. The crowds surged
into the avenue. A thin line of police officers, clearly panicked,
retreated toward the church, where reinforcements were posted on a
side street, Veronica Place.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd took over the avenue outside the church and a tense
standoff with the police began, the hearse drew up and pallbearers
carried the polished wooden coffin of Dorismond inside. For the
next hour, as anger seethed outside, the interior of the church was
an island of grief as Monsignor Rollin J. Darbouze, the pastor,
eulogized the slain man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Patrick Dorismond were to address young people today,'' he
declared, ``he would say, `Because you are young and because you
are black, avoid being on street corners too long because you could
be confused for drug dealers and be killed. Spare your own life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, the son of one of Haiti's best known singers, Andre
Dorismond, was shot to death outside a bar on the West Side of
Manhattan on March 16 in a struggle with an undercover police
officer. He was the fourth unarmed black man to be killed by police
in the last 13 months _ a series of deaths that has raised
questions about the aggressiveness of the police.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor came under fire from critics for releasing information
about Dorismond's police record, including sealed juvenile records,
for not visiting or even expressing regrets to Dorismond's family
and for defending the police actions in the case, as he had in
previous shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He was not at the funeral. ``In situations where the person
involved may have been involved in a crime, the mayor does not
attend the funeral,'' the mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the funeral were a number of Democratic state
legislators, City Council members and other politicians, including
the City Comptroller Alan Hevesi. All of them harshly critical of
the mayor, who was not present. Others who attended were relatives
of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant sodomized by police officers
in a Brooklyn police station in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Standing above a coffin draped in Haitian and American flags,
Darbouze said: ``Let us pray that Patrick's death and the suffering
of his family will not be in vain. May they find solace and
consolation and may they see steps taken so that Patrick will be a
lesson for all of us to work together for a better quality of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hourlong funeral, the crowd outside was hostile
but relatively peaceful, confining its anger to shouts of derision
against the mayor and police, who had mustered reinforcements and
now numbered about 300 officers in helmets and other riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   But as the funeral ended and the hearse and its procession
pulled away, scuffling broke out between protesters and police.
People on fire escapes and near windows along Church Avenue waved
Haitian and Jamaican flags, and some of them began hurling bottles
down on the street, some of them missing officers by inches.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in front of the church screamed ``No way! No way!''
Several American flags were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the crowds surged again, more bottles were thrown and
there were reports of more police officers down and injured.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events had begun at midmorning at the Andrew
Torregrossa and Sons Funeral Home in Marine Park, where a wake for
Dorismond had been held Friday night. Dorismond's mother, Marie,
wept uncontrollably as she was escorted to a limousine and her
son's coffin, draped in flags, was brought out to a hearse.

JERUSALEM'S TOP MUSLIM CLERIC SAYS ISRAEL EXPLOITS HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The mufti of Jerusalem, who is scheduled to meet
with Pope John Paul II on Sunday, said Saturday that he was fed up
with ``the way Israel uses the Holocaust to win sympathy'' and to
avoid international censure for its behavior toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the chief Islamic cleric of the city who was
appointed in 1994 by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, minced
no words in an interview. All week, with the international media in
town, he has availed himself quite stridently of the public stage
that he has been granted by being on the pope's interfaith
itinerary. He has made no attempt to temper his strong views.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri said Saturday that he believed that the number of 6
million Holocaust victims is exaggerated. He said Israel
demonstrated this week, when it ``took even the pope'' to the Yad
Vashem Holocaust memorial, that ``it considers its pain more
important than anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many massacres in the world,'' said Sabri, 56.
``Why is this Holocaust in particular more important?'' he asked.
``When it comes to our cause, nobody pays attention _ whether it is
the Crusader massacres against Muslims or the massacres against
Palestinians committed by Israelis. And we don't keep using and
using these massacres to remind the world what we are owed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never deny that the Holocaust happened, but we believe the
number of 6 million is exaggerated,'' he continued. ``The Jews are
using this issue, in many ways, also to blackmail the Germans
financially. The Holocaust is the reason that there isn't a bigger
noise against Israel as an occupying force. The Holocaust is
protecting Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The words clashed starkly with the pope's message of
reconciliation, and particularly his conclusive embrace this week
of the enormity of the Holocaust. This embrace included an emphatic
rejection of denial or minimization of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But the mufti, unlike the Palestinian political leaders, has not
acceded to the pope's agenda here, which includes interfaith
healing. He refused to attend the pope's interfaith gathering
Thursday, where there were verbal clashes over the status of
Jerusalem between Israel's chief rabbis and the lower-level Muslim
cleric who was assigned by Arafat to go in the sheik's place.
</P>
<P>
   This puts the pope in a very awkward situation. While he has
successfully remained above the fray so far, it might be difficult
if the mufti makes such remarks in his presence Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesmen said Saturday, after similar comments were
published in La Repubblica in Italy, that the pope's schedule would
not change, but that they might add a briefing after the morning
meeting. ``It's certainly not our fault if Hitler hated the Jews,''
the mufti was quoted as saying in the Italian newspaper. ``Weren't
they hated pretty much everywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   Sabri also said he believed that Israel was creating a tense
atmosphere in the Old City in advance of Sunday's meeting with the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With stringent security measures, including ordering Palestinian
shops in the area closed, the Israeli police could be provoking
violence, he said. He said he would not be surprised if youths
resorted to stone-throwing ``because they are being provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his message to the pope would be, ``You are a man of
peace, and in order for this city to enjoy peace, the occupation
should end and you should stand with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The visit of the pope opens the door for the whole
world to pay attention to what's going on in the Holy Land, the
reality on the ground. This week the Israeli media cannot
monopolize the flow of information. The whole world is here to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, director of the Anti-Defamation League here,
said Israel would look to Arafat to distance himself from the
mufti's remarks. ``It's very sad that the highest Muslim official
in Jerusalem sullies the name of Islam,'' he said.

MEDICARE FAULTED IN FORGIVING HUGE DEBTS

 (ATTN: Maine, Calif.)   (Exclusive)

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration improperly forgave
hundreds of millions of dollars of debts owed to the government by
health-care providers for Medicare overpayments and allowed them to
continue billing Medicare for some of the questionable expenses,
federal investigators have found.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, from the General Accounting Office, said
Medicare officials had ignored their own rules and procedures in
negotiating secret deals to settle the debts _ the three largest
Medicare overpayment cases of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the deals involved health-care organizations in New York,
and the other was with the county health department in Los Angeles.
Medicare said it had overpaid the providers by $332 million. It
settled the cases for a total of $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had agreed to the
settlements as a way to help hospitals that serve large numbers of
poor people. In each case, the government and the health-care
provider agreed that the settlement would be kept secret. The
government said it wanted to avoid setting precedents that could be
invoked by Medicare providers in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements will be the subject of a hearing on Tuesday
before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed
by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. received the
largest financial benefits in the deals. The corporation runs
public hospitals and clinics that treat 1.5 million New Yorkers a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their size and significance, investigators said, the
settlements were not reviewed or approved by any lawyer in the
federal government. Medicare rules require such reviews, the
accounting office said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report describing the deals, the General Accounting Office
said Medicare officials ``knew that the settlements were not in the
best interest of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials accepted payments of $25 million of the $155
million owed by the Health and Hospitals Corp.; $67 million of the
$98 million owed by the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, and $28
million of the $79.4 million owed by the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government settled these cases for 36 cents on the
dollar even though it could have collected much more, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spends over $200 billion a year to provide health care
to people who are elderly or disabled. Health-care providers have
many disputes with the government over Medicare payments, and they
often negotiate settlements or take their claims to an
administrative tribunal at the Department of Health and Human
Services. But these three cases were far bigger than any others,
and the settlement agreements were the only ones not shown to
health department lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A Medicare official who worked on the cases said he feared that
the ``deals would go up in smoke'' if he sought approval from
lawyers at the Justice Department or the Department of Health and
Human Services, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said the health-care providers had
used their ``political influence'' to short-circuit the normal
procedures for resolving disputes over Medicare reimbursement. It
said that top Medicare officials, including Bruce C. Vladeck, who
was head of the Health Care Financing Administration from 1993 to
1997, put pressure on subordinates to settle politically sensitive
cases after being contacted directly by health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office did not accuse the providers of
wrongdoing. It did criticize Medicare officials, saying they had
``acted improperly'' in accepting the settlements without proper
scrutiny. Federal officials generally need Justice Department
approval to settle or compromise any claim exceeding $100,000, the
GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Collins said: ``Lower-level Medicare
employees tried to sound the alarm. They protested the special
treatment given to these three providers. But their concerns were
ignored or suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of Health and Hospitals Corp.,
denied that it had received special treatment. He said the New York
hospitals were entitled to a much more generous settlement than
they received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this a sweetheart deal by any stretch of the
imagination,'' Marcos said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Anello, a lawyer for Vladeck, also defended the
settlements, saying that Vladeck had tried to make Medicare more
responsive to health-care providers and beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prompt resolution of these disputes ensured continued
health care for millions of poor people,'' Anello said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said: ``There was nothing wrong with the
settlements on the merits. There was something wrong with the
process _ how the settlements were reached.''
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office said the settlements were
``apparently unjustified'' and would not have been approved if
Medicare officials had followed the statutory criteria for
compromising government claims.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the accounting office said, the agreements should
have been reviewed by government lawyers, because Medicare
officials were ``relinquishing the government's right to recover
tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlements not only wiped out the health-care providers'
debts to the government but allowed them to be paid in the future
for some costs that would not otherwise be covered by Medicare, the
accounting office said. The disputed hospital charges included
bills left unpaid by patients.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare discovered the disputed charges in audits that covered
several years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Charles Booth, director of financial services for Medicare, who
has worked for the program since it started in 1966, told
investigators that the agreement with Health and Hospitals Corp.
``allowed past poor practices to be carried into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Booth told investigators that Vladeck, a former member of the
board of Health and Hospitals Corp., had urged him to ``move
faster'' in arranging a settlement. Booth said he replied that
speeding up the settlement process could cost the government $8
million to $10 million, but he said Vladeck told him that ``time
was more important than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Booth said, he did not consult any lawyers, because
they would have delayed the settlement, and such delays would have
displeased administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ohl, a federal Medicare official in California, expressed
``major concerns'' about the settlement with Los Angeles County,
saying it appeared to be ``a political action'' to circumvent
Medicare requirements. In an e-mail message to Medicare officials
in Washington, Ohl said, ``We believe this agreement is not in
Medicare's best interest,'' because it does not protect the
Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Visiting Nurse Service had, on the average,
billed Medicare for three times as much as the government allowed
for home-health-aide visits, and it justified such claims by saying
that patients tended to be sicker there. But federal investigators
said the nurse service never provided evidence or data to support
that contention.
</P>
<P>
   In carrying out its review, the General Accounting Office
examined 96 settlement agreements that Medicare officials
negotiated with health-care providers over the last decade. In each
case, Medicare asserted that the providers had been overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   In 93 of the cases, the General Accounting Office found nothing
illegal or improper. But it said the Health Care Financing
Administration had acted improperly in the three largest cases,
which accounted for two-thirds of the money at issue.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, said the agency had formed a ``work group'' to
analyze its debt-collection procedures.

PAKISTANI RULER INSISTS HIS MEETING WITH CLINTON WENT WELL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, on Saturday night recapped his meeting earlier in the
day with President Clinton, and to hear him tell it, he and the
U.S. president became fast friends and agreed on almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got on pretty well together,'' the general said
with a broad smile, adding that the two leaders discussed their
golf game over an amiable lunch. ``He told me he is a 12 handicap,
and I told him that I would like to challenge him on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mutual affection for golf was equaled by their shared
detestation of terrorism. ``I would say there was no difference of
opinion on this issue,'' Musharraf said at a news conference. ``He
did raise concerns, and I totally agreed with him. We ourselves are
victims of terrorism, and we denounce terrorism in all its forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are those in the U.S. government who believe
that Pakistan arms and commands militants who cross into
Indian-controlled Kashmir and throw bombs and conduct
assassinations. India, too, has made the charge. India and Pakistan
have been fighting over Kashmir since 1947, when both nations were
carved from the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   The general was asked what assurances he had given Clinton that
such infiltration would stop. ``There were no assurances because
there was no question,'' he said. ``We are not involved in sending
any kind of people across the Line of Control,'' which has been a
de facto border between the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir
for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all a people's dynamic,'' Musharraf said of the
guerrilla campaign in Kashmir. ``It is not government sponsored.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the Line of Control is a long, mountainous
stretch, and if India, with 700,000 troops stationed in the area,
cannot stop the guerrillas from entering Kashmir, what could
Pakistan do?
</P>
<P>
   He did allow, however, that there might be some terrorists
operating out of Afghanistan, Pakistan's ally and neighbor
next-door _ and said that he had promised Clinton that he would
personally look into the matter. ``I would certainly like to
address this to the satisfaction of the world community,'' the
general said helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than five months since Musharraf took power in
a bloodless coup. He has given himself the title of chief
executive. Saturday, dressed in a long white coat called a
sherwani, he seemed quite at ease.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, Clinton had given a televised speech to the
nation, adamantly refusing to serve as a mediator in the Kashmir
dispute, something Pakistan wants and India disdains. The general
sounded unperturbed, as if confronted by a minor technicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indians are quite allergic to the word mediation, so the word
mediation should be avoided,'' he said. ``But a facilitation of a
dialogue between India and Pakistan is possible. Certainly, the
United States has a role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, the general said, given the stakes with India and
Pakistan both possessing nuclear weapons, he would give
``unconditional acceptance of a dialogue at any time, in any place,
at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   A questioner suggested that the general could always pick up the
phone and call India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, but
this sounded to the chief executive like ``an impulsive action''
and not the anywhere, anytime he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could ring me up and I would certainly respond,'' the
general said by way of a counterproposal. ``I don't know if he
would respond if I rang him up.''

WORLD WAR II MUSEUM TO OPEN IN JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Miss., Ind.)  (rk) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dwight D. Eisenhower once told Stephen Ambrose, the
military historian, that the man who won World War II never fired a
shot, planned an attack or sewed up a wound. He built boats, and
one of them was a revolutionary design that made possible
amphibious landings like the one at Normandy on June 6, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Without boats built by that man, Andrew Higgins, ``the whole
strategy of the war would have been different,'' said Eisenhower,
who commanded the invasion of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ambrose decided to create a World War II museum, he put
it in Higgins' hometown, New Orleans. The historian lives nearby in
Bay St. Louis, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the museum's prominent displays will be a replica of
a Higgins boat: shallow and flat-bottomed with a protected
propeller and shaft. Higgins Industries sold the boat before the
war for use in the swamps and marshes of Louisiana, where Higgins
would impress customers by running the boat onto the seawall of
Lake Pontchartrain. The military version could land 36 men, or 12
men and a jeep, and extract itself from the beach for another
shuttle run.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, the anniversary of the Normandy invasion, the
National D-Day Museum will open, telling the story of the war with
special attention to the major amphibious assaults undertaken by
Americans in the war, including Pacific engagements like Iwo Jima,
Guadalcanal and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using the Higgins boat as a symbol for the enormous
effort that our people made during the war, building landing craft,
rifles, aircraft, bombs,'' Ambrose said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is opening as World War II is drawing a good deal of
attention in the United States, through movies and best-selling
books.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials say they expect the opening to draw the largest
gathering of World War II veterans on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to bring the whole story to life with personal
accounts,'' said Nick Mueller, the chairman of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   To help achieve that, nine oral history booths will be spread
throughout the museum. Visitors will be able to stop and hear
recordings of people involved in the war describe what they
experienced, both on the battlefield and at home.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts will be taken from the more than 1,400 oral
histories that Ambrose took while researching his book ``D-Day''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1994). The Eisenhower Center, which is a branch
of the University of New Orleans and the research arm of the
museum, is complementing those histories with the testimonies of
veterans from the war in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Artifacts will combine with the oral history booths to help
connect the visitors with those who participated in the war.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Mueller described the story of Leo Scheer, a
medic from Indiana, and the web belt that carried his medical
supplies. After coming ashore at Normandy, Scheer discovered that
all of his supplies had been ruined by sea water. So he searched
through the bodies of his dead comrades for their first-aid
pouches, and stuffed them into his belt. The belt, with six pouches
hanging from it, will be on display at the museum. The museum has
received support from the state and federal governments, with
Louisiana contributing $6.7 million and the federal government $6
million. Private donations are still being raised to pay for the
rest of the $25 million cost of construction.

 &HT;    Army testing `computerized' soldiers
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At military exercises this summer in Louisiana, troops
will find themselves engaged in fake battle against a rifle platoon
of ``cyborgs'' from the 82nd Airborne Division, headquartered at
Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Through eyepieces mounted on their helmets, the 'borgs will be
able to view the battlefield through telescopic vision, infrared
vision or nighttime vision. Eyepieces connected by cable to a video
camera mounted on their M-16 rifles will allow them to accurately
aim and fire their weapons around the corner of a building.
</P>
<P>
   If they spot a tank or other target out of their range, they'll
be able to tag it with a laser beam that pinpoints the target's
exact coordinates. The cyborg's ``on-board computer'' will then
ship those coordinates back to headquarters, which will order up an
artillery or air strike on the target.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also be able to view computerized maps of the
battlefield through their eyepiece, with their own positions and
the positions of their fellow cyborgs already plotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them shooting their buddies,'' explains Mike
Tryon, deputy manager for the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine
Command, which is helping to develop the Land Warrior wearable
computing system. Friendly fire accounted for almost a quarter of
the U.S. servicemen killed in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to speech recognition software, platoon members will
be able to perform those chores by voice command alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fighting system, so I want my soldier to keep his
hands on his weapon while he's performing all these other
functions,'' says Tryon, a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Like many complicated defense programs, the Land Warrior system
has a troubled history. Originally conceived in 1996, it was
supposed to be fully deployed by 2000, with as many as 34,000 units
put in the field. Instead it's still in the early phases of
testing, with 2004 as the earliest possible deployment date. In
December, a report to Congress by the General Accounting Office
outlined problems in the program, the most serious involving
weight.
</P>
<P>
   That's always been a touchy issue. Tryon declined to discuss the
system's total weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would give the wrong impression that we were really
burdening these guys down,'' he says. ``The truth is, in some cases
we're actually lightening the soldier's load over what it would be
if they had these functions individually, with a radio and other
equipment. For example, we've taken about 2.5 pounds off the squad
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was more candid, putting the weight of the Land
Warrior system at a prohibitive 90 pounds, which includes body
armor and two radio systems. However, the GAO also noted that after
its report was drafted, the Army had begun to redesign the system.
A total weight for the new version could not be obtained. The GAO
also criticized the life span of batteries used in the system, but
again it noted significant progress was being made in overcoming
that obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tryon, the United States is far from alone in
developing such systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next summer we'll have the British, the Germans and us all
demonstrating our systems to NATO,'' he says. ``The Australians are
building a system, too, and the Canadians are sitting back, waiting
to see what kind of technology the rest of us go with.''
</P>
<P>
   After the summer war exercises in Louisiana, the platoon of 82nd
Airborne ``cyborgs'' will train with the Land Warrior system for a
year to test its survivability and functionality.
</P>
<P>
   Later versions of the system may incorporate technologies that
are still under development, such as a type of handheld radar
system that would allow troops to detect objects such as tanks or
even human beings on the other side of a solid wall. Even more in
the future, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, is funding research into what it calls ``Exoskeletons for
Human Augmentation,'' basically a high-tech form of computerized
armor that will boost a soldier's physical capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanically augmenting the speed, strength and endurance of
the ground soldier will lead to enhanced survivability and new
mission capabilities,'' DARPA documents claim.

 &HT;    Being Steve Mann: Cyberwear pioneer alters his reality
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Steve Mann can sound strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years, I had 30,000 people inside my head, watching
what I did every day, altering my reality, offering suggestions on
what I should do next,'' recalls the University of Toronto
professor. ``I finally had to shut it down, though. My head space
got a little too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Mann's not crazy. From 1994 to 1996, while a grad student at
MIT in Boston, he streamed live video directly onto the Internet
from a device that was mounted on his head. Everything Mann saw and
heard during his day, visitors on his Web site could see and hear
as well. The experiment allowed Net users to literally view the
world as Mann experienced it. From their computers, they could also
communicate directly with Mann, which gave him a rather odd
ability. As he went about life, he could benefit from the combined
brainpower and experience of those looking over his shoulder via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could recognize people I had never met, recognize buildings
I'd never seen,'' says Mann, now 38. ``If I was in a store,
somebody (on the Internet) might tell me, `Hey, I went to high
school with that clerk right there,' and then tell me her name.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann began building his own wearable systems as a high school
student in the late '70s, and he has continued that work at MIT and
now at Toronto. At MIT, Mann worked with a fellow grad student,
Thad Starner, who's now running a wearable computing project at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The standard configuration of wearable systems offers full-time
wireless Internet access, a cell phone and e-mail, but Mann
professes a certain boredom with those mundane applications. He
wants to push the scientific, intellectual and philosophical
boundaries of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   He began tinkering with wearables out of ``a desire to create
some personal space and a personal interpretation of reality,'' he
says. In elementary school, that desire for ``personal space'' led
him to cobble together an early version of a Walkman out of
headphones and a car stereo tape player, so that he could walk down
the street listening to sounds of his own choosing, rather than
those imposed on him by others. His early wearable systems
consisted of audio and video processors that allowed him to record,
alter and play back what he saw and heard around him.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's current ``eyetap'' system is an update of the system he
built and wore in the MIT experiment. Its most visible component
are his dark sunglasses, which aren't really glasses at all. They
act more like a blindfold because they block entirely his view of
the world around him.
</P>
<P>
   Mann can still see, but only indirectly. Two electronic devices
_ one mounted on each side of his glasses _ transmit video of the
outside world onto the Internet. Mann's on-board computer in his
clothing then picks up that image from the Net and projects it by
laser directly onto his retinas. He's not seeing the world around
him; he's seeing a streaming video of that world.
</P>
<P>
   He can play around with that image. For example, he can almost
literally give himself an eye in the back of his head by mounting a
camera pointed in that direction. If Mann wants to see what's going
on back there, he can access that backward feed and play it on his
retina.
</P>
<P>
   By adjusting his lenses, he can lighten images, allowing him to
``see'' objects that otherwise might be obscured by shadows or
darkness. He can also magnify objects, giving him a form of
telescopic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Mann now restricts access to his Internet feed to people such as
his wife, Betty, who has found some interesting uses for the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm shopping at the milk counter, she can use her computer
to draw a glowing circle around the low-fat carton, guiding me away
from the full-fat variety,'' Mann says.
</P>
<P>
   Mann met Betty in 1984. At the time, his then-crude wearable
system required him to ``metallicize'' his hair with a special
silvery paint so it would conduct electricity. He admits his circle
of friends at that time had gotten a little small, with many people
put off by his technological persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met the person who was later to become my wife, I
had already committed myself to being a cyborg, having modified
myself into that way of existence,'' Mann recalls. ``But she
accepted me for what I was at a time when I was probably the only
one on the planet living this kind of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In his latest system, Mann also gives his computer the authority
to alter his reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see a condom ad that I find offensive, I can just define
that image and hit Control K _ for `kill' _ and the image
disappears. And if it ever appears in my field of vision again, the
computer eliminates it before I see it,'' he says. Mann can choose
to leave that visual space empty, or he can fill it with a pleasant
image, such as a running waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   To Mann, that condom ad is a visual form of spam, the unwanted
advertising messages that clog personal e-mail. It's something he
doesn't want to see, something shoved in front of his face for
commercial reasons. He sees his eyetap technology as a way to fight
back against that intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the eye is the window to the soul, then that window needs a
shade on it,'' Mann says. ``If the brain is a computer, then the
eye is an open port, an unsecured opening against hackers.''

EDITORIAL: THE PUTIN PUZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   Unless the polls are badly mistaken or voter turnout is too low
to validate the balloting, Vladimir Putin is likely to be elected
president of Russia Sunday. He might be best described as a KGB
democrat, with all the contradictions the term implies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is a hybrid politician, the product of the recent
transformation of Russia from a totalitarian state to a shaky
democracy. Like his country, he seems suspended between Russia's
history and its future, impressed by the benefits of liberty and
free markets yet drawn to the idea of a firm leader who can restore
stability. There is little doubt that he will be a forceful
president, determined to reverse Russia's decline. The question is
whether he will do so democratically.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's rise to power has been improbable. Last August, Boris
Yeltsin impulsively decided that Putin should be his heir and made
him prime minister. Putin, the former head of the internal security
service that succeeded the KGB, became acting president when
Yeltsin resigned on New Year's Eve. The primary source of his
popularity is the brutal military assault on Chechnya. Compared
with Russia's last two leaders, Mikhail Gorbachev and Yeltsin,
Putin is not a seasoned politician. More important, he has not
shown a decisive commitment to political and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   There is much that needs fixing in Russia today. The economy is
barely stirring. Commerce is warped by the manipulations of
criminal gangs. The government cannot collect taxes, and a handful
of fabulously wealthy men, who benefited from a giveaway of state
property by the Yeltsin government, wield disproportionate power in
the Kremlin. Millions of Russians have fallen into poverty, and the
health care system is near collapse, with life expectancy for men
now only 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   After the dizzying gyrations of the Yeltsin years, a steady hand
in the Kremlin would be welcome. Putin is smart and articulate and
appears to be a skillful, pragmatic manager. He comes with some
democratic credentials. He has declared his support for
``fundamental political rights and human liberties,'' and seems to
harbor no nostalgia for the suffocating ideology of Communism, or
the terrors carried out in its name. As an aide to Anatoly Sobchak,
the reformist mayor of St. Petersburg, Putin helped build the
beginnings of a capitalist economy in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin chooses to advance reform while protecting the newly
won liberties of the Russian people, and makes government an
effective, honest and compassionate agent of change, he can do much
to realize the expectations raised by the demise of Communism. But
his actions thus far suggest he may take a different, harsher
course. The military campaign in Chechnya, directed with enthusiasm
by Putin, is the most ominous sign. Another source of concern is
xenophobic campaign reporting by the state-owned television
network.
</P>
<P>
   Putin could prove to be a younger, healthier version of Yuri
Andropov, the hardened KGB chief who briefly served as Soviet
leader in the early 1980s and tried to rouse Russia from the coma
it had slipped into under Leonid Brezhnev. In December, Putin
pointedly ordered that Andropov's bust be put back in a place of
honor at the entrance to what was once KGB headquarters in Moscow.
Putin, who is 47, is steeped in the values and culture of the
security agency, including its emphasis on order, discipline and
the preservation of a strong central government. His dream as a
teen-ager was to join the KGB, and he served the agency loyally for
17 years, including a tour as a spy in East Germany in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has made clear that his primary objectives are rebuilding
the machinery of state power and creating an orderly society. In
the U.S. translation of a series of autobiographical interviews
soon to be published as a book entitled ``First Person,'' he says
the ferocious assault on Chechnya is necessary to prevent the
disintegration of Russia. He admires the slyness of KGB efforts to
stifle dissent in the Soviet era and regrets the haste with which
Moscow exited Eastern Europe. He has warned against the
independence of regional governors and seems ambivalent about press
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   There is no model for enlightened democratic leadership in
Russia. Gorbachev, for all his efforts to remake the Soviet Union,
could never discard his faith in Socialism. Yeltsin's embrace of
democracy was heartfelt, but his leadership was flawed. Putin has
the chance to be both democratic and effective. It would be a great
loss for Russia and the world if he followed the KGB rulebook and
turned the Kremlin back into a fortress.

 &HT;    Technology, international character at center of Whitney
Biennial
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 2000 Whitney Biennial gets the new century off to
a good start. The work of the 97 artists is serious, thoughtful,
inventive and carefully crafted. If this graciously installed
exhibition lacks the boisterousness of past biennials, a sense of
maturity is not a bad trade. And most welcome of all, it doesn't
stick its finger or its rear end in your face, which goes to show
you that art _ and the biennial _ can be provocative without being
shrill and confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   (Hans Haacke's critique of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
response to the Brooklyn Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibition
is the exception, and it looks so ``last century.'')
</P>
<P>
   The biennial aims to survey what is being made in America. Its
observation: everything, from abstract painting to installation to
Internet art (included for the first time.) Still, this is
definitely the year of technology. In addition to Net art, there is
an abundance of video, digital and computer presentations. One of
the most intriguing, even though the point isn't quite clear, is
Cambridge, Mass.-based Krzysztof Wodi-czko's ``Aegis: Equipment for
a City of Strangers.'' The contraption is a pair of winglike LCD
monitors worn on the shoulders. They show images of the wearer that
talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the year of the figure. That's inevitable, what
with the preponderance of photography and video. But even most of
the nonrepresentational objects have figurative references as
opposed to being an investigation of form and color. In the case of
Chakaia Booker's wall relief ``Homage to Thy Mother (Landscape),''
one of the most strikingly beautiful pieces in the show, the
material _ car tires cut and shredded into a variety of shapes _ is
highly symbolic. The New York artist sees many references to
African-Americans in the tires, from their color to their
resilience. In one of many interesting juxtapositions, Booker's
piece is installed across the room from works by Alabama artist
Thornton Dial, who takes a similar approach to materials.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial abounds with inventive treatment of both au courant
themes and venerable genres. Ghada Amer, an Egyptian native living
in New York, makes elegant ``paintings'' by stitching patterns on
canvas that comment on the place of women in Islamic culture.
Atlantan Chris Verene comments on women in this culture in his
photos of men in camera clubs who take soft-porn pictures of
misguided women.
</P>
<P>
   (Both he and fellow Atlantan Kojo Griffin more than hold their
own here. Unfortunately, many of the videos and films, including
those of Atlantans Robin Bernat and Ruth Leitman, weren't
reviewable during press previews.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the demographics are broader _ both in geography and
generation _ than in the past, don't expect a regional flavor. Most
of the work selected by the six-person curatorial team comes out of
either a more interior source or a larger art world consciousness.
In fact, with 21 artists born outside of the United States, the
biennial exudes an international character. Iranian-born New Yorker
Shirin Neshat has contributed a riveting two-screen video about
Islam and individualism, with a touch of romance. Art may be the
melting pot that America never quite was.
</P>
<P>
   Not every piece is a gem, of course. In some cases, the object
can't carry off the conceptual burden imposed upon it.
Nevertheless, this biennial makes a persuasive and surprisingly
coherent case that contemporary art of all description is thriving.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK CITY'S NEW DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   The headlines nowadays are filled with ambitious proposals to
transform New York City's landscape. One day, planners unveil a
scheme to stage the Olympics in the city, with a new stadium on the
West Side and apartment houses for athletes on the Queens
waterfront. Another day, Albany debates plans to connect the Long
Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal or build a new Second
Avenue subway. Clearly boom times are producing dreams for big
projects, opening a potential new chapter in the city's
self-renewal. But dreams also entail tough decisions. It is far
from obvious how best to use limited resources for urban growth.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, continuing pressure for New York City to
use its regular capital budget to repair schools, bridges and the
infrastructure. But the city's history also illustrates the
importance of grand projects that spur economic growth and enhance
New York's reputation as a cultural and business mecca. The need
for planned expansion of existing public and private facilities is
illustrated daily by crowded subways, high-priced apartments and
squeezed commercial space. It is equally evident that there is room
for quality development around rail yards, in old manufacturing
areas and in underused waterfront districts. The problem for
elected officials is how to sort through competing plans and find
the best way to continue the tradition that has produced past
successes from Rockefeller Center to Lincoln Center and Battery
Park City.
</P>
<P>
   Four overarching goals are already evident. The city government
should try to open up Manhattan's West Side to development. It
should also revise the city's residential zoning to protect the
character of existing neighborhoods. The other two goals are the
upgrading of transit links and development of the waterfront and
other vacant areas. Shaping projects around these goals will
involve complicated choices about the mix of public and private
funds and the feasibility of various stadium proposals. Those
choices, in turn, will be influenced by the outcome of the effort
to recruit the Olympics. Here is a rundown on the major issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ The West Side. The biggest opportunity for apartments and
offices is in Manhattan, west of Eighth Avenue and south of 42nd
Street, an area developers have eyed for years. The main impediment
is a lack of transit access. The committee that proposes to bring
the 2012 Olympics to New York has some imaginative suggestions. One
proposal is to build a stadium over the rail yards near the
waterfront, and link the site with the No. 7 subway line, the Long
Island Rail Road, Metro North and the Amtrak trains to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic bid is supported by Gov. George Pataki and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who also wants a West Side stadium for the Jets
and the Javits Convention Center. Madison Square Garden is also
said to be interested in moving west. A valuable new neighborhood
could rise one day from what is now largely parking lots,
warehouses and wasted space. The stadium proposals deserve serious
study. But any new facility should have multiple uses, and no
potential user _ whether the Olympics or a sports franchise _
should be handed a blank check.
</P>
<P>
   The West Side is also being looked at by a team of business
leaders put together by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin. They want to find room for high-tech and
other business expansion in other parts of the city as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Olympics. The Olympics do not always produce the economic
activity that sponsors promise. But the Olympics group has laid out
an intriguing scheme in which a stadium just might work. Its
projections show that a public investment in a train stop and
platform over the railroad tracks _ with or without a stadium _
could be paid for by tax revenues from new office, hotel and
residential buildings. Over all, projected revenue from the
Olympics would pay for more than $1 billion in new athletic
facilities throughout the city. The Olympics proposal also calls
for an athletes village to be built on the Queens waterfront and
later converted to apartments. The entire proposal foresees
improvements in housing, public facilities and transportation that
would outlast the Games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transit. In New York City, of course, grand schemes often
spark big squabbling. The state budget is now being held up by a
fight over Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's demand that more money
be spent for a Second Avenue subway line. There is no question that
the Second Avenue subway is a priority, but financing that line
should not preclude bringing the Long Island Rail Road to Grand
Central or extending the No. 7 subway line to new West Side
development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Residential preservation. All these ideas for growth reinforce
the city's responsibility to protect its neighborhoods. One
initiative to accommodate construction of new apartments without
destroying existing places is being put forward by the New York
City Planning Commission under its chairman, Joseph Rose. It would
revise the residential zoning code to encourage buildings on the
scale of existing neighborhoods, and discourage blasting down
existing street blocks for empty plazas and big towers like the one
Donald Trump is constructing near the United Nations. This
commendable proposal is going through a review with the city's
community boards and should be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   All these activities reflect New York's optimistic new spirit.
Even in these affluent times, however, the public must spend its
resources wisely. Recent proposals for Columbus Circle and a new
Penn Station have proved that there still is a role for the
government to facilitate and, in some cases, subsidize exciting new
projects. The same attitude can create still more possibilities for
the future. We intend to address the specifics of all these
proposals in coming weeks. For now it is important to salute the
promise of ideas for a new chapter in the constant journey of a
city reinventing itself.

 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For one epic year, Bobby Valentine embraced Japanese
baseball, thinking he was importing his American ways. He wound up
realizing there are other ways to play this game.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the New York Mets has now returned to his other
baseball home, with all the exuberance of a child waking up on a
birthday. This week, Valentine is proudly leading his team on a
road trip that may be the next step toward a stronger bond between
the baseball continents. Saturday night at a news conference here,
Valentine, speaking in Japanese, said he was glad to be back.
</P>
<P>
   Monday and Tuesday, the Mets and the Chicago Cubs will play
alternate exhibitions against the Seibu Lions and the Yomiuri
Giants, and on Wednesday and Thursday, the Mets and the Cubs will
play regular-season games against each other. This will be the
first time a so-called major league game has ever been played
outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will be an ordeal for the players, some of whom are not
amused. Mark McGwire was so opposed to it that he blocked the
Cardinals from taking part, and has criticized the venture as being
driven by money. Valentine concedes that the Pacific Ocean will be
a major block to interleague play, but he said, ``Eventually
they'll have medicine to deal with jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the Americas are already linked in the fertile mind of
Valentine, the first American manager ever imported to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure lasted one year, 1995, but his love for Japan was
just beginning. He mingled. He questioned. He won. He lost. And he
brought things home with him.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent spring training in Florida, Valentine held what he
called ``shag-free practices,'' meaning his pitchers do not loll
around the outfield, shagging flies during batting practice. This
is a direct benefit of Valentine's year as the manager of the Lotte
Marines in the Chiba prefecture of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we get into the weight room or the video room,'' he said.
``We try to use the time more beneficially.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliche from Americans is that the Japanese place too much
stock in the 1,000-grounder workout that leaves players bowed and
bloody.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, people prepare as a group,'' Valentine said. ``Their
practices are very long, almost to the point of monotonous. I think
they do it to excess, but we were not practicing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Japan as a celebrity, having managed six years for
the Texas Rangers and one year with the Mets' Norfolk farm club. He
was a new link between the two continents in a sporting
relationship that began in 1867, when American merchants and
sailors brought the game here. In the second half of the 20th
century, the Japanese began hiring American players.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Yonamine, born in Hawaii of Japanese descent, played 13
years in Japan, spoke the language fluently, and managed the
Chunichi Dragons to a pennant in 1974. Joe Lutz, who had once
coached in Cleveland, managed the Hiroshima Carp briefly in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Don Blasingame, the veteran second baseman from the United
States, played three years with the Nankai Hawks of Osaka, stayed
to coach and manage them for over a decade, and in 1979-80 managed
the Hanshin Tigers. The popular Blazer tried to buck the system by
not overworking his pitchers and playing what he felt was a
consistent lineup, but he resigned after little more than a season.
</P>
<P>
   Never had Japan recruited a manager directly from the United
States until Valentine was courted by the management of Lotte, a
department-store empire with roots in Korea. The general manager
was Tatsuro Hirooka, a former star shortstop and championship
manager _ ``one of the first players to move into management, a
very proud man, impeccable dresser, from the old school,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine argued with umpires until he realized he was getting
nowhere, since he did not speak Japanese and also because a temper
is decidedly counterproductive in that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fit in in Japan,'' Valentine once said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-BBN-VECSEY-COLUMN-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TOKYO: once said. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He studied the language via a computer program, with the side
result of becoming hooked on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also noticed the way Japanese bunters do not waste motion by
squaring and pivoting but rather tap the ball from the more natural
batting stance. He has found resistance in teaching that technique
to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was fascinated by the rituals _ the organized
cheerleading sections, often organized by the corporations that own
the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear 10,000 strong, waving flags, doing the wave, blowing
trumpets, it's disconcerting at first,'' Valentine said. ``But it
is part of the game, it's part of the culture. They love sumo
wrestling, and now they have soccer, but for a long time baseball
was their only team sport, so they took parts of all our team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Lotte, they Americanized their game,'' Valentine
added. ``They got rid of the big, heavy drum. They would sing `Take
Me Out to the Ball Game' in the seventh inning, which was neat.
They had songs for the individual players. They made great puns on
the two languages. There was a guy named Iya Omura, so they would
sing `Old MacDonald Had a Farm' and they would chant `Iya-Iya-O.'
It was kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also had fun trying to personalize the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was riding the trains with the fans, talking to kids, all my
idle time out in public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles when he recalls the numerical approach, how in pregame
meetings his coaches would predict the score, saying it felt like a
6-1 game. To the American ear, that sounded impossible, given the
inconsistencies of pitching, but the coaches were serious.
</P>
<P>
   In Lotte, Valentine had a three-year contract to transform Chiba
Lotte from ``second-class citizens,'' but while the Marines
finished second behind Seibu in his first season, he and Hirooka
were already at odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hired me, he fired me, we had a falling out at the end,
regretfully,'' Valentine said the other day. ``It's the only
blemish on my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese baseball has stayed with him. He has gone back on
scouting and good-will missions and has been welcomed by Shigeo
Nagashima, the great third baseman who now manages the Yomiuri
Giants, the Yankees of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine questions the traditional view that the Japanese are
too small to hit for power. Also, competition has narrowed the
baseball gap between nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, if you were behind Nagashima with the Giants,
you stayed in the system forever,'' Valentine said of the Japanese
farm system. ``Now it's loosened up. As some Japanese players come
to the U.S., that develops more exceptional young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine praised unrelated players named Matsui: Kazuo, a
shortstop with Seibu ``who rivals Rey Ordonez in the field,'' and
Hideki, an outfielder with the Giants ``who hits for power and
average, the kind of player any manager would love.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we only had three non-Americans, the way they do, I believe
the Japanese league would be stronger than ours,'' Valentine said,
acknowledging the impact of Latin American stars like Sammy Sosa,
who will be a star attraction this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' manager does not foresee ``a true World Series'' in
the short run, but adds, ``What we are doing is the closest thing
to it _ two American teams playing two Japanese teams just before
the season, not just all-star teams. The real thing. I'm going to
play these games like World Series games.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, he plans to go out and mingle. Many players may
regard this expedition as a pain in their sleep cycle, but for
Bobby Valentine, this is a homecoming, deeply anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sleep on the plane home,'' he said.  &QL;

GUARD LEADS LATE RALLY AS LOUISIANA STATE BEATS YOUNG DUKE TEAM BY
13
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ On the Louisiana State sideline, the wizened
coach, Sue Gunter, was stomping her black patent-leather heels. Her
cheeks were reflecting the color of her cotton-candy pink blouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana State Tigers were not rebounding the ball,
standing like tourists around the basket and allowing Duke, last
year's national runners-up, to take a 47-42 lead with 12 minutes 56
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then guard Marie Ferdinand, a Louisiana State junior, got bored.
She needed a change of scenery, so she took her game inside and as
a result, took her team to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand, like lightning from a bottle, jumped out to make a
steal with 12:19 remaining, going down the floor for a quick layup
that ignited an 18-4 run. DeTrina White, a sophomore, finished with
19 points and 11 rebounds for the game's only double-double, and
the core of starters who had been together for 61 games outlasted a
young Duke team down the stretch for a 79-66 victory to advance to
the East Regional final Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All throughout the season, my team has fed off me,'' said
Ferdinand, who finished with a game-high 22 points, 11 in the final
12 minutes. ``I got the team a lift and I was able to get the run
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand also anchored a stingy LSU defense that stifled Duke's
outside shooting all day. The second-seeded Blue Devils, usually 37
percent shooters beyond the arc, went 5 for 22 (24 percent) from
3-point range. Third-seeded Louisiana State shot 56 percent for the
game, the percentage helped by a strong presence in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Though both teams played a frantic motion offense that kept the
score close in the first half _ Duke led 31-30 going into the
locker room _ LSU changed from a 1-3-1 zone defense to a one-on-one
that eventually overwhelmed the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``LSU played the game we wanted to play, they always made the
extra pass,'' said Duke's Lauren Rice, who led her team in scoring
with 17 points. ``We tried to trap them but then Ferdinand ended up
with easy layups in the lane.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that coach Gail Goestenkors of Duke kept Rice and
Georgia Schweitzer, the Atlantic Coast Conference player of the
year, on the bench to rest them. That gave Ferdinand some room and
the Tigers began their run, listening to their coach's favorite
expression: ``Whatever it takes to win!''
</P>
<P>
   LSU (25-6) is making its first trip to the regional finals in 14
years. Duke (28-6), which lost four starters from last year's team,
finished the season looking ahead to next year when it has perhaps
the best recruits in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us to make it to the Elite Eight,'' said
LSU's only senior, Katrina Hibbert. ``That was one of our goals in
the season. We wanted to make history, and of course, do it for
coach Gunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunter, 58, has 613 victories overall, fourth on the women's
basketball coaches' list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many years she has left in her,'' Hibbert
said, ``so we definitely want to get to the Final Four since she's
never been there before.''

REPUBLICANS FACE ABORTION BATTLE  
 CHANGES LIKELY AT DNC  
 ISSUES VOTERS CARE ABOUT  
 POLITICIANS TALKING GAS  
 CANDIDATES' MONIKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Neb., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the abortion rights movement in the Republican Party
say they will risk precipitating a noisy, divisive fight at this
summer's Republican National Convention if the party insists on
keeping an anti-abortion plank in its platform.
</P>
<P>
   They have begun a mass mailing to convince top party officials
that a platform that even so much as mentions the abortion issue is
a platform that invites disaster on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, favors an anti-abortion plank. He has shown no inclination
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 platform carried such a plank, and efforts by the
Republican Pro-Choice Coalition and other groups to have it thrown
out were soundly rebuffed. But in an effort to mute differences
over this touchy issue, the platform writers agreed to include a
mention of some of the positions advocated by Republicans who favor
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Come the 2000 convention, abortion rights leaders plan to say
the plank must go _ or, they warn, there will be a big fight,
nationally televised, and Gov. Bush will enter the fall campaign
with a badly divided party, deprived of the support of thousands of
voters, especially women, who are already more inclined to vote
Democratic than Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must understand,'' said Susan R. Cullman, a
co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, ``that the
road to a unified Republican Party is filled with deep potholes.
The party will surely tumble into one of them if we don't take
abortion out of the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its campaign to remove the anti-abortion plank, the
coalition is mailing its members and allies 40,000 ``Pothole
Ahead!'' packets that contain postcards to be forwarded to
convention officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pave the road for ALL!'' the cards urge. ``Take abortion OUT
of politics and OUT of the Republican Party platform!''
</P>
<P>
   At the DNC, Upheaval as Usual
</P>
<P>
   Late last summer, when President Clinton picked Edward G.
Rendell to be the general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, the expectation was that the party's campaign war chest
would soon be overflowing. Rendell, then serving his final months
as mayor of Philadelphia, had a reputation as a first-class manager
and a prodigious fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there is never enough management or money in any campaign
to keep everyone happy. So there has been some sotto voce
don't-quote-me grumbling that perhaps Rendell is not such a great
manager or prodigious money man after all.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But this much is clear:
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore now the man to see when it comes to
running the Democratic Party _ a perk that goes with being the
presumptive presidential nominee _ some job upheaval is inevitable
at the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   So?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Rendell is doing a fantastic job,'' Gore declared on
Thursday night at a fund-raiser in Detroit, seeming to cast a vote
of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised, some Gore aides later confided, if some
new faces start showing up in jobs just below Rendell's.
</P>
<P>
   Poll Suggests Bush Has the Right Issues
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent much of last week promoting himself as the
``education candidate.'' But that's not to say he has abandoned or
is playing down his earlier pitch about Gore's ``credibility
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He still hammers the vice president on that at just about every
stop, reminding voters about Gore's appearance at a fund-raiser
held at a Buddhist temple and recalling the Gore boast about
``inventing'' the Internet. And he still always manages to mention
Bill Clinton, Al Gore and ``character'' in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   It is a guess whether this education/credibility attack line is
working. But a new Battleground Poll, by Ed Goeas, a Republican,
and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, indicates that Bush has latched onto
the two issues foremost in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   When the pollsters asked 1,000 likely voters in mid-March to
list the ``most important'' issue in the presidential election, 18
percent said ``restoring moral values'' and 13 percent said
``improving education.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which had a margin of sampling error of 3.1 percentage
points, found the third-most important issue to be strengthening
Social Security and Medicare (11 percent) and the fourth to be
improving health care (10 percent). After that, in order, came gun
control, crime, taxes, government spending, the environment, the
economy and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Gas Prices the Talk of State Campaigns
</P>
<P>
   The steep rise in gas prices has mainly provided political
fodder for Republicans going after Gore, who likes to boast that
the country has never enjoyed better economic times. But more and
more the gas issue is filtering down into congressional and state
races.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, former Gov. George F. Allen, a Republican trying to
oust Sen. Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, says Robb has to go because
he once called for a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in gas taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, George Grogan, a Republican businessman running for
the Senate, is broadcasting advertisements in which he accuses
Clinton of knuckling under to OPEC and urges cuts in the federal
gas tax and more oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the state's Republican Party recently ran
advertisements in which Gov. John G. Rowland called on voters to
press state legislators, particularly reluctant Democrats, to pass
a 7-cents-a-gallon cut in the state's 32-cents-a-gallon gas tax.
Democrats worry that this cut would cost the state treasury too
much.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says the blame for the price spike should

CLINTON URGES GIVING FDA OVERSIGHT OF TOBACCO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)   (jw)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton challenged Congress on Saturday
to restore the Food and Drug Administration's ability to regulate
tobacco, calling it a ``life and death issue for children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the third-ranking House
Republican, said the drug agency should concentrate instead on
finding cures for diseases, and that the president should ``use the
bully pulpit'' to tell children not to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came in his weekly radio address, broadcast
as he was ending his travels to India and Pakistan. He described
Tuesday's Supreme Court decision, which said the FDA needed
specific authority from Congress before dealing with tobacco, as a
``setback for the health of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the ball is in Congress' court,'' he said. ``They should
show they also understand the danger to our young people and give
the FDA's tobacco regulations the force of law. This is not a
partisan issue. It's a health issue for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled that when the 1998 tobacco bill was before the
Senate, it provided for FDA regulation. ``But,'' he said, ``the
leadership blocked it.'' The drug agency part of that bill was
relatively noncontroversial. The Republican leaders said they
opposed the bill because it would raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who managed the bill, blamed
campaign contributions to Republicans, who get about four-fifths of
the money the tobacco industry gives to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who introduced a bill on Tuesday
that would restore FDA authority and give its tobacco rules the
force of law, said he doubted that Republican leaders would let the
legislation come to a vote. ``They love the tobacco companies,''
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, in a news release, maintained the Republican argument,
offered on Tuesday by various party leaders, that the agency could
not handle the additional workload of tobacco regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is supposed to be aiding the development and
implementation of vaccines and life-saving medicines,'' he said.
``Do we not still have diseases that need cures? The FDA seems to
be interested in doing everything except what they are responsible
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican whip said the president should follow the example
of former first lady Nancy Reagan's efforts against drugs.
``Instead of putting forth a courageous program, like Mrs. Reagan's
`just say no' campaign against drug use, President Clinton passes
the buck and tells the American people `the ball is in Congress'
court,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government regulation is not the answer to every problem,''
Watts said. ``Sometimes situations require good, old-fashioned
leadership. I hope the president realizes this and begins to
address the moral crisis in our country. Only then will our
children be better off.''

OFFICIALS SAY MICROSOFT BID TO SETTLE SUIT IS INADEQUATE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal
offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government
concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust
case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring
a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as
Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad
violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a
week to settle the case before he issued a verdict. The two sides
had been talking for almost four months.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page
settlement offer to the Justice Department and the 19 state
attorneys general who are suing Microsoft. It included so much
technical detail that it took lawyers hours to decipher it. But in
the end, one official said, ``it wasn't nearly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in
their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the
weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the
case, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals
there.
</P>
<P>
   But two officials said no new talks had been scheduled. It
remains possible that Microsoft will offer a new or modified
proposal in the next two days. But short of that, the ongoing
settlement talks, which started Nov. 30, are likely to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   None of the state or federal officials involved with the suit
would discuss the settlement proposal, and Microsoft declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, Jackson rules in favor of the government this
week, he will also set out the procedures and schedule for remedy
hearings. In those hearings, the federal and state governments will
propose the remedies, or penalties, they want to impose. Between
now and then, they face one of the most difficult tasks in the
case: forging agreement between the federal government and 19 state
attorneys general on an appropriate remedy.

IT FEELS LIKE 1996 TO SOARING LEHMAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (jw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ In 1996, many believed that Tom Lehman
was the world's best player after he won the British Open, the Tour
Championship and led the PGA Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Lehman has felt just as good. Winning this weekend would
be another statement that his game is as good as it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   After two excellent rounds on one of the word's most challenging
courses, Lehman began Saturday one stroke off the lead heading into
the third round of the Players Championship. Hal Sutton led at 6
under (138), one stroke ahead of Lehman and Omar Uresti, who were
tied at 5 under. But the leader board was crowded with Fulton Allem
at 4 under, Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, and Len Mattiace at 2 under,
and Lee Janzen and Scott Dunlap at 1 under.
</P>
<P>
   That was serious competition, but that often brings out the best
in Lehman, who is as competitive as anyone on tour. He looked
forward to the weekend challenge at the TPC of Sawgrass. And he
liked his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my chances are as good as anyone's'' said Lehman, who
already has three top 10 finishes this year, including a victory at
the Phoenix Open. ``I expect Tiger Woods to play great. I expect
Tom Lehman to play great. I expect Ernie Els to play great. Anybody
can win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tournament has already been interesting, because many
players have commented candidly about Woods and his recent
domination of the tour. Woods has already won three times in six
starts this year, and he has two second-place finishes as well.
Commenting on Woods' victory last weekend at the Bay Hill
Invitational, Colin Montgomerie said that after the first round,
many players had already conceded the tournament to Woods in their
minds. Many players have taken exception to Montgomerie's
statement. Count Lehman among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought what Monty said was a little strange,'' said Lehman.
``After one round it's still anybody's ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit where credit is due. I was raised to
think there are two cardinal sins in sports. One is under
estimating your opponent, and the other is overestimating your
opponent. I respect very much the other players on tour. Yet, if I
didn't think I was capable of beating them, I wouldn't be out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Allem was even stronger when asked if he would be intimidated by
Woods this weekend. ``Not unless he has a gun,'' said Allem. ``He
hits it 50 yards by me and he can beat me by 15 strokes. But when I
stand on the first tee, I look into his eyes, I am looking to beat
him. I'm not going to go like Davis Love III and all those guys
that say, `Oh, you know he is so tough.' I'm going for the gusto.
Beat me. I'm not going to sit back and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought that other players were intimidated by
Woods, Allem said: ``A lot of them are. Look, the kid is great, he
is the best player bar none. He is beautiful to watch. But you have
to enjoy the opportunity to beat the guy who is the best player.
That's the way I look at it. If I look at his record and look at
mine, ain't no way. But you've got to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has been thinking positively ever since he arrived at the
tournament. Although he has never won the tournament, Lehman has
three top 10 finishes at Sawgrass, including a tie for second in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has managed to keep his ball dry at the difficult island
green par 3 No. 7, making a birdie on Thursday and a par on Friday.
Some players walk to No. 17 with trepidation, but not Lehman. ``It
adds to the course,'' said Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman would like to add to his trophy case, but he will have to
play superb golf, considering the course and the competition. But
Lehman would prefer it that way. And he was happy that he was again
playing well enough to win, especially with the Masters just two
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to play well, especially in the big ones,''
said Lehman. ``If you are going to pick a tournament to play well
in, you might as well pick a big one.''

DAIMLERCHRYSLER NEARS DEAL TO BUY 33.4 PERCENT OF MITSUBISHI
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another big move toward the global consolidation of the
automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a
deal on Monday to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors
for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest
automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have
large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and
the United States. The other giants of the auto industry,
Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still
are weak in at least one of these markets.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also marks the second time in the past year that a
Japanese carmaker has ceded management control to a foreign
competitor. Renault of France acquired a 36.8 percent stake last
year in Nissan Motors. If the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi deal is
completed, Japan would be left with only two major independent car
companies _ Toyota and Honda _ with the rest partly or entirely
under the control of western manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi has been in financial distress and is saddled with
about $16 billion in debt. And though it has a presence in
Southeast Asia as well as Japan, the company has only 2.3 percent
of the Japanese market. Mitsubishi had been sought a partnership to
shore up its capital position in the face of brutal worldwide
competition in the market for small and medium-sized cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi stake would give DaimlerChrysler the right to
name several members of Mitsubishi's board and veto power over
major decisions. And because the German-American carmaker would
provide a crucial capital infusion, it expects to have the leverage
to hammer out a strategy to bolster the two companies' presence in
Asia and in the small-car market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the move poses plenty of risks for DaimlerChrysler. The
automaker has already seen its stock pushed down in the past year,
partly because of investor fears about the financial drain of
taking command of a small-car producer and concerns about the lower
profit margins of small cars in comparison with DaimlerChrysler's
core businesses _ Mercedes-Benz luxury cars and Chrysler sport
utility vehicles, light trucks and midsized American family cars.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks between the two companies said that
Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president of Mitsubishi, was in Frankfurt
Saturday to sign a letter of intent with Juergen E. Schrempp,
chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, DaimlerChrysler will take no stake in
Mitsubishi's truck business, of which Volvo of Sweden owns 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences are often the biggest barrier to
international auto mergers. But DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi may
have an advantage because Chrysler and Mitsubishi have worked
together closely for many years. Mitsubishi makes the Dodge Avenger
and Chrysler Sebring coupes for DaimlerChrysler at a factory in
Normal, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For Schrempp of DaimlerChrysler, the Mitsubushi deal would
appear to finally satisfy a goal he has had since engineering the
takeover of Chrysler two years ago: to gain a major presence in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Asian car market has been in disastrous shape for the
last several years, thanks to the lingering effects of the
financial crises in Southeast Asia and Japan's intractable
recession, industry experts still believe it will be one of the
biggest sources of growth in years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last year, Schrempp was in advanced negotiations to
acquire a stake in Nissan and was competing against overtures by
Renault.
</P>
<P>
   But after Daimler executives scrutinized Nissan's enormous
financial and structural problems, Schrempp bowed out of the talks
and Renault ultimately struck a deal with Nissan instead.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Daimler said Saturday that Mitsubishi brought
with it some good technology, including the direct-fuel injection
diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi also owns a stake in Proton, the Malaysian automobile
company, and that stake in turn could give DaimlerChrysler improved
access to the Southeast Asian market.

   FBN-NFL-CRIME _ The NFL's p.r. machine has long juked the
growing number of criminal acts by many of its players, but two now
face murder charges and there's no dodging the questions about
off-the-field problems. Domestic violence. Bar fights. Drug abuse
and trafficking. The league cites statistics proportional to
society, but that argument doesn't wash when players already facing
or convicted of crime are allowed to enter and stay in the league.
What's being done, if anything, on a leaguewide scale and with
individual teams? NOW and M.A.D.D. have stepped up pressure in some
situations. Do players believe they're invincibile when it comes to
their actions? Will background checks intensify or be ignored? Will
the league become a Big Brother to players like Baltimore's Ray
Lewis, who was allegedly involved in a double homicide only days
before the Ravens planned to talk to him about his choice of
``friends.'' We speak to players, management, league officials, law
enforcement officials, sociologists, etc. (Woods, Palm Beach Post).

SUBURBAN HOME PRICES SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With 1999 standing as the fourth straight
record-setting year for home prices throughout the nation and the
New York metropolitan region, and with older baby boomers ensconced
in their homes of choice while younger ones seek a place to finally
fit their families, it has come to this:
</P>
<P>
   One day last month in Westchester County, N.Y., a desperate
young woman knelt on the porch of a four-bedroom home in
Hastings-on-Hudson and slipped photographs of her children under
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the house so badly,'' said Robin Friedman, the
manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence brokerage office in nearby
Irvington. ``They obviously were hoping to pull at the seller's
heartstrings. Unfortunately, they did not make the highest offer
and did not get the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The home, which Friedman described as a ``nice split-level,''
sold for $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   All across the region, because of a confluence of mostly
propitious economic forces, the squeeze is on _ and what spurts up
are prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburban arc around New York City, according to data
collected by the National Association of Realtors, the median price
for existing single-family homes hit $208,000 in 1999, an 11
percent rise over 1998 _ and nearly triple the nation's 3.9 percent
rate of increase. ``Virtually every area around New York City was
close to double digits in increases,'' said Dr. Fred Flick, the
association's vice president for economic research.
</P>
<P>
   The median price for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, for example,
rose by 9.7 percent in 1999, to $197,000. Westchester County's
average price ascended to $458,981, a 15.1 percent increase. In New
Jersey, the median price for Middlesex, Hunterdon and Somerset
counties, computed together by the National Association of
Realtors, jumped to $221,000, a whopping 23.3 percent increase over
1998 _ nearly six times the national rate of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   And while that New Jersey statistic was certainly the extreme,
it was also the point of the arrow for the region. For the second
straight year, according to another measure of the market, the Case
Shiller Weiss repeat-sales survey, every one of the 576 ZIP code
areas in 14 counties that constitute most of New York City's
suburban ring saw prices appreciate in 1999 _ 396 of them by at
least 8 percent. (Statistics for several areas, including all of
Rockland County, were incomplete.)
</P>
<P>
   That boon _ for sellers _ rides atop a historic boom.
</P>
<P>
   January was the 107th month of the nation's economic expansion,
the longest ever, surpassing the 106-month period from 1961 to
1969. ``So, 31 days into the 365,250-day-long millennium, we break
the record,'' said Dr. James Hughes, the dean of the Rutgers
University School of Planning and Public Policy. ``What a way to
start a millennium!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think 3 percent was the maximum growth rate for the
gross domestic product,'' Dr. Hughes said. ``But we closed out the
millennium, the fourth quarter of 1999, with a GDP growth of 6.9
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And housing certainly went along for the economic ride,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the national median price for existing
single-family homes set a record last year, so, too, did sales
volume. There were 5.19 million resales in 1999, said Dr. Flick of
the National Association of Realtors, breaking the record of 4.97
million sales set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, national sales of newly built homes also set a
record last year, breaking the 1998 mark. ``In the last four
years,'' said Steve Berman, a statistician in the residential
construction branch of the Census Bureau, ``we have had four of the
best six years ever for sales of new homes since the beginning of
time _ which for us is 1963, when we started the survey.'' There
were 907,000 new homes sold in 1999, topping the record of 886,000
sold in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``So don't be surprised,'' Berman said, ``that given last year's
numbers, when combined with the record for existing-home sales,
that the nation's homeownership rate hit an all-time high.'' The
old record, set in 1998, was 66.3 percent of all households owning
their own homes, he said, ``and it hit 66.9 percent in '99.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, sales activity has been feverish throughout most of
the country; regional records were set in the Midwest and South,
and the West enjoyed its third-best year ever. Less obviously,
sales volume has been somewhat dampened in the Northeast, and in
the metropolitan region in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, as Rae Rosen, senior regional economist for
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, sees it, is that ``in some
sense, we're landlocked _ in the city, but also in many older
suburban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the view of Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of
the New Jersey Builders Association, the dearth of development is
attributable to stringent zoning regulations and open-space
preservation. In New Jersey, for example, O'Keefe said, ``housing
production is down 36 percent, decade to decade,'' from 37,900
units a year during the 1980s to 24,000 in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has acted to push up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying forces of the housing market, Dr. Hughes at
Rutgers said, ``have been job and income growth, the wealth effect
from the stock market and consumer confidence, all reinforcing the
other force _ baby boomers trading up at a furious pace.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the baby-boom generation will range in age from 36 to
54. ``The older boomers are locked into the houses they want, so
they are not selling,'' Dr. Hughes said. ``The younger boomers are
trying to settle into the communities where they can finish raising
their families. So we're short of product.''

<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that rising mortgage rates stifle
demand, and interest costs for the standard 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgage have certainly risen recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, we are at four-year highs for the 30-year fixed
mortgage, hovering near 8.3 percent,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice
president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics company in
Butler, N.J. ``There's been a long, steady climb since October of
1998 when we achieved 31-year lows of 6.68 percent.'' During 1999,
the low mark for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.84 percent on
Jan. 31; the high was 8.31 percent on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Rising home prices and mortgage costs do, of course, take ``some
of the marginal home buyers out of the market,'' Gumbinger said,
but house-hungry, thick-walleted buyers have, literally, adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steady rise in fixed rates,'' Gumbinger said, ``has given
some resurgence to adjustable-rate mortgages'' _ or ARMs _ a
mortgage product that, at least to begin with, offers a lower-cost
alternative to traditional fixed-rate financing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gumbinger said, about 30 percent of mortgages being
originated ``have some form of adjustable rate, up sharply from the
10 percent in January '99.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the reasons home sales have not cooled too much
despite the climb in interest rates,'' he said.

FINDING AN APARTMENT ACROSS FROM THE OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One problem with being young, hard-working and
successful in New York is that there is no time to find a place to
live, especially when the best apartments seem to be snapped up
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Suzanne Melbinger, who is 31, was living on West
23rd Street in a two-room suite for $2,500 a month at the Chelsea
Hotel that she had taken after a three-year sublet on a Midtown
studio ran out. She was thinking she would find a more permanent
place when she had a spare moment, but she never did. Her job in
sales for Bliss, a company with spas and spa-related products,
consumed her.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a place found her.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Bliss had moved from downtown Manhattan to
Dumbo, a gritty waterfront section of Brooklyn that takes its name
from its location, down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass. As
time wore on, Melbinger grew increasingly attracted to the
neighborhood. Only someone who has relished the intensity of
Manhattan would describe Dumbo, with its spider's web of highways
and bridges, as a quiet haven, but that is exactly how she
experienced it.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, her co-workers began checking out a building across
from their office on Washington Street that was being converted
into rentals by the developer David Walentas. They kept urging her
to look at it, she said, but ``I wasn't paying attention.''
Finally, she went over to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   What she found was stunning to someone used to living in small
spaces. For $300 more than she was paying in Manhattan, she found a
loft with almost 1,500 square foot, exposed wood beams, new
oak-strip floors, a bedroom, a large office and an open kitchen
with cherry wood cabinets, stainless-steel appliances and an island
topped with black granite.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later she went back with her longtime boyfriend,
Anthony Ancona, a partner in Fountainhead, a wine store in East
Norwalk, Conn. ``We just fell in love with this building,'' said
Melbinger, who grew up in Locust Valley on Long Island. They moved
into the seven-story brick building Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was much to move. Both are avowed minimalists,
and neither has lugged around the artifacts that tend to create
clutter. Although they do not always live together _ Ancona has a
small apartment in East Norwalk _ this is the first place they are
really sharing, she said, and they are furnishing it with a few
carefully chosen things.
</P>
<P>
   On the kitchen counter is a perfect cream-colored pitcher. A few
candles sit on a bench in the foyer. A Shaker-style dining room
table on wheels was built from a kit. They bought some stools for
their kitchen counter, and they have ordered some couches.
</P>
<P>
   And that's about it. ``We don't want to overfill the room,'' she
said. ``We want to keep it as spacious as it is.'' For the first
time, they will be able to have big dinner parties. ``We love to
entertain, and we've never had the opportunity to do so,'' she
said. In the studio they had sublet, they tried, she said, but
``two people couldn't be in the kitchen at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially rewarding to someone accustomed to Manhattan are the
closets. The large coat closet in the foyer, three times the size
of a garden-variety urban coat closet, is filled with her coats and
shoes (all black).
</P>
<P>
   Although the neighborhood is hectic during the week, and newly
renovated office spaces are filling up, weekends are still quiet,
and traffic is sparse. ``I like to walk down the middle of the
street,'' Melbinger said, giving a tour of her neighborhood. ``It's
cobblestoney.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dumbo is perfect. ``What is lacking here, obviously, is
food,'' she said. For a supermarket, she must walk 10 minutes, to
Brooklyn Heights. From her apartment, she can see one of the few
restaurants, the Between the Bridges Pub, framed by the
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Manhattan Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   She chose an apartment with a view of traffic rather than of
Washington Street, she said, because she was adamant about one
thing: Despite her obvious pleasure in her work, and her attachment
to her company, she did not want to actually look at her office
from home.

 &HT;    MOST TENSE DAY AWAITS POPE AS HIS PILGRIMAGE ENDS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspaper
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel On this, the final day (Sunday) of his
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Pope John Paul II will likely face the
trickiest political challenges so far as he visits some of the most
important religious sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will be in Jerusalem's Old City, a walled district that
has been at the center of religious and political conflict for
centuries. He plans to visit the Western Wall, sacred to Jews, and
the Dome of the Rock, sacred to Muslims. Then, he will deliver a
mass in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the dim and cavernous
church where Catholics believe Jesus was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   But the grueling itinerary , which has apparently weakened the
already frail pope, will be made even more difficult because of a
controversial statements published Saturday by a Muslim cleric who
is scheduled to meet with the pope today.
</P>
<P>
   Ikrema Sabri, the top Muslim cleric in Jerusalem, is quoted by
an Italian newspaper as saying that Israelis exaggerated the number
of Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust in order to get political
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, the number was less than 6 million and Israel is
using this issue to get sympathy worldwide,'' said Sabri,
confirming the statements to the Associated Press. Sabri was
appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the PLO which is headed by
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri's comments were sure to anger Israelis and put pressure on
the pope for a responsejust the kind of political dispute the
pontiff has been struggling to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Just Thursday, the pope made a historic and dramatic statement
at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum. There, he said
the church was ``deeply saddened'' by Catholic persecution of the
Jews. He also noted the ``millions'' of Holocaust victims and said,
``no one can diminish its scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was seen by Jewish leaders as an an important
message, though the figure of 6 million was already
well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reuters, Sabri also said there could be
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the Old City.
He said Palestinians are angry about strict Israeli security
measures including the closing of shops on the pope's route for the
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Old City is populated by Palestinians who oppose
Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert Saturday night said, ``We will
address anything that comes up and I'm sure we'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   This tense final day comes after the pope avoided politics in a
visit Saturday to Nazareth, another site of religious
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The pope delivered a mass in the Basilica of the Annunciation,
the church on the site where Catholics believe an angel told the
Virgin Mary that she would give birth to the son of God.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps feeling the stress of a grueling itinerary, the pope
spoke in an especially hoarse voice. His hands shook more than
usual an apparent symptom of Parkinson's disease (cq. Eds: The
Vatican has never confirmed that he has Parkinsons).
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth, an Arab city of about 70,000, was once mostly
Christian but is now about two-thirds Muslim and the two groups
have been involved in a series of religious skirmishes
</P>
<P>
   The pope, for example, rode his popemobile on a street where
Muslims have made a makeshift mosque. Local Christians argue the
mosque is too close to the basilica where the pope spoke and is
meant only to intimidate Christians. Last Easter nearby
Christian-owned shops on the street were vandalized during a
rampage by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But people of both faiths gave the Pope an enthusiastic welcome
Saturday. Inside the basilica, the pope focused his message on the
``mystery'' of the Immaculate Conception and urged followers to
``defend the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nazareth, where Jesus began his public ministry, I ask Mary
to help the Church everywhere to preach the 'good news' to the
poor,'' the pope said. ``I ask her to teach us the way to humble
and joyful obedience to the gospel in the service of our brothers
and sisters without preferences and without prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Christians and Muslims lined the street to the
church to get a glimpse of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``His visit gives the people of Nazareth a feeling of love,''
said Muslim Fakri Fahoum, 27, who stood on a stack of spare police
barricades to get a view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beneficial, the visit, because it helps people understand
that we are not interested in any fights, we just want to live in
peace,'' said Greek Orthodox Christian Katy Tanus, 23.

 &HT;    Savannah State baseball's 37-0 run is new mark
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Can a college baseball team go a full season
without a loss?
</P>
<P>
   Before you automatically say no, consider that Savannah State
University already is 37-0. After a streak like that, 13 more wins
doesn't seem all that impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good enough to win them all,'' leading-hitter Brett
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this team, nothing would surprise me anymore,'' coach
Jamie Rigdon said. ``Who would have believed that we'd have won
this many in a row? Before the season, I was just hoping for 40
wins. I didn't know they'd come at the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are still three short of that number. But who's
counting? Oh, just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, no NCAA Division I or Division II team had
won more than 34 consecutive games in a season. Texas did it in
1977, and Florida Atlantic matched the Longhorns last year.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah State broke that record last Sunday, completing a home
sweep of Maryland-Eastern Shore with a 24-2 rout that took the
suspense away early. The Tigers had plenty of time to plan their
postgame Gatorade drenching of Rigdon to celebrate the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 35 wins, they could have come by and punched me,''
Rigdon said.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't find Savannah State in the national rankings, and
the Tigers won't qualify for the postseason, no matter how many
more games they win.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah State is caught in NCAA limbo. The school is leaving
Division II for Division I, but the move won't be finished for two
years. Right now, Georgia's oldest public historically black
college is stuck between the two classifications, not eligible for
the postseason in either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a few players because they thought there wasn't
anything to play for here,'' Higgins said. ``That is their loss,
not ours. They cared about themselves more than the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought in some good players,'' Rigdon said, ``but the
hardest recruiting I had to do was convincing some of the ones
already here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, in his fourth season at age 27, is the unlikely coach of
a very unlikely baseball powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The graduate of Lakeside High School outside Augusta came to
Savannah State to play basketball, as one of the Tigers' few white
recruits ever. He had averaged 27 points per game as a high school
senior, and he was burned out on baseball after playing that sport
for two seasons in junior college.
</P>
<P>
   But Rigdon broke his foot and soon found his hoop dream ended.
He asked baseball coach Wesley McGriff for a tryout and found his
love for that sport rekindled _ so much so, that he stayed around
as an assistant coach after playing for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When McGriff left in 1996 after winning his third Southern
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title in a 5-year span, Rigdon
was promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon's second team won 25 games in a row and finished 39-9.
Last year, Savannah State won its fifth consecutive SIAC title and
made the NCAA Division II Tournament for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were 108-38-1 in Rigdon's first three seasons. But
this year's team was missing the entire pitching rotation from
1999, plus star outfielder Brandon Jackson, who signed with the
Anaheim Angels after being drafted in the 16th round.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, a senior catcher from Cleveland and the Tigers' top
returnee, conceded that he was afraid the team might start slowly.
He shouldn't have worried.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah State swept Edward Waters 15-0 and 12-0 in an opening
doubleheader. The Tigers hit five home runs to back the shutout
pitching of freshman Ricardo Castillo and junior-college transfer
Guy Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins is batting .558 with 16 homers and 77 runs batted in.
Castillo, a native of Venezuela who started only two games as a
high school senior in Miami, is 15-0 with a 1.58 earned run average
and three one-hitters. Thigpen is 13-0 with a 1.49 ERA. The team is
averaging 13 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah State's student body of 3,000 is about 90 percent
African-American, but the Tigers' baseball team is more diverse.
The 21-man roster includes six whites and two Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wins have no color,'' Rigdon said. ``I don't think being a
white coach at a black school is any advantage or disadvantage. I'm
just looking for the best ballplayers. Nothing else matters to me
or the players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets along,'' said Thigpen, who grew up in Alabama
and went to junior college in Florida. ``We are all here to win as
a team.''
</P>
<P>
   And to play at Savannah State, which has a limited baseball
budget, means playing without a full athletic scholarship. ``You
pay the price to play here,'' Rigdon said. ``There isn't a lot of
money to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the Tigers' success even more amazing. Nine of their
wins have come against Division I teams. They have beaten Florida
A&AMP;M twice, rallying to force extra innings and winning 17-16 at
Tallahassee on Derron Street's two-run homer in the 10th. Savannah
State's biggest comeback came against St. Augustine, from a 9-2
deficit to win 12-9.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah State president Carlton Brown, who has seen the
school's other athletic teams struggle, gets carried away when he
talks about the baseball success.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're operating with almost no scholarships, aren't eligible
for any championships or postseason play, had some players leave,
and still they're winning,'' Brown said. ``To set an NCAA record is
a fantastic accomplishment. But to set it in the way that this team
has may be the most phenomenal story ever told.''

 &HT;    Top players now switching from BellSouth
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The BellSouth Classic golf tournament is an undeniable
success. It sells out every year. It generates nearly $1 million
dollars a year for charity. It has produced high-profile champs
Tiger Woods, David Duval and John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a controversial move from Atlanta Country Club in
1997, it has maintained a reputation as a solid PGA Tour event at
the Greg Norman-designed TPC at Sugarloaf.
</P>
<P>
   But what about that can't miss pre-Masters date? Moving the
BellSouth from May to the week before the Masters was expected to
produce some of the top fields on tour. It was advertised as a
perfect tune-up for Augusta with similar playing conditions, and
the pros could play in Duluth on Sunday and eat in Augusta on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked out that way. The pre-Masters date, under
contract through 2002, is costing tournament officials big-name
players, including Woods, who uses the week to prepare for Augusta.
Woods chose not to defend his 1998 title last year and has said he
has no plans to change his pre-Masters routine.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not alone. When the BellSouth Classic begins on
Thursday, only seven of the world's top 20 golfers (19 of the top
50) will compete, one week after 49 of the top 50 played in The
Players Championship. Some simply take the week off. Others prepare
for the Masters. And some say that Sugarloaf's hilly terrain is too
physically demanding the week before a major.
</P>
<P>
   Even Davis Love III, a Georgian who has been loyal to the
Atlanta tournament, will not play this year. He does not want to
risk his conditioning or spasm-prone back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be rested and have some energy going into Augusta,''
Love said. ``Give me a golf cart, and I'll play it (Sugarloaf)
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some players who don't play because of the golf
course,'' said Stewart Cink, a Sugarloaf resident and runner-up to
Duval last year. ``It's a tough walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the field includes some interesting players _
course designer Norman; defending champion Duval; Masters champion
Jose Maria Olazabal; Casey Martin, who will use a cart; Gary
Nicklaus, Jack's son; and Nick Faldo, who continues to search for
the ingredients that brought him three Masters and two British
Opens.
</P>
<P>
   The late commitments from Phil Mickelson (No. 12), Jesper
Parnevik (No. 8) and Fred Couples (No. 20) certainly enhanced the
event, but, unfortunately, Woods has become the No. 1 barometer for
field appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand,'' tournament director Dave Kaplan
said, ``that as long as we're in this date, unless Tiger changes
his (tack) for the Masters, we're not going to get him. But even if
we were to move (the date), there's no guarantee that we would get
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth also has been affected by some uncontrollable and
unfortunate timing. Kaplan thinks more of the top players would
have entered the tournament for the annual last-gasp chance to get
into the Masters. But the Masters' decision not to exempt
tournament winners took care of that.
</P>
<P>
   And while the pre-Masters date provides a natural playing
opportunity for European players, the two biggest draws, Sergio
Garcia of Spain (No. 14) and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (No. 3),
are not playing this year. Montgomerie played Atlanta last year but
reduced his 2000 schedule. Garcia said he will practice with
Australia's Aaron Baddeley at the Golf Club of Georgia next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play three tournaments before the Masters,
with the Masters being the fourth,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Some players bypassing Atlanta used to play the week before the
Masters when New Orleans occupied BellSouth's spot. But English
Turn in New Orleans is a flat course, unlike Sugarloaf, which has
more than nine miles of hilly terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy Waldorf, a first-round leader in the '99 BellSouth, played
last year because he did not have an invitation to Augusta. This
year, he will play in Augusta _ and skip the BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the old course (Atlanta Country Club), and I like the
new course,'' said Waldorf, a first-round leader in the 1999
BellSouth. ``But Augusta, to me, can be a draining week. I think
Atlanta's a pretty good preparation (for the Masters), but I'm
looking at it more from energy and being fresh for Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the BellSouth, not enough players feel the
same as Cink and two-time U.S. Open champ Lee Janzen, who tend to
play better at the end of long stretches. The first seven times
Janzen won on tour, it came on the fourth or fifth consecutive
event on his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always skipped the week before the Masters,'' Janzen
said. ``But Atlanta is so close, and I've played Augusta so many
times now, I figured last year it's better I play the week before,
just so I don't get to Augusta too early.... I think Sugarloaf's an
awesome golf course. It's hard for me not to play because I like it
so much.''

FORMULA ONE HOPES RACE AT INDY STIRS U.S. GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN U. BACON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Last weekend's Australian Grand Prix
opened the Formula One season to the delight of auto racing fans in
every westernized country except the United States, where Formula
One is still largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That might change before this season ends because the tour will
make its first trip to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sept. 24.
The Speedway has sold more than 200,000 tickets to the event, a
Formula One record.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind Formula One's surging popularity is Bernie
Ecclestone, a Napoleonic figure who effectively took over the
wayward sport two decades ago. He instilled discipline, unity and
aggressive marketing strategies to push auto racing to the
forefront of European sports sections and television stations,
behind only soccer. Ecclestone stands just over 5 feet tall, but he
is one of the most intimidating figures in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his ultimate challenge will be getting a foothold in
America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Ecclestone officially became the vice president of the
international automobile federation _ and unofficially, the most
powerful man in the sport. According to Russell Hotten, author of
the book ``Formula One,'' Ecclestone oversees everything from site
selection to hotdog-stand location.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, Ecclestone needed all the power he could muster
because the sport was a mess. Cheating was rampant. One creative
team attached a bottle full of water to the chassis to meet the
minimum weight requirement, then punctured it during the race to
make the car lighter. And Formula One had no process to handle
violations It was not uncommon for teams to skip races.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Ecclestone claimed for himself the power to negotiate
Formula One contracts on appearance fees and television rights,
ending the era of every team for itself. Now Formula One has a
consistent schedule of 17 races, all two weeks apart, and all 11
teams have committed to running two cars in every race for the next
10 years, assuring future stability and bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Ecclestone invested $18 million for in-car cameras to give
viewers a better feel for the sport's speed. Although pit stops are
technically unnecessary, Ecclestone requires one per race because
television viewers like them.
</P>
<P>
   Hotten estimates the operating costs for a Formula One team are
$50 million to $100 million a year, with McLaren and Ferrari
putting up more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Forbes magazine ranked the driver Michael Schumacher
the world's fourth-richest sportsman, and in London, The Sunday
Times estimated Ecclestone was among the 20 wealthiest Britons.

 &HT;    Pros are dealing with a new hazard on the course these days _
unruly fans
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ When golfers step up to the 17th tee
today at The Players Championship, they'll be dealing with more
than the wind, water and sand. Add another natural hazard to the
game and to the famous island hole:
</P>
<P>
   The fans.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do they applaud good shots and quietly shake their
heads at bad ones. Now golf fans boo, jeer, harass, heckle and even
confront players as if this were a World Wrestling Federation card.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the price of success. Thanks in large part to Tiger
Woods' emergence, more fans have been introduced to the sport the
past few years, and these newcomers have brought along a different
code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Mark O'Meara, who got steamed Tuesday after his tee
shot at the 17th landed in the rough inches from the water and a
man in the gallery said, ``Good thing you can putt.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who has won 16 times on the PGA Tour, stopped and
wheeled around. ``Good thing I can what? Who said that?''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of other fans, O'Meara found the wise guy:
73-year-old Dan Breen. O'Meara motioned Breen onto the tee, then
handed him a 7-iron and a ball. Breen's shot never came close to
the green, landing in the water, much to the approval of the
roaring crowd.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara strode off to the green, then turned and smiled: ``Oh
yeah, good thing you can putt.''
</P>
<P>
   This exchange _ during a practice round _ says plenty about how
things have changed on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting fans who have never played the game before or
are just coming out to experience the game, to just come out and
throw a few back with their buddies,'' Woods said. ``Fridays are
the worst days, because a lot of the guys get off early with their
buddies. They come out and have a few (beers) and say a few things
they shouldn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   NO ONE'S SAFE
</P>
<P>
   No longer are their barbs reserved for their popular target,
Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who has been a favorite target of
American fans in the past because he often speaks his mind. In the
past few years, such marquee players as Woods, Greg Norman, David
Duval and Phil Mickelson have found themselves in ugly
confrontations with the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive fan behavior reached new heights _ or lows _ at recent
Ryder Cups, where patriotism mixed with alcohol has created an
explosive backdrop. But some players, such as Montgomerie, can
expect to hear abuse at any tournament.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Bay Hill Invitational in Orlando, tournament host
Arnold Palmer was so concerned about the threat of heckling to
Montgomerie that he paired himself with the Scot during the first
two rounds. There were no incidents, but Montgomerie was quick to
point out: ``This isn't September of an odd-numbered year,''
referring to when the Ryder Cup competition between the United
States and Europe is held.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie constantly sparred with fans at last year's Ryder
Cup near Boston. But he has tried a different approach when
problems arise on the course in regular events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rarely see me saying anything on a golf course now,
compared to what I did five years ago,'' he said. ``I've decided
that my caddie should take the flak, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie has had no major problems during past Players
Championships, but he said the par-3 17th has created difficulties
for players, partly because fans wager on which player will hit the
green or land in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie praised tournament officials this year for planting
a hedge and bushes behind the 17th tee to give players more room
from the gallery. But that won't stop some of the obnoxious fans
from yelling a little louder, and those are the ones PGA Tour
veteran John Cook said should be told to leave.
</P>
<P>
   'I RESPECT YOUR HOUSE'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our house,'' Cook said. ``We invite you into our
house, you respect what we do. I go to your house, I respect your
house.''
</P>
<P>
   It's common for athletes to be heckled in other sports, but
golfers say the nature of their work makes confrontation hard to
handle. There's no way to get rid of the built-up anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other sports if you have a problem with a fan, your
adrenaline is already pumped up,'' said Lee Janzen, who won the
Players in 1995. ``In golf, if you get pumped up because of an
altercation with a fan, you have pretty much no chance of hitting
your next shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Players point out that fans who cross the line are a small
percentage of the gallery, but it only takes one. Just ask
O'Meara's 17th-hole critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lesson today,'' said Breen. ``When Mark O'Meara
hits a shot, don't say anything.''

REAL ESTATE: FROM CAN FACTORY TO APARTMENTS IN NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREA NEIGHBOURS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hoping to attract as tenants young professionals
who have been filling suburban apartment developments, a prominent
local developer is turning the landmarked American Can Factory in
the heart of the city into an upscale residential complex with
supporting retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The project, with 265 apartments and at least nine retail
establishments planned, speaks to the potential that developers see
in some declining urban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned for the last 13 years, the federally designated
historic complex and brownfields site reflects the decay affecting
parts of the Mid-City area. In 1989, a fire destroyed all but the
exterior walls of one of its six buildings. Canning operations
dating to 1906 have left lead and asbestos on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Upper-middle-class communities flank the project on the north
and west, with low-income and middle-class neighborhoods on the
east and south.
</P>
<P>
   The American Can Factory ``is a building crying out for what
we're doing and a neighborhood crying out,'' said Pres Kabakoff,
co-chairman of Historic Restoration Inc., the developer. ``It's a
symbol of either the success or the demise of the neighborhood,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kabakoff expects to repeat with American Can the success of
earlier factory renovations like the Cotton Mill Apartments, which
he developed as an anchor for the New Orleans Warehouse District, a
once-blighted neighborhood now thriving with art galleries and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   American Can's lofts and one-, two- and three-bedroom units will
range from 1,050 to 1,450 square feet. A one-bedroom unit will rent
for $900 a month, with two bedrooms at $1,250 and three bedrooms at
$1,500. A subsidized one-bedroom unit will rent for $450.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 444,000 square feet of space to be renovated sits on
7.1 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The new apartments complement the residential flavor of
Mid-City. American Can is within a mile of the central business
district, New Orleans City Park, the New Orleans Museum of Art and
the Fair Grounds Race Course, where the annual jazz and heritage
festival rocks the city each spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-City is experiencing a resurgence in residential interest.
The number of home sales has increased on average by 2.8 percent
annually over the last seven years, according to Historic
Restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Can gives people the opportunity to move back to
town, to live in a building with character in a true diverse
neighborhood without a commute, and you're two minutes from the
Interstate,'' said Conrad Abadie, president of the Faubourg St.
John Neighborhood Association, one of several Mid-City groups.
</P>
<P>
   Abadie's group worked with the city's Historic Districts and
Landmarks Commission to preserve the buildings for residential
development and to block proposals that would have torn down the
buildings to make room for a big-box retailer like Wal-Mart.
Construction of the factory dates from 1906 to 1929, with the
earliest buildings using bricks and a timber frame, and later
additions using a brick-on-concrete technique.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the renovation will be to protect the architectural
integrity of the buildings, said Kelly Nicklas, the project's
architect. ``The buildings themselves will dictate the layout of
the units,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Architects will carve out the units around existing pillars,
trying to incorporate the cement or long-leaf pine pillars as a
visual element in as many apartments as possible.
</P>
<P>
   American Can relied on some 1,200 industrial-strength windows,
many with bays measuring 18 feet long by 10 feet high, to ventilate
the factory, which was not air-conditioned and which at its peak
employed 1,500 people and operated 24 hours a day. Taking advantage
of the views provided by these massive steel windows, the
developers have designed each unit to have at least one window per
room.
</P>
<P>
   All of the buildings maintain the traditional American Can
Factory look: clay red brick, white trim and pilasters, and
historic New Orleans weathered green window frames. Everything
previously painted will be painted again, while everything
unpainted will remain that way. Existing factory signage marking
the walls, including exit indications and load limitations for each
floor, will remain as permanent references to the buildings'
industrial past.
</P>
<P>
   From the front of the building, the Orleans Avenue side, the
complex's low facade will showcase the 19,000-square-foot
commercial component of the project. Historic Restoration's retail
plan calls for one anchor tenant _ a Blockbuster- or Starbucks-type
store that would draw a wide range of customers _ and seven or
eight additional tenants, which could include a neighborhood
restaurant, salon/spa, cleaner, bookshop and gardening operation.
</P>
<P>
   Parking was expanded from the typical 1.2 spaces per unit to 1.8
after pressure from Abadie's group. Ultimately room for 450 cars
was made through interior garage facilities and outside spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Boettner, Kabakoff''s co-chairman at Historic Restoration,
described prospective tenants as young professionals and
empty-nesters. Such tenants, Boettner said, would be willing to pay
approximately 15 percent more in rent than they would at a suburban
complex to get the larger spaces, mid-city convenience and fine
finishes, including granite counter tops, that the complex will
offer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nick Silvy, a New Orleans native, is at the top of a growing
waiting list for the units. Silvy, a former homeowner, was
attracted by the convenient location and design of the apartments,
which he characterized as a blending of old and new. ``It's got the
high ceilings, natural materials, large spaces, wonderful outside
area,'' he said. ``You get the loft idea, but it doesn't feel as if
you're living in a warehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other builders had tried to develop the American Can
project but failed to come up with the necessary financing.
Kabakoff used public-private partnerships to finance the deal. His
first mortgage consists of $29 million in tax-exempt bonds from the
state of Louisiana's private activity bond cap program. The program
mandates that 20 percent of the housing units be set aside for
low-income renters.
</P>
<P>
   Additional financing includes a $6.5 million second mortgage
from the city of New Orleans, $7.5 million of equity capital
invested by Historic Restoration's investment partner, Housing
Horizons, a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corp., and a $500,000
federal brownfields grant. The brownfields program offers
incentives to find new uses for abandoned industrial sites with
mild environmental contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Zurawel, vice president of Citywide Testing and
Inspections Inc., an environmental consulting company hired to
resolve environmental concerns at the site, said that the American
Can site was cleaner than other sites in the city. ``There's not
much here in the ground or in the soil; what there is is lead or
asbestos,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Working under a new state voluntary clean-up program, Zurawel's
company has undertaken a $2.25 million effort to totally remove the
asbestos and remove or encapsulate all lead-based paints from the
buildings. The environmental remediation is well under way, and the
official ground-breaking date for the renovation is scheduled for
April 5. Historic Restoration plans to have tenants settled in by
fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kabakoff, New Orleans has been losing 10,000
residents a year for the last 25 years, which has shrunk its middle
class and its tax base.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mark Morial, noting that a wider variety of housing in the
suburbs contributed to this urban exodus, said that the recycling
of the old American Can plant ``gives us the medium-upscale rentals
that young professionals, young couples and artists can afford.''

   Unlike so many of its predecessors, the recently concluded 30th
running of the America's Cup _ won 5-0 by its defender, Team New
Zealand _ was a mostly straightforward event untarnished by the
familiar cup smorgasbord of underhanded motives, questionable
financial transactions and dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, in a number of articles published in
several New Zealand newspapers, a bizarre tale citing private
detectives, the possibility of Deep Throat-style informants and
intercepted phone conversations _ not to mention a healthy dose of
unsubstantiated allegation countered by outright denial _ has begun
to surface in the wake of the convincing Kiwi victory.
</P>
<P>
   And in yet another strange twist, at the epicenter of the quake
is an unlikely fledgling yachting writer: the Palm Beach
multimillionaire and 1992 cup winner, Bill Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all scurrilous, bloody innuendo,'' said Alan Sefton, a
Team New Zealand executive, in a telephone interview from Auckland
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sefton and the Team New Zealand chief, Peter Blake, are central
figures in a rambling article by Koch published in two New Zealand
business journals, The National Business Review and The
Independent, as well as in Scuttlebutt, an Internet sailing
newsletter published by Bayview Yacht Club, Detroit. In his
article, Koch calls for the winning syndicate to account for the
millions of dollars injected into what Sefton has acknowledged was
a charitable trust established to bankroll Team New Zealand's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What offends my sense of Midwestern values,'' Koch, a native
Kansan, said in an interview last week from Florida, ``is the
hypocrisy. When the Kiwis won the cup in 1995, they said they'd
clean it up and there'd be no mystery about the money. Now they say
it's no one's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If TNZ is a business, it looks like they've done an excellent
job. But if they're a charitable trust, they should use any profits
for charitable purposes and open their books to show where it was
spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sefton said Team New Zealand is an approved charitable trust
with tax-exempt status that is not required, under New Zealand law,
to disclose its financial records. And Sefton said they won't:
``We're sure our competitors would love to know where our campaign
priorities lie.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recent challenger trials and cup finals in Auckland,
Koch was everywhere. After failing to secure cup assignments from
some stateside television and newspaper outlets, Koch hired his own
television production crew and, at his own cost, filed about a
dozen segments with the New Zealand cup broadcaster, TV1. He also
contributed several articles to the country's largest newspaper,
The New Zealand Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find some way to participate without spending $70
million,'' said Koch, in reference to the budget for his '92
effort. ``I thought as a journalist I could look at it from a
unique, different viewpoint that would make for some interesting
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch also rode along as the unofficial 17th crewman for a day
aboard Paul Cayard's America One and Dennis Conner's Stars and
Stripes, and contributed $100,000 to each campaign. Angela Koch,
his wife, assumed the same role aboard Dawn Riley's America True,
and Riley received a $200,000 donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most people's scheme of things they were large
contributions,'' Koch said, ``but they weren't for the America's
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Koch's most recent written contribution, however, that
has created a stir. Koch said that he first offered his article
raising questions about Team New Zealand's fund-raising strategy to
The Herald and that they had agreed to publish it during the week
of March 13. Stephen Davis, the newspaper's editor, did not return
phone calls seeking comment on Koch's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, The National Business Review published an article
by Jock Anderson, a staff reporter, that included portions of a
transcript from an unauthorized taped phone conversation in which
Blake and Sefton, on a speaker phone at Team New Zealand
headquarters, apparently tried to dissuade The Herald's
corporate-affairs manager, Frances O'Sullivan, from publishing
Koch's article.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not running here,'' O'Sullivan is reported to have said
on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying article under the headline ``Blake Orders
Witchhunt for Deep Throat Informer,'' Anderson reported that Team
New Zealand had hired a security firm to check telephone records
and investigate the possibility that Koch had a source within the
team's camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Hill, news editor of The National Business Review,
said that the intercepted phone conversation was a fluke and that
Anderson, calling Sefton's office on an unrelated matter, got
through by dialing his cellular phone, which had been left on after
a previous conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on March 11, The Herald reported that Team New
Zealand's security personnel had confronted a local private
detective who said he had been retained by a California-based
detective agency to spy on the syndicate during the challenger's
finals and the America's Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Koch was informed that The Herald had rejected his
article. He then offered it to The Independent and The National
Business Review, which published the story on March 15 and 17,
respectively. Scuttlebutt published it on March 16. In it, Koch
tallies up published and estimated licensing and sponsorship income
from the regatta, which he put at $26 million, and expenses for the
event's administration, which he put at about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many in New Zealand believe that Koch's foray into
journalism is the first salvo in a renewed bid to challenge for the
cup in 2002. But Koch, with three children under age 4, said he's
through. ``My next cup is my family,'' he said.

<P>
   US Airways and its flight attendants union reached a tentative
agreement Saturday morning, more than three hours past a strike
deadline, preventing a shutdown of the United States' sixth-largest
airline that would have snarled tens of thousands of travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached shortly before 3:30 a.m. after a marathon
eight-day round of negotiations, was announced at a Washington
hotel, and when word went out to attendants gathered at vigils in
cities like Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C., the workers whooped
with joy.
</P>
<P>
   The accord gives the airline's 10,000 flight attendants a
substantial raise, which was one of the main demands of the
Association of Flight Attendants, while US Airways said the deal
helped advance its primary goal, to keep its costs competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the deal, Lynn Lenosky, the union's chief negotiator,
said, ``The contract is a five-year agreement flight attendants can
be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers with US Airways reservations expressed relief that
their trips would not be turned topsy-turvy by a shutdown during an
especially busy season, when many schools and colleges are on
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lotstein, who was at La Guardia Airport in New York at 8
a.m. Saturday to fly to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for a golfing trip,
said: ``I am thrilled to be down here. We have been up all night
trying to find out what's happening. It's been a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the agreement would give the attendants a 5
percent cash bonus when the agreement is ratified and a 5 percent
raise when the contract is signed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the attendants will receive 2 percent raises 18
months into the contract, and additional 2 percent raises after 30
months and 42 months.
</P>
<P>
   Several flight attendants interviewed said they were pleased
that for the first time they would get special holiday pay. Under
the agreement, the attendants are to receive time and a half for
working New Year's Day, Memorial Day and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zack, a union spokesman, acknowledged that the agreement
contained some work-rule changes on complex issues like scheduling,
which the airline sought to increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline says it's cost-competitive,'' Zack said. ``That's
what we wanted to help them achieve. The flight attendants I've
spoken with say it's a very fair, very good agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual pay for the flight attendants ranges from $17,145 for
new attendants to a maximum of $36,918 for those with 14 or more
years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, US Airways said: ``The AFA leadership and the
company's management worked extremely hard to put in place an
agreement that works for our flight attendants and allows the
company to compete in the marketplace. We are very pleased that we
were able to do so and that there will be no interruption in
service or inconvenience for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to discuss details of the agreement
or what the company gained in the accord. In the days immediately
after a tentative agreement is reached, company officials often
hesitate to talk about what they gained for fear of angering union
members and thus making it harder to obtain ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The union's executive council now has to review the agreement
and decide whether to recommend it to the rank and file. If it
does, the flight attendants will be asked to vote on the accord,
with the entire ratification process expected to last up to 45
days.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening an unconventional strategy, the flight attendants
had said that if there was no agreement by 12:01 a.m. Saturday,
they would wreak havoc on the airline by disrupting 49 of the
airline's busiest routes. The airline has 2,200 flights a day
carrying 150,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of this strategy, called CHAOS, for Create Havoc
Around Our System, was to maximize disruption, while allowing most
flight attendants to continue working and drawing salaries. The
union said it would not disrupt every flight on those 49 routes but
would pick its spots, shutting them down on some days and letting
them fly on others.
</P>
<P>
   But airline officials responded with an unorthodox strategy of
their own, saying that if no agreement was reached by the strike
deadline, the airline would shut down its operations instead of
being whipsawed by the union's planned partial strike.
</P>
<P>
   A strike or a shutdown would have hurt the eastern third of the
nation most, because the airline has 36 percent of the region's
market and has hubs in Pittsburgh, Charlotte and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   David Castelveter, an airline spokesman, said operations had
returned to normal Saturday. ``Operations are going well,'' he
said. ``It's business as usual. We're operating a full schedule.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers holding reservations for Saturday's flights said
they had stayed up into the middle of the night to learn whether
their flights would depart.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Driver of Albany, N.Y., said she had called the airline's
800 telephone number every half-hour until 3:30 a.m., when the
recording informed her of the settlement. She was in a joyous mood
when she flew Saturday from Albany to Greensboro, N.C., to visit
friends.
</P>
<P>
   During a stopover in Charlotte, she said: ``I feel great. All my
plans were on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Galbreath, who was worried about her plans to fly
Saturday from Charlotte to her home in Little Rock, Ark., said she
was delighted that there was a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know if we'd be able to get back,'' she said
Saturday morning at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. ``I
got up at 4 o'clock, and the news was on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' last contract expired in 1996, and the
two sides have held sporadic negotiations since. But on March 17,
negotiators, led by Lenosky and the airline's chief executive,
Rakesh Gangwal, began meeting for intense negotiations at the
Wyndham Washington Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest W. Dubester, chairman of the National Mediation Board,
joined the talks to prod the two sides to resolve their dispute.
His board had ordered a 30-day cooling-off period that barred the
union from walking out until 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the middle of the week, we were pretty much going around
the clock,'' he said in an interview Saturday. ``We had different
folks together at different times. It's analogous to shuttle
diplomacy. Sometimes have a full negotiating committee, sometimes
just the top two people.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law gives President Clinton the power to order the
airline or the union to continue normal operations for 60 days, but
labor experts said he was not considering such an order, for fear
of angering the AFL-CIO in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said on Friday that they were briefing the
president on the talks, and on Friday night the White House issued
a statement saying that Clinton ``urges the two sides to stay at
the table and redouble their efforts to reach an agreement as soon
as possible. They owe that to each other and to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had pressured the union to accept a formula, known
as ``parity plus one,'' that had been agreed to by the company's 10
other unions, including the pilots, mechanics and ticket agents.
That formula would link the attendants' pay to that of their
counterparts at the nation's four largest airlines, plus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lenosky, the union negotiator, criticized that formula and
rallied attendants against it, insisting that it would reduce their
wages and benefits. After the agreement was reached, neither side
was calling the agreement a ``parity plus one'' formula; instead
the two sides were calling it a ``cost-competitive formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Pask, a flight attendant for two years, said Saturday at
the airport in Rochester, N.Y., that she was pleased by the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud to stand behind the people who had been doing
this for 30 and 40 years,'' Pask said. ``I'm glad we didn't have to
walk out, for the customers' sake, but it was important to keep
this a professional and serious career.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For one epic year, Bobby Valentine embraced Japanese
baseball, thinking he was importing his American ways. He wound up
realizing there are other ways to play this game.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the New York Mets has now returned to his other
baseball home, with all the exuberance of a child waking up on a
birthday. This week, Valentine is proudly leading his team on a
road trip that may be the next step toward a stronger bond between
the baseball continents. Saturday night at a news conference here,
Valentine, speaking in Japanese, said he was glad to be back.
</P>
<P>
   Monday and Tuesday, the Mets and the Chicago Cubs will play
alternate exhibitions against the Seibu Lions and the Yomiuri
Giants, and on Wednesday and Thursday, the Mets and the Cubs will
play regular-season games against each other. This will be the
first time a so-called major league game has ever been played
outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will be an ordeal for the players, some of whom are not
amused. Mark McGwire was so opposed to it that he blocked the
Cardinals from taking part, and has criticized the venture as being
driven by money. Valentine concedes that the Pacific Ocean will be
a major block to interleague play, but he said, ``Eventually
they'll have medicine to deal with jet lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the Americas are already linked in the fertile mind of
Valentine, the first American manager ever imported to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure lasted one year, 1995, but his love for Japan was
just beginning. He mingled. He questioned. He won. He lost. And he
brought things home with him.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent spring training in Florida, Valentine held what he
called ``shag-free practices,'' meaning his pitchers do not loll
around the outfield, shagging flies during batting practice. This
is a direct benefit of Valentine's year as the manager of the Lotte
Marines in the Chiba prefecture of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we get into the weight room or the video room,'' he said.
``We try to use the time more beneficially.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliche from Americans is that the Japanese place too much
stock in the 1,000-grounder workout that leaves players bowed and
bloody.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, people prepare as a group,'' Valentine said. ``Their
practices are very long, almost to the point of monotonous. I think
they do it to excess, but we were not practicing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Japan as a celebrity, having managed six years for
the Texas Rangers and one year with the Mets' Norfolk farm club. He
was a new link between the two continents in a sporting
relationship that began in 1867, when American merchants and
sailors brought the game here. In the second half of the 20th
century, the Japanese began hiring American players.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Yonamine, born in Hawaii of Japanese descent, played 13
years in Japan, spoke the language fluently, and managed the
Chunichi Dragons to a pennant in 1974. Joe Lutz, who had once
coached in Cleveland, managed the Hiroshima Carp briefly in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Don Blasingame, the veteran second baseman from the United
States, played three years with the Nankai Hawks of Osaka, stayed
to coach and manage them for over a decade, and in 1979-80 managed
the Hanshin Tigers. The popular Blazer tried to buck the system by
not overworking his pitchers and playing what he felt was a
consistent lineup, but he resigned after little more than a season.
</P>
<P>
   Never had Japan recruited a manager directly from the United
States until Valentine was courted by the management of Lotte, a
department-store empire with roots in Korea. The general manager
was Tatsuro Hirooka, a former star shortstop and championship
manager _ ``one of the first players to move into management, a
very proud man, impeccable dresser, from the old school,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine argued with umpires until he realized he was getting
nowhere, since he did not speak Japanese and also because a temper
is decidedly counterproductive in that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fit in in Japan,'' Valentine once said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He studied the language via a computer program, with the side
result of becoming hooked on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also noticed the way Japanese bunters do not waste motion by
squaring and pivoting but rather tap the ball from the more natural
batting stance. He has found resistance in teaching that technique
to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was fascinated by the rituals _ the organized
cheerleading sections, often organized by the corporations that own
the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear 10,000 strong, waving flags, doing the wave, blowing
trumpets, it's disconcerting at first,'' Valentine said. ``But it
is part of the game, it's part of the culture. They love sumo
wrestling, and now they have soccer, but for a long time baseball
was their only team sport, so they took parts of all our team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Lotte, they Americanized their game,'' Valentine
added. ``They got rid of the big, heavy drum. They would sing `Take
Me Out to the Ball Game' in the seventh inning, which was neat.
They had songs for the individual players. They made great puns on
the two languages. There was a guy named Iya Omura, so they would
sing `Old MacDonald Had a Farm' and they would chant `Iya-Iya-O.'
It was kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also had fun trying to personalize the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was riding the trains with the fans, talking to kids, all my
idle time out in public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles when he recalls the numerical approach, how in pregame
meetings his coaches would predict the score, saying it felt like a
6-1 game. To the American ear, that sounded impossible, given the
inconsistencies of pitching, but the coaches were serious.
</P>
<P>
   In Lotte, Valentine had a three-year contract to transform Chiba
Lotte from ``second-class citizens,'' but while the Marines
finished second behind Seibu in his first season, he and Hirooka
were already at odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hired me, he fired me, we had a falling out at the end,
regretfully,'' Valentine said the other day. ``It's the only
blemish on my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese baseball has stayed with him. He has gone back on
scouting and good-will missions and has been welcomed by Shigeo
Nagashima, the great third baseman who now manages the Yomiuri
Giants, the Yankees of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine questions the traditional view that the Japanese are
too small to hit for power. Also, competition has narrowed the
baseball gap between nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, if you were behind Nagashima with the Giants,
you stayed in the system forever,'' Valentine said of the Japanese
farm system. ``Now it's loosened up. As some Japanese players come
to the U.S., that develops more exceptional young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine praised unrelated players named Matsui: Kazuo, a
shortstop with Seibu ``who rivals Rey Ordonez in the field,'' and
Hideo, an outfielder with the Giants ``who hits for power and
average, the kind of player any manager would love.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we only had three non-Americans, the way they do, I believe
the Japanese league would be stronger than ours,'' Valentine said,
acknowledging the impact of Latin American stars like Sammy Sosa,
who will be a star attraction this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' manager does not foresee ``a true World Series'' in
the short run, but adds, ``What we are doing is the closest thing
to it _ two American teams playing two Japanese teams just before
the season, not just all-star teams. The real thing. I'm going to
play these games like World Series games.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, he plans to go out and mingle. Many players may
regard this expedition as a pain in their sleep cycle, but for
Bobby Valentine, this is a homecoming, deeply anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sleep on the plane home,'' he said.  &QL;

<P>
   PALM BEACH POST, Fla. _ For the next four days, NFL owners and
head coaches will gather at The Breakers hotel for the league's
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will open the meeting,'' NFL vice president Joe Browne said
proudly last week, ``with the backdrop of the 1999 season.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, for better and worse, quite a backdrop. Attendance
reached an all-time high, and TV ratings were up on three of four
networks. The product kept fans interested from the season's
opening kickoff to the very last play _ a touchdown-saving tackle
at the Georgia Dome to finish off what was instantly dubbed the
best Super Bowl ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Kurt Warner, the supermarket-stockboy-turned-MVP, stood at
midfield amid a shower of glittering confetti, praising God, family
and football, it appeared the NFL would head into the off-season
with a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later, the warm-and-fuzzy images of Warner
were pushed aside and replaced with cold-and-bloody reports from
the Cobalt Lounge in suburban Atlanta. Two men had been stabbed to
death. Three men would be arrested and charged with murder. One of
them was Ray Lewis _ a 24-year-old linebacker with the Baltimore
Ravens who led the NFL in tackles in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This is the backdrop that Wayne Huizenga, Jerry Jones and the
rest of the NFL owners will be standing in front of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Never has the NFL looked so good on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Never has it looked so bad off it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, front-page headlines proclaimed that crime
in Florida had hit a 28-year-low. Meanwhile, the sports section
included an update on former Dolphins running back Cecil Collins _
one of more than two dozen NFL players arrested since NFL owners
gathered in Phoenix last March.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessarily the numbers that are troubling, though. It
is the kind of crimes NFL players are being charged with. Battering
wives and girlfriends. Sexually assaulting strangers. Even plotting
to kill a pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis became the second active player in three months to be
charged with murder. In November, after police found Rae Carruth
hiding in the trunk of a car, they charged the Carolina Panthers
receiver of plotting the murder of Cherica Adams, his pregnant
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The result is, at the very least, a public relations nightmare.
Turn on talk radio and you hear hosts and fans joking about ``the
National Felony League.''
</P>
<P>
   Trace Armstrong, a Dolphins' defensive end and president of the
NFL Players Association, points to other headlines _ from Columbine
to Oklahoma City _ and says that violence is a problem in all of
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a problem germane to the NFL,'' Armstrong
said. ``I think when you look at the overall conduct of 1,600
players, it's very good. But certainly there are incidents that
have given the league a bit of a black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-THE-FIELD CONDUCT
</P>
<P>
   For years, NFL officials have reacted to questions about
off-the-field violence with a mix of defensiveness and denial. And
when asked during Super Bowl week about the fact that the rosters
of the two teams included 13 players with rap sheets, NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said: ``I think our track record is
better than society in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is true depends on whose statistics you use and how
you interpret them. Pros and Cons, a 1998 book about NFL players
and crime, said that 21 percent of the players in the NFL in 1996
and 1997 had been arrested for serious crimes at some time during
their lives. The NFL says that in 1999, only 29 of its nearly 2,000
players were arrested, down from 37 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the programs we have are working,'' said Harold
Henderson, the member of the league's executive management council
who is spearheading talks on off-the-field conduct. ``The numbers
are coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as Tagliabue and his staff argue that it's not as bad
as it looks, they realize that the league has a problem on its
hands _ one that is perhaps more challenging than drugs, gambling
or any previous issue the league has dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, two weeks after Lewis was charged with murder,
Tagliabue called his staff together and discussed the league's
response to off-the-field violence. Earlier this month, he and
Henderson met with players union head Gene Upshaw and several
current and former players in New York. Two weeks ago, the league
issued its first suspensions under a 3-year-old anti-crime policy.
And when the owners and head coaches gather in Palm Beach, one of
the items atop the agenda will be to discuss off-the-field conduct.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wednesday morning meeting, a gathering restricted to
head coaches and primary owners, Tagliabue has asked three coaches
_ Baltimore's Brian Billick, Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy and Seattle's
Mike Holmgren _ to bring three assistant coaches and lead a
discussion about off-the-field conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Christine M. Thrower, president and CEO of Women in Distress of
Broward County, which has the largest and oldest shelter for abused
women in Florida, greets this news with a mix of optimism and
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS
</P>
<P>
   For years, it was commonplace for the league to suspend a player
for doing something to his own body _ whether it was injecting
steroids or smoking marijuana _ yet it was unheard of for it to
punish a player for doing something to someone else's body.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the 1997 season, the NFL became the first league in
major U.S. sports to institute a policy that allowed for penalties
for off-the-field violence. It calls for mandatory psychological
evaluation for any player accused of a violent crime and fines and
suspensions for players convicted of or admitting to a violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, until earlier this month, no player had been suspended
under this policy. Even the eventual suspension of Carruth was done
under a more general policy for conduct the league deems
detrimental to its well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see the NFL talking about domestic violence;
maybe other leagues will take notice,'' Thrower said. ``But if
you're not using the rules, what good are they?''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials say other cases are under review and more
punishment could be on the way. And although there is a wide
variety of opinions on what should be done once an NFL player is
arrested, all agree that the ideal solution would be to find a way
to prevent it from happening in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, one must first figure out why it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not too hard,'' said Dr. Lauren Langman, a professor of
sociology at Loyola University in Chicago who has written several
papers about football. ``Football is not exactly chess. It's not
meant to be terribly cerebral. Basketball players are less likely
to be arrested for violent crimes. That's not to say it doesn't
happen. But it's less likely. Why? Their athletic prowess is based
on speed and agility.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone buys the violence-begets-violence theory.
Armstrong, the NFLPA president, calls it ``garbage.'' And Richard
Lapchick, director of the Center for the Study of Sports in Society
at Northeastern University, said: ``This is a society-wide problem.
... Violence has become a part of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but it has been a part of the NFL culture for quite a
while. It just was limited to what happened on the field. Or was
it?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Weinstein has been in the business of keeping tabs of NFL
players' off-the-field activities since 1973. He spent 12 years
doing security work for the league, then was hired by the Dolphins
to be the team's security investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things went on when I worked for the league back in the '70s
and '80s that never got reported,'' Weinstein said. ``Now it's kind
of hard for that to happen. Consequently, the perception's out
there that things are worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein insists they aren't. He says that, in a strange way,
the increase in headlines about domestic violence is a good sign _
it shows that it is being fought more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '70s or '80s, if someone hit their significant
other and she called the police, they would sometimes come over,
talk to the people and leave,'' he said. ``What happened was wrong.
It just wasn't considered a crime. It was a private matter. Nobody
got arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they did ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s, I went down to get a player out of jail on a
domestic violence charge,'' Weinstein said. ``When I saw the
girlfriend, I was embarrassed to get the guy out. I said, 'You've
got to be kidding me.' And she didn't want to prosecute. So they
ended up dropping it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although even today there is much dispute about statistics and
how they should be interpreted, everyone seems to agree on
something. The problems start long before players get to the NFL.
They often begin in impoverished backgrounds, places where the
game's future players are surrounded by examples of crime and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dolphins cornerback Troy Vincent, speaking to a group of
schoolchildren several years ago, recalled what it was like in his
Trenton, N.J., neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part of the community to beat your wife, your
girlfriend,'' he said. ``It was cool. When you'd leave home and go
to school, you'd hear some of the guys say, 'Man, I smacked my
girlfriend three times last night.' Then one of his friends gives
him a high-five. That was the way of life. And it wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent eventually severed ties with the childhood friends whom
he felt were a bad influence. Many other athletes have not _ and
these friendships create a sticky issue for the league.
</P>
<P>
   Can it tell players who they can and can't associate with?
</P>
<P>
   GOOD VIOLENCE, BAD VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   These days the NFL tries to help break the cycle of crime with
education. The league conducts a mandatory three-day symposium for
rookies in June at which, Weinstein said, topics range from
``something as innocent as how to handle yourself on a traffic
stop, to staying away from certain areas and, most importantly,
staying away from certain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, once the players hit the field, the NFL, whether
intentional or not, often gives them another message: Violence is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, then Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick Jauron
praised strong safety Donovin Darius, a first-round pick in 1998,
for bringing ``an element of violence'' to the defense. Darius
responded by saying: ``That's the highest compliment I can think
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, even the violence off the field is given approval.
</P>
<P>
   When the St. Louis Rams drafted Ryan Tucker, one of four Texas
Christian players who nearly beat a 21-year-old man to death
outside a bar, Rams coach Dick Vermeil joked: ``He can finish a
fight; that's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   This leads to another problem with cutting down crime among NFL
players. The league can talk all it wants about an improved
screening process for identifying ``at-risk'' players before they
get in the league. But will teams steer away from those players? If
the player can run 40 yards fast enough or bench-press 300 pounds
enough times, will they even care if there is the potential for
problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really what has changed in the last 10 years is that teams are
taking more chances,'' one veteran NFL player said. ``There are
guys being drafted now that teams wouldn't have drafted in the
past. Look at what Jimmy did.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about former Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson. During
four seasons in Miami, Johnson signed running back Lawrence
Phillips and receiver Lamar Thomas, two players with long histories
of domestic abuse; drafted Collins, a player who was arrested twice
during his brief college career for breaking into women's
apartments; claimed Tony Martin, a receiver who was released by the
Atlanta Falcons after being indicted on federal drug money
laundering charges; and signed Dimitrius Underwood, a defensive end
who had disappeared from the Minnesota Vikings camp.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Johnson gave an identical reason for the signing. ``I
think he can be a player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Thomas and Martin, who was acquitted after a trial that
featured courthouse appearances by Johnson and Dan Marino, remain
on the team. Phillips was arrested in a Plantation bar and charged
with battery of a woman who wouldn't dance with him. Underwood
attempted suicide during the team's bye week last season. And
Collins was arrested after police say he jumped through a window of
a women's apartment. All three eventually were cut by the team, but
some players believe the off-the-field problems took their toll not
only on the team's image but its performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Newman, who played offensive line for the Dolphins for 13
years and is now a criminal judge in Miami-Dade County, agrees with
NFL officials who say that the majority of today's players are
good, law-abiding citizens. But he wants to see the league come
down harder on those who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to pull out the few bad apples,'' he said. ``The
league has the responsibility to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it? This much is certain: When the owners come to Palm
Beach, they will be aware that others perceive they have a problem.
And at least some of them agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have this type of thing,'' Kansas City Chiefs owner
Lamar Hunt said recently. ``We must find a way to stop it.''

NO PLAYING HOOKY FOR TROUT OPENER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state's trout season April 1 opener falls on a Saturday
this year, sparing young and not-so-young anglers alike the
awkwardness of having to play hooky from school or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is always risky to predict opening-day stream conditions, and
this year is particularly challenging. Mild weather during the
first few days of March seemed to presage a truly auspicious early
season, as did the winter of 1999-2000, during which there were
only three weeks of bitter cold in the Northeast. The past three
winters in the United States set records for warmth. But before
mid-March this year, a lot of rain fell in the state, and in the
Catskills, streams were close to overflowing. This was followed by
a stretch of cold weather, more rain and some snow.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, barring a blizzard or torrential rain on April 1,
opening-day devotees are going to sally forth no matter what the
weather or water levels. For them, the ritual is not to be missed.
It is a long-anticipated escape from winter's grim embrace, and
this year there are indications that they will find many waters
quite fishable. One fly-fishing expert, Ed Van Put of Livingston
Manor, N.Y., said recently: ``It looks promising on the Beaverkill
and Willowemoc. The streams are high but clear, and there are only
patches of snow in the headwaters of the Beaverkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Put, who is a wildlife technician with the state's
Department of Environmental Conservation, also notes that the mild
winter augurs well for the denizens of the streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beaverkill and Willowemoc froze over only once this past
winter in late January, and iceout was a relatively gentle event,''
Van Put said. There was relatively little scouring of the stream
bottoms by ice jams and uprooted trees. Such scouring destroys
aquatic insect life, a major source of food for trout.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day I talked to him, Van Put had seen anglers
fishing the no-kill section of the Willowemoc and added that
throughout the winter, whenever there was open water, anglers would
often be working that stretch or the two portions of the Beaverkill
that are similarly regulated. Fishing with flies or artificial
lures only is allowed there all year and all trout must be returned
to the water. During the regular season, the creel limit on the
remaining portions of many of those rivers is five trout, nine or
more inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Elliott, fisheries manager for the conservation
department's Region 3 (Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland,
Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties), says that stream conditions
are about normal for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the streams in his area, Elliott said, are going to get
an increase in the numbers of 2-year-old brown trout being stocked,
up from an annual quota of about 12,000 the last couple of years to
almost 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nice fish,'' he added, ``from about 12 to 15 inches
long.''
</P>
<P>
   During the previous two years, about 1,000 of those fish were
tagged and anglers were asked to report catching tagged fish. This
year's stocked trout will not be tagged, but the reporting proviso
for survivors of the previous years' releases holds.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pierce, a conservation department fisheries biologist who
watches over the branches of the Croton River, as well as the
Amawalk, happily reports that ``the city has completed, or nearly
completed, work on the Amawalk dam.'' A reservoir on the Amawalk
and two others on the aforementioned branches of the Croton are
part of New York City's far-flung water system.
</P>
<P>
   The work included construction of a water fountain below the
Amawalk dam that is intended to correct the oxygen deficiencies as
far as trout are concerned, which occasionally occurred in the
first half-mile of the river downstream from the dam.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Pierce said, ``in late summer, when dissolved
oxygen levels got low in the reservoir, the water was coming out of
the bottom of the dam nice and cold but was nearly devoid of
dissolved oxygen. The fountain should solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a fountain adds atmospheric oxygen to the water, similar to
what happens when wind-driven waves churn the surface of a lake, or
a river tumbles through precipitous rapids.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the West Branch of the Croton _ between Croton
Falls Reservoir and the stream's confluence with the East Branch of
the Croton _ retains its no-kill status this year, lures or flies
only, and regulations on the section of the East Branch from the
East Branch reservoir to the diverting reservoir, remain unchanged:
flies or lures only, open to fishing year-round, and a daily limit
of one trout, 14 or more inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island has three major trout streams, the Connetquot,
Nissequogue and Carman's River, which are almost always eminently
fishable. On Carman's, within Southaven Park, a section is set
aside for fly-fishing only and catch and release. Elsewhere the
daily limit is three trout, 9 inches long or more; and a daily fee
of $2 is required. The number for information is (516) 854-1414.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nissequogue, in Caleb Smith State Park, there are
four-hour daily sessions. Angling is limited to fly-fishing with
barbless hooks and the limit is two trout, minimum length 9 inches.
The fee is $15. Reservations, which are needed, can be obtained by
calling (516) 265-1054.
</P>
<P>
   Intrepid anglers are already flogging the Connetquot _ taking
advantage of its special no-kill, February to March,
fly-fishing-only season that ends April 1. On April 1, the regular
season, also limited to fly-fishing, begins. There are three daily
four-hour sessions ($15 each) and two trout of any size may be
kept. The number for reservations is (516) 581-1005.

REAL ESTATE: KEEPING MOSQUITOES AT BAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ill., Mass., Ark.)  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While mosquitoes are generally not a high-priority
item at this time of year _ in the New York City area, the insects
do not become active until late spring _ some recent announcements
by the city's Health Department may inspire homeowners to launch a
pre-emptive strike against the pests even before they take their
first flight.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, the Health Department reported that a study by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that
hibernating mosquitoes collected in Queens had low levels of the
West Nile virus genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   While no live viruses were recovered, officials said, the
discovery raises the possibility of a repeat of last year's
outbreak. The virus can cause encephalitis and meningitis. Seven
people died last year, and 62 others became seriously ill as a
result of being bitten by infected mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Though health officials have developed a surveillance and
control plan to prevent a repeat of last year's outbreak, there are
steps that homeowners can take to keep the number of new mosquitoes
at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be the time of year you expect to see
mosquitoes,'' said John Gadd, a spokesman for the Health
Department. ``But it's not too early for homeowners to start their
mosquito prevention efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pest control authorities say that the best way to reduce the
number of mosquitoes around a home is to remove any standing water.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Potter, an urban entomologist at the University of
Kentucky in Lexington, said that the kind of mosquito identified by
health officials as the carrier of the West Nile virus _ Culex
pipiens, the common household mosquito _ typically lays its eggs on
the surface of standing water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeowners often don't realize that there are a whole bunch of
places where water might be accumulating,'' Potter said, adding
that while it is unlikely there are any mosquitoes flying around
now, it is only a short time before egg-bearing females will take
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the conditions are right, they'll start laying
eggs,'' Potter said. ``And any eggs they lay will hatch in a matter
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the likely _ or perhaps unlikely _ places where eggs will
be laid, Potter said, are buckets, birdbaths, pool covers,
discarded tin cans, old tires, cisterns, recycling bins, inverted
trash-can tops, saucers for flowerpots, water that has collected on
top of pool covers and tarpaulins, and even small pockets on
children's toys. One of the most common breeding areas, he said, is
a leaf-clogged rain gutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosquitoes develop rapidly,'' Potter said, and they can go
from tiny water-bound wrigglers to flying, biting adults in as
little as one week. ``That means that a single neglected roof
gutter can produce hundreds of new mosquitoes each day,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But what can homeowners do if they have an ornamental pond or a
swampy area that is impossible to drain?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing to consider might be to stock the pond with mosquito
fish,'' Potter said, referring to fish called predacious minnows,
which are about an inch to an inch and a half long and dine quite
happily on mosquito larvae.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative, he said, is to treat the pond or swampy area
with a ``biorational'' insecticide that will kill mosquito larvae
while leaving pets, plants and people unharmed. Products that will
accomplish this, he said, include Bactimos, Vectobac and Altosid,
all of which can be bought from Clarke Mosquito Control Products in
Roselle, Ill., (800) 323-5727; and Mosquito Dunks, manufactured by
March Biological Control in Sherwood, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all essentially harmless to other aquatic organisms,''
Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ross, the owner of March Biological Control, said that
Mosquito Dunks are similar in size and shape to small doughnuts and
float on the surface of standing water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each dunk will treat 100 square feet of surface water for 30
days,'' Ross said, adding that the product will remain effective
for that period even if the area in which it has been placed _ a
swampy area, for example, or pools that may form along the banks of
a brook or stream _ dries up and then refloods.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito Dunks are sold in six-packs for about $8.25 and can be
bought from March Biological's Web site: www.marchbiological.com.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have not been able to eradicate mosquito larvae,
there are various products on the market that can be used on adult
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the products that can be purchased by consumers are
reasonably safe,'' said Timothy Deschamps, a member of the
executive board of the Northeastern Mosquito Control Association, a
nonprofit organization in Northborough, Mass. ``But be sure to
follow the label directions. More is not necessarily better, and if
you use too much, you could end up killing beneficial insects along
with the mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Deschamps recommends spraying around the bases of shrubs and
high plants because that is where mosquitoes are likely to rest
during the day. And since most mosquito sprays have little residual
effect, he said, it is typically necessary to find the mosquitoes
and make a frontal assault.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One product that does not work very well with mosquitoes,
Deschamps said, is the electronic bug zapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that a typical backyard bug zapper might get 1
percent of the mosquito population in a back yard,'' he said.
Instead, they attract harmless or beneficial insects like moths and
ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one zapperlike product now being marketed whose
manufacturer claims that its mosquito-killing power is considerably
increased by the use of heat and even carbon dioxide to lure its
prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our machine actually mimics the body temperatures of humans,
cattle and pets, all the things that mosquitoes like to bite,''
said Alvin Wilbanks, the president of Environmental Products and
Research in Blytheville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   And while the device may look to a human like an aluminum
wastebasket with a hat, Wilbanks said, it looks like a human to a
mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Chandler, the town treasurer of Pollard, Ark., said, the
town bought five of the gadgets last year and has bought five more
for this summer. ``The machines are being used as an alternative to
using airplanes to spray insecticide in public parks. They've
really done the job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology is not cheap: The basic Mosquito Killer unit
costs $399. A $120 addition that emits carbon dioxide, mimicking
exhaled breath, increases the kill rate, Wilbanks said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Unable to find enough workers in the booming
economy, American corporations are trying to expand the labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, employers had met their labor needs by hiring
people who were already employed or at least wanted to work. But as
this pool shrinks, they are increasingly recruiting from among the
36 million working-age people in the United States who had not
sought a job, or even thought about taking one.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Bell is one of these new workers. Bell, a college junior,
did not need a job. Living at home, he had enough pocket money, and
the first payments on his school loans were still in the future.
But when a notice went up on a school bulletin board that H&AMP;R Block
was hiring students skilled in computers to trouble-shoot problems
called in from Block offices around the country, Bell applied and
got one of the jobs. ``Most of my friends now work,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The company has gone out of its way to accommodate the
23-year-old student, juggling schedules so that he can carry four
courses at the DeVry Institute of Technology and still work 25
hours a week. Between semesters, he worked on Tuesdays, then
switched to Mondays to attend Tuesday classes. Nearly 200 other
students hired for the tax season get similar flexible treatment at
Block's new technical center here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to students like Bell, companies are stepping up
recruiting of the urban poor, retirees, housewives, men and women
mustering out of military service, the handicapped, women coming
off welfare, and illegal immigrants not already counted in the
labor force. People with jobs are being recruited to moonlight in
second jobs, and part-timers are adding hours more easily than in
the past. To get workers, some companies even relocate to pockets
of relatively high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting poster and the promise of flexible hours were
what landed Bell despite his mother's resistance. ``She does not
want me to work while I`m in school,'' he said. Aside from flexible
hours, companies are offering subsidized transportation, child
care, store discounts, free meals, family outings, tuition
subsidies and, in one case here, an $80,000 softball field _
everything, in sum, but significantly higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are in uncharted territory,'' said Lawrence Katz, a
Harvard University labor economist. ``The last time we had such
tight labor markets, in the 1960s, the baby boomers were beginning
to take jobs, and they fed the labor pool. We don't have them
today, and we really don't know how many people we can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy may ride, or fall, on the the answer. Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, argues that the pool of
people still available to take jobs has dwindled to the point that
employers will have to pay more in wages to compete for workers and
then will push up prices to cover the higher labor costs. Citing
this inflationary danger as one reason for their actions, the Fed's
policy-makers have moved interest rates up a quarter percentage
point five times since last June to slow the economy, with the
latest increase coming last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan's estimate of the number of people still available
for jobs relies on the Labor Department's monthly employment
surveys, which do not count as available the people who say they
are not interested in working. Many of these people are now being
recruited, including Bell, who was busy being a student until he
saw the H&AMP;R Block poster and popped into the labor force. In
addition, the Fed chairman's concerns about inflationary labor
shortages do not reflect the extent to which workers are settling
for intangible benefits, rather than higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly inflationary wage increases are not evident in
national wage statistics or in the Kansas City metropolitan area,
where the unemployment rate of 3.2 percent is nearly a percentage
point less than the nation's 4.1 percent and employers are offering
all the new lures, short of big raises.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case at Block's recently opened
technology center. A quarter of the 800 people working there in the
tax season are students like Bell, who is earning $11.54 an hour,
barely up from last year's rate. Another 200 are low-skilled
customer call-center operators, some of whom commute by municipal
bus from an impoverished neighborhood nearby. H&AMP;R Block has put the
new center, and its jobs, near enough for the operators to get to a
job, one that pays $8 to $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been pressured to raise wages because of the labor
shortage,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni, the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Even some officials in the Clinton administration, despite its
hands-off policy regarding the Federal Reserve, are challenging the
Fed's view that an inflationary labor shortage is developing.
Martin Bailey, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said, ``We don't see wage pressure coming from the labor
market at this time.'' More bluntly, the labor secretary, Alexis
Herman, declared in a recent interview: ``I tell everybody Alan
Greenspan is a wise man, and I don't comment on Fed policy. But
this is a balanced economy that can continue to perform at a very
solid and steady pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference lies in how the experts tally the number
of available workers. Herman counts at least 13 million people
across the nation available for jobs, including 3 million part-time
workers who have told surveyors from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
that they would take more hours if they could get them.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's more conservative estimate of 10 million people
available for jobs leaves out the part-timers. He focuses on the
nearly 6 million people who are listed as officially unemployed
because they are actively looking for work, as well as 4 million
others who tell the bureau's surveyors that they have not looked
for work lately but would like a job or might like one in the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's estimate of 10 million would-be workers has declined
from 13 million in January 1996. But both his estimate and Herman's
miss those who are not thinking about working but can be lured into
jobs. The great majority of them are the 36.3 million working-age
civilians who are busy in other activities and see themselves as
not available for work, unless, like Bell, a company's lures change
their mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City's poorest neighborhoods, the statistics miss
hundreds of families ``who don't respond to surveyors or answer the
door or any of that stuff, but want jobs,'' said Clyde McQueen,
president of the Full Employment Council.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The council is a publicly subsidized organization that tries to
get people in poor neighborhoods into jobs, mainly by training them
and then paying for transportation, including bus fare to H&AMP;R
Block's new center and similar job sites. ``The first thing people
here want to know,'' McQueen said, ``is what is the shift time,
does the bus get there and what happens if I have an emergency at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Kansas City is the sweep for new workers more on
display than at Station Casinos, a gaudy, Las Vegas-style hotel and
casino complex that is the biggest of the four casinos along the
Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos opened in 1997, and almost overnight 5,000 new jobs
appeared in greater Kansas City, a considerable impact on a work
force that then numbered 916,000 and now numbers more than 965,000.
The casinos initially bid up wages, offering low-skilled workers
$7.50 to $9 an hour. That drained people from other employers,
including customer call-center operators at Sprint, then earning
less than $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of folks to the casino boats,'' said Mary M.
Hogan, manager of Sprint's call center in suburban Lenexa, Kan.,
``but it is not an issue now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has raised its starting pay to $8.25 an hour. It has also
eased the wage pressure by employing more college students and
offering them nonwage benefits like flexible part-time schedules
and tuition subsidies of $5,250 a year if they stay at least that
long. Station Casinos, employing 2,120 people, has also
soft-pedaled wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more we compete on the whole package,'' said John V.
Finamore, president of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from health insurance, that package includes a child care
center, 10 percent discounts at local merchants, free meals once a
month served by executives, gifts at Christmas, a talent show for
employees and their families and, most recently, the softball
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are soft labor costs that are much more easily absorbed
than fixed wage increases and can be shed more easily,'' Finamore
said.
</P>
<P>
   To find workers, Station Casinos uses specialized employment
agencies that recruit immigrants from Latin America, Africa,
Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere. Ninety employees came out
of retirement and 270 others work at the casino as a second job,
often as weekend blackjack dealers earning $15 an hour, most of it
in tips. For a while, the casino's vans brought people from poor
neighborhoods to work in the hotel, but now a municipal bus _ known
as the Casino Cruiser _ makes the run every half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compete on wages,'' Finamore said. ``All you do is
raise the bar across the city.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration improperly forgave
hundreds of millions of dollars of debts owed to the government by
health-care providers for Medicare overpayments and allowed them to
continue billing Medicare for some of the questionable expenses,
federal investigators have found.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, from the General Accounting Office, said
Medicare officials had ignored their own rules and procedures in
negotiating secret deals to settle the debts _ the three largest
Medicare overpayment cases of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the deals involved health-care organizations in New York,
and the other was with the county health department in Los Angeles.
Medicare said it had overpaid the providers by $332 million. It
settled the cases for a total of $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had agreed to the
settlements as a way to help hospitals that serve large numbers of
poor people. In each case, the government and the health-care
provider agreed that the settlement would be kept secret. The
government said it wanted to avoid setting precedents that could be
invoked by Medicare providers in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements will be the subject of a hearing on Tuesday
before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed
by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who requested the review last May.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. received the
largest financial benefits in the deals. The corporation runs
public hospitals and clinics that treat 1.5 million New Yorkers a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their size and significance, investigators said, the
settlements were not reviewed or approved by any lawyer in the
federal government. Medicare rules require such reviews, the
accounting office said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report describing the deals, the General Accounting Office
said Medicare officials ``knew that the settlements were not in the
best interest of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials accepted payments of $25 million of the $155
million owed by the Health and Hospitals Corp.; $67 million of the
$98 million owed by the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, and $28
million of the $79.4 million owed by the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government settled these cases for 36 cents on the
dollar even though it could have collected much more, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spends over $200 billion a year to provide health care
to people who are elderly or disabled. Health-care providers have
many disputes with the government over Medicare payments, and they
often negotiate settlements or take their claims to an
administrative tribunal at the Department of Health and Human
Services. But these three cases were far bigger than any others,
and the settlement agreements were the only ones not shown to
health department lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Booth, director of financial services for Medicare, said
he feared that the ``deals would go up in smoke'' if he sought
approval from lawyers at the Justice Department or the Department
of Health and Human Services, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said the health-care providers had
used their ``political influence'' to short-circuit the normal
procedures for resolving disputes over Medicare reimbursement. It
said that top Medicare officials, including Bruce C. Vladeck, who
was head of the Health Care Financing Administration from 1993 to
1997, put pressure on subordinates to settle politically sensitive
cases after being contacted directly by health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office did not accuse the providers of
wrongdoing. It did criticize Medicare officials, saying they had
``acted improperly'' in accepting the settlements without proper
scrutiny. Federal officials generally need Justice Department
approval to settle or compromise any claim exceeding $100,000, the
GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Collins said: ``Lower-level Medicare
employees tried to sound the alarm. They protested the special
treatment given to these three providers. But their concerns were
ignored or suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of Health and Hospitals Corp.,
denied that it had received special treatment. He said the New York
hospitals were entitled to a much more generous settlement, based
on the services they provided Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this a sweetheart deal by any stretch of the
imagination,'' Marcos said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Anello, a lawyer for Vladeck, also defended the
settlements, saying that Vladeck had tried to make Medicare more
responsive to health-care providers and beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prompt resolution of these disputes ensured continued
health care for millions of poor people,'' Anello said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said: ``There was nothing wrong with the
settlements on the merits. There was something wrong with the
process _ how the settlements were reached.''
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office said the settlements were
``apparently unjustified'' and would not have been approved if
Medicare officials had followed the statutory criteria for
compromising government claims.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the accounting office said, the agreements should
have been reviewed by government lawyers, because Medicare
officials were ``relinquishing the government's right to recover
tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlements not only wiped out the health-care providers'
debts to the government but allowed them to be paid in the future
for some costs that would not otherwise be covered by Medicare, the
accounting office said. The disputed hospital charges included
bills left unpaid by patients.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare discovered the disputed charges in audits that covered
several years.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Booth, who has worked for the program since it started in 1966,
told investigators that the agreement with Health and Hospitals
Corp. ``allowed past poor practices to be carried into the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Booth told investigators that Vladeck, a former member of the
board of Health and Hospitals Corp., had urged him to ``move
faster'' in arranging a settlement. Booth said he replied that
speeding up the settlement process could cost the government $8
million to $10 million, but he said Vladeck told him that ``time
was more important than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Booth said, he did not consult any lawyers, because
they would have delayed the settlement, and such delays would have
displeased administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ohl, a federal Medicare official in California, expressed
``major concerns'' about the settlement with Los Angeles County,
saying it appeared to be ``a political action'' to circumvent
Medicare requirements. In an e-mail message to Medicare officials
in Washington, Ohl said, ``We believe this agreement is not in
Medicare's best interest,'' because it does not protect the
Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Visiting Nurse Service had, on the average,
billed Medicare for three times as much as the government allowed
for home-health-aide visits, and it justified such claims by saying
that patients tended to be sicker in New York than elsewhere. But
federal investigators said the nurse service never provided
evidence or data to support that contention.
</P>
<P>
   In carrying out its review, the General Accounting Office
examined 96 settlement agreements that Medicare officials
negotiated with health-care providers over the last decade. In each
case, Medicare asserted that the providers had been overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   In 93 of the cases, the General Accounting Office found nothing
illegal or improper. But it said the Health Care Financing
Administration had acted improperly in the three largest cases,
which accounted for two-thirds of the money at issue.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, said the agency had formed a ``work group'' to
analyze its debt-collection procedures.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Sig Rogich has such a reputation for buffing _ in
some cases salvaging _ the images of big-name Republicans that
former President Bush summoned him from a post as ambassador to
Iceland to try to rescue his re-election drive in 1992. Four years
earlier, Rogich had conceived the legendary Bush commercial that
featured a helmeted Michael Dukakis riding in a tank.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogich's prowess at crisis management is celebrated far
beyond the political world. Three years ago, Mike Tyson, the former
heavyweight champion, turned to him for public relations tutelage
after Tyson gnawed on Evander Holyfield's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hired me after he bit the guy,'' Rogich recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the chatter in Republican circles is that Gov. George W.
Bush, the party's presumptive presidential nominee, might turn to
Rogich, an advertising and public relations executive, for a
political reconditioning job. Even in victory, the Texas governor
is trying to add gloss to his image after his battering in the
primaries. In an interview on Friday in his Las Vegas office, with
a panoramic view of the hotels and casinos where he has been a
fixture for years, Rogich heaped praise on Bush. He said the White
House was the governor's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this master at stage managing politicians was not timid
about reviewing discouraging episodes in the Bush campaign that had
weakened the governor's public persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``In campaigns it's the little things that you've got to pay
attention to if you're going to be successful,'' said Rogich, who
counts the singer Wayne Newton as among his close friends and has
served as state boxing commissioner and once owned a slot machine
company. ``Churchill said, `Little things bring empires down.' I've
always believed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich prefaced his comments about the Bush operation by saying
repeatedly that he did not want to ``second guess'' the team in
Austin. Still, he suggested that had he been managing Bush's public
presentation, as he did with the elder Bush in the White House,
there would have been fewer lapses, and perhaps a crisper message.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly distressed by the Bush campaign's decision
early this month to allow the candidate to appear before millions
on David Letterman's show on a satellite hookup from St. Louis.
Bush drew devastating reviews for cracking second-rate jokes,
grinning nervously and looking downright mirthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never let the president go on a satellite,'' Rogich
said. ``It doesn't make sense. First of all, the audience is
clapping when you're standing so you don't respond to it because
you're delayed. When he's laughing because he has said something
funny, the audience is finished with the laugh. It's not smart. You
need to get on there in person, be part of the show, stand up and
do a high-five if that's what it calls for _ and sit down. You
never do the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Rogich is not tapped for a formal role _ Bush aides
insist there are no plans to hire him _ he already carries
significant influence with the Bush family: He checks in with
former President Bush every week or so. He said he got to know Gov.
Bush ``quite well'' during the 1988 campaign. And he does not
hesitate to dispense tips to the candidate directly or in e-mail
notes to the chief strategist, Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Rogich would not reveal what those pointers are. But he said the
Bush campaign needed to be more aggressive at defining the governor
_ and highlighting his most captivating qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George Bush that I knew was a fun guy to be around,'' he
said. ``He's got a nice sense of humor, a nice way about him and a
deep compassion. Now, they need to get on message. They need to
talk about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich made clear that he did not have much use for Bush's
``Reformer with Results'' slogan, which the campaign unveiled in
the wake of Sen. John McCain's upset in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably appropriate at the time,'' he said. ``I'm not
sure it stays in play.'' Picking his words carefully so not to
sound too dismissive, he said, ``Some of the themes we've done in
the past have a little more poetic side to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamenting the absence of the rallying cry of ``compassionate
conservatism'' that for so many months had been the Bush campaign's
signature, Rogich said: ``That's a terrific slogan. The word
compassion is something that is important in people's lives. You
could almost drop `conservative.' That's how good the word is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich also confessed that he was bewildered by Bush's failure
to be more magnanimous to McCain and his followers in a recent
interview with The New York Times in which the governor allowed
that he had learned no lessons from his vanquished rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to naturally reach out to bring your enemies, or
opponents, into the fold,'' he said. ``The smart candidates reach
out a little more. It's all about winning: At the end of the day,
there's a column that says, `Won' or `Lost.' I just would have
liked to have seen a little more harmony at the end of it. But
you've got to remember that McCain didn't reach out, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its imperfections, Rogich, who is 55, said the Bush
campaign should hardly feel desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a second expansive wave of talent that comes in
to take part,'' he said. ``So I think those problems take care of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was critical that the campaign broaden its inner
circle, explaining: ``This is not a training ground. This is the
big leagues. They've got six months now to put this package
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Might his services be part of that second wave? ``It's not
really something I'm thinking of doing,'' he said. ``But I'm going
to be there to help them in any way I can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Told that his name seems to keep resurfacing among Bush
loyalists, he said: ``I'm flattered. But they've done pretty well
without Sig.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rogich, hardly out of the picture, is keeping an especially
close eye on Vice President Al Gore. While Gore has provided ample
grist for damaging commercials from the Bush camp, he said there
was nothing as potent as Dukakis in a tank, an advertisement that
ridiculed the former Massachusetts governor and, many believe,
contributed to his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that they've made gaffes that I've seen per
se,'' Rogich said of the Gore camp. He said of Gore: ``I think he's
articulate. He's very smart. He's sincere. He's a little over the
top on certain issues but he comes at them from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogich said that unlike Bush, the vice president ``comes across
too cold and is tough to warm up to.'' Rogich does give Gore credit
for shedding his blue suits for casual apparel and favoring earth
tones. ``Changing the dress a little bit was a smart thing to do,''
he said. ``It just lightened him up.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the time President Bush was wearing an unsuitable
tie when he was about to address the House about the Persian Gulf
War: ``I said, `Take my tie!'''
</P>
<P>
   That blue tie is now framed at the entrance to Rogich's office.
There is also a note from President Bush about the tie: ``It just
sent the right message to Saddam Hussein. Thanks, Sig.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about doing something about the attire of the younger
Bush, who favors off-the-rack suits? ``Everybody keeps asking me
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the governor is really a product of the East Coast,
Rogich, who favors Italian suits and Hermes ties, added, ``Most
Eastern people do need a little help.''

   OSAKA, Japan _ In one of her first public acts as Japan's first
woman governor, Fusae Ota, weight 97 pounds, was to enter the ring
at the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday and bestow prizes on
competitors up to five times as hefty.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since 1953, it has fallen to the governor of Japan's
second-largest prefecture, a tough commercial region 250 miles
southwest of Tokyo, to award the prizes at the spring sumo
competition. But there has never been a woman governor before. And
so, just a month after taking office, Ota found herself battling
not just the sumo wrestlers' ban on women in their hallowed ring,
but the centuries of tradition that have accorded her sex a
distinctly second-class place in Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years of custom dictate that women may not enter the
dohyo, the 15-foot diameter ring of sandy clay in which the sumo
wrestlers grapple. At first, Ota aggressively challenged the rule.
Eventually, after a tense standoff with Akebono, the 500-pound
heavyweight of sumo wrestling's governing body, she backed down,
agreeing that her male deputy would present prizes in her place,
but vowing to pursue the matter again next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the advocates of equal opportunity, the affair was cause to
ponder just how far Japanese women have come, despite Ota's
election victory _ after her male predecessor was forced to step
aside over charges of sexually harassing a 21-year-old female
campaign worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all so elated over Governor Ota's victory, not only
because she was the first woman, but also because she was the best
qualified candidate for the job,'' said Kiyoko Yamanaka, a woman
who is a member of the Osaka prefecture's legislature. ``But this
sumo confrontation was like being splashed with a bucket of cold
water. We suddenly realized that basically nothing had changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of Japan's legislators are women, and the
country, which has the world's second-largest economy, ranks 140th
among all nations in terms of participation of women in politics,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Japan Sumo Association said that banning
women from entering the sumo ring had nothing to do with sexism but
rather was an age-old tradition that should be honored. Sumo's
ancient roots are entwined with Japan's indigenous Shinto religion
that detests defilement, especially death and blood. Sumo wrestlers
toss salt into the ring in a ritual meant to purify the ground at
the start of each match.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the sumo association is perfectly justified in
maintaining its own traditional culture at a time of constantly
changing views on values and history,'' Katsuo Tokitsukaze, the
association's chairman, told Ota, according to local news reports
of a telephone conversation in which he persuaded her not to press
her case. But Tokitsukaze left the door open for further
discussions, saying, ``It is also important to hear others'
opinions on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ota, a former senior official of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, declined to be interviewed for this article,
citing a busy schedule of budget meetings with the prefecture
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Yamanaka, who described herself as a feminist legislator, said
that the sumo association's tradition was problematic because it
perpetuated the notion in Japan that women were unclean and
therefore not as worthy as men.
</P>
<P>
   She cited other examples of traditions that have excluded women,
including one at Mount Ominesan in Nara prefecture, which for
religious reasons has been off-limits to women for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 female teachers climbed the mountain last year,
much to the consternation of local priests who said the women had
``trampled underfoot the faith of believers.'' The teachers union
later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   In a public opinion poll conducted recently by the newspaper
Asahi Shimbun, 47 percent of people surveyed said that Ota should
be allowed inside the ring, while 37 percent backed the sumo
association and the remainder were undecided. Forty-eight percent
of the men and 45 percent of women polled sided with the governor,
while 39 percent of men and 35 percent of women supported the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the stadium where the tournament is being held, sumo
fans voiced differing opinions on the issue. ``Tradition is often
difficult to explain, but no one is trying to hurt women or deprive
them of something by keeping them out of the ring,'' said Shigehiro
Yonezu, a businessman. But his daughter, Kiyo, 25, disagreed. ``No,
papa, you have to understand that this tradition was created by a
male-dominated society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a time when the popularity of sumo
wrestling is declining, especially among young Japanese, and the
sport's credibility has been damaged by charges of bout-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, there are empty seats at major sumo
tournaments, which have traditionally been sold out. Faced with
hard economic times, many Japanese are unwilling to shell out the
$50 needed for a decent seat.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings are also declining. More Japanese have come
to prefer baseball and soccer, and the $100 million-a-year sport
now faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Many people still recall an incident in 1991 that was a severe
blow to sumo's reputation. In grade school, boys and girls practice
sumo together. A 10-year-old girl became the champion in Tokushima
prefecture but a boy who came in second place was awarded the medal
and allowed to attend the national championship.

</P>
<P>
   At the sumo stables, where wrestlers rise every morning at the
crack of dawn to practice, there were no words of support for Ota's
effort to step inside the ring. ``I'm all for women's rights but
the dohyo is a place where only men fight and if a woman steps
inside I'm not going to wrestle there anymore,'' said Dejima, a
360-pound champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must understand that we've devoted our lives to these
traditions, which encompass so much more than just keeping women
out of the ring,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Makiya Saito, Ota's husband, said that his wife was very
surprised and upset over what he said was the sumo association's
narrow-mindedness. ``On the surface it seems like a ridiculous
issue, but it has big significance,'' Saito said. ``It shows just
how backward Japanese society is when it comes to women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Saito, who refers to himself as Japan's ``first husband,'' said
that since his wife's election, Japanese men keep asking him ``what
kind of man are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to tell Japanese men that I am secure enough in my
manhood to support my wife and fulfill my official duties as
husband to the governor,'' said Saito, who operates an optical lens
company.
</P>
<P>
   Norio Tsuboi, a popular television announcer, offered a comical
solution to the problem: ``We should strap the governor into a
harness that hangs from the ceiling of the stadium and gradually
lower her into the ring, stopping just before her feet touch the
ground.''

funeral of Patrick Dorismond, the unarmed son of Haitian immigrants
who was shot to death in a confrontation with New York City police,
on Saturday fired up both Haitian protest and pride. An angry crowd
burned an American flag draping his coffin and mourners clashed
with police in riot gear after a procession that began with Haiti's
national anthem. Demonstrators break through police barricades,

   (NYT17) NAZARETH, Israel -- March 25, 2000 -- POPE-2 -- Cheered
by a mixed local crowd of Muslims and Christians, Pope John Paul II
appeared for one moment to have erased the religious rifts in this
ancient city as he came to celebrate Mass in Nazareth on Saturday.
The pope's visit was seen primarily as a gesture toward Israel's
dwindling number of Christians, who once dominated Nazareth and the
Galilee region. Local Christians worry that they have become a
minority within a minority, now barely 10 percent of an otherwise
Islamic Arab population in a state that is five-sixths Jewish.

who was shot to death in a confrontation with New York City police,
was laid to rest on Saturday. Dorismond's coffin was carried across
Brooklyn and surrounded by some 15,000 anguished mourners and angry
protesters along the funeral route. Before and after the funeral,
several clashes between protesters and police took place. Family

with the overall theme of hunting and honoring family, the
Christian Sportsmen's Fellowship uses hunting and fishing
illustrations to convey the love of God in terms many men can
relate to. The fellowship, an evangelistic organization based in
Atlanta, has nearly 300 local affiliates in the United States.

with New York City police, in which he was unarmed, arrives at the
Holy Cross R.C. Church in Brooklyn on Saturday. The funeral
procession was surrounded by thousands of mourners who came out to
express both their grief and anger. At least four police officers
were injured and two people were arrested. Witnesses described
scenes of tense confrontation and tumult: bottles smashing on the
street, American flags burned and a rain of curses falling on
police and an absent Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. (Andrea Mohin/The

New York's La Guardia Airport. The accord gives the airline's

   (NYT7) SAMARA, Russia -- March 25, 2000 -- RUSSIA-VOICES --
Pollsters and analysts claim that Vladimir Putin, the 47-year-old
former KGB agent who took over as acting president of Russia last
New Year's Eve after just four months as prime minister, has
managed to remain remarkably popular precisely because he has
religiously shunned any one ideology. But almost a continent
westward, in the Volga River town of Samara, Boris Fursov, a
retired Soviet army officer who devoted much of his career to the
Cold War, says Putin's muscular submission of Chechnya is reason
enough by itself to deny him the presidency. ``In Soviet times,''
he says, ``maybe one man could impose order. In a democracy, it is
an entire nation's job.'' (Patrick E. Tyler/The New York Times)

 &HT;    Bonfire safety issues overlooked for traditionBy Mike Ward and
Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ For 40 years, Texas A&AMP;M University
officials knew that the Aggie bonfire was a dangerous and
potentially deadly project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hundreds of injuries and repeated written warnings of
safety threats, A&AMP;M administrators made preserving the bonfire as a
student-run activity paramount. Official action to deal with safety
issues often was short-lived and poorly enforced, sometimes because
of fear that changes to the revered tradition would upset students
and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last November, the incomplete, four-tier tower of logs
collapsed. Twelve people were killed and 27 were hurt. The tragedy
reverberated through the tight network of Aggies, who consider the
bonfire a powerful symbol of unity.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have insisted they had no reason to believe
that the bonfire would collapse. But many of more than 10,000 pages
of documents _ memos, letters, manuals and committee reports _ show
that chronic safety risks went uncorrected, partly because of
ineffective oversight by university officials. Preventing injuries,
identifying safety risks and eliminating those risks were largely
left to the students in charge of building the stack, the records
show.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have declined to discuss details of the
bonfire project, citing an ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In January, A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said he would resign if the
investigation determined that poor leadership or oversight by the
university contributed to the Nov. 18 collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member commission appointed by the university to
investigate the collapse is expected to release its report in early
May.
</P>
<P>
   Retired A&AMP;M professor Bill Stout, who co-chaired a 1990
committee that recommended shrinking the size of the bonfire,
already has an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my personal opinion, if they had followed the
recommendations, there's a good chance that 12 people would be
alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, working through a spokeswoman, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   WARNINGS WENT UNHEEDED
</P>
<P>
   In February 1960, an aide to the then-military school's
commandant wrote what now sounds like a prophetic warning about the
annual precursor to the Texas A&AMP;M-University of Texas football
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most dangerous parts of the operation is the actual
stacking of the logs on the bonfire itself,'' the aide wrote,
recommending that the height and size of the bonfire be limited.
``We in the Administration owe it to the students to do all we can
to help them construct a bonfire they will be proud of ... However,
we must keep control over them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, more warnings followed, but with little
effect:
</P>
<P>
   After the bonfire reached a record height in 1969 _ 109 feet, 10
inches _ university officials ordered future bonfires capped at 70
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, officials again capped the bonfire's height,
this time at 55 feet. They later acknowledged that bonfires
continued to be built too high.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, a recommendation to reduce the height to 45 feet _
mostly to keep flying embers from starting fires in surrounding
neighborhoods _ was dropped amid fears that shrinking the stack
would anger students and alums and damage the campus tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a committee of students and faculty members recommended
that the bonfire height be reduced to 44 feet to address safety,
academic and environmental concerns. Then-A&AMP;M President William
Mobley endorsed the change, but it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Texas Fire Chiefs Association executive director
tried to persuade A&AMP;M to build a bonfire out of wooden pallets,
saying such a stack would be ``less difficult to construct and more
structurally stable.'' The recommendation was not implemented.
</P>
<P>
   University officials tout a student-written safety manual as a
key to minimizing the risks of injury. They asked students to
review the bonfire-building operation and update the manual
annually to enhance safety.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the manual instructed students to build a bigger
fire than was allowed. The collapsed bonfire was headed toward 75
feet _ 20 feet higher than the 55-foot limit.
</P>
<P>
   And even though a faculty adviser has overseen the bonfire for
years, there is no evidence that the adviser was held accountable
for ensuring the university rules were enforced.
</P>
<P>
   A HUGE UNDERTAKING
</P>
<P>
   Putting on the bonfire is a giant undertaking for students,
particularly the so-called senior redpots and other student bonfire
leaders. Their responsibilities include raising money _ usually
tens of thousands of dollars _ lining up equipment, finding a
tree-cutting site, coordinating construction schedules and
enforcing safety rules. Most participants say the exercise has
taught them about leadership, teamwork and problem-solving.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Dollins, who was the 1990 student chair of the Bonfire
Advisory Committee, called the work the most important part of his
education at Texas A&AMP;M. At 20, he was in charge of 5,000 people who
worked at a remote location with chainsaws, axes and machetes,
oversaw the use of $1.2 million in equipment and managed a budget
of tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most 20-year-olds in the U.S. don't get that kind of business
background,'' Dollins said.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY OF INJURIES
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, hundreds of students, perhaps even thousands,
have been injured building the bonfire, most during the
tree-cutting phase.
</P>
<P>
   So many people were hurt in the early 1950s that officials one
year ordered all bonfire workers to don coveralls with ``Safety
First'' emblazoned across the back.
</P>
<P>
   Although injuries dropped, university officials still worried.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960 report to the commandant, officials recommended
limits on the height and size of the bonfire. A smaller fire, they
reasoned, would mean fewer logs to be cut, and fewer cuts would
mean fewer injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if the height of the centerpole is regulated and the
outrageously large logs not permitted to be used on the stack this
will, in effect, limit the size of the bonfire so that each class
will not be attempting to better last year's record,'' the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
   The stack reached 101 feet that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accidents during the construction are a problem and serious
injury or death could easily occur,'' another internal A&AMP;M report
warned in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire topped out at a record 109 feet, 10 inches in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, safety concerns were overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety in the stacking area is excellent and the danger
would not be lessened by reducing the height of the bonfire,'' a
March 1972 memo quotes J. Malon Southerland as saying during a
meeting on the issue. At the time, Southerland was the bonfire
adviser. He now is A&AMP;M's vice president for student services, and
the bonfire is among his responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974, amid lingering concerns, A&AMP;M Vice President John
Koldus decreed in a memo: ``The height of bonfire will be
controlled.'' He set the limit at 70 feet, but it proved
short-lived. In two years, the bonfire height was widely reported
to be 75 feet. There's no evidence in the documents that any
university official was held accountable for the lack of
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   EFFORTS TO IMPROVE IMAGE AND MANAGEABILITY
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire's height and safety remained hot issues in the
1980s. A faculty committee reporting to Koldus considered further
height limits because fewer and fewer students were showing up to
help build the bonfire. The ones who did skipped classes and
neglected homework, hurting their grades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, a student who had been drinking died after falling from
a tractor en route to a tree-cutting site, University officials
promised a crackdown on drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, drunken revelry was mentioned in local newspaper
accounts. Advertisements in the campus paper to recruit bonfire
workers for the cutting phase enticed: ``Bring your axe, your lunch
and your friends. Keg party Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   As flames leapt up the bonfire that year, the plywood outhouse
at its peak _ representing a UT fraternity house and symbolic of
the rivalry between the schools _ toppled from the log stack and
landed on a hard-hatted student. Miraculously, he was not seriously
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kibler became the university's bonfire adviser in 1983. He
later said in a memo to a colleague that he was ``shocked over how
`out of control' the program was in many respects'' when he took
over. He blamed a ``prevailing attitude of animosity, mistrust, and
belligerence'' between bonfire leadership and the university
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 memo, Kibler, now A&AMP;M's associate vice president for
student affairs, said that despite changes _ ``part of the overall
effort to improve the image and manageability of Bonfire'' _
problems lingered, including drunken revelry among the student
construction crews. As an example, he cited ``pot passing,'' the
annual ritual where the construction chiefs, known as senior
redpots, designate their successors by passing their hardhats,
called ``pots,'' to junior redpots, who have less experience than
senior redpots.
</P>
<P>
   Kibler described the tradition as ``a raucous nighttime event
involving excessive drinking, unsafe activity on the stack and
axe-handle beatings by the senior and junior redpots. This usually
took place before a crowd and so represents one of Bonfire's most
difficult image problems. ... It is imperative this year that this
activity be brought completely under control so that no violations
of university regulations take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his warning, drinking and horseplay on and around the
stack would continue to plague the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, neighbors and College Station officials were
lobbying the university to find a new home for the bonfire. At the
time, the bonfire was built on Duncan Field, an open space at the
south edge of the A&AMP;M campus that is within shouting distance of a
residential neighborhood and several university dorms and
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Eaton, a vice president for academic affairs and a
resident of the affected neighborhood, warned of the fire danger in
1986: ``As meaningful as this event is to our students, it is
really a tragedy that is poised and waiting to happen,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One report that year noted a ``perception by citizens and the
fire department that the university (students and administration)
does not care about the problems created by Bonfire.'' But another
warned of ``a backlash from students/former students'' if the site
were moved.
</P>
<P>
   In response to university president Frank Vandiver's request to
study relocating the bonfire, two vice presidents said in a
February 1986 memo that the bonfire adviser would enforce the
height limit and ``appropriate safety measures, both during the
cutting and stacking phases of construction.'' Although the pleas
to relocate the bonfire seemed compelling _ a dorm roof had caught
fire from the embers in 1972 _ tradition won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Aggie Bonfire is one of the most important
traditions at Texas A&AMP;M University,'' began the memo announcing the
decision not to move the bonfire 1986. It would be another decade
before university officials would move the bonfire to the Polo
Ground, a larger field at the northeast edge of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the very few tangible events that embodies the
Aggie Spirit, while emphasizing the importance of teamwork and
camaraderie,'' said Charles Cargill and John Koldus, the A&AMP;M vice
presidents. ``It should be retained as a viable tradition as long
as it is properly managed and controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Stiteler Jr., a university health and safety officer,
tried in the fall of 1986 to ``minimize accident potential''
related to the the bonfire and asked university officials to reduce
the height of the stack to 45 feet. But Kibler, now associate
director of student affairs, rejected the proposal. As Kibler
explained in a subsequent memo: ``The main objective of the
university is to minimize accident potential by making a reasonable
effort to control the hazards associated with Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC OUTCRY
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, criticism had reached fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, including clergy, were clamoring for the university
to bring the raucous behavior under control. Students, including a
group that called itself Aggies against Bonfire, also were up in
arms about the cutting and burning of thousands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   In response, two committees _ a faculty-student committee and a
Texas A&AMP;M regents' committee _ studied changes in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   None focused on the structural soundness of the log tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally and completely foreign to us that something
like this could happen,'' said Dollins, then the senior redpot
leader who served on the faculty-student committee.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty-student committee came closest to addressing the
structural issue, recommending yet further limits on the size of
the stack.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion was quickly endorsed by Koldus, then vice
president for student services; Kibler, by then associate director
of student affairs; and William Mobley, A&AMP;M's president at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   But the change would never come to pass. Within months, students
objected to the height reduction, and officials dropped the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Kibler declined comment. Koldus and Mobley could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The regents' committee, including Raul Fernandez, who now serves
on the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, former House
Speaker Billy Clayton and Houston attorney Ross Margraves, set as
its goal to assure that the bonfire ``will continue to be a safe,
sane, sober and orderly activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee had never met.
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY MANUALS
</P>
<P>
   The annual safety manual, which was to identify, evaluate and
control ``all hazards associated with the Aggie Bonfire ...
according to accepted safety engineering practice,'' focused mainly
on the safe use of chainsaws, axes and tractors. In the 1984
manual, the earliest one still in university files, the hazards
inherent with building the log pile are mentioned in one paragraph
_ without specifics on how to build the stack.
</P>
<P>
   Another section rated the risks associated with the stack
construction as relatively high. To minimize the risks, the manual
recommended allowing only experienced workers on the higher reaches
of the stack and having redpots continuously supervise every step.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1999 tragedy would later confirm, that was not followed.
Freshmen and sophomores were working on some of the highest tiers
of the stack when it fell.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire adviser was responsible for reviewing the safety
manual annually, but in a 1985 deposition, Kibler said he could not
``claim that I look at every letter and every word.''
</P>
<P>
   In some years, it contained incorrect information. For example,
since 1986, the circumference of the bonfire was supposed to have
been limited to 145 feet. But manuals in years since have listed
the limit as 150 and 195 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 memo, Kibler said he was enforcing the limits: ``I now
personally measure the height and diameter of the stack during its
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   When the log pile collapsed in November, it was 59 feet high and
headed to 75 feet. Its circumference was about 120 feet. Soon after
the collapse, bonfire adviser Rusty Thompson said he thought the
stack was 55 feet high. He has not elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   During the '90s, the university began offering a construction
sciences class to teach the student bonfire builders how to oversee
such a large construction project. An improved safety manual was
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Though a professor has said he helped draft diagrams and
specific plans to make the bonfire more structurally sound,
university officials say they have been unable to find any of them.
They have not said whether the plans were used in building the 1999
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those design changes, tradition was considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we tried to remember was design features were
incorporated without infringing on the spirit and tradition of
bonfire construction,'' former A&AMP;M professor Larry Grosse, who
helped develop the manual recalled in an e-mail to Kibler after
last November's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the changes, problems continued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the log stack buckled as it was under construction.
Because it did not fall suddenly, no one was hurt, and the bonfire
was torn down and rebuilt within a few days. Some credit the design
changes with keeping the log pile from falling. Others say the
near-collapse was another signal that was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, there are indications that many of design changes
were not adhered to in subsequent years. Scribbled in a diary kept
by one of the 1999 student bonfire leaders is this notation:
``Bonfire is never built the same way twice.'' Bill Stout, the
retired professor who co-chaired the student-faculty committee,
believes the recommendations from 1990 remain a worthy goal: save
the positive aspects of the bonfire, reduce the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bonfire needs to be stopped, ``said Stout, who
taught at A&AMP;M 18 years and donates regularly to A&AMP;M. ``It certainly
needs to be made smaller.''

IN CHELSEA PARK, ANOTHER JOLT TO BUMPY LIFE OF SOVIET DISSIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (Eliminates photo note) 
(jw) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some Soviet dissidents became international symbols
of human rights in the 1980s. Nikolai Tolstykh, like thousands of
others, served his political imprisonment in obscurity. Confined
for years in labor camps for anti-Soviet propaganda, Tolstykh was
nearly 40 and estranged from his wife and son by the time a thaw in
the Cold War cracked open his cell door and sent him to America.
</P>
<P>
   He had studied medicine, psychiatry and law in the Soviet Union.
But in New York City, where his name became Tolstich, his broken
English and bad health left him struggling in temporary jobs as a
home health aide. He was depressed, friends said, and he drank. In
late 1998, a decade after Mikhail Gorbachev ordered him freed,
Tolstich entered a Manhattan homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he still cut a professorial figure on Dec. 6,
when he sat down on a bench in a Chelsea park at noon in a light
rain. A thin, neatly dressed man of 51 with short hair and a
goatee, he had beside him a briefcase holding a Russian-English
dictionary, a book of philosophy and a few personal items,
including a hairbrush.
</P>
<P>
   But two New York City police officers had reason to suspect he
was homeless. His bench was one of a dozen in the park on Ninth
Avenue and 28th Street across from the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen,
where 1,000 homeless people eat daily. Sure enough, when the
officers demanded identification, Tolstich produced a homeless
shelter ID card.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstich said they ordered him to put his briefcase on the
ground, stood him against a tree, frisked him and searched his
pockets, according to an affidavit he signed on Dec. 29. Then they
issued him a summons for a violation _ ``obstructing park bench'' _
because he had the briefcase on it.
</P>
<P>
   This month, lawyers for the homeless added Tolstich's affidavit
and summons to a 1997 federal class-action lawsuit that has
challenged the constitutionality of the Giuliani administration's
crackdowns on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But Tolstich himself has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He was last seen at the 30th Street Men's Shelter in Manhattan
on Jan. 7 _ three days before his court date to contest the
violation. Letters from his elderly mother in St. Petersburg
collect at the social service agency where he received his mail.
And after fruitlessly searching the jails and shelter system, his
lawyer and Soviet emigres who know him say they are worried that
Tolstich may have found the revival of old fears unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, he wrote: ``I now associate that park not only
with the experience I had on Dec. 6, but also with my experience in
the Soviet Union. There, because it was a totalitarian state, the
police could treat anyone the way the police treated me on that
day. On Dec. 6, I felt treated like somebody in the Soviet Union,
because I am homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokesman, Lt. Stephen Biegel, would not
comment on the case because a judge has not ruled on it. But he
said that the police received many neighborhood complaints about
homeless people spreading belongings on park benches. Park
regulations prohibit the use of a bench in a way that interferes
with its availability.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the nonprofit Urban
Justice Center, who met Tolstich at the soup kitchen's legal
clinic, said that during the month Tolstich prepared his affidavit,
he was sober and reliable, keeping three appointments. The former
dissident, who studied in Leningrad at the prestigious Academy of
Arts and at the Medical Institute before being sent to hard labor
in prison camps, was in a workfare job at the time, records show,
cleaning doors on Wall Street in exchange for weekly relief of
$11.25 and $32 in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Lasdon said that he was thrilled to have a man with such a
history join the lawsuit. He told Tolstich the park bench violation
was likely to be dismissed, but warned that a failure to appear in
court would generate an arrest warrant. He noted that the police
had been raiding shelters to round up homeless people with
outstanding warrants. For now, no warrant has been issued for
Tolstich, because the clinic's lawyers have won three adjournments
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   To the fraying circle of former Soviet dissidents, Tolstich's
case is an emblem of how the post-Communist world has forgotten
their sacrifices. ``A lot of them have come to no good end,'' said
Edward Kline, the president of the Andrei Sakharov Foundation.
``They haven't found a place for themselves in the West and they
can't really go back _ they're unwanted in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Yarim-Agaev, a former dissident leader, said that young
Russians in both countries shook their heads at political activism
and asked, `` `Why would anybody do that instead of making money?'
Nobody in that generation remembers that there was even a Cold War
or Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it likely, as Tolstich's Jan. 10 court date drew near, that
memories of being locked up overwhelmed him? ``Of course, yes,
absolutely,'' said Yuri Fedorov, a veteran of Soviet political
imprisonment and president of the Gratitude Fund, a charity that
helps Soviet dissidents. ``He's not a very strong man,'' Fedorov
added. ``He used to be a very good man.''

 &UR; NEW YORK: good man. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Soviet exiles placed Tolstich's name on a list of
political prisoners, with only the barest facts of his case.
Veterans of those days read volumes between the lines of his entry:
1980-83, imprisoned under fabricated criminal charge. Arrested
spring 1985, Article 70. Publication of his works abroad. Tried
December 1985-January 1986. Political camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yarim-Agaev said that fabricated criminal charges were
especially commonplace in 1980, during a three-year campaign by the
KGB to eliminate dissent. After rounding up all the visible
activists, he said, the secret police arrested little-known
dissenters and put them with criminals. ``That is part of the
tragedy of Nikolai,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The works that got Tolstich in trouble are long forgotten _
probably articles in the Russian-language press of Europe, experts
say. But they were enough for charges under Article 70, which
outlawed ``anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.'' Pretrial
detention was harsh in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), whether in a
KGB prison known as ``the gray house,'' or in Kresty, the infamous
czarist-era fortress with punishment booths that only had room for
a man to stand.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction under Article 70 meant punishment in a political
labor camp, with even more severe physical conditions and limited
interaction with the outside world than in the criminal camp, said
Yarim-Agaev, who called it ``the second circle of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolstich was one of 200 political prisoners released by decree
of Gorbachev in late 1987, and among those expelled from the
country, his affidavit said. Within days of arriving in New York,
he came to the Center for Democracy in the USSR in Manhattan, which
Yarim-Agaev had founded in 1985. Later, Tolstich contributed
articles to various publications including Novoye Russkoye Slovo,
the major Russian language newspaper in New York, others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote a lot,'' Yarim-Agaev recalled. ``He was _ he is a
very cultivated and educated person, a person with humanitarian
inclinations.'' But adjustment to a foreign country was difficult
after years in a prison camp, he added. ``A person after that
hardly feels full of energy for new labors and new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dissidents had imagined that coming to America would feel
like coming home. Instead, they found what Catherine A.
Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International League for
Human Rights, calls ``a constant disconnect'' between their ideals
and reality. And when the Soviet Union collapsed into economic
chaos, gangsters and old KGB hands seemed to get rich and powerful
on U.S. aid, former dissidents said, while their kind slid into
impoverished irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Democracy was disbanded in 1991. For a few years,
Tolstich's acquaintances saw him at birthdays and funerals of their
old circle, but eventually lost track of him. By the mid-1990s, the
downward slope of his life steepened into a succession of unstable
living arrangements and short-lived jobs that he later listed for
his lawyer: mechanic's assistant, clerk, security guard.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, acquaintances said, Tolstich roomed in a squalid
ground floor apartment in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn with
Boris Khurgin, a newspaperman described by former colleagues as a
brilliant poet who drank himself to death at 48.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot summer night a week after Khurgin's death in 1995, a
colleague was sent to their apartment to look for poems to save.
What he found was a wake without end in two tiny, barely furnished
rooms where several men sat half-naked, sweating and drinking vodka
with ``terrible, bluish faces.'' One was Tolstich.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, Tolstich briefly entered the city's shelter
system for the first time, returning in late 1998, Department of
Homeless Shelter records show. But last year, when Fedorov
encountered him again, he was pulling his life together. He said he
had been living for months at the 30th Street shelter and attending
an alcohol treatment and counseling program for Russian immigrants
run by the Educational Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he quit the drinking and tried to find a job,''
Fedorov said. ``It was true. I asked him, `Why didn't you call me
when you had a problem with this?' But he said, `I was ashamed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov last saw him on Dec. 28, at a nursing home where they
visited another former political prisoner, who was dying of cancer
at 58. Friends say that they believe that Tolstich was shaken by
that man's death a few days later, and that it might have
contributed to his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, a few worn-looking men rested in the part
of Chelsea Park where the police had stopped Tolstich. There is a
small patch of asphalt surrounding a World War I memorial to ``the
soldiers and sailors of Chelsea.'' The site of the former
dissident's humiliation resonated with some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dissidents are like soldiers,'' Yarim-Agaev said. ``They're
veterans of the war for human rights. Even Nikolai, I would not
consider a failure _ he has already won his struggle. He deserved
to live decently the rest of his life for what he already
accomplished.''

A GET-OUT-THE-VOTE CAMPAIGN, MOSCOW STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With one last little trick in a campaign full of them,
the Kremlin on Saturday tackled the one thing that can stop
Vladimir V. Putin from winning Sunday's presidential vote outright:
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether Putin will win a four-year term in
the Kremlin, but when he'll win it. Polls put Putin's support at
about 50 percent. He needs to exceed that figure in Sunday's first
round to avoid a runoff election next month with the runner-up, who
is most likely to be the Communist, Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   A low turnout Sunday could hurt Putin's chances of an instant
victory, and even invalidate the ballot if it falls below 50
percent of Russia's 108 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, state-run Russian public television subtly urged
people to vote while appearing to remind them to set their clocks
ahead one hour Saturday night, thus skirting campaign rules about
politicking on the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' intoned a voice in the ad. ``On March 26 a new
time will begin in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the latest thinly veiled effort to support Putin in
a race where just about everyone _ including some of the
contestants _ seems to be trying to maximize his chances for a
first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has dominated Russian politics since he took power after
President Boris N. Yeltsin resigned on New Year's Eve, so much so
that he has eschewed campaign advertisements and avoided televised
debates with his rivals. Instead, his ``working trips'' have
brought him daily, favorable coverage from the state-run national
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Most other media have joined the Putin bandwagon, making it easy
for the front-runner to stay above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, none of Putin's rivals appear to be trying hard to defeat
him. Neither Zyuganov, who is running second in most polls with
about 20 percent, or the liberal, Grigory Yavlinsky, who is in
third place with 7 percent, has tried to stir up support with
rallies or noisy public appearances. Zyuganov has avoided attacking
Putin altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of other contenders have raised suspicions that
they are running as part of a Kremlin ploy to weaken Zyuganov's and
Yavlinsky's chances. In fact, Aman Tuleyev, the Communist governor
of the Kemorovo province in Siberia, has endorsed Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Ella Pamfilova, a former Cabinet minister, contributed to
suspicions that her campaign had been conceived to take votes from
Yavlinsky when she launched a personal attack against him last
week. Among other things, Pamfilova asserted that Yavlinsky had
undergone plastic surgery, and questioned whether Russia needed
``Michael Jackson as its president.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova's outburst was part of a televised news broadcast that
contained several blatant attacks on Yavlinsky that played on the
anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia still present in parts of
Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as Kremlin officials realized that Putin's
chances of a first-round victory might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Putin, perhaps uneasy about his first-round
prospects, appealed for people to get out the vote. At the same
time, a poster from an ostensibly nonpartisan Committee for Honest
Elections went up in provincial cities, with a message to vote.
Because of a pun on Putin's name, any Russian might read the poster
as an appeal to support the acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Putin must win convincingly Sunday to decrease his
dependence on politically connected business moguls, who for years
have profited from their influence on government. Putin has
promised to crack down on these oligarchs, whom Russians blame for
many of the country's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most prominent oligarchs, Boris Berezovsky, who
holds a controlling stake in ORT television, hinted that Putin's
promise, like the campaign itself, was for show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the oligarchs must be distanced from the authorities.
That is normal, absolutely correct. But it is impossible to
achieve,'' Berezovsky told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. ``But
the words are right for the voters.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Unable to find enough workers in the booming
economy, American corporations are trying to expand the labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, employers had met their labor needs by hiring
people who were already employed or at least wanted to work. But as
this pool shrinks, they are increasingly recruiting from among the
36 million working-age people in the United States who had not
sought a job, or even thought about taking one.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Bell is one of these new workers. Bell, a college junior,
did not need a job. Living at home, he had enough pocket money, and
the first payments on his school loans were still in the future.
But when a notice went up on a school bulletin board that H&AMP;R Block
was hiring students skilled in computers to trouble-shoot problems
called in from Block offices around the country, Bell applied and
got one of the jobs. ``Most of my friends now work,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The company has gone out of its way to accommodate the
23-year-old student, juggling schedules so that he can carry four
courses at the DeVry Institute of Technology and still work 25
hours a week. Between semesters, he worked on Tuesdays, then
switched to Mondays to attend Tuesday classes. Nearly 200 other
students hired for the tax season get similar flexible treatment at
Block's new technical center here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to students like Bell, companies are stepping up
recruiting of the urban poor, retirees, housewives, men and women
mustering out of military service, the handicapped, women coming
off welfare, and illegal immigrants not already counted in the
labor force. People with jobs are being recruited to moonlight in
second jobs, and part-timers are adding hours more easily than in
the past. To get workers, some companies even relocate to pockets
of relatively high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting poster and the promise of flexible hours were
what landed Bell despite his mother's resistance. ``She does not
want me to work while I`m in school,'' he said. Aside from flexible
hours, companies are offering subsidized transportation, child
care, store discounts, free meals, family outings, tuition
subsidies and, in one case here, an $80,000 softball field _
everything, in sum, but significantly higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are in uncharted territory,'' said Lawrence Katz, a
Harvard University labor economist. ``The last time we had such
tight labor markets, in the 1960s, the baby boomers were beginning
to take jobs, and they fed the labor pool. We don't have them
today, and we really don't know how many people we can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy may ride, or fall, on the the answer. Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, argues that the pool of
people still available to take jobs has dwindled to the point that
employers will have to pay more in wages to compete for workers and
then will push up prices to cover the higher labor costs. Citing
this inflationary danger as one reason for their actions, the Fed's
policy-makers have moved interest rates up a quarter percentage
point five times since last June to slow the economy, with the
latest increase coming last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan's estimate of the number of people still available
for jobs relies on the Labor Department's monthly employment
surveys, which do not count as available the people who say they
are not interested in working. Many of these people are now being
recruited, including Bell, who was busy being a student until he
saw the H&AMP;R Block poster and popped into the labor force. In
addition, the Fed chairman's concerns about inflationary labor
shortages do not reflect the extent to which workers are settling
for intangible benefits, rather than higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly inflationary wage increases are not evident in
national wage statistics or in the Kansas City metropolitan area,
where the unemployment rate of 3.2 percent is nearly a percentage
point less than the nation's 4.1 percent and employers are offering
all the new lures, short of big raises.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case at Block's recently opened
technology center. A quarter of the 800 people working there in the
tax season are students like Bell, who is earning $11.54 an hour,
barely up from last year's rate. Another 200 are low-skilled
customer call-center operators, some of whom commute by municipal
bus from an impoverished neighborhood nearby. H&AMP;R Block has put the
new center, and its jobs, near enough for the operators to get to a
job, one that pays $8 to $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been pressured to raise wages because of the labor
shortage,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni, the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Even some officials in the Clinton administration, despite its
hands-off policy regarding the Federal Reserve, are challenging the
Fed's view that an inflationary labor shortage is developing.
Martin Bailey, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said, ``We don't see wage pressure coming from the labor
market at this time.'' More bluntly, the labor secretary, Alexis
Herman, declared in a recent interview: ``I tell everybody Alan
Greenspan is a wise man, and I don't comment on Fed policy. But
this is a balanced economy that can continue to perform at a very
solid and steady pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference lies in how the experts tally the number
of available workers. Herman counts at least 13 million people
across the nation available for jobs, including 3 million part-time
workers who have told surveyors from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
that they would take more hours if they could get them.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's more conservative estimate of 10 million people
available for jobs leaves out the part-timers. He focuses on the
nearly 6 million people who are listed as officially unemployed
because they are actively looking for work, as well as 4 million
others who tell the bureau's surveyors that they have not looked
for work lately but would like a job or might like one in the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's estimate of 10 million would-be workers has declined
from 13 million in January 1996. But both his estimate and Herman's
miss those who are not thinking about working but can be lured into
jobs. The great majority of them are the 36.3 million working-age
civilians who are busy in other activities and see themselves as
not available for work, unless, like Bell, a company's lures change
their mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City's poorest neighborhoods, the statistics miss
hundreds of families ``who don't respond to surveyors or answer the
door or any of that stuff, but want jobs,'' said Clyde McQueen,
president of the Full Employment Council.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The council is a publicly subsidized organization that tries to
get people in poor neighborhoods into jobs, mainly by training them
and then paying for transportation, including bus fare to H&AMP;R
Block's new center and similar job sites. ``The first thing people
here want to know,'' McQueen said, ``is what is the shift time,
does the bus get there and what happens if I have an emergency at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Kansas City is the sweep for new workers more on
display than at Station Casinos, a gaudy, Las Vegas-style hotel and
casino complex that is the biggest of the four casinos along the
Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos opened in 1997, and almost overnight 5,000 new jobs
appeared in greater Kansas City, a considerable impact on a work
force that then numbered 916,000 and now numbers more than 965,000.
The casinos initially bid up wages, offering low-skilled workers
$7.50 to $9 an hour. That drained people from other employers,
including customer call-center operators at Sprint, then earning
less than $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of folks to the casino boats,'' said Mary M.
Hogan, manager of Sprint's call center in suburban Lenexa, Kan.,
``but it is not an issue now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has raised its starting pay to $8.25 an hour. It has also
eased the wage pressure by employing more college students and
offering them nonwage benefits like flexible part-time schedules
and tuition subsidies of $5,250 a year if they stay at least that
long. Station Casinos, employing 2,120 people, has also
soft-pedaled wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more we compete on the whole package,'' said John V.
Finamore, president of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from health insurance, that package includes a child care
center, 10 percent discounts at local merchants, free meals once a
month served by executives, gifts at Christmas, a talent show for
employees and their families and, most recently, the softball
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are soft labor costs that are much more easily absorbed
than fixed wage increases and can be shed more easily,'' Finamore
said.
</P>
<P>
   To find workers, Station Casinos uses specialized employment
agencies that recruit immigrants from Latin America, Africa,
Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere. Ninety employees came out
of retirement and 270 others work at the casino as a second job,
often as weekend blackjack dealers earning $15 an hour, most of it
in tips. For a while, the casino's vans brought people from poor
neighborhoods to work in the hotel, but now a municipal bus _ known
as the Casino Cruiser _ makes the run every half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compete on wages,'' Finamore said. ``All you do is
raise the bar across the city.''

DRAMA, IF NOT OUTCOME, IN RUSSIA VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLYUCH ZHIZNI, Russia _ Barring a spectacular upset, Russian
voters Sunday will choose as their president a man they barely
know, one whose views on running the world's largest country remain
a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The acting president, Vladimir Putin, is the hands-down
favorite; his election has become a foregone conclusion. The event
is a huge milestone in Russia's 1,000-year history, the first
change in Kremlin leadership to take place by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   But if the outcome of the presidential election is clear, that
does not mean there is no drama.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense is about how this steely former KGB agent plans to
deal with the world's other nuclear superpower _ and with his own
people _ once he is armed with the popular mandate that a majority
vote would give him.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders, and undoubtedly some Russians, will be watching
for clues on whether Putin might steer Russia toward integration
with the rest of Europe or whether he might turn to Soviet-style
rule _ authoritarian and isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of other Russians _ teachers and mushroom vendors,
television salesmen and lion-tamers _ will also be watching. But
most will be thinking little about Putin's KGB past, his foreign
policy ideas, or his relative commitment to democratic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the heartland south of Moscow, voters from all walks of life
said last week that they long for a leader whom they can trust,
someone who can help drag their lives out of the circle of poverty,
corruption, and chaos that has characterized post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To assume that Putin is the answer to their problems is a leap
of faith, especially when his own connections to the ``oligarchs''
_ the business tycoons whom Russians blame for most of their
problems _ have hardly been dispelled.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters seem to realize that. These are people who have been
badly treated, time and again, by their leaders. Dozens of
interviews found that many of the Russians on Putin's bandwagon
appear to be reluctant riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not fooled,'' said Anna Lazareva, 72, who was selling
marinated mushrooms for the equivalent of a dollar a jar on a
roadside near Klyuch Zhizny, a farming settlement 250 miles south
of Moscow with a name _ it means ``Spring of Life'' _ that belies
the village's decrepit appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Putin is the favorite because he is the one we
see most often,'' Lazareva said.
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the way Putin has capitalized on the
popularity of his military campaign against rebels in Chechnya with
a blitzkrieg of tough-guy promotional stunts and straight-talking
promises, which are displayed nightly on three news networks.
</P>
<P>
   Polls put Putin's support at about 50 percent, more than double
that of the nearest of his 10 competitors, the Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   The only questions Sunday are whether the required 50 percent of
Russia's 108 million registered voters will turn out to make the
election valid, and whether Putin will get his victory right away
by gaining 50 percent of the vote, or whether he will get it in a
lopsided runoff contest with Zyuganov on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Whizzing around in jet fighters, promising to crack down on
corruption and make life better, Putin has captured the imagination
of Russians disenchanted by the last four years of the Yeltsin
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Boris Biryukov, one of Russia's most
renowned lion tamers. Biryukov nearly died the last time he was in
the cage five years ago, when one of his eight lions, realizing
that the aging trainer had lost a step, took a swipe at him. He
managed to fight the 350-pound beast to a standstill, and escaped
only slightly mauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin reminds me of the way I was with my lions,'' said
Biryukov, now the director of the circus in the regional capital of
Voronezh, 300 miles south of Moscow. ``When you go into that cage,
you have to show them who is boss or else they'll rip you apart.
Putin is like that. He knows how to turn the screws, and he'll help
us straighten out this mess. He's not afraid of lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a young lion snaked his paw out of his cage and made
a nasty slash in the jeans of a photographer standing too close.
Taking it in stride, Biryukov was marveling about how difficult it
must have been for Putin to fly in a spartan military jet,
something he has done twice in impromptu visits to military units
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The flights have made at least as much of an impression on
voters as Putin's visit March 18 to Voronezh. People seemed to draw
conclusions about how Putin would run Russia from the way he has
overseen the Chechen campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impressed me about Putin was his trip to Chechnya on New
Year's eve, when the rest of the country was getting drunk,'' said
Vera Avdeyeva, a geography teacher in the town of Khokol, 25 miles
west of Voronezh. ``He looks like someone who will be active, who
will make people care.''
</P>
<P>
   Khokol, like so many rural Russian towns, is a tangle of
rambling wooden huts, crumbling cinderblock apartments, and piles
of junk lying around rusting. Most of its food-processing factories
are unable to make payroll and probably should be bankrupt. (Only
one factory, Khokhol Sugar, has been declared officially
insolvent.) Like most of Russia, the town rarely finds the money to
pay its teachers their $35 a month salaries on time.
</P>
<P>
   Avdeyeva became a celebrity of sorts last year, after a Russian
television station did a story about how she had to donate blood to
get cash for a couple of hot dogs and margarine for her New Year's
meal. A Danish TV station picked up the story, and soon after,
Avdeyeva received a wire transfer of 150 Danish crowns (about $25
at the time) from a well-meaning Danish couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was very suspicious,'' Avdeyeva said as she shivered
last week in the unheated geography lab of Khokol's High School No.
1. ``The bank wanted to know why I was getting money from abroad.
It took them two days to sort out whether they could actually
release the money, even though there's nothing in the law that says
I can't have friends in Denmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Avdeyeva is counting on Putin to make laws in Russia work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might even help that he was in the KGB, from the point of
view of discipline and thoroughness,'' she said. ``I'm hoping he
turns out to be a decent man. Otherwise, there's no hope.'' But she
is not counting on things getting much better soon.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that impoverished people in Russia voted for the
Communists, but that is no longer necessarily the case. Perhaps
because Voronezh has a Communist governor, or perhaps because they
have been voting for Communists in parliamentary elections since
1993, people here see Zyuganov as a representative of the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``People voted for him, but he sits around in Moscow in
Parliament and nothing changes,'' said Sergei Lavrov, who was
selling television sets in Yelets, a small industrial city in the
heart of Russia's fertile Black Earth region, 200 miles south of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The television sets are made by a local factory that, like many
Russian enterprises, pays its workers in kind. Other employees in
Russia get paid in toilet seats, sex toys, and crystal vases, among
other things. Motorists occasionally stop to buy the televisions,
which are fitted to work in cars. Lavrov, a former factory worker,
makes 5 percent on each set he sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is not a market economy, this is something
primitive and fundamentally wrong,'' he said as he gazed at the
rusted metal garages, ripped military tents, and rickety lean-tos
where a dozen other television vendors sold the same sets. ``But I
don't know if anyone here thinks Putin will get around to fixing
our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was getting late at Klyuch Zhizny, and Anna Lazareva was
gathering her jars of mushrooms to take inside the one-story house
she shares with her son's family of seven and their dog, Mukhtar.
Her son, Anatoly, a farmer who gets paid in flour and feed from
what is left of the local collective farm, was explaining the
tragic story of the town's oddly beautiful name.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that a wealthy 19th-century merchant built a pond
for his sick wife and called it ``Spring of Life,'' because
spending time there miraculously made her feel better. In fact,
local historians say that the merchant was a cruel man who refused
to accept his son's marriage, driving the son and his wife to
commit suicide. The merchant then refused to take in his
grandchildren, and instead built an orphanage for them. To comfort
his wife, he built the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, Putin is a bit like that merchant,'' Anatoly
said. ``But we don't know if we're getting the one from the fairy
tale or the one from real life.''

LAKERS' BRYANT BLOSSOMING INTO STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is 21, and the world already is his stage as he blithely
dances through it with a gladness peculiar to his modest age.
</P>
<P>
   The aging process hasn't even begun to work its cruelties on
him, and he dashes around basketball courts throughout America in a
frenzied ballet of soaring leaps and acrobatic moves that excite
the multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just love basketball,'' he says. ``Want to be the best at it.
Will be the best at it. Only a matter of time. I'm learning all the
time. Getting better. But still got a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant smiles, and it's the contented, confident, knowing
smile of a youngster who is worth millions of dollars and who is on
the best team in the NBA and who is rapidly emerging as one of the
top performers in his industry.
</P>
<P>
   He is standing in front of his dressing cubicle in the Staples
Center locker room of the Los Angeles Lakers on a recent evening,
and I ask him what he does for enjoyment when he isn't playing
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that during the season basketball is my
total life,'' he says. ``I don't get away from it very often. Oh, I
do go see a movie once in a while. I usually go in after it starts,
and sit in the back. Don't want to cause any commotion. Just me
sitting in the back alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant is as eligible a bachelor as there is in Southern
California, but he doesn't go clubbing, doesn't pursue women and
doesn't engage in the temptations that are available in the garish
nights to athletes with such wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in L.A., I mostly stay home with my family and when
I'm on the road I mostly stay in my room,'' he says. ``I like
reading. I watch some TV. But my main priority now is basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has become uncommonly proficient at it in the past few
weeks as he has played with an unselfishness that was noticeably
missing in his game in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been a maturing process,'' says Bryant. ``I'm seeing
things now that I didn't in the past. Remember, when I was in high
school, I was called upon to do everything. And then, suddenly, I'm
in the pros, but I still have that same mentality. That's the only
way I ever knew how to play. I felt I had to do everything. It took
me time to learn that I don't have to do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 21, and he and Shaquille O'Neal have become the most
overwhelming force in basketball, The Combo, as O'Neal has dubbed
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's energy is unbelievable,'' says Jerry West. ``He's just
all over the floor when he's playing. There's a chance he can make
the all-defensive team this season. Not bad for a kid 21.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing well together,'' says O'Neal. ``I'm proud the
way Kobe has matured.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an almost overnight metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, Kobe Bryant still was taking too many
wayward shots that did nothing but anger his coach, Phil Jackson,
and his teammates, still was dribbling too often into traffic,
still was committing too many turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   He even was bawled out for his undisciplined antics by O'Neal
after a home game on Jan. 19 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   He constantly was being railed from the sidelines by Jackson,
and even was yanked out of several games as punishment by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But no more.
</P>
<P>
   He suddenly has turned into the Lakers' top passer, and even has
been the beneficiary of some extraordinary passes himself,
especially from O'Neal, since teammates have detected the dramatic
change in his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there was some frustration by teammates,'' says
Bryant. ``Listen, I was frustrated, too. I just want to win. I want
to do everything I can to help us to win. And, if it means me
passing more, I will. I don't mind that a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among the sporting pundits is that Kobe Bryant
could be duplicating the well-publicized accomplishments of
Toronto's Vince Carter if he weren't on a team that featured
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather be a one-man show like Vince Carter, or would
you rather play in the shadow of O'Neal?'' I ask Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' he says. ``I like it just the way it is. I'd much
rather be on a team that can win the NBA title. Winning is fun.
I'll have my time in the sun. Remember, I'm only 21. One day,
Shaquille O'Neal will be gone, and I'll still be here. And I'll
still be pretty young.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though Kobe Bryant is being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   You're not ignored in the NBA when you're averaging more than 22
points and making dazzling shots and passes that elicit applause
from the patrons and hand-slaps from teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time's on my side,'' he says. ``My goal still is to be the
best basketball player in the world, and I work to reaching that
goal every day. I'm learning more all the time. And I'm having a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 21, and it's all going his way, including time, his most
blessed ally. &QL;

CLINTON, IN PAKISTAN, TALKS OF INDIA PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD _ Ending his six-day visit to the South Asian region
that he recently dubbed ``the most dangerous place in the world,''
President Clinton stopped here briefly Saturday to speak frankly
with its new military leader and directly to its citizens, urging
an end to violence and a return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not,'' Clinton warned, ``there is a danger that
Pakistan will be even more isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has shown concern over the heightened
conflict between Pakistan and India over the disputed territory of
Kashmir, and about the possibility that the dispute could escalate
to involve nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of his remarks, from a 10-minute nationally televised
address to about 100 minutes of meetings with the military leader,
General Pervez Musharraf, was in striking contrast to his speeches
in India since Tuesday, all of which have emphasized the potential
of the Indian-US relationship. The statements on Pakistan seemed to
carry a threat of diminished or severed ties if Islamabad does not
do what the United States wants.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton will arrive in Geneva to meet President Hafez
al-Assad of Syria. Clinton has been a prominent force trying to
promote peace in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, and seemed
eager to add Kashmir, the disputed territory occupied by both India
and Pakistan that has been at the center of two of three
Indian-Pakistani wars since 1947, when the two countries were
created out of British colonial India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who slipped into Pakistan quietly, switching from Air
Force One to a small, unmarked jet to counter possible terrorists,
concluded his South Asian tour without visible progress on defusing
tensions between Pakistan and India, both of which have nuclear
weapons. He also was unable to win from Musharraf a timetable for a
restoration of democracy or a pledge to curb Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after Clinton left, Musharraf said he could
not agree to talks on Kashmir unless India took a series of
``reciprocal'' steps to ease the tensions. He also made it clear
that he had given no ground on the other issues of concern to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf appeared to place on Clinton the onus of preventing
the frictions over Kashmir from exploding into a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told you of my openness to meet anybody, anywhere and
at any time. And now it is up to him how he uses his influence to
initiate this process of dialogue,'' Musharraf said of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, said he empathized with Pakistanis'
frustrations over corruption and bad governance by Pakistan's two
previous, democratically elected governments. Warning that there is
little excuse to overthrow a bad but democratically elected
government, as Musharraf had done in a bloodless coup in October,
Clinton added: ``The answer to flawed democracy is not to end
democracy, but to improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also highlighted the faltering alliance between
Islamabad and Washington, a relationship that served US interests
well during the Cold War, when Pakistan was a buffer to communism
in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the partnership should be ``a force for tolerance
and understanding throughout the world.'' But, he said, the
military coup that suspended Pakistan's democracy last October
threatened to undermine that friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the absence of democracy makes it harder, not easier,
for people to move ahead,'' Clinton said. ``We share your
disappointment that previous democratic governments in Pakistan did
not do better for its citizens. But democracy cannot develop if it
is constantly uprooted before it has a chance to take hold.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of Clinton's visit was to press Musharraf to
set a timetable for national and provincial elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Musharraf, who calls himself Pakistan's chief executive,
reiterated that it would take time to create conditions for those
elections and noted that he had announced earlier in the week that
local council balloting would be held on a nonparty basis beginning
in December.

OPEC NATIONS GIVE NO SIGN THAT OIL FLOW WILL INCREASE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Despite unusually public pleas by the Clinton
administration for relief from high oil prices, there were few
signs of support for a big increase in oil production as ministers
from petroleum-exporting countries arrived here Saturday for
crucial meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is scheduled to consider an increase in output, members
of the 11-nation cartel remained divided and were girding for
grueling negotiations throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is too early to decide now,'' said Obaid bin Saif
al-Nasseri, the United Arab Emirates' oil minister, as he entered
his hotel early Saturday afternoon. ``We have not discussed all the
possibilities and all the options. My recommendation is to wait for
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the most important disagreements are between
Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two largest producers within OPEC. Saudi
officials have been pushing for an increase in production of
between 1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has repeatedly argued for much smaller increases, and its
position has hardened as oil prices have retreated from recent
highs of more than $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has also lashed out at the United States, where lawmakers
are pushing for sanctions against OPEC countries and where
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has lobbied OPEC countries in a
whirlwind tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC should not opt for a big increase under political
pressure,'' said Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh, on the
country's state radio before departing for Vienna Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that a rash increase could lead to a ``catastrophe,''
Zangeneh said OPEC nations ``must move with the market and seek
stability. We hope OPEC will make a decision based on economic
justifications, not political.''
</P>
<P>
   Even boosting production by one million to 1.5 million barrels a
day would not necessarily have much impact on oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the crucial question is whether the increase comes
on top of or merely substitutes for the cheating on oil quotas that
is already taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts estimate that OPEC countries and the four
nations that joined in the production cuts one year ago _ Mexico,
Russia, Oman and Norway _ are already overshooting their target of
23 million barrels a day by about 1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC leaders agree to increase quotas by 1.5 million barrels
but clamp down on cheating, the net effect would be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the increase comes on top of the current overproduction,
most analysts believe, the impact on oil prices will be modest and
the reduction in gasoline prices no more than a few pennies a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Verleger, a veteran oil economist at the Brattle Group in
Newport Beach, Calif., noted that inventories of crude oil have
declined to dangerous new lows at the same time as an acceleration
in global economic growth is expected to increase demand.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency, a research agency in Paris
financed by oil-consuming countries, has predicted that worldwide
demand for oil will climb by 4 million barrels a day, to 75 million
barrels, from now and December.
</P>
<P>
   If worldwide inventories are not restocked, Verleger argued,
consuming nations could find themselves under increasing pressure
to turn to Iraq. Iraq, which remains under U.N. sanctions, is
allowed to produce as much as it can under tight restrictions on
what it is supposed to spend the revenue on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't increase inventories now, we may need Iraq's oil
by Christmas,'' Verleger said.
</P>
<P>
   But even non-OPEC countries are extremely worried that any big
increase in production will send prices plunging back to the levels
of just one year ago _ $11 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Olav Akselsen, Norway's oil minister, politely rebuffed
Richardson on Thursday after meeting with him in Oslo, Norway.
Richardson has been traveling widely in recent weeks to urge
oil-rich nations to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging the need for some sort of increase,
Akselsen said Norway did not support rolling back all of the
production cuts that sent oil prices from a devastating nadir of
$11 a barrel to the current level of about $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total suspension of today's production regulations will have a
negative impact on the market and work against price stability,''
Akselsen said in Oslo on Thursday. ``Both too high and too low oil
prices will lead to more instability.''

A GET-OUT-THE-VOTE CAMPAIGN, MOSCOW STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects spelling in slug)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With one last little trick in a campaign full of them,
the Kremlin on Saturday tackled the one thing that can stop
Vladimir V. Putin from winning Sunday's presidential vote outright:
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether Putin will win a four-year term in
the Kremlin, but when he'll win it. Polls put Putin's support at
about 50 percent. He needs to exceed that figure in Sunday's first
round to avoid a runoff election next month with the runner-up, who
is most likely to be the Communist, Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   A low turnout Sunday could hurt Putin's chances of an instant
victory, and even invalidate the ballot if it falls below 50
percent of Russia's 108 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, state-run Russian public television subtly urged
people to vote while appearing to remind them to set their clocks
ahead one hour Saturday night, thus skirting campaign rules about
politicking on the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' intoned a voice in the ad. ``On March 26 a new
time will begin in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the latest thinly veiled effort to support Putin in
a race where just about everyone _ including some of the
contestants _ seems to be trying to maximize his chances for a
first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has dominated Russian politics since he took power after
President Boris N. Yeltsin resigned on New Year's Eve, so much so
that he has eschewed campaign advertisements and avoided televised
debates with his rivals. Instead, his ``working trips'' have
brought him daily, favorable coverage from the state-run national
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Most other media have joined the Putin bandwagon, making it easy
for the front-runner to stay above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, none of Putin's rivals appear to be trying hard to defeat
him. Neither Zyuganov, who is running second in most polls with
about 20 percent, or the liberal, Grigory Yavlinsky, who is in
third place with 7 percent, has tried to stir up support with
rallies or noisy public appearances. Zyuganov has avoided attacking
Putin altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of other contenders have raised suspicions that
they are running as part of a Kremlin ploy to weaken Zyuganov's and
Yavlinsky's chances. In fact, Aman Tuleyev, the Communist governor
of the Kemorovo province in Siberia, has endorsed Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Ella Pamfilova, a former Cabinet minister, contributed to
suspicions that her campaign had been conceived to take votes from
Yavlinsky when she launched a personal attack against him last
week. Among other things, Pamfilova asserted that Yavlinsky had
undergone plastic surgery, and questioned whether Russia needed
``Michael Jackson as its president.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova's outburst was part of a televised news broadcast that
contained several blatant attacks on Yavlinsky that played on the
anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia still present in parts of
Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as Kremlin officials realized that Putin's
chances of a first-round victory might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Putin, perhaps uneasy about his first-round
prospects, appealed for people to get out the vote. At the same
time, a poster from an ostensibly nonpartisan Committee for Honest
Elections went up in provincial cities, with a message to vote.
Because of a pun on Putin's name, any Russian might read the poster
as an appeal to support the acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Putin must win convincingly Sunday to decrease his
dependence on politically connected business moguls, who for years
have profited from their influence on government. Putin has
promised to crack down on these oligarchs, whom Russians blame for
many of the country's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most prominent oligarchs, Boris Berezovsky, who
holds a controlling stake in ORT television, hinted that Putin's
promise, like the campaign itself, was for show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the oligarchs must be distanced from the authorities.
That is normal, absolutely correct. But it is impossible to
achieve,'' Berezovsky told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. ``But
the words are right for the voters.''

PONTIFF VISITS TOWN OF JESUS' BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II retreated from the politics and
pageantry of his pilgrimage Saturday, seeking to turn his attention
to the personal side of his spiritual journey.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff began the day with quiet prayer and then a Mass in
Nazareth where the New Testament says an angel announced to Mary
that she would give birth to the Christ child.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary on the sixth day of his Holy Land tour, the
79-year-old pontiff ended the day with a twilight vigil in a garden
here on the Mount of Olives where Jesus is believed to have
agonized before his crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the pope prayed in silence at the stone in the Garden of
Gethsemane where Jesus contemplated his impending death, a new
controversy began festering.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a scheduled meeting with the pope, Jerusalem's
leading Muslim cleric told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that
Israel had exaggerated the death toll of the Holocaust to garner
international sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six million? It was a lot less,'' said Ikrima Sabri, the grand
mufti of the Al Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines. ``It's
not my fault if Hitler hated the Jews. Anyway, they hate them just
about everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The minimizing of the Jewish deaths, which flies in the face of
historians' consensus, was later repeated in interviews with The
Associated Press and provoked bitter responses in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy will probably cast a shadow over Sunday's plans
to end John Paul's trip with a strong interfaith message as he
visits Jerusalem's Old City and shrines sacred to Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   On his journey here the pope delivered a powerful and emotional
reflection on the evils of the Holocaust. More than any pope before
him, John Paul has devoted part of his 22-year papacy to fostering
better Catholic-Jewish relations and renouncing anti-Semitism of
church followers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican spokesman declined to comment and said no decision had
been reached as to whether the pope would cancel his meeting with
Sabri, who was appointed a senior cleric by Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Cabinet minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said, ``I would
recommend Muslim spokesmen not engage in this garbage of historical
writing or interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has, at least so far, managed to avoid the pitfalls of
this politically and religiously charged region.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to a Palestinian refugee camp and spoke of the
suffering of the 3.5 million Palestinian refugees, but he avoided
the thorny issue of whether they have the right to return to homes
and villages in what is today Israel. He has also seemingly won the
hearts of many Israelis by confronting the tragedy of the Holocaust
while skirting the emotional issue of the status of Jerusalem,
which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the pope stood and waved through the bulletproof glass
of the ``popemobile'' as it weaved through the narrow streets of
Nazareth, the town where Jesus grew up. The visit coincided with
the Roman Catholic Feast of the Annunciation, celebrating the
occasion when the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would
give birth to Jesus. The pope's sermon explored the Christian
belief in the ``great mystery'' of the virgin birth and the story's
message of faith and submission to God's will.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the pope's motorcade wound its way to a vacant
piece of land that has torn this town apart. Muslims want to build
a mosque there to honor a martyr of the Crusades. The Christian
mayor and much of the Catholic hierarchy insist it be a public
plaza for tourists visiting the massive Basilica of the
Annunciation, a central shrine of Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed construction of the mosque, which Israel has
approved, sparked Muslim-Christian rioting last Easter. The pope's
visit seemed to be an occasion for Nazareth's Muslims and
Christians to come together.
</P>
<P>
   Nisreen Shomar, 23, a Christian, standing in the crowd to catch
a glimpse of the pope as he passed by, said, ``The pope's message
here is very important for Christians who have felt under siege
here. But it is also important for the whole community, a way to
bring us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Barkarni, 26, a Muslim, came to the lot where some 800
Muslims held daily prayers, but craned his neck to see the pope as
he passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All people of Nazareth, Muslim and Christian, believe the pope
is a welcome guest,'' he said. ``He is a man of God, so we are
honored to have him.''

US AIRWAYS   RETURNS TO NORMAL SCHEDULE AFTER TENTATIVE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Airways flew a normal schedule Saturday, after a tentative
labor agreement reached in the wee hours of the morning averted a
strike at the nation's sixth-largest airline and the busiest on the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   There were no long lines or delays at Boston's Logan
International Airport, and US Airways officials said travel was
smooth throughout its system.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, however, declined to comment on the proposed
settlement with the flight attendants' union, reached more than
three hours after a 12:01 a.m. deadline had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of the National Mediation Board, the two
sides had been trying to reach an agreement that would give the
airline's 10,000 flight attendants raises, while making the
company, which has the highest costs in the industry, competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The mediation board chairman, Ernest DuBester, had requested
that the two sides continue talking, and the airline team, headed
by chief executive Rakesh Gangwal, and the Association of Flight
Attendants team, led by US Airways AFA president Lynn Lenosky,
agreed on a proposal that calls for a signing bonus, pay raises
over the life of the five-year contract, and increased job
security.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the company got changes in work rules that will
make the airline more competitive. Among the work rules the company
sought to change were how flight attendants are scheduled and how
much paid sick leave they can take.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough came when the airline stated Thursday that there
might be alternative ways to achieve its goal of having US Airways
employees at parity with workers of United, American, Delta, and
Northwest Airlines, plus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the settlement, neither the flight attendants nor
the airline mentioned parity. ``Parity is their concept and you
should ask the airline,'' said Cynthia Kain, spokeswoman for the
flight attendants' association. ``But there are all kinds of way to
find cost savings.'' A US Airways news release, in the only comment
made by the airline, stated, ``The AFA leadership and the company's
management worked extremely hard to put in place an agreement that
works for our flight attendants and allows the company to compete
in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   About 11 percent of the stock of US Airways Group Inc., the
holding company for the airline, is owned by Tiger Management, a
hedge fund, which has seen the stock price plummet in the last two
years. Tiger Management has said it is working with the US Airways
Group board to increase shareholder value by merging the airline or
selling part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Kain said increased job security was very important for flight
attendants in the event of a merger or partial sale, such as its
low-cost brand MetroJet. The new contract has stronger job
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The contract must be reviewed by the AFA US Airways Master
Executive Council. The council will then recommend to the rank and
file how to vote on the contract. Ratification is expected to take
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Airports, airlines, Amtrak, and passengers along the East Coast
had braced for a shutdown. Management had said it would ground all
planes rather than let its passengers face the uncertainty of
wildcat walkouts promised by the flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is the No. 1 or No. 2 carrier at more than 40
airports along the East Coast and operates the
Boston-LaGuardia-Washington shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns and operates
Logan, officials were relieved by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good news for the traveling public and it is always a
good day when you don't have to use your contingency plans,'' said
Massport spokesman Jose Juves.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was even more upbeat at Charlotte, N.C., Philadelphia,
and other cities, most notably Pittsburgh, where US Airways
operates hubs and dominates travel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MYSTIC, Conn. _ A hand-built replica of the Cuban schooner
Amistad, whose cargo of rebellious African slaves galvanized
pre-Civil War abolitionists and made the ship an enduring symbol of
freedom's triumph, was launched with great fanfare into the Mystic
River Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, reconstructed with painstaking attention to historic
detail _ from the golden eagle figurehead on the bow, along its
sleek black hull with a single white stripe, to the elegant
lettering on its transom _ will be used as a floating classroom,
traveling from port to port to teach the Amistad story.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people attended Saturday's festivities at Mystic
Seaport, home to the nation's largest maritime museum and the
shipyard where the Amistad was built over the last two years.
Scores more spectators dotted the Mystic River in a colorful array
of canoes, kayaks, rowboats and other small craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have an opportunity to see a piece of history that
has been re-created,'' Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell said at a ceremony that
was punctuated by the music of traditional African drummers. ``We
are proud of the role Amistad will play in history not only today
but for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 12:30 p.m., with the tide high in the Mystic
River, the launching ceremony began with the tolling of a bell 53
times in honor of each of the captives held on the Amistad. A
ceremonial chain was cut, a bottle of water broken across the bow
and six white doves released.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the push of a button, automated winches lowered the
lift-dock holding the Amistad into the water. As it reached a depth
of 10 feet, the wooden ship, flying the American flag but still
without masts or sails, floated free, and the crowd erupted in loud
cheers and applause. The HMS Rose, a tall ship anchored nearby,
fired its cannons.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such ceremony when the original Amistad entered
Connecticut waters 161 years ago, carrying a cargo of slaves who
had been kidnapped in Africa and sold at auction in Havana. Seized
by a Navy brig off Long Island, the Amistad was towed to shore in
New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The slaves, in a mutiny, had killed the ship's captain and chef
but failed in an effort to return to their homeland in what is now
Sierra Leone in West Africa. After 63 days at sea, they were
charged with murder and jailed in New Haven, where they waited for
American courts to consider their fate.
</P>
<P>
   President Martin Van Buren hoped to extradite the prisoners to
Cuba, where they would have been enslaved once again. But
abolitionists took up the Africans' cause and organized a defense
that eventually led to John Quincy Adams, the former president,
arguing their case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1841, three years after the ship's capture, the court
ruled that the Africans had been kidnapped illegally and ordered
them freed. The 35 survivors eventually returned to their homeland,
their saga fixed in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of recreating the Amistad grew out of a parade of tall
ships in New York Harbor to celebrate the American bicentennial in
1976. The parade included a ship that had been temporarily renamed
Amistad, which caught the attention of Warren Q. Marr II, then
editor of Crisis, a journal of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   His interest led to the creation of Amistad America, a nonprofit
educational foundation formed in 1996 to re-create the Amistad. The
project also got a huge lift in publicity and interest from the
1997 Steven Spielberg movie ``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the $3.1 million replica, paid for by corporate
sponsors and a $2.5 million grant from the state of Connecticut,
began in March 1998 under the direction of Quentin T. Snediker, a
captain and master shipwright with experience in building historic
wooden sailing vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Snediker, who has the look of a classic seaman, with a white
beard and denim sleeves rolled up to expose an anchor tattooed on
his left forearm, led the research into the details of the original
Amistad that had been little noticed by historians interested in
the ship's story, not its nautical design. A team of researchers
scoured the National Archives and other historical repositories
throughout New England. A treasure trove of information came from
documents related to the sale of the ship after the court case was
resolved, including details about the sails, rigging and
fastenings.
</P>
<P>
   In guiding visitors around the new ship, Snediker stresses that
Amistad was a workaday cargo schooner, not one of the infamous
Middle Passage slave ships that carried captives from Africa to the
Americas. This, he points out, is one of the historical lessons to
be taught about slavery in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amistad was just a freight vessel,'' he said. ``But still she
was so embroiled in this international incident that it shows how
the whole economy was based on the labor of enslaved people. Every
aspect of New World life was in some way complicit. Part of her
power will be to help people understand the complexities of the
past and how they continue to manifest in some of the issues of
racism that we still face.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with the state, it will spend half the year
in Connecticut waters and the other half traveling. It will have
classrooms as well as accommodations for overnight passengers.

   You deploy the cell phone and dial a familiar, multi-digit
number preceded by zero. An operator picks up on the first ring and
you say, ``Collect call from the Los Angeles Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   The operator asks about your family, then waits for a response
on the other end of the line. After three more rings, you hear a
click followed by the voice of the general manager for the South
Lake Tahoe Snake Eyes, your Triple-A farm team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're callin' up Rascalitisovich,'' you say, referring to last
year's third-round pick. Nice shooter, good feel for the game, this
kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You flyin' him down on Southwest?'' the Eyes' GM asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. It also happens to be 2002 (the year 4 AJ; After
Jordan) and Lamar Odom still hasn't been convinced to use his right
hand on those kamikaze streaks to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's already a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   But today's topic is strictly minor league.
</P>
<P>
   As those of you who haven't developed or borrowed a life may
know, the basketball future includes the threat of a real minor
league (lose the panic; we're not referring to the Big West). No,
this will be a professional league comprised of teams directly
linked with NBA franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a portent for the future of college basketball? Well, it
could mean March Madness will be downgraded to March Testiness
(some critics believe it already has been).
</P>
<P>
   However, the anticipated jailbreak by college and high school
players may not be as inclusive as doomsday prophets would have us
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Television. The college game has network TV and ESPNs 1 &AMP; 2;
minor league basketball might be displayed on TBS4 or something.
Many young players are savvy enough to realize Dick Vitale and
Billy Packer are two of the best agents they'll ever have.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the college game will take an even greater hit, but it
figures to survive.
</P>
<P>
   When a minor league does erupt, what would it mean for the NBA's
future?
</P>
<P>
   It could mean you'll need a jacket in hell and commissioner
David Stern has reached some sort of compromise with CBA owner
Isiah Thomas. You may be aware that Thomas is attempting to
purchase another minor league or two, merge these properties into
one big stew and serve it up as an officially licensed NBA minor
league.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds fine. With existing minor league franchises in place, NBA
owners wouldn't have to cough up the scoots required to create
their own farm teams.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to NBA yard dogs, Stern's not exactly turning
cartwheels over the notion of having his institutional control
challenged by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: cede some of his power to Zeke or blow him off and
have the NBA and its owners go into pocket to produce a minor
league?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if, for the next year or two, the NBA
continues to lean on its current minor league:
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA. &QL; 
Rivers on a roll
</P>
<P>
   First-year Orlando Magic coach Doc Rivers bought even more
respect from his players last week.
</P>
<P>
   The sticker price was $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The cash will go to the NBA, which fined Rivers for ripping the
officials after the Magic shot only 13 free throws in a loss to
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with the fine,'' he said. ``I just
thought my players needed someone to stand up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The amens you now hear are being produced in the dressing room
of the Clippers, who typically receive as many calls as the
Elephant Man on the eve of prom night. &QL; 
Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The Nike Hoop Summit game to be contested by a team of U.S. high
school hotshots and a squad of their foreign peers will include the
participation of Yao Ming. Ming is an intriguing 19-year-old,
7-foot-5 prospect who currently is posting 12 points, 7 rebounds
and 4 blocks per game for a pro team in China. Ming may be
available for the 2001 NBA Draft and could join three American high
school phenoms (including Tyson Chandler of Dominguez High) in the
top steps of the lottery. ... Before annihilating the UCLA defense,
Iowa State point guard Jamaal Tinsley was unable to lead Mt. San
Jacinto College past Cerritos in the 1999 California state juco
championship game. Tinsley, by the way, was being tracked on NBA
radar screens long before the NCAA Tournament began. ... If, as
expected, Bill Laimbeer is named head coach of the Detroit Pistons,
don't be shocked if he hires Bruise Brother Rick Mahorn to ride
shotgun. Mahorn now coaches the Rockford Lightning of the CBA. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ex-76ers center and Lovetron ambassador Darryl Dawkins has been
named head coach for the Tampa Bay franchise in the new ABA 2000.
... According to many scouts who really like Florida's Mike Miller,
the Southeastern Conference sophomore small forward with the best
NBA future is Vincent Yarbrough of Tennessee. ... Many of the same
big thinkers who say the UCLA squad is poorly coached now believe
Jerome Moiso would be better prepared for an NBA career by spending
another year with the Bruin staff. ... Clipper Troy Hudson arrived
for Friday's practice with his hair unbraided, but insisted the
condition of his 'do was unrelated to the breeze created when
Houston's Steve Francis blew past him Thursday night.

 &HT;    Sutton makes splash; Woods 1 back
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Guess who's the intimidator at The
Players Championship? OK, here's a clue: It's not Hal Sutton or
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the most famous holes in golf. It's a piece of land
so terror-filled, you'd think the Bates Motel was located there.
</P>
<P>
   It's the TPC at Sawgrass' nerve-racking, 145-yard island green
17th, which Saturday became the unmerciful undoing of leader Sutton
and helped make today's final round a certain TV ratings bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton came to the 17th at 12-under-par, leading Woods by four.
When the 41-year-old Sutton left, it was with a triple-bogey 6
after hitting his 9-iron tee shot into the water, then
three-putting with his reload from up against the high back fringe,
60 feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's Sutton and Woods battling today for ``the fifth major''
and a first prize of $1,080,000. Sutton, who first won the event in
1983 and seeks a wire-to-wire victory, finished with his third
straight 69 and is at 9-under-par 207.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is one stroke back at 8-under 208 after a solid 66, his
first round in the 60s in 15 rounds at The Players Championship.
Woods, who made six birdies, an eagle and two bogeys, is trying for
his 11th victory in his last 17 PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton indicated early in the week that he was not intimidated
by Woods and reiterated it Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played really good golf today,'' Sutton said sternly. ``That
69 could have been a 64 or 65 pretty easily and was one swing away
from being a 66. I hope I can do the same thing tomorrow. If I do,
he'll have to play his tail off.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the intimidation factor that Woods commands with the
way Woods seems to intimidate most players, Sutton said, ``I think
it's a bigger deal to y'all than it is to me. I'm not looking at it
that way. He's just another guy who's going to put his left leg in
his pants and then his right leg in his pants, just like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman is third after a double-bogey at the 18th for a 72
and a total of 5-under 211.
</P>
<P>
   Friday challengers Fulton Allem and Omar Uresti obliterated
themselves Saturday. Both one stroke off the lead after 36 holes,
they shot 82 and 80, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sluman shot a 66 for fourth place at 4-under 212. Craig
Parry of Australia (69) and two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen
(70) are tied for fifth at 3-under 213.
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta resident Scott Dunlap is the best among Georgians,
tied for seventh at 2-under after a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's 9-iron at the 17th traveled about 5 yards too far,
nearly striking the back fringe on the fly, then bouncing into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it when it was in the air,'' Sutton said. ``I'll just
have to accept the consequences.... It was one of those situations
where I was hollering 'uncle' all the time and I just couldn't get
away from the hole.''

 &HT;    Patriarch's legacy of self-reliance and hard work leaves an
indelible mark on next generations
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. _ Preston King's recent return home to Albany was
chronicled by local, national and international media as an
extraordinary journey. After all, the 63-year-old college professor
had to wait 39 years to make the trip from England, all because of
his long-ago insistence on being treated with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for the Kings of Albany, Preston King's homecoming was the
latest in a long line of journeys _ both literal and metaphorical _
in search of dignity for themselves and others. These travels are a
theme of a rich family history. They have taken generations of
Kings along country roads, across the continent, over oceans and
beyond racial barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The first steps were taken when Clennon Washington King, who
would become the patriarch of a remarkable family, set off on foot
from a Florida Panhandle hamlet called Two Egg, determined to reach
Tuskegee, Ala., 180 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   C.W. King was a farmer's son who didn't want to spend his life
farming. He wanted the better life an education could give him, and
he knew he could work his way through college at Booker T.
Washington's famous Tuskegee Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon reaching Tuskegee, he told Booker T. that he wanted to
get that education,'' says Carol King, widow of C.B. King, one of
C.W. King's seven sons. Having worked with horses back home, he was
hired as Washington's coachman, driving him in a carriage to and
from the train station.
</P>
<P>
   King's close encounter with Tuskegee's founder and the school's
philosophy of black uplift through hard work and self-reliance were
lifelong influences. ``Whatever I am,'' he was fond of saying,
``and whatever I hope to be, I owe to Booker T.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also at Tuskegee that he met and fell in love with a
fellow student named Margaret (Maggie) Slater from Milledgeville,
Ga. She graduated a year ahead of him in 1915. After he served in
World War I, they married and, in 1919, moved to Albany, where C.W.
King's father, Allen James King, had moved from North Florida.
Allen James King worked as a drayman for the railroad, hauling dirt
for rail beds.
</P>
<P>
   Clennon Leslie King, C.W. King's grandson, says family legend
holds that the move followed Allen James King's defiance of white
authority. ``My great-grandfather was a man who had very little
tolerance for white people showing him disrespect,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Allen James King and his wife journeyed 100
miles up the Flint River to Albany, and his son followed. C.W. King
secured a job as a letter carrier. But he also started a business:
the Little Wonder Cafe. It was Albany's first black-owned
restaurant, though some whites who saw the very light-skinned
Maggie King behind the counter thought the place belonged to a
Greek family.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Wonder was the first in a string of businesses owned
by C.W. King: a women's clothing store called the Swank Shop
(opened in the late 1940s and still operating today), a bus
service, a newspaper and two neighborhood grocery stores, the Busy
Spot and the Super Spot. He also bought property tracts around
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a knack for making money. But, according to one of his
sons, C.W. King was most interested in serving as an example for
the rest of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening several businesses,'' Paul King said, ``my father
was trying to inspire other black people to start businesses. He
was more interested in inspiring than in making a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The businesses also gave King a degree of independence that was
unusual for a black man in the South at the time. And he passed
along the advantage to his seven sons. (The Kings also had a
daughter, Muriel, who died when she was 14 months old.)
</P>
<P>
   The businesses ``provided employment for the sons,'' says Carol
King. ``It provided employment so that those sons were not required
to go elsewhere to get jobs, which meant that they weren't
subjected to the abuse and exploitation of many employers. It was
built in to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the sons of C.W. King spread their wings and left the
cocoon their father had created for them, they led lives of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Clennon W. King Jr., the eldest, became an educator, minister
and civil rights activist. At one time while living in Albany, he
simultaneously held jobs as a high school principal, a pastor and a
radio disc jockey. He studied Egyptology at the University of
Chicago and could read and write hieroglyphics. He was a professor
at several U.S. universities and founded colleges in Ethiopia and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Clennon King attempted to become the first black person
to enroll in the University of Mississippi. He was promptly
committed to a state insane asylum. That incarceration clearly was
politically motivated, but Clennon, as the King family iconoclast,
often did things that embroiled him in controversy and brought
trouble on himself. He was imprisoned in California after being
convicted of abandoning his family. In 1976, he mounted a one-man
campaign to integrate the congregation of the small baptist church
President Carter attended in Plains. But his crusade only resulted
in national attention for Clennon King _ much of it criticizing him
as a grandstander _ and a painful rift in the local community.
</P>
<P>
   Slater King was a graduate of Tuskegee and did his graduate
study at Oberlin College in Ohio. He returned to Albany and opened
insurance and real estate businesses in offices he built on
property his father owned. He served as president of the Albany
Movement, which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. _ who was
not related to the Kings of Albany _ to town to help protest
segregation and racial discrimination. In 1963, he became the first
black candidate to run for mayor of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Slater King also worked to bring low-income housing to Albany
and to improve services to senior citizens. A city street has been
named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin King became a building contractor after graduating from
Tuskegee. Among the buildings he constructed in Albany are the
present location of the Swank Shop and the offices of the local
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Chevene Bowers King graduated from Fisk University in Nashville
and attended law school at Case Western University in Cleveland,
Ohio. He was the first _ and for many years the only _
African-American attorney in Albany. C.B. King represented Martin
Luther King Jr. when he was arrested during the Albany
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   C.B. King also represented blacks in civil rights cases and
other court cases around Georgia. In Albany, he filed suit to end
segregation in the public schools. In 1970, he became the first
black person to run for governor of Georgia since the
Reconstruction era. Both of Georgia's U.S. senators advocate naming
the new federal courthouse being built in Albany in honor of C.B.
King.
</P>
<P>
   Paul King attended Howard University in Washington and the
University of Madrid in Spain. He eventually earned a Ph.D. in
Mexico and became a professor of foreign languages at Albany State
University. According to Carol King, her brother-in-law showed a
knack for languages early on. As a high schooler, he learned
Spanish during trips to Miami. After that, he earned money serving
as an interpreter for wealthy Miami families who took vacations in
Cuba. At one point, Carol King says, Paul King could read and
understand 12 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Allen King graduated from Atlanta's Morris Brown College and
moved to Washington to be a schoolteacher. When Slater King was
killed in a car accident in 1969, Allen King came back to Albany to
continue the real estate and insurance businesses. He also bought
and operated a drug store.
</P>
<P>
   Preston King was admitted to Atlanta University's early entrance
program as an 11th-grader. The following year he enrolled at Fisk
University. After graduating in 1956, he went to the London School
of Economics, where he earned a master's degree and then his Ph.D.
The draft deferments Preston King received for his college studies
were the genesis of the 39-year exile that ended last month when he
returned home from the funeral of his oldest brother, Clennon.
</P>
<P>
   Paperwork for his first deferment was sent from Fisk.
Correspondence from the Albany draft board concerning his status
was addressed to ``Mr. Preston King.'' But King went home between
his graduation from Fisk and the start of his classes in London. He
dropped by the draft board offices and, for the first time,
officials saw that he was black. It is evidence of the racial
divide in Albany at the time that those whites in positions of
power didn't connect the Preston King at Fisk _ one of the nation's
best known historically black colleges _ to the city's most
prominent black family. At any rate, once they knew who and what he
was, things changed.
</P>
<P>
   Envelopes from the draft board were addressed to ``Preston
King.'' The board's letters simply addressed him as ``Preston.''
King informed draft board members he would no longer respond until
they addressed him with the courtesy title ``Mr.'' When the board
ended his deferment and ordered him home for induction into the
Army, he returned but refused to be inducted until he was addressed
as ``Mr. King.'' After he was tried and convicted of draft evasion,
King did not report to serve his 18-month prison sentence. Instead,
he fled back to England, where he eventually became a distinguished
professor of political science at the London School of Economics.
He wrote books and lectured around the world, but he never returned
to American soil until President Clinton issued the pardon that
allowed him to attend Clennon King's funeral.

POPE GIVEN A REMINDER OF THE DIVISIONS AMONG THE HOLY LAND'S
CHRISTIANS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ John Paul II has sought to use his time in Israel
and the West Bank to foster reconciliation among Jews, Muslims and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night, he attended an ecumenical meeting given by
Diodoros I, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, that for all
its warmth also underlined the deep divisions among Christians in
the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid trace of the schism between Catholicism and
Orthodoxy that dates back more than 1,000 years took place after
the pope and the patriarch had delivered their remarks. The papal
nuncio in Jerusalem, Pietro Sambi, took the microphone and asked
that all church leaders present recite together the Lord's Prayer,
each in their own language. It was an unscripted suggestion, and it
turned out to be more of a breach of ecumenical etiquette than a
rousing inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, in the elegant reception room, where Roman
Catholics, Melchites, Maronite Christians, Armenian Catholics and
Chaldeans (and the head of the Church of Scotland, in green tartan
trousers and a frock coat) were seated, all rose and recited the
prayer, mostly in Latin. The left side, which included Greek
Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Syrian Ethiopian Coptics, and others,
also rose, but almost all remained silent. So did Patriarch
Diodoros I.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not used to saying the Lord's Prayer in these
circumstances,'' Father Aleksandr, a Russian-born priest who works
for the Greek Orthodox Patriarchy and was at the meeting, said
afterward. ``You cannot just jump over history.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox doctrine bans prayers with Roman Catholics and while it
has happened _ most notably, when John Paul II made his
breakthrough visit to the Patriarch of Romania and the two leaders
attended each other's Masses _ some branches of the Orthodox Church
are stricter than others. The Greek Orthodox Church, which withdrew
from all efforts at dialogue with the Vatican in 1989 and has
denounced the Roman church as ``cunning'' and ``heretical,'' is one
of the most conservative.
</P>
<P>
   That was one reason John Paul II, who has made Christian unity
one of the goals of his papacy, was so eager to meet 77-year-old
Diodoros I, whom he kissed on both cheeks. The Greek Orthodox
church is the largest Christian denomination in Israel, and its
hierarchy controls many holy sites. Others are jealously divided,
including the Holy Sepulcher, the church built over the site where
tradition says Christ was crucified, in which the pope will say
Mass on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Holy Land, where Christians live side by side with the
followers of Judaism and Islam, where there are almost daily
tensions and conflicts, it is essential to overcome the scandalous
impression given by our disagreements and arguments,'' the pope
said in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch praised the pope for his ``tireless and continuous
contribution'' to promoting Christian ideals, but also reminded him
of his grievances against Rome, including, he said, the efforts
some Churches make to increase the numbers of their faithful ``by
exploiting unemployment, education, and other social needs in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear that the Roman Catholic church is using its resources
and clout to convert Orthodox believers is acute in Israel, where
tensions between the Greek hierarchy and their ethnic Arab
followers has tempted many to join the Catholic church, whose
hierarchy is mainly ethnic Arab, and which has many schools and
hospitals. But there are also signs that the local churches are
beginning to cooperate, notably in Nazareth, where all Christian
churches closed for two days to protest the construction of a
mosque next to the Church of the Annunciation, where the pope said
Mass Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's encounter, where the two leaders exchanged
gifts and crosses and toasted each other with champagne, was not a
breakthrough, but it signaled a significant step forward in the
pope's campaign to mend the rift.
</P>
<P>
   The rift, however, is far more important to leaders than most
Christians, who are a small, uneasy minority in Israel and the
Palestinian-controlled territories. ``The important thing is for
the pope to help settle the question of Palestine,'' said Nicholas
Shbeita a Greek Orthodox Christian who runs a gift shop near the
Holy Sepulcher.

FISET'S SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stephane Fiset's ``no comment'' after Saturday's 4-4
Los Angeles Kings tie with the Boston Bruins rang out like shot off
the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset wasn't merely pulled by the Kings after two periods, he
was betrayed. After beating mighty Philadelphia on Thursday, he was
forced to face the Bruins without any intensity from his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everyone to know that I wasn't disappointed in Stephane
Fiset,'' said Kings coach Andy Murray, who watched the Kings rally
from a three-goal deficit after Fiset left. ``He played his heart
out for us on Thursday and this is how we thanked him. It was
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins outshot the Kings 17-4 in the first period. In the
second, Boston scored twice after turnovers in the Kings' end. The
Bruins scored four consecutive goals, including three in the
second. The last one came from Brian Rolston on an impossible
angle. His shot struck Fiset's right leg and trickled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a guy like (Fiset) coming back from an injury and
play the way he did against Philly, you'd think we'd be building
some momentum. Instead we left him out there to dry. We got a point
tonight with the tie, but it doesn't feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Fiset's second game since missing 10 days with a
strained right groin. The Kings did not want to rush him back.
Earlier this season, Fiset was forced to return ahead of schedule
from a hand injury when Jamie Storr suffered a concussion.

   Chartrand returns: With all the jumbled lines since Ziggy Palffy
was injured six games ago, it wasn't hard to miss rookie Brad
Chartrand, who has been back after missing two months with a broken
jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand played almost eight minutes against Boston. More
amazing is that he is playing at all. After undergoing surgery to
insert two pins and a plate in his jaw, Chartrand was back playing
at minor-league Lowell, Mass., in 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come back as soon as I could,'' Chartrand said.
``I didn't want the Kings to forget about me. But even I was
surprised how quickly my jaw responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Fourth-line strongman Steve McKenna played his
40th game for the Kings, qualifying him for protection in this
summer's expansion draft. He responded with an assist on Bob
Corkum's third-period goal.... Jozef Stumpel had assists on both of
Glen Murray's third-period goals. Stumpel, who had two goals
Thursday, has 14 goals and 33 points in his last 26 games.... After
going nine games without a goal, Luc Robitaille has two in his past
two games. He has 35 this year and 552 for his career, four behind
former Boston great Johnny Bucyk for 15th all-time.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: GOP abortion battle brewing
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the abortion rights movement in the Republican Party
say they will risk precipitating a noisy, divisive fight at this
summer's Republican National Convention if the party insists on
keeping an anti-abortion plank in its platform. Abortion rights
advocates have begun a mass mailing warning party officials not to
mention abortion issues in the GOP platform at the 2000 convention
in Philadelphia in August, or face a battle. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee, favors an anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must understand,'' said Susan R. Cullman, a
co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, ``that the
road to a unified Republican Party is filled with deep potholes.
The party will surely tumble into one of them if we don't take
abortion out of the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY STILL STRONG LEADERS SAY
</P>
<P>
   Pat Choate, chairman of the national Reform Party, said that
infighting among party members won't cripple the party or
overshadow its mission. ``These are issues that had to get
resolved, and it's well that they be resolved here, in March,''
Choate said Saturday at a meeting of the Virginia Reform Party in
Richmond. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon is to rule
in Lynchburg, Va., whether Choate's faction or one headed by former
chairman Jack Gargan controls the party and almost $15 million in
campaign funds. Choate deposed Gargan last month at a rowdy meeting
in Nashville, Tenn. Pat Buchanan is considered likely to win the
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   GORE BACKS CAMPAIGN MANAGER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said Friday that his campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is
doing a ``terrific job'' and suggested Coelho would remain with his
presidential campaign despite a criminal investigation into past
financial dealings. Asked if he was concerned about the possibility
of criminal wrongdoing, Gore refused to elaborate on his statement,
saying, ``He's doing a great job and he will keep on doing so.''
When asked about Gore's problems regarding Coelho and an
investigation of White House e-mail, George W. Bush said Friday:
``The best way to make sure we get rid of all these investigations
is to change administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE IN BUSH COUNTRY TO RAISE CASH
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was in Houston attending a reception and dinner Friday
in hopes of raising more than $600,000 for the Democratic National
Committee. The event capped a week of fund-raising in Washington,
D.C., Cincinnati and Detroit. Gore, who has called for an overhaul
of campaign finance laws and challenged George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to mutually halt the
raising of large, unregulated donations of ``soft money,'' has
shown no signs of letting up his own prodigious fund raising.
Gore's goal is to help the party rase $35 million in soft money
during the next few months to finance anti-GOP TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN A NAME?
</P>
<P>
   When Secret Service agents talk into their sleeves while
protecting presidential candidates, they almost always refer to
their charges by code names seemingly picked at random _ Dasher for
Jimmy Carter, Rawhide for Ronald Reagan, Eagle for Bill Clinton,
Sundance for Al Gore. George W. Bush's code name? Tumbler.

HOME IS WHERE THE WINS ARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ As if they required a gentle reminder of the need
for home-court advantage in the playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers
play today in one of the most daunting settings in the NBA. Against
their potential first-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings' 27-6 record at Arco Arena is tied for
second best in the Western Conference (behind the Lakers' 31-4 at
Staples Center), and third overall in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Kings fans are rabid, close to the action and packed in tight in
one of the more intimate - and deafening - arenas in the league.
The Lakers have lost two of their last three games here.
</P>
<P>
   But if these teams meet in the first round of the playoffs, the
Lakers will have home-court advantage in the five-game series. If
the Lakers win at least eight of their final 12 games, they'll lock
up home-court advantage throughout the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``(That's) always great to have,'' coach Phil Jackson said,
``but regular season and playoffs are like two different seasons.
Nothing counts. You throw everything out the window and start over
again. The thing that's fortunate is if you do have home court, you
can rest in your own beds, that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lakers are also the NBA's best road team this
season, with a 27-8 record away from Staples Center. And the home
court doesn't always translate to an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win all your home games (in a series), and if you
hold serve the entire time then you win it all,'' Brian Shaw said.
``But that's all that it really means. A few years ago when we were
in Orlando, we had the best record, had home court all the way
through and ended up being swept in the Finals. You realize that
you can't put too much on it, because each night you have to go out
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson, who had derided Staples for being ``cavernous,''
among other things, won't yet proclaim his home court an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. Our fans are really animated, though. They do
the wave about the third quarter every night. It's enjoyable to
watch them do it,'' Jackson said. ``We still have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Lakers boast an intimidating home-court edge, the way
the Kings, Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can say that yet,'' Shaw said. ``It's a new
building for us, too. And now we're not even coming in and having
(a) shootaround here on game days. So hopefully it's turning into
that. It seems like the fans are starting to get a little bit more
into it, and it's starting to become more intimate out there.
Hopefully, by the time we get to where we need to be going, we'll
have it all working for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: The Kings have again moved up to the No. 7 slot
in the West, and the battle for No. 8 - and a first-round matchup
with the Lakers - could go down to the last game. Jockeying among
seeds four through eight are Phoenix, San Antonio, Minnesota,
Seattle and the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will see all of those teams at least once more, but
``we're still a ways away'' from scouting a first-round opponent,
Jackson said. ``We'll probably track their last five games, however
it boils down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Assistant coach Tex Winter and rookie Devean George
are both suffering from the flu and did not make the trip.

13-YEAR-OLD PRODIGY OVERSHADOWED BY WEBB  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN STREGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. _ Only the magnitude of her domination
here this past week has kept Karrie Webb from joining the rest of
the LPGA in turning over one of its pre-eminent stages, the Nabisco
Championship, to a 13-year-old wunderkind from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Aree Wongluekiet, an amateur playing here on a sponsor's
exemption, shot Saturday's second-best round, a four-under-par 68,
which left her tied for third place heading into the final round on
the Dinah Shore Course.
</P>
<P>
   The best round of the day was delivered by Webb, who shot a
five-under-par 67. It was a demonstration of the No. 1 player in
the world at the peak of her game, emphatically reiterating that a
close second does not exist, at large or in this particular
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Webb concluded 54 holes in 12-under-par 204, leaving her eight
strokes ahead of the defending champion, Dottie Pepper, and
virtually assuring her fifth victory in six starts this year and
the second major championship of her career.
</P>
<P>
   She will be paired in the final round with Wongluekiet, who
along with her twin sister, Naree, have been leaving notes in
Webb's locker, expressing a desire to play together someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's played her way into playing with me,'' Webb said. `I'm
excited to play with Aree. I can't image what's going through her
mind right now, 13 years old and playing in the last group in a
major.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely it also taxes the imagination to know what Webb is going
through with her dominating play right now. Perhaps only Tiger
Woods can relate. Indeed, parallels often are drawn between the
two, and another surfaced here. When Woods won the Masters in 1997,
he carried a nine-stroke lead into the final round and won by 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco Championship is the women's equivalent of the
Masters, and the notion that Webb's lead is not insurmountable
seems as far-fetched as anyone suggesting Woods had not already won
the green jacket at a similar stage at Augusta in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say, whatever the lead, that I've won,'' said Webb,
25. ``I don't give myself that luxury. I've got 18 holes ahead of
me, four or five hours of work ahead of me. I still have to play
some good golf.''
</P>
<P>
   What Webb accomplished Saturday even seemed to surprise her.
</P>
<P>
   ``From tee to green, I hit the ball extremely well, maybe the
best I've ever hit it,'' she said. ``I only missed two greens. I
probably missed four or five putts inside 12 feet. I'm not
complaining, but I probably could have made a few more putts.''
</P>
<P>
   The only complaints that warrant consideration at this point of
the 2000 season would have to come from the others on the LPGA.
Webb has not been unbeatable, though she has been close. She has
won three of the four LPGA tournaments she entered, and finished
second in the other, losing to Charlotta Sorenstam at the Standard
Register Ping last week. She also won the Australian Women's Open,
which is not an official LPGA event.
</P>
<P>
   She began play Saturday with a three-stroke lead over Pepper,
who experienced back pain on the practice tee and struggled through
a round of 72. Webb made only one bogey, at the fourth hole, and
birdied three consecutive holes on the back nine to open a
nine-stroke lead at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to play my game,'' she said, ``and not pay
attention to what anyone else was doing. When I saw that Dottie and
Lorie weren't making a move, it made it easier to fire at pins.`
</P>
<P>
   The most notable move was made by Wongluekiet (pronounced
wahn-gloo-KEE-it), who might have erased doubts anyone had about
the wisdom of inviting 13-year-old twins to compete in a major
championship. Naree missed the cut, but her sister has carried the
Wongluekiet banner impressively enough to remind everyone that Webb
is not the only golfer in the tournament.

PUSH FOR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY STRAINS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOLLYWOOD,
THEATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As movie stars collect their Academy Awards
tonight, a behind-the-screens crisis is shaking the relationship
between those who make movies and those who show them.
</P>
<P>
   Financial fallout from a glut of movie screens in the United
States already has the exhibition industry on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hollywood wants theater owners to upgrade for digital
projection technology at a cost of $100,000 per screen.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, neither side seems willing _ or perhaps able _ to pay
for the upgrade. In the end, some industry observers say,
moviegoers may pay higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   While exhibition firms have been adding movie screens at a
steady pace in the last decade, a multibillion-dollar building
binge began in earnest in 1994 when Kansas City-based AMC
Entertainment Inc. broke ground on the nation's first megaplex _
the Grand 24 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of losing customers, AMC's competition began their own
building frenzy, sometimes opening megaplexes within blocks of
similar ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade the number of movie screens has increased by
66 percent to almost 37,000. In the same period, the number of
tickets sold increased by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result the length of movie runs has decreased, meaning
Hollywood receives a greater share of the box-office revenue at the
expense of exhibitors. Traditionally moviemakers receive a large
percentage of box-office receipts early in a movie's run, with the
percentage declining over the run. Thus, a long run helped
exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ego seems to be driving market share aspirations ... and now,
we're collectively drowning in red ink,'' said Robert E. Goodrich,
head of Goodrich Quality Theaters in Michigan, which recently
closed the South Quality 12 in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the request from Hollywood to upgrade to digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does an industry that's drowning in red ink ... undertake
a major technological retooling of its presentation?'' Goodrich
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That, says John Fithian, president of the National Association
of Theatre Owners, is the $3.7 billion question, the theoretical
cost to convert 37,000 screens at $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that $800 million, a cost mostly borne by the
studios, is spent each year making and distributing film prints to
the more than 7,500 movie houses and complexes in the United
States. Digital delivery _ by satellite, a disc or perhaps cable _
would drastically lower their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Who pays for digital conversion was the topic at last month's
ShoWest in Las Vegas, an annual exhibition extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Fithian shocked _ and delighted _ some in attendance when he
said distributors should pay for the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said stands _ we're not looking to assume more
financial obligations at this point based on what we've just gone
through,'' Fithian said. ``We would look to them, if they want it,
to finance it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood insiders say the exhibitors' woes are of their
own making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street got involved in putting a lot of money in a lot of
(exhibition) companies because they saw a cash cow,'' said Tom
Sherak, chairman of 20th (Century Fox) Domestic Film Group.
``People see cash coming in, they think it's a good business, add
Hollywood to it, and they think it's a great business _ but it
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful exhibition operators, Sherak said, control costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's never changed about exhibition over the
years: It's a Ma and Pa business,'' Sherak said. ``It's nickels and
dimes _ and the ones who've succeeded are the ones watching
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Sherak and others, Hollywood has its own financial
woes.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, which represents the major studios, said eight of 10 films
in domestic theatrical release never recover the cost of making the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   And, Valenti said, even when all other revenue streams, from
video to overseas exhibition, are tapped, only four of 10 movies
make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making movies is a lousy business,'' Valenti said. ``It is not
an attractive, congenial marketplace to make money just in
theatrical exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherak said profit margins had been squeezed from 10 percent to
12 percent a decade ago to the current level of 2 percent to 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the exhibition industry is swimming in red ink, the
stocks of many studios' parents have soared. MGM and Sony, for
example, in the last year have seen their share prices increase 139
percent and 158 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the average cost to make and market a movie dropped
2.5 percent, to $76 million. And those that are financially
successful often rely on making money from all venues.
</P>
<P>
   For instance ``The Beach,'' which starred Leonardo DiCaprio and
cost $50 million to make (including more than $20 million for
DiCaprio), as of Monday had pulled in $38.8 million in its six-week
domestic run.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure already has been surpassed by runs in a few
European countries, including France and Britain. Its distributor,
20th Century Fox, expects to make money on the movie.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exhibitors concede that few movies make money in their
domestic runs alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Fithian said, ``if the movie doesn't make it on the
American cinema, it's not going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the half-dozen exhibition companies contacted for this
report, Goodrich was the only one that would speak on the record.
Others, including AMC, declined to talk about the issue or did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Poessiger, a local movie insider who produces the radio
show ``Jack Goes to the Movies'' and who attended ShoWest, was not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The love/hate relationship is alive and well. ... And this
whole digital conversion issue isn't helping,'' Poessiger said.
``It's strictly a one-sided deal as far as I can see in terms of
helping distribution and not exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   But exhibitors have too much at stake to complain on the record
about their treatment from Hollywood. And while Hollywood and
exhibitors thrive or perish together, Hollywood seems to have the
upper hand now because of the glut of screens, which gives it an
edge in rental negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Film rentals between studios and exhibitors are negotiated in
various ways, including declining percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a deal, in the first two weeks of a run the studio
may get 70 percent of ticket sales, 60 percent of the second two
weeks, 50 percent the next two weeks and so on.
</P>
<P>
   That system and others usually were satisfactory. But now that
movie runs are shorter because movies are being shown on so many
screens, such agreements are no longer satisfactory to exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, splits are supposed to even out at 50/50. But in
the last several years exhibitors have been paying 56 percent or 57
percent of the box office to studios.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel O'Neill, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said
exhibitors would like to use digital conversion as leverage to get
Hollywood to change the way film terms were set.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, would address exhibitors' woes until enough
older, outdated and unprofitable theaters are closed to put
exhibition on more even footing with Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood's inclination to help exhibitors is almost
nonexistent, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, for one, is not expecting handouts from Hollywood. He
says he thinks Fithian and National Association of Theatre Owners
are unrealistic if they think they are going to change a
relationship that has been the same for 30 or 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says he thinks the solution is for exhibitors to
raise ticket prices. Last year Americans paid an average of $5.08
per ticket, compared with $4.23 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the 14-year-old who's willing to pay $18 for a T-shirt
and $16 for a CD would be willing to pay significantly more for a
movie ticket,'' Goodrich said. ``Why are we theater owners so
unable to do what so many others are able to do and raise prices?''

BORING A HOLE IN OUR SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ I tried, folks, I really tried. I spent three
weeks in two shifts at spring training with the Red Sox and did my
best to find color, controversy, tension, and pizzazz.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. It is truly hopeless. Dan Duquette has accomplished the
ultimate in his Dukedom: He has assembled a team in his own boring
image. No more Foxy Lady for these guys. Now it's more like the Fox
Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Sox camp has been Tranquillity Base throughout the spring. I
think the biggest controversy was Pedro Martinez arriving a
half-hour late because he had to blow out the candles on his dad's
birthday cake in the Dominican Republic. I mean, how long would it
be before anybody noticed if Troy O'Leary stopped talking to the
media?
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Sox are a Boston sportswriter's worst nightmare _ nice
guys who stay out of trouble and say nothing inflammatory about one
another or the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm boring, I know,'' said manager Jimy Williams, a man given
to answering the most harmless question with, ``We're just playing
the schedule, trying to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest, I think when the checkout kid at the supermarket asks
Jimy, ``Paper or plastic?'' Jimy smiles and says, ``Just playing
the schedule, son. Trying to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   They won 94 games last year, then took a thrilling Division
Series from the Indians. They are Sports Illustrated cover boys,
picked to win the World Series. They have two of the premier stars
in baseball, and they own the Boston sports market. They just
aren't very funny anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we had a team meeting and said, `Let's be as boring as
possible,' '' said catcher Jason Varitek. ``Seriously, it starts
with our best people. Look at Bret Saberhagen. He's not even on the
team right now, but he's here every day, doing his work. Nomar is
one of the top five players in baseball, but he doesn't pop off.
Petey (Pedro Martinez) is a different story, but he'd never do
anything to hurt the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Team players. Careful with their words and actions off the
field. It makes me long for the good/bad old days when Oil Can
Boyd, Wade Boggs, Mike Greenwell, Roger Clemens, Jose Canseco, and
Mo Vaughn patrolled the premises. It was always something with
those guys. Wade would get run over by his wife in the family
four-wheeler and announce, ``I'm the white Irving Fryar.'' Roger
would thumb his nose and show up a week late. The Can would get a
summons from the Florida police. Greenie would get into fistfights
with teammates. Mo would flip his SUV then rip Duquette and John
Harrington as ``the joint chiefs of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin is just about the only active Sox player who
remembers the good/bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young at that time,'' said Valentin. ``Wade and
Greenwell couldn't keep their mouths shut, stuff like that. But the
game has changed. These younger players now are more serious. They
take vitamins and drink healthy shakes. It's a different mentality.
There's a lot less activity off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure. Gone are the days when the Sox were fodder for Barbara
Walters and Geraldo Rivera. It's highly unlikely Williams is going
to get a Fed-Ex package from a cocaine-dealer friend. As far as we
know, the front office hasn't hired private detectives to follow
any Boston ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Saberhagen, Stanley, and Garciaparra invest in
collections of fine wines. That's a far cry from the days when
Boggs and Tim Lollar had their names stitched on barstools at the
Howard Johnson's lounge in Winter Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said, ``I've got to be the most boring interview. It's
the personality of this team. It's also Jimy and the way he treats
people. It doesn't allow for grumbling. But I don't think we're
boring by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our superstars are as quiet as you're gonna get. On a lot of
teams, that's where you get your controversy. The biggest names are
the most vocal. But our shortstop is the exact opposite. Mo used to
be the go-to guy for the media. Now there's no one. I'm too boring.
Nomar's too nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was a teenager during the Delta House days of Sox
spring training. Baseball's Rain Man has little use for off-field
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're boring,'' he said. ``There shouldn't be
controversy and most of it is made up anyway. It's been like this
since I've been here. I don't know if other stuff would be
tolerated. When someone comes to this team, he knows what it's
going to be like. There's a certain demeanor and mentality. You
guys just make up the other stuff anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, Nomie. In the old days, it took no creativity to make
the Red Sox colorful. Who could invent Velvet Elvis, Roger running
in headphones with Daddy Butch Hobson, the Can's film festival
(Boyd got a summons for overdue X-rated videos), or Lou Gorman
reacting to a Clemens walkout with, ``The sun will rise, the sun
will set, and I'll have lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says stuff like that anymore. Not around Camp
Tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is what's on the field, not what you guys write
about,'' said Valentin. ``Now you have to work harder, and you
don't want that. You want the easy stuff. We're boring but
efficient on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Boring but efficient. The Duke Sox.

TIE KNOCKS BRUINS FOR A LOOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When coach Pat Burns was suffering through the third
period Saturday, he was thinking about the Bill Murray movie
``Groundhog Day,'' in which Murray's character wakes up every
morning and realizes it's the same day over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   In Burns's case, he felt as if he was reliving the Bruins'
blowing of leads over and over again. Boston took a three-goal
advantage into the final 20 minutes of play against the Los Angeles
Kings and watched it evaporate, settling for a 4-4 overtime tie at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The tying goal for the Kings came with only 20.7 seconds
remaining in regulation when former Bruins Glen Murray and Jozef
Stumpel combined to haunt their former club. Stumpel, along the
right boards, dished a pass in the slot to Murray, who redirected
it past goalie John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether we stopped playing or they just picked it
up,'' said Burns. ``I'm not sure yet. It's like (`Groundhog Day')
right now. I wake up and it's the same thing. It's been like that
all year. It's the same story: We get a goal scored against us. We
put guys out there who are afraid to get scored on and we get
scored on.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse tarnished the inspired performance put on by
forward Steve Heinze, who returned after missing six games because
of torn rib cartilage. Heinze, in self-deprecating fashion, had
pointed out Friday that he hadn't had 2 points in a game all
season.
</P>
<P>
   He changed that against the Kings with two goals and an assist.
This season has been an offensive wasteland for Heinze. Even with
Saturday's output, he has only 11 goals in 68 games, only three in
his last 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the game with no expectations,'' he said. ``Just
relax and play. The puck bounced my way. I could've had four goals
if I had put a couple home in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tie really muted any happiness or relief he was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a great period and you still have a sour taste in
your mouth because you gave away a lead like that,'' said Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   What made the third all the more horrid was how well Boston
played in the first two periods. The Bruins outshot, outskated, and
outplayed the Kings in every conceivable way.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Kings scored on their first shot, at 11:23 of the
first, when Luc Robitaille drilled the puck from the left point
right between Grahame's pads.
</P>
<P>
   But the next four belonged to the Bruins, who were cruising.
Andre Savage started the barrage at 15:07. Boston added three more
in the second, with Heinze figuring in on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:17, Shawn Bates, who later left the game because of a wrist
injury, stole the puck from Murray and charged in on goalie
Stephane Fiset, who pokechecked the puck away. But Heinze was there
in the slot, corralled the puck, and beat Fiset for his 10th of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Heinze struck again at 13:40. Ken Belanger set up the score when
he picked off Stumpel and dished a pass to Heinze, who slalomed
down the slot, alternating between his backhand and forehand,
before banking a forehand shot off the stick of defenseman Aki Berg
and into the net for the 3-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston tallied his 15th of the year with a shot from
below the right circle at 18:05 on the power play, banking it in
off Fiset for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray replaced Fiset at the start of the third
with Jamie Storr, and Los Angeles' dormant attack came alive.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started just 48 seconds in when Murray scored on the
power play. At 8:07, Salisbury native Bob Corkum made it 4-3. The
meltdown continued with Murray's second goal at 19:39.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were skating well, shooting the puck at the net, and
playing with a fear of losing a little bit and not being
embarrassed,'' said Burns. ``Then in the third period, they turn it
on and all of a sudden, we're in a game. They looked pretty good in
the third period, putting us on our butts pretty good.''

BLUES' BREAKTHROUGH WELL-PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAGUE NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two weeks from Sunday, the St. Louis Blues will most
likely lay claim to the Presidents Trophy, awarded to the NHL's
most successful team during the 82-game preliminaries to the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The honor is based on fact (the best regular-season record)
rather than opinion, but no one is more worthy than the Blues.
Their mastery of every aspect of the game _ goaltending, defense,
penalty killing, offensive balance, coaching _ made them the first
NHL team this season to record 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list of reasons for St. Louis's success is the
contribution of its minor leaguers. No other NHL organization has
relied upon, or benefited as much from, the American and
International Hockey Leagues as the Blues. More than half of St.
Louis's players were developed in its farm systems; even its front
office and coaching staff were groomed in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   An entire line came through Worcester (the Blues' AHL
affiliate), and their resident pest and an impact rookie also spent
plenty of time at the Centrum. Both goaltenders and a key
defenseman also paid their dues in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, we've been developing NHL players in a
competitive, successful environment,'' said John Ferguson Jr., who
is Worcester's general manager and the assistant GM in St. Louis.
``Our philosophy is to prime the pump. It's worked even quicker
than we thought it might.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk of development and minor league pipelines would have
been heresy under former GM/coach Mike Keenan. When he departed St.
Louis in 1997 after 2 1/2 seasons, he left a team weighted down
with aging free agent acquisitions under long-term contracts and a
demoralized AHL affiliate plagued by constant, seemingly impulsive
recalls and demotions.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan would summon players to participate in a morning skate,
then fly them back to Worcester afterward. Those days are long
gone. Instead, the Blues utilize an unofficial ``three-year plan,''
roughly the amount of time a prospect is granted to show whether he
has NHL potential.
</P>
<P>
   After Keenan was fired, Larry Pleau was named GM, and he hired
Joel Quenneville as coach. Both had prepped for NHL jobs in the
minors, Pleau with the Rangers' and Whalers' systems and
Quenneville as coach in Springfield (AHL) in 1993-94. The Blues
then began to retool, placing an emphasis on development rather
than free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is not to have someone play for two or three
years, but to play for 10 years for the St. Louis Blues,'' Ferguson
said. ``We started to develop our players by giving them important
minutes and high expectations. Our whole outlook is to work to
produce players.''
</P>
<P>
   It's paid off better than the Blues could have imagined. The
dynamic ``Slovak Pak'' line of Pavol Demitra, Michal Handzus, and
Lubos Bartecko all skated in Worcester, though Demitra's background
is a bit more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Originally property of Ottawa, Demitra broke his hand early in
his professional career while with the Senators' Prince Edward
Island AHL team. But Ferguson, a scout with the Senators when
Demitra was drafted in 1993, was aware of his potential. The Blues
traded for Demitra three years later, and he has proven Ferguson's
acumen. With 28 goals and 46 assists, Demitra is St. Louis's
leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   If Demitra is Exhibit A of how minor league seasoning can pay
off, then center Marty Reasoner is Exhibit B. A star on Boston
College's 1998 NCAA final team, Reasoner received a 22-game NHL
baptism last year. The Blues' No. 1 draft pick in 1996 was
Worcester's top scorer when he was recalled for the second time
this season last month and has nine goals in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bergevin experienced a career resurrection in the early
1990s when he played on two Calder Cup teams in Springfield under
Jim Roberts. Now one of St. Louis's steadiest defensemen, he gets
his marching orders from Roberts, a Quenneville assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Jamie McLennan, the backup to Roman Turek (himself
plucked from Dallas's system after last season), resuscitated his
career in Worcester in 1996-97; the summer before, he nearly died
of meningitis before completing a year with the IceCats. He's in
his third season with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Tyson Nash, the Blues' chief agitator, spent last
season in Worcester. Center Johan Hecht, defenseman Ricard Persson,
and right wing Jamal Mayers also there played at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rule A in minor league hockey: When the parent club calls, the
farm team answers as quickly as possible. But the result often
isn't positive for the minor league affiliate. Such is the case in
Providence, which has run through 54 players while providing some
of its leading names to the injury-riddled parent club in Boston.
So severe was the personnel shortage that only 14 skaters dressed
for a recent game, and the Baby B's have been scouring for players
everywhere from the IHL to the East Coast Hockey League to the
United Hockey League. Typical of the Baby B's situation: Just when
it appeared they had an offensive linchpin in New Hampshire's Jason
Krog, the Islanders recalled the reigning Hobey Baker winner
Thursday. Krog had been loaned to Providence earlier in the month
from Lowell and earned last week's AHL Player of the Week honors
with six goals and five assists in four games. Still, the defending
Calder Cup champs clinched a playoff berth Wednesday . . . Many
comings and goings from Tsongas Arena, including a trade involving
Lowell and the IHL. Former BC standout Dave Hymovitz was dealt to
Chicago and ex-UMass-Lowell center Jeff Daw headed to the Lock
Monsters from Houston. In late February, center Craig Charron was
traded back to Lowell, his college town, from St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The annual late-season signing period has begun, as players
whose collegiate seasons are finished try their hand at the pros.
Among the first to hook on are two former Northeastern Huskies,
center Roger Holeczy and right wing Billy Newson, both of whom
joined New Orleans (ECHL) . . . Gordie Howe as a Detroit Red Wing?
Of course. Howe as a Hartford Whaler? Sure. As a member of the
Syracuse Crunch? Not really, but that's the answer to a question in
the latest edition of Trivial Pursuit. The board game asks: ``Whose
cameo appearance with the AHL's Syracuse Crunch made him the only
puckster to skate actively in six decades?'' Howe is given as the
answer, but his plan to play in Syracuse in 1997 never materialized
and he wound up taking one shift with the IHL's Detroit Vipers
during the 1997-98 season. But it's absolutely no problem with the
Crunch. ``I think it's great that we're getting all this mileage
out of it,'' said general manager Vance Lederman . . . Logo of the
Week: Augusta, Ga., is a pretty august place, what with the
Masters. So when the ECHL's Raleigh IceCaps relocated to the city
two seasons ago, their new nickname reflected a dual meaning. The
link of the Lynx to the genteel sport of golf is obvious, and the
feline connection is honored by a live lynx which resides in a cage
in the Richmond County Civic Center during home games. One
question: Should Tiger Woods be informed of this?

KASPER NOT EAGER TO REVISIT GHOSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Steve Kasper is an agent now, likes his life of
representing players, and doesn't long for the days of being behind
an NHL bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given that a thought,'' Kasper said last week,
reflecting on the business only some 24 hours after Robbie Ftorek,
his Devils in first place in the Eastern Conference, was given the
gate in New Jersey. ``I mean, the idea of being successful, and
then having to pick up every two or three years, that's not really
appealing to me at this point in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in Bruins Country who need reminding, Kasper was
behind the bench here in the Hub when the Bruins last finished out
of the playoffs. Only three years later, the Black and Gold club
coached by Pat Burns is about to meet a similar fate, unless there
is another version of the Massachusetts Miracle staged on Causeway
Street in the last two weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond how they'll be compared in their futility, there really
isn't much in common between Kasper's 1996-97 Bruins and today's
lackluster lot under Burns. For two seasons, Kasper and assistant
Cap Raeder were in charge of an aging squad with some key stars _
Ray Bourque, Adam Oates, and Cam Neely _ that desperately needed an
infusion of young support players. When the old guys fell apart,
Mssrs. Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell decided it was time to cut
with the past and ditched the likes of Oates, Rick Tocchet, and
Bill Ranford, all of whom were dispatched to D.C. in the swap for
Jason Allison, Anson Carter, and Jim Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The employment equation changed drastically not only on the
roster, but behind the bench, too. When the smoke cleared, and
everyone was talking about moving ahead with youth (the club Burns
inherited), Kasper and Raeder were left looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Sinden sincerely believes Kasper did a good
job behind the bench. Sinden said last week it was the public
outcry over how Kasper handled one incident _ the benching of Neely
and Kevin Stevens in a game at Toronto _ that ultimately left him
with no choice but to make the change in coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt his public persona,'' said Sinden, referring to the
Neely benching that riled vox populi. ``But I thought he was a
damned good coach. I likened him to Terry O'Reilly _ maybe not
quite right there yet, but on his way to being a damned good coach.
It's just that the public perception was so strong against him,
after benching Neely and the fact that we finished last. Everyone
was focusing on that. We couldn't move beyond it. I had no
rebuttal. If you recall, I was in his corner over the benching
thing. Between that, though, and finishing last . . . for the
organization's sake, I really had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in a wide-ranging interview with the Globe,
team owner Jeremy Jacobs identified Kasper and the much-beloved Don
Cherry as two of the club's worst coaches in his quarter-century of
ownership. Neither Sinden nor Kasper chose to comment directly
about Jacobs's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he felt that way,'' said Sinden. ``Overall, I'd
liken Steve's situation to changes you sometimes see in government.
You'll see situations where the government is good, but the leaders
get tossed because economics are down. Other times, you see bad
leaders keep jobs simply because economics are good. Steve Kasper
got caught in that political situation with Cam and there was just
no getting beyond it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasper remains ever the loyalist, even while suffering the
slings and arrows from the owner's office in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole season, right to the last game, we played hard,''
he said. ``We were just a team short on talent. I'll just say that
I know what we had and I think we got a lot out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How are the Bruins going to go about rebuilding the franchise?
Well, they haven't dared to spend with the big boys since the
summer of '95 when they swapped for Stevens and Shawn McEachern,
and they did that then because they knew they had seats to fill
with the opening of the new and bigger FleetCenter. After this
season's flop, and Bourque's departure, empty seats loom again. But
will management spend again? At the moment, it appears they have no
choice. If so, two names to keep in mind: 1. Brendan Shanahan and
2. Keith Tkachuk. Shanahan is an unrestricted free agent as of July
1 and will be looking for at least $6 million-plus a year.
Tkachuk's deal in Phoenix increases to $8.3 million next season,
which has made him virtually an untradeable commodity (remember
Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos calling Tkachuk's deal ``a stupid
contract''?). But with last summer's drastic drop in free agent
prices _ everywhere except Manhattan _ the likes of Shanahan and,
eventually, Tkachuk, ultimately might have to look at smaller
paydays. At a price around $5 million or $6 million, the Bruins
could be enticed by Shanahan or Tkachuk _ more so Shanahan, because
they wouldn't have to give up bodies in the acquisition . . . There
isn't a single NHLer who would take the ice without putting on a
protective cup and pulling on elbow pads and shinguards. But the
vast majority choose to play without eye protection. Go figure. In
light of Bryan Berard's tragic accident a couple of weeks ago, the
matter is just now getting proper attention. Kudos to Toronto boss
Ken Dryden, who stated the obvious last week, noting that sooner or
later everyone will wear eye protection. ``And why not sooner than
later?'' asked Dryden. Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Ftorek was skilled. He is also a skilled X's and
O's guy. What he needs, obviously, is a crash course in people
skills. No doubt he'll get another chance, but it will take a
cooling off period, similar to the waiting game Mike Keenan has had
to play since getting turfed in Vancouver, his fifth club. Bedside
manner isn't addressed in the Coach's Manual, but eventually every
good coach has to develop it, or at least figure out the facade . .
. Now that Eric Lindros has burned the bridge in Philadelphia even
before he departs, what do the Flyers do? L'Enfant Terrible
unloaded on club management and medical staff last week after
learning, via second opinion, that he suffered a Grade 2 concussion
when hit recently by Boston defenseman Hal Gill. The Flyers'
medical staff had told him his problem was migraine headaches. It's
obvious the two sides can't live with one another, but where are
the Flyers going to find a suitor for Lindros, his $8.5 million
salary, and his dicey medical history, including last year's
collapsed lung and numerous concussions? The only potential landing
spot could be the Rangers, who would be only too happy to unload
their No. 1 headache, Theo Fleury. Another out for the Flyers could
be to hope that Lindros gets a Group 2 (free agent) offer sheet
over the summer and they pick up five first-round picks as
compensation . . . Ken London, former producer/director of Channel
38's Bruins broadcasts, figures Bourque has played the equivalent
of more than a full season shorthanded. The rough math: Bourque
will have played some 1,525 games by season's end and,
conservatively, he was on the ice at least four minutes per game
while the Bruins/Avalanche killed penalties _ a total of 6,100
minutes, or approximately 100 games. It proves two things: 1.
Bourque could use a breather; 2. London has a little too much spare
time on his hands.

   Chris Pronger has emerged as a viable (leading?) candidate for
the Hart Trophy, awarded to the league's Most Valuable Player. The
last defenseman to win it was Bobby Orr, who rattled off three
(1970-72). Another great Bruins blue liner, Eddie Shore, won it
four times in the '30s . . . Ex-BU forward Mike Grier will be out
of the Edmonton lineup at least three weeks, following surgery to
repair a torn left triceps and tendon near the elbow . . . For
better or worse, Mike Vernon will be Florida's No. 1 goalie for the
playoffs. He's not the best answer, but he's better than Trevor
Kidd . . . As of Saturday, the brothers Bure (Pavel and Valeri)
were within one goal of tying the brothers Hull (Bobby and Dennis)
for most NHL goals by brothers in a season. Bobby scored 58 and
Dennis 30 for the record of 88, set in '68-69. As of Friday
morning, Pavel had 52 for the Panthers and Valeri 35 for the
Flames. ``It doesn't matter if he scores 88 and I score 1,'' said
Valeri. ``It will be our record. If we do it, it will be something
special.'' . . . Sergei Zubov's new deal in Dallas will bring him
$25 million over five years. Is he that good? Probably not. But it
underscores, once more, the value of a legitimate quarterback to
work the point during power plays . . . Detroit coach Scotty Bowman
didn't win friends in NHL headquarters with his skewering of
referees Dave Jackson and Rob Shick following the Wings' 4-3 win
over Colorado. He added to the insult when he fingered Bryan Lewis,
director of officiating, for not assigning one or two of the top
refs _ Bill McCreary, Kerry Fraser, Don Koharski, or Dan Marouelli,
by Bowman's account _ to such a key game. Bowman wound up with a
$7,500 fine for his tirade . . . As with the Marty McSorley
incident, there is no defending Scott Niedermayer for chopping
Florida tough guy Peter Worrell over the head with his stick
(Niedermayer was suspended 10 games). But Worrell goes over the top
sometimes. Witness: his throat-slashing gestures, which the league
promptly outlawed . . . Ron Tugnutt, recently dealt from Ottawa to
Pittsburgh for Tom Barrasso, would be a logical candidate to move
to Tampa Bay as a free agent in the offseason. Remember, Bolts boss
Rick Dudley was Senators GM when Tugnutt was north of the border,
and Tampa Bay needs a veteran hand to bring along Dan Cloutier . .
. Only two clubs have fired coaches in the second half of the
season and gone on to win the Cup. The Leafs ditched Art Duncan for
Dick Irvin and won in '32. The Habs dumped Claude Ruel and won with
Al MacNeil calling the shots in '71 _ and with Dryden stopping
everything in net . . . Kelly Buchberger, when asked if he had any
say when it came to his being dealt from Atlanta to Los Angeles:
``I'm not Ray Bourque _ I don't have that luxury.'' In the end, not
even Bourque had that luxury.

PHOENIX NOT LETTING SEASON TURN TO ASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last week, after helping Phoenix defeat the Celtics,
Penny Hardaway took a moment to reflect on how his new team does
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, they have great management,'' said Hardaway. ``They have
a great staff overall. They make sure everything is up to par.
Before we leave the building, if there's anything we need, they get
it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, there was something the Suns needed. And they
went after it right away, before Hardaway &AMP; Co. left America West
Arena after dispatching the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Just before halftime of the Kings game, Suns sparkplug Jason
Kidd went down with a broken ankle. Before the game was over, Suns
executives Bryan Colangelo and Cotton Fitzsimmons were tossing
around names. Colangelo put the initials ``KJ'' at the bottom of
his list and circled them. Fitzsimmons liked what he saw and picked
up the phone, making an SOS call to Kevin Johnson, who retired
after the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' said Suns CEO Jerry Colangelo, ``things move
quickly around here.''
</P>
<P>
   And KJ, who said he spurned other offers last year because it
wouldn't have felt right wearing a uniform other than Phoenix's, is
scheduled to be back in a Phoenix uniform Sunday night against the
Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   No one could replace Kidd, who will be a first-team All-NBA
selection (or should be) and one of the top five MVP candidates.
But KJ is as good a fallback as one could envision. He just turned
34, and while he hasn't played in two years, he claims to be in
excellent shape _ somehow we can't imagine otherwise _ and will get
a full month to get back into the flow. Even more important, he'll
be eligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought this day would come,'' Johnson said upon
arriving back in the Valley of the Sun. ``I don't think anybody can
anticipate something like this. But it's the life we live and the
twists that come our way. I never thought I'd say this, but it's
good to see you (media) guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns proved again that, as the late, great Ron Grinker liked
to say, they play chess while the others play checkers. They have
had an incredible string of misfortune this season, ranging from
Tom Gugliotta's near-fatal seizure, to Penny's foot problems (22
games missed), to Shawn Marion's knee woes, to Gugliotta's
season-ending knee injury, to Rex Chapman's appendectomy. There
also was Danny Ainge's abrupt resignation. Somehow, they have risen
above it all and, entering the weekend, had the fifth-best record
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who had tired of Orlando (and vice versa), is
continually amazed at how the Suns operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once (Orlando) management kind of turned against me, I knew I
couldn't win the battle; once they gave up on me, it was time to
go,'' he said. ``Here, they come in and tell you what's on their
minds. That's the biggest thing. If they have a problem, they tell
you. That's the way it has to be. It'd save a lot of relationships
if you could just be straightforward instead of trying to go behind
players' backs and affecting their games.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Kidd is a devastating loss both individually to
Hardaway and to the Suns. KJ will help. But Kidd is a magnet for
others because he gets them the ball. The first words out of
Hardaway's mouth Monday when he was asked what he liked most about
Phoenix were ``Jason Kidd.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes that they're letting him just be Penny. He may not
be an All-Star Game regular anymore (last appearance, 1998) or an
annual All-NBA selection (last appearance, 1997) but he is happy to
blend in. He's been the big fish in the little pond, and it didn't
go well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where I had to be Superman in
Orlando,'' he said. ``Once I got hurt, no one wanted to accept that
I wasn't the same player at that time. I had knee surgery. I
couldn't come back and play like they wanted me to play. I was a
wimp. Chuck (Daly) came in and wanted instant success. The year
before, I had 40-plus points, back-to-back, in the playoffs against
Miami. That's the player he wanted. But I still had knee problems.
I had to have a second surgery. And he gave up on me. I couldn't
reach his expectations with a 10-foot pole. If I couldn't get
there, it wasn't accepted. He had high standards and I couldn't
produce for him the way he wanted. He gave up on me. That's just
the way it went.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Boston will be crawling with NBA executives and scouts over the
next few days. The reason: the annual McDonald's High School
All-Star Game is Wednesday night at the FleetCenter. Scouts and
general managers are likely to be more interested in watching the
practices (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday) and the scrimmage (Tuesday)
than the actual game, which has turned into a glorified
dunk-o-rama. ``The games have been disappointing ever since the
high school exodus started,'' said Celtics GM Chris Wallace.
``They've disintegrated into these rock-and-jock contests where
there's no defense and everything is `can you top this?' The
practices can be more revealing. And it's also better to either see
these guys with their own high school team or at a summer event.''
There are six kids thought to be considering a direct jump to the
NBA. The best of the lot, 6-foot-9-inch Eddie Griffin from Roman
Catholic in Philadelphia, is believed to be thinking about honoring
his commitment to Seton Hall. How's that for a concept? But 6-9
Darius Miles of East St. Louis, Ill., who has committed to St.
John's, and 6-7 Gerald Wallace, of Childersburg, Ala., who has
committed to Alabama, are thought to be closer to taking the
plunge. (The Blue Ribbon Yearbook said last fall that Wallace and
Griffin were further along than Al Harrington, Tracy McGrady, and
Jonathan Bender were at this point.) Another, Jerome ``Buddy''
Harper, who hails from Columbia, S.C., is thought to be coming out
as well. He's a 6-6 shooting guard who has bounced from school to
school and may have eligibility concerns. Two others thought to be
considering: DeShawn Stevenson, a 6-5 guard from Fresno, Calif.,
and Alton Ford, a 6-9 Karl Malone-in-the-making from Houston.
Wallace said he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about when
the topic turns to high schoolers turning pro. ``I think it's been
overblown,'' he said. ``First of all, you're talking about a
handful of kids. It's not like we're getting 30 guys every year.
Yes, a few shouldn't have done it. But how can you legislate away
the freedom of a Kevin Garnett or a Kobe Bryant to protect a Red
McDavid? And the teams that drafted these guys would do so again.
Rashard Lewis (a second-rounder in 1998) would probably be a top 15
pick if that draft were redone. Where I think it does hurt the
league is on the promotional end. You don't see these guys in
college and it takes a while for them to get the recognition they
would have had had they gone to a Final Four or two.'' The Celtics
have several McDonald's alums, from Pervis Ellison to Paul Pierce.
Asked about the game, Pierce said, ``It was something special for
me because I had a chance to showcase my skills against the top
players. It gave me a lot of confidence going into college.'' That
year, the game also featured Garnett, Vince Carter, Stephon
Marbury, and Shareef Abdur-Rahim. But Pierce also says he found his
college experience invaluable. ``It was important to me,'' he said.
``I don't think I was ready or mature enough to make that jump.
College days are some of the best days of your life. It's the last
chance you have to still be a kid and have a lot of fun, because
once you get to the NBA, it's all work. Some of the things you
experience in college, you don't get a chance to do. I'm glad I had
a chance to go.''

   Notre Dame has advanced to the semifinals of the National
Invitation Tournament in New York, and there's one man watching the
Irish with a certain degree of smugness: John MacLeod. He spent
eight seasons in South Bend and now is back in the NBA as the
treasured ``veteran assistant'' on Scott Skiles's Phoenix staff.
MacLeod has bittersweet memories of his years at Notre Dame. He
never got the Irish into any postseason tournaments, and there was
a ``Forever .500'' feel about them during his years. But he's proud
that he helped get them into a conference. (The school was an
independent until 1995-96.) ``I campaigned like heck to get Notre
Dame into a conference,'' said MacLeod. ``When we joined the Big
East, it was a lot tougher than it is now. And it was the right
move for Notre Dame basketball.'' A sore spot: He feels his
reputation as a recruiter was belittled, even though he got Troy
Murphy and Matt Carroll to come to South Bend. ``We recruited one
heck of a group of kids,'' he said. ``Both of those guys are going
to be NBA players. And, against a lot of odds, we did an excellent
job of recruiting. We didn't have a lot of support in that area.
When your ability to recruit is questioned publicly, in the papers,
while you are in the middle of the recruiting process, that's what
I refer to as not getting the support you need. It's tough enough
to recruit as it is without having your ability as a recruiter
questioned in the middle of the recruiting process. That's what was
taking place.'' . . . Another ringing endorsement of the Clipper
Way, courtesy of Rodney Rogers: ``They don't try to do anything.
They just try to stay the same and they don't care that players
want to leave or get traded. The owner doesn't care. The front
office doesn't care. You end up showing up and collecting the
check. It's no fun out there at all.'' . . . One of the great
late-season stories is the somewhat startling success of the
Pistons. Detroit had lost 11 straight on the road. But when the
Pistons headed out West under interim coach George Irvine, who is
doing what he wants because he's not interested in the job, what
happens? Detroit beats Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland to start
the trip, improving to 7-2 under Irvine. Against the Sonics and
Blazers, Grant Hill, nursing a sore ankle, scored 28 fourth-quarter
points on 14-of-19 shooting. ``George has been smart,'' Hill said
after the Portland game. ``He doesn't run me dog-tired. In the
past, I'd get tired down the stretch. Not to make excuses, but when
I'm fresh down the stretch, I play better.'' . . . Speaking of the
Blazers, they will use Jermaine O'Neal a lot more now that Arvydas
Sabonis is out indefinitely with a sprained right foot. Old friend
Joe Kleine also could be exhumed for real playing time. That's why
he's there . . . Indiana's 21-point loss to Milwaukee Thursday
night was the Pacers' worst home setback since a 24-pointer to
Sacramento in November 1995. The Pacers were booed as they left the
court at halftime. Imagine that . . . Those frolicking Bulls are on
track to become the lowest-scoring team over a full season since
1954-55. Of course, the Bulls took scoring to a new low last year,
when they (a) averaged 81.9 points a game and (b) erupted for 49 in
a game against Miami. They are about 3 points below the 1954-55
Milwaukee Hawks, which, given their personnel, can hardly be termed
a shocker.

UCONN'S DEPTH STOPS OKLAHOMA; LSU IS NEXT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ The Connecticut women's basketball team, ranked
first in the nation all season, is a caravan of steamrollers
hurtling down the highway at breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: the Round of 8.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are fortunate to field five good players; Connecticut
boasts a continuous wave of all-world and all-American talent,
undeniable and interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   When Oklahoma players peeled themselves off the court,
Connecticut's substitutes hovered over them Saturday, eclipsing the
Sooners' sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you feel kind of smothered, you can't breathe,''
Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale said after the game. ``It was like each
basket gave us oxygen just to get us through to the next one, and
there it comes again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the top-seeded Huskies flattened the fifth-seeded
Sooners, 102-80, in the East Regional of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament to advance to the Round of 8 for
the sixth time in seven years. Eleven Connecticut players scored,
five in double figures. Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams _ the
sophomore forwards who come off the bench _ led their team with 16
points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut will play third-seeded Louisiana State on Monday for
a berth in the Final Four in Philadelphia. LSU defeated Duke,
79-66, in the earlier regional semifinal Saturday at Alltel
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some pretty talented players on our team; it could be
any two or three people any night,'' said Shea Ralph, the UConn
starting guard who scored 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have starting post players that wear out their starting
post players and then we put two more in. We don't miss a beat. A
lot of time, they're even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Every player Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma recruited was an
all-American in high school. Ralph and Williams, were national
players of the year. So was Kelly Schumacher, in Canada, and
Svetlana Abrosimova, in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There is remarkable depth on the UConn team, which crushed
opponents by an average margin of 31.7 points this season. With
five players who average double figures, the balance always seems
to be in the Huskies' favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the Microsoft of women's basketball,'' Auriemma
said. ``Somebody can sue us when we have a monopoly on the game.
But we don't have a monopoly on the game. Tennessee does with all
their championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has one national title to Tennessee's six. The two
could meet in this year's championship game, three contests away.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Huskies were seeded No. 1 in the East Regional
was in 1995, when they were undefeated and won their only title.
This season the Huskies are winning just as convincingly as that
team.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two rounds of this tournament, the Huskies beat
their opponents by an average of 54.5 points, holding them to an
average of 45 points. Although the Sooners scored 42 points by
halftime, the Huskies had already established their defensive tone.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma actually took a 9-6 lead with 16 minutes 34 seconds
remaining in the first half. Connecticut responded by unleashing an
18-0 run in a frantic three minutes, which included six steals.
UConn caused 33 turnovers in the game.Twenty-one of them came on
steals.
</P>
<P>
   As Oklahoma pulled within 57-42 at the half, the Sooners
celebrated each shot as if it were a moral victory. Within the
first five minutes of the second half, though, Connecticut raced to
a 67-46 lead. Jones scored 12 of her 16 points in the second half
to keep the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to score as many points as we can,'' Abrosimova said.
``Our defense is really aggressive. We don't look at the scoreboard
and say, `We're up by 20, we can stop playing.' We just keep
pressing. We keep pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Phylesha Whaley, the only senior for Oklahoma, which was making
its first appearance in the Round of 16, said the Sooners had no
answer for Connecticut's depth. ``You can't tell when one comes
in,'' she said. ``They don't drop off.''
</P>
<P>
   With 36.8 seconds left, 6-6 forward Christine Rigby, who plays
just four minutes per game, sunk a perfect left-handed hook shot
that broke the 100-point mark. She finished the play by converting
the foul shot, an exclamation point to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma said: ``They better not be satisfied. We're not done
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State (25-6) was trailing Duke, last year's national
runner-up, by 5 points with 12:56 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then the LSU junior guard Marie Ferdinand leapt to make a steal,
scored a quick layup and ignited an 18-4 run that sent the Tigers
to the Round of 8 for the first time in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore DeTrina White gave her team a boost on the boards
in the second half, finishing with 11 rebounds and 19 points. She
led four starters who had been together for 61 games past a young
Duke team down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``All throughout the season my team has fed off me,'' said
Ferdinand, who finished with a game-high 22 points, 11 in the final
12 minutes. ``I got the team a lift and I was able to get the run
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State held the Blue Devils, usually 37 percent
shooters beyond the arc, to just 5 for 22 from 3-point range.
Louisiana State, meanwhile, shot 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``LSU played the game we wanted to play; they always made the
extra pass,'' said Duke's Lauren Rice, who led her team in scoring
with 17 points. ``We tried to trap them, but then Ferdinand ended
up with easy layups in the lane.''

KINGS SETTLE FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maybe you don't have to play all 60 minutes like the
coach keeps insisting. Maybe the Los Angeles Kings found a few
shamrocks left over from St. Patty's Day, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Murray knows there are no maybes when the playoffs
begin in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He knows Saturday afternoon's 4-4 tie with the Boston Bruins in
front of 17,565 at the Fleet Center will not be a tie against the
Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Murray took no solace in watching his team overcome a three-goal
deficit in the final period to force overtime against the
disappointing Bruins. The Kings had dug such a hole that Murray
unleashed a stick-throwing tirade before the third period that
still had him shaken after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have to realize that in the National Hockey League
you just can't turn it on and off,'' Murray said. ``It was
disgusting the way we played the first 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after playing probably their most inspired game of
the season last Thursday in Philadelphia. The Kings tied that game
with 2:15 left in regulation and won it 3-2 in overtime, both on
goals by Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they broke down after Luc Robitaille gave them a
1-0lead midway through the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored the next four goals, including two by Scott
Heinze. Brian Rolston made it 4-1 with less than two minutes left
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings (35-30-10, 84 points) remain fifth in the
Western Conference with seven games to play, Murray knows it is
just as easy to get bounced from there in the first round as it is
from the eighth and final spot.
</P>
<P>
   So Murray pulled goaltender Stephane Fiset after two periods,
not out of disgust but out of respect for the game played in
Philadelphia and concern for the way his teammates let him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fiset) did not deserve what we did to him,'' said Glen
Murray, who scored twice in the second period, including the second
with 21 seconds remaining in regulation. ``I don't know what it
was, whether it was the afternoon game or a letdown after
Philadelphia or whatever. It never should have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the goal that gave the Bruins a 2-1 lead. Shawn Bates stole
the puck away from Bryan Smolinski along the boards. Bates tried a
backhander against Fiset, but the puck rebounded to the slot where
Heinze fired it for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   And not on the next goal when Stumpel turned it over and Heinze
wound up with his second and a 3-1 Boston lead with 13:40 in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other signs of the breakdown. The Kings were
outshot 17-4 in the first period. Kelly Buchberger and Aki Berg
were called for penalties in the Boston end during the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played so bad, it could have been 5-0 after one,'' said Ian
Laperriere. ``Not a lot of people know how intense the coach can
be. He let us have it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Murray stopped yelling, the Kings took off. They even
could have won it when a high-sticking penalty by Kyle McLaren gave
them 1:54 on the power play in OT.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings caught their first break just 28 seconds into the
third period when Dave Van Impe was called for holding. Seventeen
seconds later, Glen Murray took a pass from Stumpel in the corner
and one-timed it past Bruins goaltender John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd started to buzz. The Bruins, considered a playoff
contender before the season, has faltered badly. On Thursday, they
took a two-goal lead into the third and lost 4-3 to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started playing too tight,'' Heinze said. ``We played not
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made it a one-goal game at 8:07 when Bob Corkum skated
from behind the net and fired the puck past Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   Boston continued to fade and the Kings kept on the pressure.
With a minute to go, the Kings pulled Jamie Storr, who replaced
Fiset. Stumpel, one of two centers on the ice, took the puck out of
the corner and fed Murray in front.
</P>
<P>
   With 21 seconds left, Murray scored his 26th of the year, one
behind injured Ziggy Palffy for second on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good that we came back, but bad that we had to,'' Garry
Galley said. ``This is why St. Louis has the best record in the
league. Every night they are consistent. That's where we need to
get. In a hurry.''

JORDAN'S COMMENTS TOWARD CARTER ARE, ER, DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Toronto forward Vince Carter has grown tired of
the increasing comparisons to Michael Jordan this season, but they
must be gaining some validity.
</P>
<P>
   Because this week, the hyper-competitive Jordan went out of his
way to take a shot at ``Air Canada,'' just as he is blossoming into
the NBA's best marketing tool for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   That's a role Jordan owned in the '90s, and even though he's
retired, don't expect him to be gracious toward anyone who might be
considered a worthy successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince doesn't play defense,'' Jordan said. ``Kobe (Bryant) can
play both ends. Right now, (Bryant) is the better player.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had a simple response to Jordan's comments: ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan continued by paying a backhanded compliment to Carter's
offensive skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince Carter is probably the worst thing for (Bryant) because
Vince can dunk and do all the incredible things and that makes Kobe
want to do them, too, for the notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter wasn't amused. ``I don't care what anybody says about (my
defense),'' he said. ``People (make critical comments) for a
reason. Everybody has an opinion on everybody else. It's no
different than hearing it from anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The stunning aspect of Jordan's criticism is that he slammed a
fellow North Carolina alumnus, which is supposed to be one of the
tightest and most loyal cliques in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do (stick together),'' Carter said. ``But (Jordan) is a
popular guy. We don't see him much.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was asked if he had any sort of relationship with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't surprise many of Jordan's Bulls teammates, who
would have a similar answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   The self-serving comments continued for Jordan this week, when
he announced he would no longer make endorsements once his current
contracts expire. It's a little late for Jordan to find religion on
this topic, after shamelessly hawking himself for the past 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Music buff: Nets coach Don Casey was introduced to a member of
the pop group 'N Sync this week. ``Is that one of those bands that
hums?'' Casey asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sundown in Phoenix: No team has experienced worse injury
problems than the Suns, and that was before Jason Kidd broke his
ankle Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Kidd's injury, the Suns temporarily lost Tom Gugliotta
after he suffered a seizure, and then for the rest of the season
after his knee injury. Penny Hardaway missed 21 games with a torn
foot muscle, and Rex Chapman underwent emergency surgery for an
appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, center Oliver Miller got into an
altercation this week with assistant coach Phil Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather not talk about it,'' Miller said, although he
did apologize to Suns president Bryan Colangelo. No word if he
apologized to Weber.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kidd, he is expected to return for the Olympics in
September, but his return for the playoffs is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   No Nike fan: Sonics small forward Ruben Patterson has been out
with a swelled Achilles' tendon, and he swears the injury is the
result of his Nikes, after a MRI proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to wear Nikes anymore,'' Patterson said. ``Gary
(Payton) went through it. Vin (Baker) went through it. I think it's
just how Nikes are made.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time a player has blamed his shoes for an
injury. Earlier this year, the Suns' Hardaway blamed his Nikes for
contributing to his foot problems.
</P>
<P>
   Easy on Rider: Miami coach Pat Riley was intrigued by the
possibility of adding released/troubled Hawks guard Isaiah Rider,
but since Rider would be ineligible for the playoffs, Riley will
wait until the offseason to make a run at the enigmatic shooting
guard.
</P>
<P>
   New league: The NBA is close to announcing formation of a new
minor league in the fall of 2001, with eight to 12 teams in non-NBA
cities playing in arenas of around 10,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The league is concerned about the growing number of young
players trying to make the jump to the NBA. There was one redshirt
freshman, four true freshman and two high school players in last
year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would always prefer that (a player) goes to college,'' NBA
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Legally, we can't require
it. So, if he has made the decision not to (go to college), but
he's not quite ready to play in the NBA, we think having some other
league where we could closely monitor him would be better for the
player and ultimately better for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the NBA can make a little money on the side ... so much
the better.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious downfall is that too many marginal players will
forgo college, preferring to play in the developmental league.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 spot: The Mavericks have added former Lakers coach Del
Harris and former Wizards coach Gar Heard, bringing to 10 the
number of assistants on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Peter Vecsey of the New York Post to write: ``The
Mavericks team plane now has three classes ... first, coach and
assistant coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mavs owner Mark Cuban didn't appreciate Vecsey's criticism
regarding Cuban's hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quote me on this; Peter Vecsey is an idiot,'' Cuban
said.

TURIN OUT TO CHANGE ITS IMAGE WITH '06 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ Their calling cards still say ``candidate city''
and from time to time the organizers will catch themselves
reverting to bidding mode. ``Bid? Basta! (Enough!),'' says
committee chief executive Evelina Christillin with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Turin, the old industrial city on the banks of the Po, will be
hosting the 2006 Olympic Winter (si, Winter) Games. The Lords of
the Rings decreed it last June in Seoul when they chose this city
of a million people over the Swiss hamlet of Sion in a startling
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the victory, there were very few people who thought we
could win,'' says Marco San Pietro, the committee's international
relations director.
</P>
<P>
   And now, nine months later, it's finally sinking in that the
world is coming and the clock is ticking. Though the Games are
still six years away, everything must be up and running by the
autumn of 2004. But until the government turns over the $600
million needed to build everything from the ice rinks to the bob
run, nothing can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have time,'' says Christillin. ``But we have no time
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turinese, who had never before bid for the Games, hardly
expected to get them. Their bid, which wasn't launched until May
1998, was primarily a marketing tool to show that the Piedmontese
capital was more than automobiles and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiat and Juventus are great resources,'' says mayor Valentino
Castellani, who doubles as committee president. ``But Turin is much
more. The industrial image we have is from the century that is just
past. But before, our city was one of the great capitals of Europe,
part of the Grand Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Turin, founded two millennia ago by the Romans (who called it
Taurinorum, the city of bulls), was the first capital of the
kingdom of Italy in the 1860s. It was the showplace of the House of
Savoy, a baroque jewel at the foot of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Henry James, the American writer, called Turin ``a city of
arcades, of pink and yellow stucco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every object is a reminder, every reminder a thrill,'' he
wrote nine decades ago in ``Italian Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as its residents readily admit, is that there are
too many reminders here of what was. The city's history, and curse,
is for things to begin here and move elsewhere. Over time, Turin
was eclipsed by Rome, by Milan, by Florence, by Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Australia two years ago, we had to point out
Turin on a map,'' says Christillin.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic bid was a way to make the city stand out in bold
baroque type on the eve of its third millennium. Nobody denied that
it was a long shot. Italy hadn't hosted the Winter Games since
Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956, when Americans still watched them on
movie newsreels.
</P>
<P>
   Sion had bid before, had wined and dined and lobbied
International Olympic Committee members by the dozen. The town was
a short train ride along the lake from Lausanne, headquarters of
the IOC and many international sports federations.
</P>
<P>
   When Swiss journalists ventured here for a look, they brought
back tales of an industrial sinkhole with no snow and no chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swiss were so sure,'' says Christillin. ``They had no
doubts, not for one moment. It was like a one-man race.''
</P>
<P>
   When the IOC abruptly banned visits to bid cities last winter in
the wake of the Salt Lake City payoff scandal, the Turinese figured
they were doomed. How could they convince the Lords that this was a
winter city, that the mountains were barely an hour's drive to the
west?
</P>
<P>
   They had been counting on the visits to give the voters their
own Grand Tour, to show them the arcades and piazzas and castles
and museums, and ply them with agnolotti and Barbera d'Asti and
their fabled chocolates and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can send them a book, but it is not the same thing,'' San
Pietro said with a shrug back then. ``They cannot taste our wine or
our food.''
</P>
<P>
   So Turin was left to practice the ancient Italian art of
arrangiarsi, of making impromptu arrangements. Its approach was
subtle, both by necessity and by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turin is not a city that leaps with enthusiasm,'' says
Castellani, an engineer who did his graduate work at MIT and calls
Boston ``my second home.'' ``It is a city of understatement. That
is the usual mood, and you can't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rome had boasted and swaggered two years earlier and lost the
2004 Summer Games to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good lesson for us about what to do and what not to
do,'' says Christillin. ``The Romans had said their candidacy was
by far the best. We decided not to shout too much, to be cool and
calm and not pretend that we were the favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Turin's low profile played perfectly against Sion's brass-band
clamor. And the Italians got an undeniable boost from the ``Hodler
backlash'' _ voters who resented Marc Hodler, the Swiss member
whose whistle-blowing on his hands-out colleagues broke open the
Salt Lake scandal and turned the IOC inside-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made our calculations, we thought maybe we could win
by eight or nine votes, no more,'' San Pietro says. Instead, Turin
won by a stunning 17 out of 89 cast. Castellani and his cool, calm
coterie sprayed champagne on each other in the hotel lobby and
returned home amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back, I am still wondering how we could do it,''
acknowledges Christillin, who makes her living as a university
professor. ``We began with no telephone, no fax, no nothing. We had
not the faintest idea what to do. It was `La Cage Aux Folles.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The organizing committee, which works out of the old Fiat plant
at Lingotto on the edge of downtown, still numbers only 10 people.
``The Korean War refugees,'' Christillin calls them.
</P>
<P>
   The new committee wasn't put together until last month and the
general manager, businessman Paolo Rota (of Diadora sportswear),
won't be named formally until Tuesday. But once the agency
coordinating the government and the organizers is put in place and
the money starts coming in, things will move double-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two opportunities here,'' says Castellani, who will
stay on as committee president after his second mayoral term ends
next year. ``We can change a little bit the image of our city,
which has been obscured by our history as an industrial site. And
we can accelerate our development.''
</P>
<P>
   For too long, Turin has been Detroit with castles, stuck in
neutral and fading from view, wanting to evolve but needing a
jump-start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be a lab test of what we are capable of doing in the
future,'' says Castellani.
</P>
<P>
   The model is Barcelona, another old industrial city that used
the Games (1992 Summer) as a steam engine to remake itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many similarities,'' says Christillin. ``Barcelona is
our flashlight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Games will force the Turinese to transform a bunch of
overdue projects (a subway, a fast train to Milan, better roads,
more hotels, new housing, renovated factories) from dreams to
realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be under observation by all the world,'' Castellani
realizes. ``We cannot make mistakes. So it is a nice resource to
have a deadline that is so straight, so imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Turinese are worried. They may be understated (it's
the old House of Savoy influence, they say), but once an object is
in their hands, they are precise. They are eager to show the world
that the home of Fiat and Juventus (whose black-and-white striped
jerseys are soccer's Yankee pinstripes) can also host a winter
carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stay for two weeks on television, everyone in the
world knows where you are,'' Castellani says. ``I did not know
before where Lillehammer was located. Now I know.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was leaving Seoul last June, Castellani picked up a
Korean newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not read what was written, but there was a chart of
Europe,'' he says. ``Next to it was a chart of Italy, with Turin
put there. Now, everybody knows where we are. Having been selected
_ that is already an important result.''

 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ News from the International Skiing Federation meeting
has a most curious headline. Too many injuries, rising costs, and
the dominance of the Austrians are the problems that the FIS is
hashing through in its annual year-end meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There's always been a strong connection between sailing and
skiing, but listen to what FIS officials say about their situation:
``The domination of the sport by the Austrians has become an
increasing concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest problem is that, as Austria dominates skiing with
800-pound gorillas such as Hermann Maier (four of five World Cup
titles) and Renate Goetschl, fans in others countries are losing
interest.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is idle speculation, but might we be looking
at a similar situation in the America's Cup?
</P>
<P>
   According to ESPN, once Prada sqeaked past AmericaOne to win the
Louis Vuitton Cup and face New Zealand in the America's Cup final,
television viewership fell like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   It was not helped by the three days of abandoned light-air races
interspersed with inflexible laydays, three of which fell right
after postponements.
</P>
<P>
   And with the near-certainty after a couple of races that Prada
was not in contention, the air was out of the Cup balloon for good.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be an end in sight to the domination of
the Austrian ski team, which won an unheard-of 39 races this
season. Symbolically, the male team made its statement at the
season-ending 2000 Snow Festival, where the 27-year-old Maier and
lots of younger teammates swept the podium in the downhill,
Super-G, and giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
   The women showed only slightly less dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that the skiers fighting for Austrian positions
could score well on any other World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for spots on the Austrian team is intense.
Talented youngsters who pour out of the country's academy system
have one thing in mind _ to knock off the competitor just ahead on
the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old star such as gate specialist Benjamin Raich is a
glimpse into the depth and youth of the Austrian team. So who's
going to knock off the juggernaut?
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything that can be said of the Austrian ski team can be
said of the New Zealand America's Cup team, many of whose members
will compete in the next Volvo around-the-world race (formerly
Whitbread).
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear that the many assumptions were wrong regarding
the value of the Challengers' Olympic-style competition, it was
also true that New Zealand was an indomitable force in not just
building boats but racing them as well.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors who dominated in Auckland earlier this month are
hardly youthful, but there are young sailors who, they say, can
step into any position and sail the A boat just as well as the B
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Coutts's final-day gesture of turning over the wheel to
26-year-old Dean Barker sends no message other than that. And
Barker took that message a step further by sailing a stronger start
than the four Coutts sailed before him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gary Jobson, a former Cup racer and longtime observer:
``There's not one single sailor on the Kiwi team that I would
replace with one from the Challengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the team was so good in every department, the
speculation is still strong that the Kiwis probably could have
beaten Prada if the two sides switched boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our boat had a little edge in some winds,'' said Alan Sefton,
a Team New Zealand syndicate chieftain, ``but not anywhere near as
much as they're making it seem out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Crunch the numbers on the legs of each race, and it is clear
that Prada was much closer in boat speed than the results indicate
_ sort of like a tennis player losing a match, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was in the start, then getting lucky with the
windshifts,'' said New Zealand tactician Brad Butterworth. ``They
couldn't win a start from Russell, and they couldn't win a race
without winning a start.''
</P>
<P>
   So the questions remain, fascinating ones to hold us through the
three offseasons until the next Cup:
</P>
<P>
   --Had Paul Cayard sailed against New Zealand, could he have won
at least the right-entry starts from Coutts? And could AmericaOne
then have held a lead to the finish?
</P>
<P>
   --Even with Patrizio Bertelli in possession of Young America's
boats, which even the Kiwis believe were the fastest of the
Challengers, can they reach beyond the level that Team New Zealand
enjoyed this month?
</P>
<P>
   --In Peter Gilmour's logical view, it will do no good in 2003 to
be as fast as New Zealand was in 2000. And since only New Zealand
has its own benchmark, how do Challengers now find a way to get
beyond them?
</P>
<P>
   And the ultimate question is, again, are the Kiwis so dominant
that they effect a kind of paralysis on Challengers, who must raise
funds, field teams, and build boats?
</P>
<P>
   And start today, if they haven't already.

DUVAL MAKING AN EFFORT TO LIFT THE SHADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ David Duval concedes that he has
sought professional advice to help deal with the media after some
rocky times in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to change my nature,'' said Duval. ``I want to
sit here and if I am asked a question, I want to answer the
question. I want to understand sometimes where the questions are
coming from and try to relay my point better than I have in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   It's admirable to make the initiative, and even more so for
Duval to talk openly about it. For two years he received nothing
but positive press, but last year many of the stories turned
negative. Some of it was his fault, he said, but much of it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for instance, all that nonsense coming out of the
British Open, when reporters over there lambasted him as an ugly
American. Supposedly, Duval ripped the tournament, criticized the
Carnoustie layout, and behaved poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that disappointed me the most,'' he said, ``was that
they made it sound like I didn't like playing there. That is
completely 180 degrees from the truth because I love playing over
there. Always have.''
</P>
<P>
   Check the transcripts of his interviews, Duval has said time and
time again, and read his comments about Carnoustie; Duval was no
more critical than the other 149 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman had terrible things to say about the course. So,
too, did Colin Montgomerie. And Tiger Woods was another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Duval got ripped.
</P>
<P>
   Next was the Ryder Cup money issue, a situation that never
should have gotten as far as it did. The fact that it boiled over
at the PGA Championship at Medinah was the fault of the PGA of
America, which should have heeded Tom Kite's suggestion and
straightened out the mess following the grumblings at Valderrama in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a whole lot I can change about that week at the
PGA,'' said Duval, who found himself in the middle of a controversy
after an interview in Golf Digest in which he talked honestly about
the right to direct money from the Ryder Cup toward a charity of
his choice. People thought Duval wanted to be paid for playing in
the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask my opinion of things, I give it to you,'' Duval
said. ``I don't have a problem with people who differ with my
opinion _ that is what it is all about. But to be lambasted for
having a different opinion . . . well, I find it strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval is trying to convey a better image of himself to golf
fans. To that end, he did a series of commercials for Footjoy,
Charles Schwab, and AT&AMP;T that cast him a favorable light. That's
good for him and good for the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last week, a reporter started to ask,
``Everybody talks about the whole Tiger rivalry . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Duval politely interrupted and said, ``Not much of a rivalry
right now, is there?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, and so did everyone else in the room. Then, when the
press conference ended, Duval put on the sunglasses and retreated.
Not to the solitude of the driving range, but to the madness of the
first tee at TPC Sawgrass, where he helped conduct a junior clinic
for hundreds of kids.
</P>
<P>
   He had them laughing, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's lucrative TV contract is up next year, and
negotiations probably will start this summer. One idea bandied
about is moving The Players Championship to May, which could take
it away from NBC because of a conflict with the NBA playoffs. Some
officials like the idea of having a marquee event each month _
Andersen Consulting Match Play in March, Masters in April, TPC in
May, US Open in June, British Open in July, PGA in August, American
Express in September, Tour Championship in October _ but there
could be resistance from players. They like TPC's present spot as a
serious springboard to Augusta, but don't be surprised to see it
moved to May. . . . According to PGA Tour officials, major network
ratings for weekend golf coverage are up 11 percent from a year
ago, and ESPN's weekend ratings are up 26 percent. There's probably
a chance those figures will be mentioned during the negotiations .
. . The European Tour breaks new ground this week _ in South
America. The Brazil Rio de Janeiro 500 Years Open marks the Tour's
first visit to that continent, and there will be a second event in
Sao Paulo next week. The European Tour also visits Asia and
Australia . . . When the European Tour actually gets back to
Europe, one of its better events will be the Deutsche Bank SAP Open
in Germany, thanks to the entry of defending champion Woods. It
means missing the MasterCard Colonial, but Woods will have serious
challengers, most notably Nick Price, Jesper Parnevik, Darren
Clarke, Lee Westwood, and Bernhard Langer. Woods's victory at the
Deutsche Bank last May ignited his winning roll . . . Speaking of
Langer, it was a busy week for him. Last Sunday, he finished tied
for 18th at the Bay Hill Invitational. The next day, his wife
delivered the couple's fourth child, and two days later Langer
drove to TPC Sawgrass to squeeze in six practice holes before the
start of The Players Championship. . . . Woods made a cut for the
46th straight time, to tie Vijay Singh for fourth-best in Tour
history. Now Woods can set his sights on 53 (Kite), 86 (Hale
Irwin), and 105 (Jack Nicklaus) . . . President Clinton is the
honorary captain of the 2000 Presidents Cup. Perhaps that means
players will get to hit two or three drives at each tee, select
their best, and have Secret Service agents toss back errant shots
at no cost.

   Twin sisters Aree and Naree Song Wongluekiet were given
sponsor's exemptions into this week's Nabisco Championship. Aree is
in third and in the final pairing, but it's still a major mistake
at a major tournament. Forget all the junior championships they
have won. Forget the immense talent. Remember this: They are just
13 years old. Perhaps they can compete physically with many of the
LPGA Tour players, but so what? Intellectual maturity should be
considered. The sponsor did not do the LPGA Tour any favors by
shoving the sisters into the spotlight, at the expense of gifted
players such as Karrie Webb, Annika Sorenstam, Laura Davies, Juli
Inkster, Dottie Pepper, Janice Moodie, and Lorie Kane. The girls
cannot play regularly on the LPGA Tour until they are 18, but they
have plans for some Monday qualifiers this year. ``They are good
players at this age, but there's a lot of things to avoid, like
burnout, overexposure, injury,'' said Jonathan Yarwood, who coaches
the girls at the David Leadbetter Academy in Florida. ``But
hopefully, if they keep going on the course that they're on,
they're going to be pretty good.'' What's the hurry? . . . Last
year, Sorenstam expressed objections to two days of pro-am play at
the Nabisco, a situation that is still testy. She participated this
year, though a pairing with Celine Dion certainly enticed her . . .
Though she has earned enough points for the LPGA Hall of Fame,
Sorenstam cannot be officially inducted until she completes the
10-year ``waiting period.'' That will take another three years.

   The youthful innocence seems to be wearing off Sergio Garcia,
who has not played well in the early months as a card-carrying
member of the US PGA Tour. In his round of 82 Thursday at TPC,
Garcia looked (take your pick) mystified, bored, frustrated, and
befuddled. Conditions were brutal, and had he been more
experienced, perhaps he would have done what Duval and Montgomerie
did later in the day in much tougher conditions _ hang in there and
shoot 75. Instead, Garcia played carelessly and with very little
patience. His swing is long and loose and gets him in trouble quite
often. Fortunately, he has a marvelous short game and can get
himself out of many dire situations. Unfortunately, a marvelous
short game alone will not cut it on the PGA Tour week in and week
out. The undisciplined mechanics could prove costly to Garcia,
something that Price alluded to last summer. Garcia also seems less
at ease with the media, which is understandable. Then again, he
jumped into this madness with full force, and trying to play in the
US and Europe this year, at the tender age of 20, could be a
mistake. TPC is his fourth event (three medal play), and in 12
rounds he has broken 70 just once. He has missed the cut twice.
When he talked following Thursday's debacle, Garcia seemed far
removed from the bubbly personality who captivated the golf world
last year. ``It looks like it is taking its time,'' he said. ``We
will keep waiting and let's see what we can do.'' . . . If he
continues to struggle, how attractive will that Garcia-Woods
made-for-TV event be? . . . Duval showed that he has a good grasp
of the situation when asked about winning last year's TPC. He
didn't want to argue the merits of it being a fifth major, but he
does know this: Winners of the TPC since 1991 have one thing in
common _ a major championship on their resumes. The TPC winners who
have won majors: Steve Elkington, TPC winner in 1991 and '97 (PGA
Championship was his major); Davis Love, 1992 (PGA); Price, 1993
(two PGAs, one British Open); Norman, 1994 (two British); Lee
Janzen, 1995 (two US Opens); Fred Couples, 1996 (Masters); Justin
Leonard, 1998 (British Open).

MARTINEZ COOKING WITH GAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ Pedro Martinez insists he's not much of a
spring training pitcher, which is not to be confused with what he
does in spring once the games count.
</P>
<P>
   Fast starts have been a staple of Martinez's first two seasons
with the Red Sox. Last season, he was 10-1 with a 2.01 ERA through
the end of May, his only loss coming April 15 in his first Fenway
Park appearance of 1999, when he was beaten, 4-0, by John Snyder
and the Chicago White Sox. In '98, he was 6-1 by Memorial Day, and
in his career he's 37-10 with a 2.45 ERA for the season's first two
months.
</P>
<P>
   He has given no indication this spring will be any different.
Ten days away from his Opening Day start in Seattle, Martinez threw
76 pitches in 4 2/3 innings Saturday, allowing six hits (five
singles and a double by Doug Glanville) and a couple of runs while
striking out six in a 10-4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in
Jack Russell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I feel, I'm pretty much ready to do it,'' Martinez said.
``I could go seven or eight innings (in the opener), if I happen to
be in command of all my pitches and don't go too deep in my counts.
My body feels that way, that I could throw seven innings and 100
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in Boston's 5-3 Opening Day win over the Royals in
Kansas City, Martinez threw 121 pitches in six innings, striking
out nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of mistakes, one to Glanville, when he kept
the curveball up,'' said Red Sox catcher Tim Spehr, ``but I thought
he threw better here than in the minor league game he threw, when
he got away with some pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some fine tuning he needs to do, but a guy like
that, even on his worst days, is still incredible. You can see his
intensity pick up. He's ready for the season. All his pitches are
sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last Monday, Spehr hadn't caught Martinez since 1996, when
both were with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him afterward, `You've improved so much,' '' Spehr
said. ``Like, his curveball is so much better than it was in
Montreal. In Montreal, he was more of a thrower. He's a pitcher
now. He knows how to use his stuff, his mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a dominating pitcher. Every time he goes to the
mound he can throw a no-hitter or a shutout. He has the best
fastball in the game, the best changeup in the game, and one of the
top three curveballs in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a pinch, Martinez might even swing the bat a little bit.
His high chopper to short off Phillies starter Andy Ashby in the
second inning scored Donnie Sadler from the third. It was
Martinez's first RBI in a Red Sox uniform in any game, spring or
regulation. In the fifth inning, third baseman Scott Rolen took a
hit away from Martinez with a diving stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only one he robs,'' he said of Rolen, who was the
National League Rookie of the Year in 1997, when Nomar Garciaparra
won the AL award. ``He robs everybody. He's awesome. Maybe I need
to get Rolen to autograph the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolen, who went down swinging at high heat from Martinez in the
second inning, when the Sox ace struck out the side, was told of
Martinez's compliment. ``If he does that, then maybe I need to send
over six balls for him to sign,'' Rolen said.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez played in the NL, which requires its pitchers to
bat, he boasted with a smile that he'd driven in plenty of runs. He
amended that when told a check of the records showed he had 11
RBIs. Martinez takes an .098 average (25 for 255) into this season,
having struck out 117 times. But he did hit a bases-loaded triple
once, in Pittsburgh six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was off Denny Neagle,'' he said, reciting details of his
at-bat like any other big-leaguer. ``I hit a fastball. What else am
going to look for in a bases-loaded situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest thing that ever happened to me as a
hitter. I hit it to right-center. If you hit it in the right place,
you can get bases. And I can run. That's something I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams will be happy if he sticks with his other
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' Martinez said. ``My arm is in great
shape. It's just a matter of pitching now.''

YANKEES FEEL THEY HAVE RED SOX COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The news that the Red Sox have been ordained World
Series champions by Sports Illustrated barely caused a ripple in
the New York Yankees' clubhouse when the Sox visited here the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Bernie Williams sat in front of his cubicle with his
electric guitar, jamming with pitcher Jason Grimsley. Coach Mickey
Rivers visited with his old Angels teammate, Sox broadcaster Jerry
Remy. Derek Jeter posed with Nomar Garciaparra for a promotional
photo. Roger Clemens paused long enough from his off-day workout
regimen to smirk and say, ``Great, new century,'' when apprised of
the SI cover. Tino Martinez, who later in the day would have the
option on his contract picked up, chuckled. Jim Leyritz, the King,
laughed at the idea that the Sox were now doubly cursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, somebody has to pick somebody,'' Leyritz said.
``We feel pretty good about defending our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   This had the makings of a disquieting week in Yankeeland. George
Steinbrenner, perturbed at the club's 5-18 spring record, had
called a late-night summit meeting, during which general manager
Brian Cashman tried to assure him that the two-time defending World
Series champions did not require any undue tinkering. By the end of
the week, the Boss had to be feeling better, as the Bombers blanked
the Sox, 2-0 (with Ramiro Mendoza making a strong bid to win the
No. 5 starting slot), and the next day crushed the Marlins, 19-0.
</P>
<P>
   Let the season begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can put any team on the cover right now until the
season starts,'' outfielder Paul O'Neill said. ``Depends how you
want to look at it. A lot of people think it's time for the breaks
to start going against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our pitching staff gives us a chance to win it, day in and
day out.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some thought out there that the Yankees are starting to
show age. Clemens and David Cone are 37. So is O'Neill, while third
baseman Scott Brosius is 34, which is about the age most people
have El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, pegged at.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens isn't buying it: ``People said David Cone's shoulder was
about to fall off last year, and he pitches a perfect game.''
O'Neill isn't, either: ``I don't see where a year makes that much
difference. We swept through the playoffs and the World Series last
fall, with the best baseball we played all year, and that was what,
four months ago? I don't think things change that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the Yankees and their challengers,
O'Neill said, is that other clubs need players to have career
seasons in order to contend. ``We're lucky,'' he said, ``in the
sense that we're a good enough team that if everybody has a pretty
good year, we have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell me that if Pedro wins only 10 games this
season, Boston will win,'' said O'Neill, who left unspoken the fact
that Clemens won just 14 in 1999 and the Yankees still went all the
way. ``That's a lot of weight on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best pitcher in baseball, so he can probably handle
it, but our main concern is that people stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so rare, O'Neill noted, that the Yankees have been able to
keep their core players together, a function of the Boss's deep
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun part of this, other than the rings, is that it has
been the same people,'' O'Neill said. ``That's the way sports ought
to be. People go to a Yankees game, they know who's going to be out
there, year in and year out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has a good team. I respect them a lot, that team.
They've got some great players, and it starts with Jimy Williams,
the same way it starts with Joe (Torre) here. It's the same way.
Jimy knows how to get people to win.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was told how Sox catcher Jason Varitek, among others,
said the Yankees played perfect baseball against the Sox in the
ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect? No, we weren't perfect,'' O'Neill said. ``But we
played sound baseball. We don't have guys who hit 40 or 50 home
runs, but we have guys who put together good at-bats. We give
ourselves a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And no magazine cover is going to change that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolute lock that the brothers Martinez will be paid
more than any pair of pitching siblings in the history of the game.
Pedro the Younger has a base salary of $11 million this season. If
he wins his second consecutive Cy Young Award, the club will owe
him an additional $250,000. That's the only performance clause he
has in his contract. Ramon the Elder, meanwhile, is guaranteed
$5.25 million, a hefty increase over his $750,000 base salary last
season. His contract is loaded with incentives and performance
clauses. If he wins the Comeback Player of the Year award, he will
be paid $250,000. There are $50,000 bonuses if he is an All-Star or
the MVP of the League Championship Series, $100,000 if he is World
Series MVP. If he wins the Cy Young Award, he will be paid $150,000
(he gets $75,000 if he finishes second, $50,000 if he is third).
The performance clauses include $100,000 for 175 innings pitched
and $200,000 for 200 innings. Sixteen starts, he earns $100,000.
Twenty-six starts, he gets $175,000, and there is an additional
$200,000 for every start over 30. Ramon hasn't pitched 200 innings
since he was with the Dodgers in 1995, which also was the last time
he made 30 starts. The last time he made as many as 20 starts was
in 1997, when he took the ball 22 times. Next season, if the Sox
exercise the option on Ramon's contract, the brothers would crack
the $20 million mark. Ramon would be guaranteed $8.5 million,
unless the club were to exercise a $750,000 buyout. Pedro,
meanwhile, will have a base salary of $12.5 million.

<P>
   Baseball America takes a dim view of Dan Duquette's vaunted
minor league system, ranking the Sox organization 21st in terms of
premium prospects and depth. Baseball America's comment: ``The Red
Sox have become increasingly dependent on their foreign scouting
efforts to both the Far East and Dominican Republic to stock their
talent base. One advantage of signing Asian talent is the
experience level of the pitchers. Boston can start pitchers like
Sun Woo Kim, Sang Hoon Lee, or Tomokazu Ohka at advanced levels and
move them to the big leagues in one or two years. Trades and a
couple of marginally productive drafts have left the system thinner
than in recent years, especially with athletic players.'' . . . Sox
outfielder Carl Everett, who expressed his dislike for the Yankees
his first day in camp (``I never liked pinstripes''), had little to
say last week when the Sox visited the Yanks in Tampa about the
team that made him its No. 1 draft pick in 1990. ``I've talked
about it too much already,'' he said. ``I said what I have to say.
It's not something I want to keep on. I said it. That's how I felt.
A lot of people think I'm bitter. That's not true. I jumped for joy
when I went to Florida.'' Everett played three seasons in the
Yankees organization before the Marlins took him in the second
round of the 1992 expansion draft. He had advanced as far as the
Single A Florida State League with the Yankees in '92, when he was
chosen the league's best defensive outfielder in a poll of managers
and coaches. Everett, who grew up in Tampa, said he was surprised
when the Yankees drafted him. ``I never heard from the Yankees,''
he said. ``It was mainly Seattle and Pittsburgh and the White
Sox.'' . . . Both New York teams have been mentioned as
possibilities for Tigers outfielder Bobby Higginson, who averaged
25 home runs for three seasons before falling off to a dozen last
year. Boss Steinbrenner dispatched aide Gene Michael to follow
Higginson over the weekend, while the Mets, with Rickey Henderson
once again asking to be traded, are said to be considering
Higginson, too, perhaps in exchange for a lefthanded reliever or
Henderson . . . The Phillies were thinking about bringing back
second baseman Mickey Morandini from the Expos in exchange for
outfielder Rob Ducey, who would fill Montreal's need for a
lefthanded-hitting outfield reserve. Another second base
possibility that has been mentioned for the Phillies is San Diego's
David Newhan, whose father, Ross, is the national baseball writer
for the Los Angeles Times . . . The Mariners, still in the market
for a lefthanded-hitting outfielder and thwarted in their attempts
to acquire Jim Edmonds, apparently are mulling over a list that
includes Matt Lawton of the Twins, Todd Hollandsworth of the
Dodgers, and Travis Lee of the D-Backs . . . With Eli Marrero and
Mike Matheny hitting below the Mendoza Line and Rick Wilkins just
above it, the Cardinals may be in the market for catching help
(Scott Hatteberg?). They thought about San Diego's Carlos
Hernandez, who is coming back from a ruptured Achilles' tendon, but
passed for now . . . Mixed signals still are flying around about
Brad Radke, though the best guess now is the righthander will open
the season with the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Expos apparently have decided that Peter Bergeron, a
throw-in to the Carlos Perez/Mark Grudzielanek deal with the
Dodgers, has better game than Milton Bradley, his competition for
the Expos' center field job. Bergeron apparently will start in
center and bat leadoff. He's been working with base stealing guru
Maury Wills, whose only knock on Bergeron is that he's too nice.
``No matter how many times they throw over to the base, you say,
`I'm going anyway,' '' Wills said. ``You're not popular with the
other team, but your own teammates love you. The visiting fans boo
you, and that's a great compliment. Bergeron's a mild-mannered guy.
He's not cut out to be that kind of person. I'm trying to make him
mad _ dirty him up a little in his thinking.'' . . . Frank Thomas
says he's healthy and happy again in White Sox camp, but 1 home run
in his first 37 at-bats has some people wondering whether the
private hitting lessons he's getting from Walt Hriniak are robbing
him of power. The Big Hurt laughs at that notion. Like Mo Vaughn,
he said his power comes later in spring . . . Heather Nabozny, who
is in charge of the care and nurturing of Detroit's new Comerica
Park field, is the first woman to be hired as a head groundskeeper
in the big leagues . . . Canton's Bobby Witt, who was mentioned as
a possibility for the Red Sox when they were casting about for a
starter this winter, is close to nailing down a spot as the
Indians' No. 5 starter or a long man out of the pen . . . With
regular broadcaster Dave O'Brien planning to miss the Marlins'
opener against the Giants in order to do an ESPN game, Boston
College grad Jon ``Boog'' Sciambi is scheduled to do six innings on
WQAM, the team's flagship radio station in Miami. Sciambi, whose
love of the game is such that he once left a comfortable studio job
in Miami to spend a summer broadcasting minor league baseball in
Boise, Idaho, has done the occasional inning for WQAM while
handling pregame and postgame duties . . . Meanwhile, former
Harvard baseball captain and shortstop David Forst has been hired
by GM Billy Beane to work in Oakland's front office . . . Former
Sox pitcher Stan Belinda, who has waged a successful fight to keep
his career alive despite multiple sclerosis, has beaten out former
A's closer Billy Taylor for a job in the Rockies' bullpen . . . It
may be the end of the road for ex-Sox catcher John Marzano, who
refused a minor league assignment from the Devil Rays, opted to
take his release instead, and went home to Arizona . . . Grand
exit: After playing an exhibition against the Twins in Fort Myers,
Texas catcher Pudge Rodriguez boarded a helicopter that landed
beyond the center-field fence and flew off for a personal
appearance in Miami . . . Former Sox replacement player and
reliever Ron Mahay is now the clear front-runner to be the A's No.
5 starter. The lefthander came into the weekend with a 2-0 record
and 2.50 ERA in 18 spring innings . . . Jim Leyland, who is
spending a month in Cardinals camp as a special assistant to GM
Walt Jocketty, is a huge Everett fan. ``I love him,'' Leyland said.
``Power, speed, intensity. He made himself a hell of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Edmonds deal came together so quickly, four days
after Angels GM Bill Stoneman said his center fielder wasn't going
anywhere. When the Angels originally talked to the Cardinals, they
asked about young pitchers Rick Ankiel and Chad Hutchinson, neither
of whom is available. Thursday was the first time Stoneman asked
for Kent Bottenfield, and Jocketty quickly took the deal. The Cards
think that with the development of Garrett Stephenson, the
impending arrival of phenom Ankiel, and the possible June return of
Matt Morris (who missed all of last season with elbow surgery),
they can offset the loss of Bottenfield. Meanwhile, with Eric Davis
slow to come back from rotator cuff surgery on his left
(non-throwing) shoulder, St. Louis manager Tony La Russa can move
J.D. Drew from center to right and let Davis take his time. And
when he's healthy? No one's saying so, but a trade isn't out of the
question . . . Give credit to agent Scott Boras, who didn't win
free agency for underaged Dodger signee Adrian Beltre but cut him a
fat three-year, $5.5 million deal that could be worth considerably
more if Beltre triggers an escape clause. If the third baseman has
400 plate appearances this season or 800 in the next two, he can
void the last year of the deal. The contract includes a $1.5
million signing bonus and calls for a $500,000 salary this season,
$750,000 next year, and $2.3 million in 2002. If Beltre voids the
last year, he'll be arbitration-eligible. Escape clauses are not
unknown for free agents but are believed to be unprecedented for an
arbitration-eligible player . . . Mike Hampton said he lost
interest in signing with the Astros last winter because they traded
catcher Brad Ausmus and Everett, leading him to question whether
owner Drayton McLane was committed to winning. But Hampton, who was
traded to the Mets but has yet to sign a long-term deal with New
York, said he isn't ruling out a return to Houston after the season
. . . The Cubs originally voted against the trip to Japan but OK'd
it after Major League Baseball offered guaranteed payments to
players, coaches, and clubhouse personnel of $10,000-$25,000.
``Their original offer was $10,000 and we knocked it up,'' said
Cubs player rep Mark Grace. ``We wanted them to grease our palms a
little more. That's the American way.'' No, this wasn't another
case of greedy ballplayers. Grace said he was looking for a maximum
payday for the support personnel and minimum-wage guys . . . Six
teams _ the Dodgers, Rangers, Astros, Indians, Royals, and Orioles
_ will meet Tuesday in Las Vegas with city officials and MLB
representatives about moving spring operations there. The Dodgers,
the only West Coast team still training in Florida, hold the key to
the deal. If they go, the others are likely to follow . . . The
Indians took a day off last week, their first in seven springs
here. GM John Hart had vowed not to schedule another one after the
tragic events of March 22, 1993, when pitchers Tim Crews and Steve
Olin were killed and Bob Ojeda seriously injured in a boating
accident on Little Lake Nellie near Orlando. But time, said Hart,
has healed the wounds.

LIPPETT'S VENTURE STUFF OF DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ronnie Lippett is returning to football. Not to pro
football, mind you, but to pure football.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of football the former Patriots cornerback feels
is missing these days from the hearts of too many players in the
NFL. They play now for money, for fame, for a shoe contract, for
everything but what got them started. What they don't play for much
anymore, it seems, is precisely what Lippett is hoping to find in
the tiny football outpost of Warren, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   It is there that he will join former teammates Steve Grogan and
Mosi Tatupu to run a football team on which the only money changing
hands will be with the uniform suppliers. It is a team to be known
as the East Bay 1776 Minutemen, the latest arrival in the New
England Football League. It is here _ in minor league football _
that Lippett believes men can be free to dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston (NFL expansion) franchise wasn't available to us,
so I went for this,'' joked Lippett, who bought the NEFL team along
with Grogan and Tatupu after being approached by longtime Boston
sports figure Jack McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack was a great friend of Billy Sullivan's, and he called and
asked if I'd help start a team in Warren, R.I. I had just gotten
back from a USO trip to Bosnia, and I had seen how dreams can be
destroyed so easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the dreamers will be Lippett, although his dream is
different. When he came to the Patriots as an eighth-round draft
choice in 1983, little was expected of him. Supposedly, he was too
slow to play corner in the NFL and not physical enough to play
safety. That is what the scouts said, but the scouts don't dream.
</P>
<P>
   After a rough start, his grit and ability made him an NFL
starter on a Super Bowl team and a fixture for years at cornerback.
Lippett has no illusions about, or interest in, playing football
again, although he'd probably be a star even today in the NEFL. His
dream is different from that of his players, but it is a football
dream all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for me to live out my dream to be a head
coach,'' said Lippett, who will continue to serve as an assistant
at Curry College under another former teammate, Steve Nelson. ``I'm
looking forward to having players who play for the love of the
game. That's missing nowadays. It seems to me so many guys are
playing only for the money. The essence of the game is lost for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Grogan will serve as the club president, Tatupu as offensive
coordinator, and Lippett as the on-the-field boss. It is a position
he had long dreamed of landing somewhere, but it is only a
part-time dream, because Lippett has bigger dreams than just
winning a few more football games.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, he has run the Ronnie Lippett Mentoring
Program, a youth organization in Taunton in which high school
juniors and seniors serve as mentors to elementary and secondary
school kids, many of whom are struggling with the same kinds of
problems Lippett grew up with. Just as he has not forgotten the
love of football, Lippett hasn't forgotten the importance of love
in all things, especially the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to work in a program where kids are getting what
you're saying,'' said Lippett, whose program received a big
financial boost from NFL Charities. ``They're learning who their
real role models are: their parents and grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippett also has worked with Family Service of Greater Boston
for seven years, talking with kids who are growing up in much the
same circumstances he had to overcome growing up in Sebring, Fla.
What he tells them is what he will tell his NEFL players: Dream and
know what's important in your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep kids stabilized in the home,'' Lippett
said. ``When I was 8, I was taken out of my mother's home. My
stepfather was beating me pretty good, so eventually they put me
with my grandmother. My mother and my grandmother made sure to put
people in my life who were good role models: a minister, a teacher
I really liked, eventually my coach. They molded me into a person
who wants to give back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippett does that in schools in Taunton and Boston and anywhere
else someone asks him to go. He does it at Curry, where he coaches
young men who play for fun, not fame. And now he'll be doing it in
Warren, R.I., with a group of men who play football for only one
reason: love of the game.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they'll be coached by a guy who feels the same way .
. . about football and about life.

   When the owners meetings begin in earnest Tuesday in Palm Beach,
Fla., one of the few hotly debated issues will be instant replay.
Again. After much debate last year, replay returned for the first
time since 1991. It was generally successful, but opponents still
exist. Among the most outspoken is Bengals owner Mike Brown, who
cast the lone vote against the system being continued. ``We're
trying to perfect the imperfectable,'' Brown said last week. He
claims replay was used fewer than a dozen times on plays that
actually affected a game, yet games were stopped 195 times (out of
more than 38,000 plays) for a review. He called the system ``a
hoax'' on the game and the fans. Oddly, of the six ``yes'' votes,
one came from Cardinals general manager Bob Ferguson, whose boss,
owner Bill Bidwill, has never voted for replay. ``It's always a
close call,'' said NFL senior vice president for communications Joe
Browne. ``Some clubs spoke up against it during the season. The
calm of the offseason may have calmed them down.'' . . . Replay has
prompted one change in the rules. During last year's playoffs, a
key reception by Buccaneers receiver Bert Emanuel was ruled
incomplete upon review because the tip of ball touched the ground _
even though Emanuel was in full possession. This ruling _ on a play
that has come to be known in Tampa as ``the Immaculate Deception''
_ has led to a rule change allowing such a catch. The new rule will
save the elbows of many receivers, who scrape them on artificial
turf making sure their hands are beneath the ball on low throws.
Detroit's Herman Moore claims to need surgery after slamming his
elbows into the turf so often over the years . . . One innovative
plan the NFL is considering will be discussed by the owners at
length: a flexible December schedule in which the nationally
televised games on Sunday and Monday nights would not be announced
until 3-5 weeks in advance. The idea is to play the top games in
front of a national audience. One argument for this is to avoid
what happened last year, when neither the Rams nor Colts got much
national exposure until the playoffs because so little had been
expected of them before the season. If such a plan were approved,
it would not be implemented next season . . . Denver coach Mike
Shanahan believes in creative tension. He's providing it this
spring by saying the Broncos' quarterback job may belong to Brian
Griese on the first day of training camp but not necessarily on the
last if Gus Frerotte plays better. Considering what Shanahan did to
Bubby Brister a year ago _ taking the job of John Elway's
replacement away from the veteran in the preseason and handing it
to the untested Griese _ he must like to keep his quarterbacks on
their toes . . . Here's how young players end up broke. In a
deposition given several weeks ago in a case brought against
embattled agent Tank Black by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Jaguars star running back Fred Taylor said he lost his
entire $3 million signing bonus in bad investments Black put him in
. . . Old friend Ben Coates is a realist. While visiting the
Tennessee Titans last week, Coates conceded that he will not earn
anywhere near the $2.7 million he was scheduled to be paid by the
Patriots in 2000 before being cut for salary cap reasons. ``The
price is definitely down,'' Coates said. The price may be down more
than a little. It may be cut in half, with either Coates or Troy
Drayton likely offered not much more than a $1 million package on a
one-year contract . . . By the way, Coates's opinion on how he was
misused last season hasn't changed. He finished with 32 receptions,
his lowest total since his second NFL season, 1992, when he was
still a spot player. He still believes it was not a result of a
dropoff in his ability. ``It's not my fault,'' Coates said. ``I'm
still the same player I was two, three years ago.'' . . . The
Titans allowed free agent safety Anthony Dorsett to sign with
Oakland because Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher did not believe Dorsett
could be a full-time starter, even though he filled in for injured
Marcus Robinson in the Super Bowl. He is a top special teams player
who was a Pro Bowl alternate last year, but is hoping to win a
starting safety job with the Raiders . . . Four-time Pro Bowl guard
Ruben Brown is learning the harsh realities of free agency: Get
your money early or you may not get it at all. When the free agency
period opened, the Bills' guard was demanding a $5 million-$6
million package, but when Detroit and Miami passed, Brown was in
limbo. His demands have decreased to around $3.5 million-$4
million, but even that is not likely in the price range of Buffalo,
which has cap problems.

   Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt called a staff meeting Tuesday to
outline how he believes Miami has improved this offseason despite
the retirement of Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino and the
departure of probable Hall of Fame coach Jimmy Johnson. Wannstedt
talked for 20 minutes, insisting the Dolphins had not lost a single
free agent he felt was key to their chances. He also predicted that
ex-Patriot part-time starter Heath Irwin could start at right guard
for the Dolphins in September . . . Jacksonville Jaguars defensive
end Tony Brackens has decided not to attend the team's voluntary
workout program until he has a new contract despite having the
team's franchise label slapped on him. Brackens must play for the
average of the top five defensive end salaries, a figure that
should be around $4.2 million. Brackens is seeking a long-term
contract averaging $7 million-$8 million after leading the team
with 12 sacks in 1999 . . . Nine weeks ago, Jacksonville All-Pro
tackle Tony Boselli tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his
right knee, keeping him out of the playoffs. The normal recovery
time is eight months to a year, but Boselli believes he will start
the season in September _ barely the minimum recovery time . . .
Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna recently signed a one-year deal with
the Seahawks worth $1.3 million, far more than he'd hoped for when
his pro career began. ``When I got into this, all I wanted to do
was pay off some bills,'' Kitna said. ``Now I've done that.'' I'll
bet . . . If you want to get the skinny on what Doug Flutie was
really feeling the week he was benched by the Bills in the
playoffs, get the new issue of NFL Insider magazine. Senior writer
Vic Carucci details Flutie's long week of turmoil before the AFC
wild-card game with Tennessee. One cute story Flutie told is how
his daughter, Alexa, told him her middle school had started a
petition to ask the Bills to reconsider starting Rob Johnson.
``That was her way of trying to make me feel better,'' Flutie said.
``Isn't that what it's all about?'' . . . Quietly the Dolphins
brought in Tom Donahoe as a consultant to work with Wannstedt in
preparing for the college draft. The move is still seen by many as
the precursor to Donahoe ending up with Wannstedt full-time . . .
Here's one assessment of Raymont Harris, the onetime 1,000-yard
rusher the Patriots signed to help ease their running back
problems. He has lasted a full season only once, in 1994 as a Bears
rookie. Three years later, he rushed for 1,033 hard yards but took
a battering and has never been the same. He started only three
games in Green Bay the next year and didn't play at all last year.
Harris runs hard up the gut, but the belief around the league is
that his body can't hold up to a steady pounding and he lacks the
elusiveness to play any other way. The point being, the Patriots
still need a running back . . . The Raiders intend to expand their
use of defensive back Charles Woodson, both offensively and
defensively. Head coach Jon Gruden says he is working on ways to
utilize Woodson not only as a receiver and return threat but also
as more than just a cover corner. The Raiders plan to use Woodson's
speed to blitz in certain situations. With ex-Patriot coach Ron
Lynn handling Oakland's defensive backfield, you can expect more
aggression from Woodson. Woodson was an explosive receiver at
Michigan and believes he can outdo the 36 receptions two-way man
Deion Sanders had for Dallas four years ago.

WISCONSIN DEFENSE DOES IT AGAINST PURDUE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ As the buzzer sounded, they ran toward each
other in disbelief, sharing a similar feeling with college
basketball fans across the country. The Wisconsin Badgers, the
sixth-place team from the Big Ten Conference, stunned even
themselves Saturday as they advanced to the school's first Final
Four in 59 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's improbable ride in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association men's basketball tournament continued with a &QC; 64-60
victory over Purdue in the West Regional final. It lifted the
Badgers into the national semifinals, a place Jon Bryant once
thought existed only in his dreams. Two years ago, Bryant
transferred from Division II St. Cloud State in hopes of earning a
spot on Wisconsin's roster. After knocking down five of nine
3-pointers and scoring 18 points Saturday, the senior guard
celebrated as the regional's most outstanding player and a symbol
of the Badgers' unlikely success.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday in Indianapolis, Wisconsin (22-13) will play
Michigan State (30-7), a 75-64 winner over Iowa State Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous. Just look at us,'' Bryant said, motioning
around Wisconsin's locker room. ``We never thought we'd be here. It
just goes to show what confidence does. That, and good
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Badgers became the lowest-seeded team to reach
the Final Four since 11th-seeded Louisiana State in 1986. They are
the first No.8 to advance this far in the NCAA tournament since
Villanova in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they qualified for the Final Four, in 1941, the
Badgers won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just expected to make the tournament, and once we got in,
we thought maybe we could do a little damage,'' said guard Roy
Boone, who came off the bench to score 12 points. ``Not this much
damage. But after a couple of wins, we started thinking we could
beat anybody in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin beat the Boilermakers (24-10) for the third time in
four meetings this season, doing it again with a scrapping defense
that held them without a field goal for two long stretches. Purdue,
which shot 39.6 percent, did not make a field goal for seven
minutes in the first half (from 9 minutes 1 second to 2:01) and
almost six minutes in the second half (from 6:55 to 0:57 seconds).
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kowske added 14 points and 8 rebounds for the Badgers. Led
by Bryant, they made 43.8 percent of their 3-point attempts (7 of
16). Purdue had more balanced scoring, but hurt itself on 3-point
shots, making only 7 of 23. Brian Cardinal and Carson Cunningham
had 13 points each. Mike Robinson scored 12 and Greg McQuay added
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their team defense and Bryant's 3-pointers really cut our
throats,'' Purdue Coach Gene Keady said. ``It was one of those
things where they just played a little bit better and we could
never get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   In a personal contest of senior guards, Jaraan Cornell, the
Boilermakers' streaky shooting guard, rarely escaped the shadow of
Mike Kelley. Cornell made only one shot, a 3-pointer, in nine
attempts. Kelley finished with 5 points and 5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept chasing him and fighting through screens and
telling myself not to relax,'' Kelley said. ``I was working real
hard to get his shots. They just weren't falling for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell said, ``In the last four minutes they stepped it up a
notch on defense, and we couldn't execute our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied at 52-52, the Badgers slowly and painfully
ended the Boilermakers' hopes of taking Keady to his first Final
Four in 20 seasons at Purdue. Kowske scored on a drive across the
lane, Boone hit a jump shot, Mark Vershaw made two free throws and
Boone added two free throws for a 60-53 lead with one minute left.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Purdue was forced to foul, and came within 61-57
with 19.5 seconds to go on a tip-in by Greg McQuay. Cunningham sank
a 3-pointer to make it 63-60 with 11.5 seconds left, but the
Badgers responded with four of seven free throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They easily could have won,'' Wisconsin Coach Dick Bennett
said of the Boilermakers. ``The key was our ability to take better
care of the basketball in the second half. In the first, we just
had too many turnovers and were rushing a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal, who scored all of his 13 points in the second half,
kept the Boilermakers close as the Badgers threatened to pull away,
sparking a rally for a 50-49 lead with 6:50 to play. He scored 9
points in an 11-4 run, hitting back-to-back 3-pointers, a short
jumper and a free throw after being fouled by Kowske, Wisconsin's
leading rebounder. It was Kowske's fourth foul and put him on the
bench for almost five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He returned after Cardinal tied the score at 52-52 on two free
throws with 5:23 left.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team led by more than 7 points as the Badgers held on
for a 31-28 halftime lead despite a jump shot at the buzzer by
Purdue's John Allison. Bryant sparked the Badgers with 10 points,
making 3 of 4 of his 3-point attempts, and Boone scored their last
5 points. Wisconsin shot 57 percent to Purdue's 47 percent in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue got 7 points apiece from Robinson, Cunningham and Maynard
Lewis. The Boilermakers forced more Wisconsin turnovers (10) in one
half than the Badgers had against Louisiana State (9) in their
semifinal victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first half developed into a series of mini-runs as both
teams tried to gain momentum. The Badgers held it with four minutes
left with seven unanswered points on a 3-pointer from Maurice
Linton, a running one-hander by Kelley and a short jumper by Kowske
for a 25-19 lead. Kelley's basket was important because his drive
down the lane resulted in the second foul on Cardinal, who spent
the rest of the half on the bench.

MICHIGAN STATE NEEDS LATE RUN TO ENSURE PLACE IN FINAL FOUR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Three of the players are a proud and
unperishable export of an industrial town that has seen better
days: Flint, Mich. And Saturday night, when Michigan State needed
to fire the Spartans' steel to overcome a tournament by bouncing
Iowa State, Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell pulled
their welders' masks down and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   The three combined for 14 clutch and often spectacular points in
the final four minutes of the Midwest Regional final of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball
tournament to turn a 6-point deficit into a 75-64 victory and a
return trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-0 run erupted with a 21-foot bomb from the lefty Peterson
and was fanned by free throws, followed by a 15-foot runner from
Bell. But what finally torched the Cyclones, broke what had been a
willful effort and left them in tears after the game, was Cleaves'
alley-oop pass from the top of the key to a body soaring above the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   It was Peterson who, with 2 minutes 4 seconds left, seemed to
slam the ball below him and through the rim for Michigan State's
64-61 lead as a sold-out and loudly partisan Michigan State crowd
of 21,214 began calling for Indianapolis and a semifinal matchup
with Big Ten rival Wisconsin. They were the sort of acrobatics
Michigan State's A.J. Granger has seen plenty of from his teammates
of four years, but they continue to amaze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drew that up in a timeout because we wanted to make sure we
got a sure thing,'' said Granger, who along with Peterson led the
Spartans with 18 points. ``That is about as sure as you get. I did
my usual thing _ turned around with my mouth open and watched Pete
go flying through the air. It got the crowd, the momentum, and I
knew where we were going from there.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, it was as if the Cyclones, who had contained
Michigan State to that point with vicious jersey-to-jersey defense,
had been paralyzed by a high-flying ghost. Up to that point, the
showdown between the No.1- and No.2-seeded teams _ the only region
to play to form _ was being punched out in Iowa State's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones outrebounded Michigan State _ which had led the
nation in that category _ by 38-27. They held the Spartans to 40
percent shooting and had Cleaves in foul trouble with four
personals with seven minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cyclones scored only once more _ a 3-pointer by Michael
Nurse _ and Iowa State Coach Larry Eustachy beat his team to the
locker room by getting two technical fouls and being tossed from
the game with 13 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Behind by 69-64 and still seething about a double foul called
minutes earlier _ when one official disagreed with another on
whether Bell had blocked a drive by Iowa State's Paul Shirley _
Eustachy lost his composure when the all-American Marcus Fizer was
called for his fifth foul.
</P>
<P>
   He followed Referee Lonnie Dixon to midcourt and unleashed a
nose-to-nose tirade that Dixon tolerated briefly before calling two
quick technical fouls and waving Eustachy out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy went to the Michigan State bench and shook hands with
Spartans Coach Tom Izzo and then stalked off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappoint way to the end the game and I apologized
to my team for it,'' said Eustachy, who was still shaken after the
game. ``But we went down fighting and I'm not going to apologize
for my actions either. They played better quality basketball in the
last five minutes and thus they're moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cleaves was able to skip off the floor, waving his arms to
gather in the noise from the crowd, he acknowledged the Spartans
had been fortunate victors in a mostly well played war and gave all
the credit to another teammate not from Flint: the junior Andre
Hutson, who had 17 points, 11 rebounds and wore Fizer out inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was huge for us _ taking on a guy like Fizer, said Cleaves,
who had 10 points. ``Everyone was talking about Marcus, but Andre
took the challenge. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be sitting
here right now and talking about next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclone players, on the other hand, could barely talk at
all. Michael Nurse conceded that with a 6-point lead and a habit of
not making mistakes in the game's final minutes, he and his
teammates were counting on the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team thought we could win it,'' said Nurse, who had
18 points. ``We needed three stops. You got to credit them. They
didn't stop playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what their emotions were in the locker room, both
Nurse and Fizer bowed their heads and tried to talk through the
tears. Eustachy reached for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know this is our last game,'' said Fizer, who had
18 points. ``That this is the end of a great season. A lot of
people didn't expect for us to get this far. But it's over now.''

BERNARD CHALLENOR, 63, HEALTH PROFESSOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Bernard D. Challenor, a longtime public health
educator at Columbia University, died March 15 at his home in
Manhattan. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, said Jeanne M. Stellman,
a colleague at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Challenor was a professor at the Joseph L. Mailman School of
Public Health at Columbia and a former acting dean of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Desmond Challenor was born July 24, 1936, in Manhattan.
He received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College; an M.D. from
the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center in
Brooklyn; and a master's degree in public health from Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he worked with the World Health Organization and
the United States Public Health Service in Asia, Latin America and
West Africa. And he worked for the Boston Department of Health and

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a day of solemnity and outrage that degenerated
into violence, Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed son of Haitian
immigrants who was shot to death in a confrontation with the police
on March 16, was carried across Brooklyn, eulogized as a martyr and
laid to rest Saturday after a march and funeral that drew thousands
of anguished mourners and angry protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after his funeral, there were clashes between
protesters and the police, and wild scenes and sounds of chaos:
barricades tumbling under surging crowds, American flags burning,
the clashing chords of car horns, and the crash of glass thrown
from a height, all beneath the airborne staccato of police
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The police said 23 officers were injured, most of them cut by
flying glass, although one suffered a leg injury and a possible
broken nose. Four civilians were injured and at least 27 people
were arrested, most of them on charges of disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Before the protests, the police said they were preparing for a
crowd of as many as 10,000. Though they would not provide an
official crowd estimate Saturday night, one police commander put
the number at between 4,000 and 5,000 people at the demonstration's
peak.
</P>
<P>
   As the day waned and Dorismond was buried in a cemetery in
Queens County, the bitter retributions and finger-pointing that had
marked the days since his killing continued, this time over who was
responsible for the disorders that had engulfed his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the friend of violence,'' Dorismond's mother, Marie,
said at a news conference, while her son was being buried. ``I
never like to see that.'' (According to Haitian custom, parents do
not accompany their children's bodies to the graveyard.)
</P>
<P>
   At her side, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has become the family's
adviser, blamed the police for provoking the trouble. ``We do not
condone violence,'' he said into a battery of microphones. ``We
asked the police not to bring in riot gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was not at the scene, ascribed the
violence to unnamed demagogues, and praised the police for a
measured response to provocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers should receive the thanks of the entire city
for the restraint they exhibited in the face of sustained hostility
and abuse,'' the mayor said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, when
you allow demagogues to take over for political and divisive
purposes, the American flag gets shredded and burned, steel
barricades are hurled and bottles are thrown, injuring police
officers and civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor visited several hurt officers at Kings County Hospital
about 5 p.m. ``We've had some horrible provocations of the
police,'' Giuliani said. ``A large number of them were attacked,
and the way they handled it kept this down to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at the hospital, a visibly angry Joseph P. Dunne, the
chief of department, defended the way the police had handled the
demonstration. ``That crowd attacked the police, plain and
simple,'' he said. He dismissed accusations that the crowd had been
provoked by the appearance of officers in riot gear, saying, ``Some
of our officers appeared in helmets after the bottles came in from
the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   But bystanders and legal observers criticized the police's
handling of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lochard, 36, said he saw an officer hit a woman with a
billy club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to follow the funeral procession when the coffin
came out. A cop took his baton and began hitting a woman in the
crowd. Then these cops in riot gear came running down for no
reason,'' he said. ``These cops sabotaged a peaceful funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public words since the killing, Detective Anthony
Vasquez, 29, who shot Dorismond, released a statement through his
lawyer: ``On behalf of my family and myself, I want to extend our
heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Dorismond and the Dorismond family.
As a father and a son, I can only imagine the depth of your grief.
Our prayers are with you at this sorrowful hour.''
</P>
<P>
   From 9 until 11 a.m., a hearse carrying the body of the slain
26-year-old security guard led a procession of predominantly
Haitian marchers and dozens of cars on a three-mile route from a
funeral home in Marine Park to the church in Flatbush. Sobs of
grief mingled with screams of hostility against the police and
shouts demanding justice and the resignation of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   At their thickest, marchers walked 30 across, and Sharpton and
the Rev. Herbert Daughtry were among those carrying a banner that
read ``Justice for Patrick Dorismond.'' Marchers sang impromptu
songs in Haitian Creole, with lyrics like ``They hurt us, and at
the election we are going to get them back.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The procession up Flatbush Avenue was nonviolent until it neared
Holy Cross Catholic Church on Church Avenue, where the funeral Mass
was celebrated, shortly after 11 a.m. Thousands more people stood
on sidewalks, penned behind metal police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it appeared, the pent-up feelings of the day came surging
out, after more than a week of anger over the shooting and the
mayor's derogatory characterizations of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Metal police barricades were suddenly and noisily shoved down
all along the block. At least two officers fell under the metal
stanchions and were injured, one with a bloody face, one with an
injured leg. The crowds surged into the avenue, and a thin line of
police officers, clearly panicked, retreated toward the church,
where reinforcements were posted on a side street, Veronica Place.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd took over the avenue outside the church and a tense
standoff with the massing police began, the hearse drew up and
pallbearers pulled out the polished wooden coffin of Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   It was draped in Haitian and American flags. Someone ripped away
the American flag and set it ablaze. The crowd danced around it,
shouting angrily. The pallbearers carried the coffin with
difficulty through the dense crowd and into the church, a beige
limestone edifice with a single bell tower surmounted by a gold
cross.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two hours, as anger seethed outside, the interior
of the church was an island of grief and solemnity as Monsignor
Rollin J. Darbouze, the pastor, eulogized the slain man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Patrick Dorismond were to address young people today,''
Darbouze declared, ``he would say, `Because you are young and
because you are black, avoid being on street corners too long
because you could be confused for drug dealers and be killed. Spare
your own life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, the son of one of Haiti's best-known singers, Andre
Dorismond, was shot to death outside a bar on Manhattan's West Side
in a struggle with an undercover police officer. He was the fourth
unarmed black man to be killed by the police in the last 13 months
_ a series of deaths that has raised questions about the
aggressiveness of the police.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor came under fire from critics for releasing information
about Dorismond's police record, including sealed juvenile records,
for not visiting or even expressing regrets to Dorismond's family,
and for defending the police actions in the case, as he had in
previous shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was not at the funeral. ``In situations where the
person involved may have been involved in a crime, the mayor does
not attend the funeral,'' the mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel,
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the service Saturday were a number of Democratic
Party state legislators, City Council members and other
politicians, including the city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, all of
them critical of the mayor. Others who attended included the
parents of Amadou Diallo, Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant
sodomized by a police officer in a Brooklyn police station in
August 1997, and the lawyer Johnnie Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   Standing above the coffin, Darbouze said: ``Let us pray that
Patrick's death and the suffering of his family will not be in
vain. May they find solace and consolation and may they see steps
taken so that Patrick will be a lesson for all of us to work
together for a better quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the Mass, Dorismond's mother kissed the casket
three times. She was carried out, accompanied by Sharpton. Near the
door she went into convulsions, her body held high, and was then
lowered to the floor. She eventually was able to walk out of the
church.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Marie Dorismond, addressed the congregation. ``From
the limo, I could see mothers crying as if they were in labor
pain,'' she said. ``I understand you're crying with me, you're
yelling with my family. We are all in pain together.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the funeral, the crowd outside was hostile but
relatively peaceful, confining its anger to shouts of derision
against the mayor and the police, who had mustered reinforcements
and now numbered about 300 officers in helmets and other riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   But as the funeral ended and the hearse and its procession
pulled away for Cypress Hills Cemetery in Queens, scuffling broke
out between protesters and the police. People on fire escapes and
in windows along Church Avenue waved Haitian and Jamaican flags,
and some of them began hurling bottles down on the street, many of
them missing officers by inches.
</P>
<P>
   The police formed a human barricade to subdue the crowd, and
officers used their batons to knock down flying glass. Officers
with bullhorns urged the crowd to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd screamed, ``No way! No way!'' Several American
flags were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Norman Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties
Union, discussed tactics with police commanders, urging them to
order the police in riot gear to retreat a short distance. At one
point the officers agreed, and a Brooklyn state assemblyman, N.
Nick Perry, and Siegel approached the crowds standing behind the
police barricades, telling people that they could be arrested if
they remained in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do the smart thing and move to the sidewalk,'' Perry
said. ``Let's not play into the hands of the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most vocal people in the crowd did not want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our streets,'' shouted Zulaykha Kamille, of East
Flatbush. ``We are protesting peacefully. We are ready to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Thomas stood nearby, pointing at his small, open Bible.
``You can't stop people from doing what they're doing,'' he said.
``They've been hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   During a scuffle one woman who was later arrested knocked off an
officer's hat, and an officer had his hands around the throat of
another woman being arrested. Officers struggled to get many of
those arrested into handcuffs and into wagons.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd began to break up around 3:30, the police fought a
series of skirmishes with smaller groups, mostly composed of
youths, who roamed the streets of Flatbush, taunting and cursing
the officers. The scuffles often arose as the police tried to break
up knots of people, who pushed back as the officers pressed them
with nightsticks. Bottles were thrown at the police during some of
these scuffles, and the police were seen to use pepper spray and
what appeared to be tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wouldn't have happened if these barricades weren't
here,'' a man, who declined to give his name, said as the violence
ebbed. ``Giuliani is trying to control us with this.'' He suddenly
grabbed a barricade and hurled it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Another mourner took a more peaceful approach. ``Maybe by all of
us being here, we can bring about some justice,'' Vanecia Gousse,
28, a nurse's assistant, said as she stood in front of the church
gate.

UNIONS MAY DISRUPT L.A. DURING CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flexing its new power, Los Angeles labor unions
with more than 250,000 members have banded together to fight for
lucrative contracts in the public and private sectors, threatening
to embarrass or even disrupt the city during this summer's
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   From blue-collar workers to actors and writers, from sheriff's
deputies to janitors and graduation students, the coalition of
local unions hopes to see them work together if they don't win
large pay raises or other concessions in contract talks that kick
off this month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets of joint protests _ and, as a last resort,
strikes _ are the Los Angeles Unified School District, county
government, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, city of Long
Beach, the Gas Co. and Kaiser Permanente.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city workers are not members of the coalition but
police and firefighters are up for a new contract, and those talks
will add to the labor tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a convergence of this kind with the
opening of collective bargaining,'' said Miguel Contreras,
executive secretary-treasurer of the federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also don't think we've ever been at a point where so
many workers have contracts coming up in the same period. We just
realized what we will be facing last year and it sent up a red flag
for us to try to create a common message around the county.''
</P>
<P>
   As a way to kick off the campaign, some 2,000 members of the
different unions have scheduled a rally and march Tuesday in the
downtown area, beginning at LAUSD headquarters and picking up
marchers at the county Hall of Administration, Ronald Reagan State
Building and other locations, ending up at Pershing Square.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras said each union will be negotiating on its own, but
will look to the others for support in the event of any
demonstrations or work actions.
</P>
<P>
   And while he voiced hope the negotiations would be concluded
before the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, he
acknowledged it could be a factor in some talks and that local
officials do not want to see the city embarrassed during the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, the county wants to hold off on some talks until
after the convention,'' Contreras said. ``We think we should be at
the table now.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners are monitoring the situation and voice hope
there will be no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that any labor issue will be resolved before
the convention begins,'' said Ben Austin, spokesman for the Los
Angeles Host Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But others privately admit to having some concerns if there is
not a resolution on most of the contracts by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get to June and there are still a number of outstanding
contracts, it would be a real concern,'' said one official, asking
not to be identified. ``If it gets to July, then it's a red-hot
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides of Mayor Richard Riordan said he is monitoring the
situation and believes the unions will have successfully completed
most of their contracts by the time of the convention. The
convention is scheduled Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The first test could some soon, with the janitors who are
members of SEIU Local 1877 preparing for a strike starting April1.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of janitors and their supporters demonstrated Friday
along Ventura Boulevard in Encino, temporarily stopping traffic,
while similar protests were held in Pasadena and Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are working to do is get the message out that it is
unions who represent workers and will get the best deal for them,''
Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   The federation had its most successful year ever last year,
signing up 91,000 workers for unions, mostly home-care workers. It
has continued its aggressive recruitment drive this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp.
of Los Angeles, said forming the coalition was a logical next step
for the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is strong and they want to get their fair share,''
Kyser said. ``But there are some who worry that while the economy
is good now, it might cool off and they don't want to get into high
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Contreras said workers particularly those in the government
sector are due for large raises since many took pay cuts or saw
their salaries frozen during the bad economic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the workers who took the cuts and when the economy is
strong, we should benefit as well,'' Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the contract talks involve more issues than
salary and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sacharow, a spokesman for the federation, said teachers
will be dealing with issues such as the breakup of the school
district and pressure to accept merit pay rules. Workers in the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority are concerned about efforts
to create a San Fernando Valley Transit Zone that would take over
operation of dozens of MTA bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges facing the unions is getting members to
work together and support one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what we're doing is education and let someone who
works for the Gas Co. know that an unemployed actor or writer from
the Screen Actors Guild has the same problems he does,'' Contreras
said.

PAINTER GOING ON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For more than a year, an unfinished, 12-story
mural of the Statue of Liberty has gazed down on the National
Cemetery from a nearby building in Westwood, a tear in her eye
reflecting a battle over free speech and city rules for public art.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Mike McNeilly intended the mural as a tribute to fallen
veterans. But now it symbolizes his fight with City Hall over rules
that required him to win Councilman Mike Feuer's approval before he
can even apply for permission to paint the privately owned
building.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, more than a year after police and building inspectors
forced him to stop the mural on the Westwood Medical building,
McNeilly goes on trial for painting ``Liberty'' without a permit.
He faces six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the chilling effect when a politician can put a
chilling effect on your right of free speech,'' McNeilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a picture of the top half of the Statue of Liberty
in the United States of America. I can't think of anything more
fitting than the symbol of freedom within one block of the National
Cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly said that just as police moved in to stop him from
finishing the painting, he improvised a tear drop to reflect his
frustration and anger.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer refused to comment on the matter, citing the pending
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a city renowned for larger-than-life murals and billboards,
the controversy pits the artistic community against critics
fighting what they see as visual clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's being unjustly persecuted as an artist for doing
his work,'' said Al Boime, an art history professor at University
of California, Los Angeles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Feuer argued in a letter to the Cultural Affairs Commission last
year that murals such as this ``detract from the scenic aspects of
the Wilshire Corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his office ``continues to get numerous complaints
about this illegally installed sign,'' and said McNeilly should not
be allowed to finish what he started without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly admits he never applied for a permit because he
believes the city's permit system was arbitrary and
unconstitutional. It allowed a single council member in this case
Feuer to block the project before McNeilly could even submit his
permit application to the Cultural Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since McNeilly voiced his criticisms, the restriction has been
removed, but the city continues to prosecute him
</P>
<P>
   and the building's owner for painting without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time Feuer has stood in the way of
McNeilly's efforts to paint the building. The councilman blocked
him from painting a Disney-commissioned mermaid in 1997, so
McNeilly assumed Feuer wouldn't approve Lady Liberty and decided to
ignore the rules as a form of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try it once and they slam you down. You either go back and
fight it your own way, or you just don't do it, which means you've
given up your basic right of free speech,'' McNeilly said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21, 1999, he fought it his own way. After obtaining
permission from the building owner, he and his assistants began
work on the mural. They had finished the top half of her face when,
according to McNeilly, at least eight police officers, along with
building inspectors and other city officials, descended on the
building and forced him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly was allowed to go back up briefly to secure his
equipment, and managed to paint a subtle teardrop.
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly then tried to legally apply for a permit, only to be
quickly rejected by Feuer and the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Gloria Dabbs-Mann said the fairness of the
permit process is not the issue, since McNeilly didn't file for a
permit first. If he had, and was rejected, he could have appealed
that rejection and then argued the process was unfair, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is being prosecuted for painting the mural without a
permit or a contractor's license and then refusing to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that Mr. McNeilly needs to take down that sign
because it wasn't permitted,'' Dabbs-Mann said. ``If you allow him
to have a sign up, everyone can put a sign up on a building without
a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that even under the old process, the Cultural Affairs
Department's staff would sometimes make exceptions and allow
permits to go forward without a councilman's letter of support.
</P>
<P>
   McNeilly and his attorney, Gary Mobley of Irvine, counter that
he did not have to apply for a permit to challenge the
constitutionality of the law, citing Supreme Court decisions that
date to the civil rights protests of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Boime, the art history professor, said that public murals are an
important part of Greater Los Angeles' culture and history, from
the Chicano protest murals of East L.A. to the enormous commercial
``tall-walls'' of West Hollywood's Sunset Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think L.A. culture, you think murals. First as a form
of protest, then also as a way of enhancing the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the appearance of the neighborhood would be
improved, not hurt, by this particular mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least this gives it some color and appeal. And it does have
a symbolic importance in overlooking the veterans' cemetery.''

VIVIAN HARRIS, 97, COMEDIAN, CHORUS GIRL AND LONGTIME `VOICE OF THE
APOLLO'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vivian Harris, a comedian and chorus girl and the
performer with the most recorded appearances _ 10,000 _ at the
Apollo Theater in Harlem, died Feb. 18 in Englewood, N.J. She was
97.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who died at the Nursing and Retirement Home of the
Actors Fund of America, was one of the women hired by the manager
of the Cotton Club for a new chorus line when Duke Ellington came
to play for the white audience there. She was one of the first ever
to dance the Charleston, in the 1923 Broadway show ``Runnin'
Wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She performed with the top black comics Pigmeat Markham, Spider
Bruce and Ralph Cooper during the Depression years, when comedy
kept the Apollo afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Reed, a singer and dancer at the Apollo in 1935 and
theater manager from 1950 to 1960, remembers her as ``one of the
sweetest girls I ever met in my life.'' Indeed, the two were
sweethearts from 1927 until 1929. Until the Apollo started using
masters of ceremony in the mid-1950s, he said, it was her voice,
clear and precise, that came from behind the curtain to announce
the night's big attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `The Apollo Theater takes great pleasure in
presenting Duke Ellington' or Cab Calloway, or whoever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Miles, a filmmaker who made the 1981 documentary ``I
Remember Harlem,'' said Harris was known as the Voice of the
Apollo. In addition to her announcements, he said, she often sang
``I May Be Wrong, but I Think You're Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was born on Dec. 23, 1902, in Harlem. She was the second
of five daughters; the others were Lottie, Margie, Lorraine and
Edna Mae, who became a star of the black cinema. Her father, Sam,
gained some fame as a boxer and then became a customs inspector.
Her mother, Mary, worked as a maid for the Gay 90's pin-up Lillian
Russell, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As blacks gradually moved uptown, the Harrises were among the
first black families to migrate to Harlem. They wanted to be near
the new home of their church. Their brownstone on 132nd Street was
also near the Lafayette Theater, where stars like Ethel Waters,
Maud Russell, and Butterbeans and Susie would perform.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister Lottie was something of a groupie; she would invite
the performers to the house for dinner and often to stay for the
night. Harris said, ``I might as well open a rooming house,'' and
did.
</P>
<P>
   This resulted in the stars' practicing routines in the house's
big kitchen. They worked with the girls on their singing and
dancing skills and encouraged them to pursue show business careers.
All but Margie did.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Julia Richmond High School, Vivian joined
``Shuffle Along,'' the Broadway production put together in 1921 by
the ragtime pianist Eubie Blake and the singer and lyricist Noble
Sissle. The show ushered in a series of successful black musicals
on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Harris went on to be a chorus girl in ``Runnin' Wild,'' with
music by James P. Johnson and lyrics by Cecil Mack, which added a
new dance, the Charleston, to the national repertory. Mae Barnes
introduced the dance in the first act, but Harris' spirited
third-act version also drew enthusiastic attention.
</P>
<P>
   A review in The New York Times of Oct. 31, 1923, said that in
addition to its funny comedy, the show ``excels in eccentric
dancing _ some of the most exciting steps of the season (though
steps is not always the right word, for knees are used more often
than ankles) are now on view at the Colonial.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris performed in other productions on what came to be known
as Black Broadway. She traveled to Paris, London and other European
cities with Lew Leslie's ``Blackbirds,'' a theatrical revue.
Working with Tim Moore, who became famous as Kingfish in the ``Amos
'n' Andy'' television series, she performed the burial scene from
the play ``Porgy,'' the precursor to the same scene in Gershwin's
opera ``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   When Duke Ellington started at the Cotton Club in 1927, the
manager hired a new chorus line, which included Harris. ``They had
nothing but light girls, they didn't have any real dark girls there
at the time,'' Harris said in the Harlem documentary. ``Only the
two girls at the ends of the line were dark.'' She was considered
light.
</P>
<P>
   The women wore big, feathery costumes, and Harris' exotic tap
dance caught the eye of one of Ellington's trumpet players, Louis
Metcalf. The two were married, with cases of Champagne to
celebrate, despite Prohibition. Harris said the gangsters who
controlled the Cotton Club were the benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935 Frank Schiffman, the manager of the Lafayette Theater,
bought a burlesque house on 125th Street that Mayor Fiorello La
Guardia had ordered closed. It became the Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   Harris started there in 1935 as the voice behind the curtain,
and over the years performed with almost all the popular black
comedy acts. She played in the first rendition of Pigmeat Markham's
``Here comes the judge'' skit, immortalized for a later generation
by Flip Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In Dusty Fletcher's ``Open the door, Richard'' skit, another
classic of the black comedic stage, she played the woman in the
window Dusty vainly tried to reach.
</P>
<P>
   When Moore went out to California to play Kingfish on ``Amos 'n'
Andy,'' he recommended Harris to play Kingfish's wife, Sapphire.
She flunked the screen test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out looking too white,'' Harris said. ``I was rejected
and it broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But she stayed at the Apollo until 1970, working as cashier and
in the wardrobe department when she was not onstage. Undoubtedly,
some of her 10,000 appearances involved exchanging tickets for
money in the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister Edna Mae, who left home to star in films, including
``The Green Pastures'' in 1936 and ``The Notorious Elinor Lee'' in
1940, always lamented that her sister did not aim higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have had a career like Ethel Waters or Alberta
Hunter,'' Edna Mae said in the 1980s. ``I still don't know why she
stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian's marriage was brief, and she never remarried. There are
no immediate survivors. But when she visited Harlem, as she did
almost every day until recent years, everybody greeted her.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, Harris' long-ago boyfriend, was known for his theme song,
``It's Over Because We're Through.'' But he says he cannot remember
why he and Harris broke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a hate bone in Vivian's body,'' he said.

GLITZ RETURNING IN FILM CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(``Tonight's'' in story refers to Sunday, March 26.) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Shreiber, unheralded author of an anti-IRS
tract and full-time street hawker of old magazines, looks at the
scene along Hollywood Boulevard and sees ``a sleazy, scuzzy place''
full of ``lunatics and vagrants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood reminds me of a suburb of Tijuana,'' he says flatly,
unimpressed by the touches of glitter that have begun to dot this
legendary street of grand illusions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the film industry gathers for tonight's 72nd Oscars
ceremony, skeptical voices like Shreiber's are being drowned out by
the roar of construction equipment and the buzz of speculators.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of decline, new restaurants, stores, coffeehouses
and nightclubs are poking up through Hollywood's grimy sidewalks.
At the northwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue,
the massive $430 million retail-entertainment complex that will
permanently host the Academy Awards rises at a feverish pace, next
to the new subway station that is supposed to bring tourists in
record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to say to people is if you haven't come to
Hollywood lately, you haven't seen it,'' says Jackie Goldberg, the
powerful Los Angeles City Council member whose district encompasses
much of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But along with Hollywood's long-delayed, oft-proclaimed revival
has come great uncertainty _ and sticky questions about the shape
of its future.
</P>
<P>
   Will wary suburbanites who haven't set foot in Hollywood in
years be lured by its growing lineup of tourist-friendly
attractions?
</P>
<P>
   Can the area's eccentric and colorful street life, represented
by people like Michael Shreiber, co-exist with the sleek ``new
economy'' culture of dot-coms colonizing the area?
</P>
<P>
   Will whatever still remains of Old Hollywood's raffish charm _
its vintage 1920s office buildings and musty antique bars be
eclipsed by the towering new retail developments?
</P>
<P>
   In short, will the new Hollywood offer a dynamic and complex
urban environment, or a sanitized simulacrum a la Universal
Citywalk?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anyone even remotely could say that
development is not going to be good for Hollywood,'' says Margaret
Crawford, a professor at Southern California Institute of
Architecture. ``But good in the long run? Good in the short run?
Good for who?''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions may sound almost heretical in a town that has
been awaiting its economic savior for nearly 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the 1920s and'30s, the major film studios began
uprooting from Hollywood and taking their act to Century City and
the San Fernando Valley. Only one, Paramount, still survives there
intact.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Hollywood never got over the exodus. By 1954
producer David O. Selznick was grumbling that ``Hollywood is like
Egypt, full of crumbled pyramids. It'll never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, the last of Hollywood's once-glamorous
storefronts were morphing into porn shops and wig emporiums, and
its star-embossed sidewalks were serving as makeshift beds for
junkies and teen-age runaways.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, earthquakes, riots and Southern
California's swooning economy took a further toll. Just one year
ago, City Council President John Ferraro described Hollywood as ``a
cesspool'' where visitors ``come from all over the world,
regurgitate and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But today that jaundiced viewpoint contrasts sharply with the
hopeful forecasts of planners and politicians: Hollywood's worst
days may indeed be behind it.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Since 1993, violent crime in the district is down more than 75
percent and property crime down 55 percent. Office rents in that
period have doubled to an average of $2 per square foot, still a
bargain by Westside standards.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the new commercial activity has centered on
Hollywood Boulevard between Vine and La Brea, investment has begun
moving south toward Santa Monica Boulevard, which is part of a
business improvement area called the Hollywood Media District.
Among its new tenants are IFILM, a digital film company that's
relocating its 150 employees to Hollywood from San Francisco, and
Kozmo.com, a New York-based firm that delivers products ranging
from groceries to DVDs via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area of Hollywood has been a hub for production and
post-production, but it has never really touted itself the way the
media district in, say, Burbank has,'' says Julie Kleinick,
director of acquisitions and leasing for Albert Sweet Development.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ryan, IFILM's chief financial officer, says that five
years ago, ``I wouldn't have set foot in this area.'' Now, he
believes Los Angeles is ``the next big boomtown in the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Residential home sales also are up throughout Hollywood,
Realtors report.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the area's most prominent signs of renewal can be
found along Hollywood Boulevard between La Brea and Highland, the
stretch most frequented by tourists. In the past, the majority of
these visitors came, saw, and left central Hollywood in less than
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Today, construction cranes loom over Hollywood Boulevard, where
Toronto-based TrizecHahn Development Corp. is raising a
640,000-square-foot retail complex, due to open in September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling two full blocks and subsidized with $98 million in
city bonds, the project will include a 640-room hotel, a spa, a
ballroom and architecture mimicking the faux-Babylonian sets from
D.W. Griffith's ``Intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Its centerpiece will be the 3,000-seat Premiere Theatre for
concerts and other live performances between annual Oscar
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Among its future neighbors will be the $20 million Hollywood
Orangeland project, next to Mann's Chinese Theatre, which will
house retail stores and a Frederick's of Hollywood museum.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, TV Guide announced plans for a West Coast
headquarters in a 12-story building across from the Chinese and the
TrizecHahn project.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Davidson, senior vice president of corporate marketing
for TrizecHahn Development, predicts that a redeveloped Hollywood
could draw 20 million visitors annually up from its current
9million and nearly double the 11 million people who attend the
theater annually in New York City's Times Square district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception was always much worse than the reality,'' says
Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce. ``That's what we've had to battle in bringing Hollywood
back. It was the reputation ... as this place with hookers and
pimps on every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hollywood's new development is not without critics. Some say
the TrizecHahn project is a suburban-style mall of the kind that
saps the vitality of surrounding streets
</P>
<P>
   the antithesis of Pasadena's One Colorado, in the heart of Old
Town, or Santa Monica's popular Third Street Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really are based on the urban block and the idea of the
city, and this (TrizecHahn) is more of a shopping mall, inwardly
focused,'' says Crawford.
</P>

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending March 18 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

LOS ANGELES: focused,'' says Crawford    
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She personally welcomes such recent additions to the
neighborhood as a new Starbucks, but believes that the rush to
entice middle-class shoppers and diners will sacrifice the area's
eclectic quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we need to be romantic about tattoo parlors and hustlers?''
Crawford asks. ``No. But at the same time there are legitimate
concerns about that kind of homogenizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Hollywood VOTE, a group lobbying for Hollywood to
secede from the city of Los Angeles and become its own
municipality, maintain that Hollywood's spruce-up has simply
arrived too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there has been a lot of money dumped here lately,'' says
Hollywood VOTE attorney Mitchell Green. ``But I think a lot of that
has to do with Hollywood being so ridiculously run-down that it
attracted the money. There was a vacuum here. I don't think that's
something the city can take credit for. It happened through
neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that neglect is still highly visible. On Hollywood
Boulevard, boarded-up buildings sit side-by-side with Disney's
brilliantly restored El Capitan movie house. East of Highland
Avenue the foot traffic drops off, especially after dark, and most
storefronts are shuttered well before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood today remains, at best, a patchy work in progress, a
bazaar of contradictory impulses that change from building to
building.
</P>
<P>
   But where some see neglect, others sense opportunity, like New
York City's 42nd Street/Times Square area, which in recent years
has evolved from a tawdry strip of peep shows and porn theaters
into a booming entertainment mecca.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that parallel, in October the Walt Disney
Co. will open its hit Broadway musical ``The Lion King'' at the art
deco-style Pantages Theatre at Hollywood and Vine, which is
undergoing extensive renovations for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Just 2 years ago, Disney's opening of ``The Lion King'' at New
York's New Amsterdam Theatre, an ornate 1903 vaudeville house
painstakingly restored by Disney Imagineers, signaled 42nd Street's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   Now Disney _ which spurred corporate interest in Hollywood three
years ago when it bought and restored the El Capitan movie house _
is hoping that ``The Lion King'' can further reclaim Hollywood's
lost luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Hollywood is all about,'' says Peter Schneider,
president of Walt Disney Theatrical Productions. ``It's always been
about the entrepreneur, the excitement of the movies, the
excitement of what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theatres and
Producers Inc., the national trade organization for the commercial
theater industry, thinks Hollywood faces many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to feel safe, you have to feel comfortable, and you
have to feel that it's not going to take you an hour to drive from
Brentwood to Hollywood and Vine,'' Bernstein says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will all of Hollywood's new cultural attractions be of the
PG-13 variety.
</P>
<P>
   The Knitting Factory, the renowned New York City music club and
paragon of digital-age hipness, will launch a Hollywood satellite
this summer in the Hollywood Galaxy building, near Mann's Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was drawn to the Hollywood area not only because
of the new corporate investment, but because its edgy ambience
evokes a funkier, pre-gentrified New York, says Guy Compton,
KnitMedia director of marketing and media relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area now sort of walks the line,'' Compton says. ``It's
got almost like the old 42nd Street feel to it.''

<P>
   &UR; CRIES UNHEARD: Why Children Kill. The Story of Mary Bell &LR;  By
Gitta Sereny. Owl/Holt, $16. Drawing on extensive interviews with
an Englishwoman who murdered two boys in 1968 when she was 11, the
author examines the troubling question of how society should deal
with children who commit violence. ``This is an extraordinarily
important and powerful work,'' Alex Kotlowitz wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999. ``It will agitate, provoke and poke and
prod your preconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLIZZARD OF ONE: Poems &LR;  By Mark Strand. Knopf, $15. In this
Pulitzer Prize-winning collection, the eminent poet approaches the
universal through the universal, apprehending a snowflake, for
example, not in its particularity but as linked to a continuum of
snowflakes outside and inside the reader's consciousness. His
magisterial verse evokes a godless world that returns our gaze with
a blank stare, and he offers only small consolations and rare
``spectral glimpses'' of poetic epiphany. ``Strand's willingness to
grapple at this dim frontier has a salutary, lone-wolf quality that
makes him more interesting as his voice mellows and ages,'' Deborah
Garrison wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A PRAYER FOR THE DYING &LR;  By Stewart O'Nan. Picador USA, $13. The
sheriff of a small Wisconsin town is driven to the brink of madness
by a crisis brought on by twin plagues: a diphtheria epidemic and
advancing brush fires that threaten the lives of the quarantined
townspeople. Last year the reviewer Patrick McGrath called this ``a
fine, terse novel about the circumstantial nature of evil and the
terrible fragility of man.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDING IN A RIVER WAVING A STICK &LR;  By John Gierach.
Fireside/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13. This literate collection of
fly-fishing essays resembles an angler's book of days. ``It is as
fine a representation of outdoor writing as you're likely to find _
wise, funny and well wrought,'' Jeff MacGregor wrote in The New
York Times Book Review last year. ``Gierach is sly and smart and
writes a clean, purposeful line of prose.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN &LR;  By David Foster Wallace.
Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95. Moral fervor bubbles through these
unconventional stories about male selfishness, which are populated
by ``monstrous, parodic versions of Updikean characters,'' Adam
Goodheart said in 1999. ``Even when Wallace's postmodernist
chemistry projects simply fizzle out, there is always at least a
whiff of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FARM SHE WAS &LR;  By Ann Mohin. Bridge Works, $13.95. This
poetic first novel about a tenacious 90-year-old woman struggling
to endure on her family's farm in upstate New York celebrates the
sounds and sensations of the barnyard. ``The particulars of her
seemingly humble life ... make her about as entertaining as any
real person could be,'' Sally Eckhoff wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAYING FOR KEEPS: Michael Jordan and the World He Made &LR;  By
David Halberstam. Broadway, $14. In canvassing the dazzling career
of the basketball superstar, Halberstam depicts his subject as not
only a top-flight hoopster but a top-flight pitchman. ``Halberstam
delivers ... insight, balance, analysis'' and hard-dug facts, Ira
Berkow said in 1999. ``He skillfully skirts hagiography.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; MICHAEL JORDAN AND THE NEW GLOBAL CAPITALISM &LR; , by Walter
LaFeber (Norton, $12.95), a historian uses Jordan's popularity and
the worldwide profitability of the sportswear maker Nike to issue a
polemic on the corrosive effects of American capitalism abroad.
Last year the reviewer Jay R. Mandle said LaFeber begins with
``sound premises'' but fails to make a very persuasive case.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OF CABBAGES AND KINGS COUNTY: Agriculture and the Formation of
Modern Brooklyn &LR;  By Marc Linder and Lawrence S. Zacharias.
University of Iowa, $21.95. This timely study of the effects of
unchecked suburban sprawl charts the transformation of
turn-of-the-century Brooklyn from a rural community into a tightly
packed urban center. The result is a ``thoughtful and well-written
history,'' Keith Schneider wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS: An Oral History of Manhattan From the
1890s to World War II &LR; , by Jeff Kisseloff (Johns Hopkins
University, $19.95), is a sweeping collage of voices drawn from 10
city neighborhoods. In 1989 the reviewer Meredith Tax said
``Kisseloff is a sensitive interviewer'' and his book ``has
wonderful passages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MODEL BEHAVIOR &LR;  By Jay McInerney. Vintage Contemporaries, $11.
A young magazine writer gets dumped by a beautiful model and
searches for meaning amid the decadent glamour of New York. Sound
familiar? In 1998 the reviewer A.O. Scott found this return to the
terrain of ``Bright Lights, Big City'' to be a mixed bag.
``McInerney is a gifted and exasperating writer,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SINKING OF THE ODRADEK STADIUM &LR;  By Harry Mathews. Dalkey
Archive, $11.95. In a series of madcap letters, an American
intellectual in Miami Beach and his Asian wife, who is living in
Italy, chronicle their fitful search for a treasure supposedly lost
off the Florida coast in the 16th century. In 1975 the reviewer
Edmund White called this futuristic novel ``a comic masterpiece.''
