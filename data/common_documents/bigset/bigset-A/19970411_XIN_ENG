<HEADLINE> World Trade Growth up Four Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The volume of world merchandise
trade increased by four percent in 1996 after two years of strong
growth, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
World trade saw new records both in goods exports and services
exports. In value terms, world merchandise exports passed the
5,000 billion U.S. dollars mark for the first time, increasing
four percent to 5,100 U.S. billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Middle East recorded merchandise export
and import growth of 10 percent or more in value terms. For the
first time since 1990, the value of Africa's exports and imports
expanded more rapidly than total world trade, largely on the basis
of increased fuel exports.
</P>
<P>
The first five most rapidly increasing exporters are Malaysia,
the Philippines, China, Thailand and Singapore. The leading
importers are Argentina, Poland, Malaysia, Philippines and China .
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary examination of the evolution of world trade in
1996 based on statistics available as of early March, WTO
predicted a stronger trade growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Based largely on the projected recovery of economic growth and
trade in Western Europe and Asia, and continued high growth in
Latin America, the volume of world trade in 1997 should expand
somewhat faster than the four percent gain in 1996, said the WTO.
</P>
<P>
A more detailed and extensive analysis of trade developments in
1996 will be published in November in the WTO Annual Report.

<HEADLINE> Policewoman Shot, Wounded in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A policewoman was shot and wounded
in Northern Ireland this afternoon in a suspected Irish Republican
Army (IRA) guerrilla shooting incident, BBC television said today.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place outside the courthouse in the city of
Londonderry, Northern Ireland, shortly before 1500 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The officer was on duty close to the building in Bishop Street
when she was hit, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
One shot is believed to have been fired from a car. The officer
is said to have been wounded in the chest.
</P>
<P>
No other details were reported at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The shooting happened as senior Republicans dismissed
speculation of an IRA cease-fire before Britain's general election
on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has been fighting for 28 years to end British
rule in Northern Ireland, was believed to be responsible for a
series of bomb attacks recently both in Ulster and mainland
Britain with the purpose of forcing the government to permit Sinn
Fein, its political wing, to enter peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain has refused to admit Sinn Fein to the Northern Ireland
peace talks unless the IRA declares a lasting cease-fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of companies being
formed in Britain in the first three months of this year increased
sharply, underlining a strong economy, according to figures today
from Jordans, a business information specialist.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in mainland Britain, a total of 46,637 new
companies were set up in the first quarter, up 16.2 percent over
the same period last year and the biggest year-on-year rise since
the third quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, company start-ups grew for every month this year,
from 13,821 in January to 16,640 in March, although Jordans said
that the March figures might be flattered as lawyers must complete
company registration processes before the end of the financial
year, namely the end of March.
</P>
<P>
For 1996 as a whole, a record 163,798 new companies were
registered, a rise of 13.8 percent over the previous year.

NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Front (UF) would
recommend dissolution of Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) if
it loses tomorrow's confidence vote and it ruled out resignation
of the Deve Gowda government ahead of the vote, UF sources said
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
"Moral and legal" force of the recommendation would be the same
whether it was made after the defeat in the house or before that
when its majority was in doubt, the sources said, adding that the
president would have to explore the possibility of an alternative
government before taking a decision.
</P>
<P>
The front steering committee has also decided to send a
delegation to the president to convey it to him that none of the
front constituents would support the Congress in the formation of
government.
</P>
<P>
The front would not shy away from facing the confidence vote,
the sources further said.
</P>
<P>
The UF decided to face the confidence vote tomorrow following
the failure of two rounds of formal talks with the Congress since
last night. The UF rejected the Congress's demand to change the
leadership of the government in the talks. President S. D. Sharma
asked the UF to prove its majority in parliament on April 11 after
the Congress withdrew its support to it on March 30.

<HEADLINE> US White House Eases Stance in Budget Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
signaled its willingness to support further cuts in domestic
spending to woo the U.S. Congress in budget talks starting this
week.
</P>
<P>
There is a big spending gap of roughly 200 billion U.S. dollars
between the five-year spending plan President Bill Clinton
proposed last February and the Republicans' requirements put
forward last year.
</P>
<P>
During the budget talks this week, the White House offered
another cut of 18 billion dollars on Medicare Tuesday, raising the
promised cut to 100 billion dollars in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
It was seen as a major compromise of the U.S. government
although the reduction is still far from the requirements of
Republicans who asked for trimming of the Medicare by 180 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House negotiators have been seeking more
spending cut on the Medicare and other entitlement programs
although the Democrats in the Congress are objecting to the White
House making unilateral concessions while the Republicans haven't
even proposed a budget this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are supposed to discuss tax cut beginning from
today -- an area in which the White House is looking for
Republicans to give some ground.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the Congress want as much as 200 billion dollars
in the tax cut in the next five years while President proposed a
reduction of 98 billion in his budget plan this year.
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans have not showed any retreat from their
stance on the tax cut as yet.
</P>
<P>
Far from suggesting any retreat on the tax cut, U.S. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is not a party in the current budget
talks, called Wednesday for more tax cuts such as the elimination
of capital gains and estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
How to trim the spending and cut the taxes to reach a balanced
budget by 2002 has been a major dispute between the Democratic
government and the Republican-controlled Congress in the U.S. in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The dispute on the budget of fiscal year 1996 resulted in two
government shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996 and it was seen
as a prelude of the U.S. presidential election last year.

HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangzhou Apollo
trounced newly-crowned Viceroy Cup winners Sing Tao of Hong Kong
6-0 to win the Viceroy Challenge Cup soccer tournament here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao, who took the Viceroy Cup, Hong Kong's most
prestigious professional soccer trophy, four days ago, launched
waves upon waves of offensives in the early stage of the
match. But lack of coordination foiled their efforts and their
hasty shots did not convert to any goal.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Apollo, now third on team standings at China's
professional first division league, played a solid game, with
quick switchings from defense to offensives.
</P>
<P>
Apollo's forward Tan Ende opened the scoring with two
consecutive goals at the 43rd and 44th minutes. His successful
shots were launched almost from the very same spot -- just outside
the penalty zone.
</P>
<P>
The Apollo players scored four goals in the second half, three
through efforts by forward Karim Haddaovi, including a successful
penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
Scorers:
</P>
<P>
Apollo: Tan Ende (43rd minute, 44th), Karim Haddaovi (51st,

<HEADLINE> Faction Leaders Meet to Solve Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu's main faction
leaders, Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed met at
Ramadan Hotel at the green line dividing Mogadishu today so solve
differences.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two men which was the fourth one since
Hussein Aidid succeeded his late father lasted for 90 minutes and
remained indoors with the press people waiting outside the
meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
The unforeseen meeting was also attended by the 22 member
committees appointed by the two men for solving the political
differences between the two factions as well as the pacification
of Mogadishu. According to one of the delegates, the chairman of
the committee appointed by Ali Mahdi Mohamed, engineer Mohamed
Hussein Addow, their discussions have been successful so far.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Addow who very driefly spoke with the newsmen outside
the hotel after the meeting said the committees have put forward
the agendas of their discussion to their faction leaders who
according to him have fully accepted and commended their efforts.
The agendas for the discussion were not disclosed, however it is
believed that they consisted of sensitive issues regarding the
long-standing power struggle between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Underground reports said Ali Mahdi's committee has proposed a
six point agenda to be negotiated over. According to the report,
the agendas include the culmination of the political
misunderstanding with each side stepping down from its former
attitudes towards the other. The agendas also include the
formation of a system that avoids any kind of armed hostility
between the people of the two sides in the war torn capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Hussein Aidid's side had yet to
respond to the proposed agendas forwarded to them early this
week. However, south Mogadishu authority has generally endorsed
to collaborate with the agendas even though they will be
subjected to some modifications according to a member in the
meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Outside the meeting at Ramadan hotel, heavily armed militiamen
whith dozens of battle wagons and technicals have been securing
the stability of the area with both militia officers working
together. The militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid have been
placed at the eastern side of the hotel overseeing north
Mogadishu, while those of Ali Mahdi Mohamed were also put at the
northern end of the hotel with their back to south Mogadishu. The
security system has increased the morale of the militiamen and
some of them have even chatted and smoked together. There were
also many people outside the building with happy faces about a
new hope for peace at least in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The meeting today has been sponsored by the committees of the
two factions who have been continuing their meetings since April
1. There has been no foreign involvement in the meeting today,
however it believed that the factions were still respecting the
diplomatic shuttle initiated by Mr Giuseppe Cassini, the Italian
special envoy to Somalia who managed to get the two faction
leaders together on January 20 at Ramadan hotel.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the meeting, south Mogadishu faction leader,
Hussein Mohamed Aidid has headed to km-50 airstrip and flew to
Nairobi on his way to Cairo where he will meet top officials from
the government of Egypt who earlier held talks with Ali Mahdi's.
The meeting today took place only two days after the conclusion
of the national salvation council meeting in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Tries to Dominate Feminine Protection Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Company, a
consumer product giant in the United States, announced Wednesday
that it would buy Tambrands Inc. in an attempt to dominate the
feminine protection business.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the acquisition would be the largest ever
made by the company which already leads the market for sanitary
pads with its Always and Whisper brands and would now dominate the
tampon market with Tambrands' Tampax brand.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G, which sells 35 billion U.S. dollars worth of consumer
products annually in 140 countries, intends to use its enormous
distribution system to expand the Tampax brand globally and create
new marketing programs for the brand.
</P>
<P>
Tambrands is based in White Plains in New York state and has
annual sales of 662 million U.S. dollars. The acquisition would
mark the end of Tambrands as an independent company after more
than 60 years as the market leader in tampons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada to Go Alone on Trade Pacts With S.America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada is prepared to go it alone
in negotiating free-trade agreements with South America if the
United States continues dragging its feet on a continent-wide
trade zone.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can wait," Canadian Trade Minister Art
Eggleton was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue with our agenda of building up
opportunities in Latin America whether or not the Americans are
there," Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
Canada may sign a free trade pact with South America's largest
trading bloc, Mercosur. "We will further explore whether it's
Mercosur or individual countries -- anyway we can expand our
opportunities in Latin America," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will raise the issue of Canada going alone
in a trade initiative with Mercosur when Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso visits Canada in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He also expects to explore the unilateral negotiations further
on May 15, when the hemispheric trade ministers convene in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Canada has been getting impatient with the fact that a U.S.
pledge to create a hemispheric pact has stalled again.
</P>
<P>
It is afraid that the European Union (EU) will further increase
its trade ties on South America.
</P>
<P>
The EU has already been well ahead of Canada and the U.S. in
trade with the four Mercosur countries, namely Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to launch talks soon in a bid to get its
own trade pacts with the four countries.

<HEADLINE> HKSDB Supports HK's Participation in National Games: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Sports
Development Board (HKSDB) supports local associations in their
efforts to form a Hong Kong delegation to participate in this
year's Chinese National Games, a high-ranking HKSDB official said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China's Eighth National Games are slated for October this year
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Ip Hay Wood, HKSDB's Director of Sports Development, made these
comments when attending a public event here today.
</P>
<P>
"HKSDB has always supported Hong Kong associations in competing
in high-level international events. But participating in the
National Games is after all a matter of internal affairs for us
Hong Kong people," Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive sports games have their own standards for
participation, she said. But the organizers of the National Games
offered preferential conditions to Hong Kong athletes so that they
can skip the qualifying tournaments for most of the individual
sports.
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't we utilize such a good chance for competing in
high-level sporting games?" Ip asked.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has long been a regular participating team for the
Commonwealth Games, which has not affected in any means Hong
Kong's independent sports status," she continued. "Why should it
occur now?" Ip asked.
</P>
<P>
"We should not get the sporting matters too politicized and
HKSDB shall fully support Hong Kong associations if they make the
choice to go to the Shanghai Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out and we had to act," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
"A solution is surely to be found in the near future, I
believe, for Hong Kong to compete in the National Games," Ip
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Apple to Sell Division to Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems are talking about the possible sale of Apple's Newton
division to Sun, according to a report of the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
Apple, in a bid to cut costs, is exploring numerous options for
Newton and has talked with others, including Inventec, a company
from Taiwan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Apple spurned Sun's bid to buy Apple. Last week,
rumors spread that Sun and Apple were again sitting together for
merger talks. But the talks appear centered on Newton and Java, a
Sun programming language.
</P>
<P>
Newton is the operating system for Apple's hand-held 1,000 U.S.
dollar MessagePad computer and its 700 U.S. dollar eMate portable
for kids.
</P>
<P>
The new eMate and MessangePad are selling well, but the Newton
division has yet to make money. Its research and development costs
may be too much. Apple has lost 936 million U.S. dollars over the
past five quarters.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Invests More on Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corp., the third
largest automaker of the U.S., is planning to place 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars to expand its Detroit factories in the next five
years, mostly to build more trucks.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today said that with the move, Chrysler is adding to
the auto industry's multibillion-dollar bet that the truck boom
will last.
</P>
<P>
The swing to trucks also is a bet on cheap gas. Trucks, on
average, get 25 percent worse mileage than cars. Big pickups and
sport utilities can get just 12 to 14 miles per gallon in town, 18
on highway.
</P>
<P>
Pickups, vans and sport-utility vehicles -- collectively
considered light trucks -- account for 43 percent of industry
sales in USA and are expected to grow to more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trucks are 65 percent of Chrysler sales, 57 percent at Ford
Motor and just 43 percent at General Motors, which has been slower
to convert factories to make trucks, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Ford added factory capacity to build at least 1 million more
trucks a year, mainly by converting car factories into truck
factories, since 1991.
</P>
<P>
General Motors added about 25 percent to truck-manufacturing
capacity, about half a million vehicles a year, by converting car
plants add adding shifts and workers at truck plants since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Toyota is building a plant at Evansville, Indiana, to make
100,000 pickups a year, beginning late 1998.

scheme in Harare, where 230 stands have already been sold and
houses were being built under a turnkey package.

ATHENS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Greek capital of
Athens arrested a taxi driver today for his allegedly involvement
in a series of murders and attempted murders over the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) today,
Dimitris Vakrinos, 35, has admitted to killing his 53-year-old

His other victims included Anastasia Simitzi, a 26-year-old

</P>
<P>
Vakrinos is also reportedly to be responsible for four cases of
attempted murders and five armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
The police here believe that Vakrinos committed the murders
because he had an acute inferiority complex and psychological

<HEADLINE> France Urges Zairians to Allow Transition for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- France today urged "all the Zairian
parties to respect their commitments" in order to allow the
country have an "orderly transition to be reached by consensus"
toward national reconciliation and elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether France supports Zairian President Mobutu Sese
Seko, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said, "The
word belongs to the Zairian people who should be asked to
democratically express, through the electoral way, about this
process of transition."
</P>
<P>
"It is not for us, in the exterior, to talk about this issue,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Zaire's new prime minister, General Likulia Bolongo, has ruled
out the possibility that Mobutu would step down from power before
the legislative elections theoretically scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that Bolongo is facing the
big challenge of how to organize the elections, as more than one
third of the territory of Zaire has been taken by the rebels of
Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We invite firmly all the Zairian leaders to look for,
together, a way to go pacifically out of the present political
crisis and consecrate their efforts to the re-adjustment of the
country," said the French Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He again expressed France's support for the peace mission being
launched by the United Nations special envoy for the Great Lakes
region, Mohammed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
"There is the word `elections,' which is to say that the word
should belong to the electors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the two conflicting sides of Zaire had agreed
in Pretoria to prepare for "a fundamental and democratic change in
the country" and "free and transparent elections to be observed by
the international community."

<HEADLINE> British Voters Still in Changeable Position: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- As Britain's general election
campaign is getting into depth, opinion polls show that the mood
of the voter is still volatile.
</P>
<P>
With three weeks to go to the polling day, the latest Gallup
poll showed the opposition Labor Party 23 percentage points ahead,
only 5 less than when the campaign began last month.
</P>
<P>
But a Mori poll showed Labor's lead cut sharply to 15
percentage points -- down 12 in the past week. It put Labor on 49
percent, the Tories on 34 and the Liberal Democrats on 12.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Labor is still in a much stronger position with a
bigger lead than during any recent general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
There is no precedent for the Tories to reverse the huge gap
that still exists between them and Labor before the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Prime Minister John Major and opposition Leader Tony
Blair both sought to focus on the issue of trust and steer
attention away from Neil Hamilton, the former minister at the
center of the "cash for question" allegations.
</P>
<P>
Tories claimed there was "open warfare" between Blair and his
deputy, John Prescott, over privatization. Labor accused the prime
minister of breaking his promises to cut tax.
</P>
<P>
Both parties accused each other of "lying" as the campaign is
getting into depth.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization was not mentioned in their manifesto. It's now
something Blair has believed in since he was in nappies, it
seems," said Major.
</P>
<P>
Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, accused the Labor
leadership of "lying" to try to cover up its U-turn over its
readiness to privatize the National Air Traffic Service.
</P>
<P>
Labor seized on a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies
which concluded that the real tax burden for the average household
had risen by 7 pounds (11.2 US dollars) a week since the last
election.
</P>
<P>
Blair claimed the Tories wanted people to forget what they had
said before the last election. He accused Major of breaking 92
promises and imposing 22 new taxes, and "failing to give the
country leadership."

<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Power Division of the UK-based
Clyde Pneumatic Conveying has secured two prestigious ash handling
contracts from China, according to a press release issued here
today.
</P>
<P>
The contracts have been placed independently by CETIC for
Qujing Thermal Power Plant and by the Shanxi Electric Power
Corporation for Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant and each covers the
supply of ash handling systems for two 350MW boilers.
</P>
<P>
The CETIC contract will employ a series of Clyde "Ash Vessels"
and "Denseveyors" to convey 53 tph of precipitator fly and air
heater ash, first to an intermediate silo, and then to a main
storage silo -- a total distance of 725 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Shanxi Electric contract, a series of Ash
Vessels will be used to convey 51 tph of economizer and
precipitator fly ash 334m to a main ash storage silo.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were received within three months of each other
and demonstrate the increasing strength of Clyde Blowers in China
since the company opened its first joint venture factory in
Shanghai last year.
</P>
<P>
An official from Clyde said the reasons given for awarding the
contract to Clyde included "competitive prices and the technical
superiority of the product over competitive systems."

<HEADLINE> Bonn Expels Iranian Diplomats, Recalls Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Bonn said this afternoon that it was
expelling four Iranian diplomats and recalling its ambassador to
Iran in response to a Berlin court verdict that Iranian leaders
ordered the 1992 Berlin killing of four Kurdish leaders.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was
recalling its ambassador Horst Baechmann to Teheran and in the
foreseeable future would suspend its "critical dialogue" with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Four of a total of 63 people with diplomatic status at the
Iranian embassy in Bonn would be expelled, according to the
statement, which did not release the names.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the involvement of Iranian leaders in
the 1992 shooting of Kurdish leaders in Berlin as "a flagrant
breach of international law," which was unacceptable in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
In Teheran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said it had recalled
its ambassador to Germany Hussein Mussavian for certain
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Germany has since 1992 been a key supporter of the European
Union's policy of "critical dialogue" with Iran. The EU policy of
trade and talks with Iran has drawn bitter criticism from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Judge Frithjof Kubsch said in a Berlin court
verdict on the killing of Sadegh Charafkandi, chief of the banned
Democratic Kurdish Party in Iran, and his three aides in a Berlin
restaurant in 1992, that Iranian leaders ordered the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
The trial at Berlin's Kammergericht, the city-state's highest
criminal and civil court, has been held under intense security for
more than three years and found four of the five defendants
guilty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Teheran pledged no extremist group revenges and
the safety of Germans in Iran. According to Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, Iran is still interested in keeping good relations
with Germany, which is currently Iran's single most important
trade partner.
</P>
<P>
"A verdict, however, based upon evidence by an enemy of the
Islamic republic can by no means be regarded as a purely
judicatory matter," he told the German press agency DPA Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Velayati referred to former Iranian President Abol Hassan Bani
Sadr, who gave the evidence that linked Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to
the Berlin assassination.

<P>
ANKARA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to dispatch
troops to Albania next month to join an international
peace-keeping force there, a high-ranking Turkish official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen made the
remarks after meeting with visiting Albanian Deputy Foreign
Minister Albert Rakibi, who arrived in Ankara Wednesday for a
three-day working visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Turkish soldiers could be included in the
international peace-keeping force that will be deployed in
Albania, adding that the Turkish government is waiting for the
ratification of the troop dispatch by the Turkish parliament.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will also send humanitarian aid to Albania after
security of transportation to the country is achieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Oymen expressed his hope that Albania would overcome its
difficulties within the framework of democracy and free market
economy. He also said that other countries should not intervene
with Albania's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rakibi expressed his thanks to the Turkish
government and people for extending political and economic
support to Albania, which has continued for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed a message from Albanian Head of State Sali Berisha
to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and will hand over an

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: No Peace Talks Without Halting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa today stressed that halting the construction of new
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem was a pre-condition for any
attempt to salvage and restart the peace talks in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after talks with Kuwaiti acting Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
during a short visit here.
</P>
<P>
He termed halting the settlement construction as a basic point
in the current consultations and coordination at the Arab level.
</P>
<P>
"This point is the crux of internationally acclaimed
understanding that Israel has no right to build any settlements at
all in the Arab East Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has given green light
for Israeli bulldozers to start building the controversial
settlement on March 28 which triggered a flurry of international
criticism and spates of violence in the West Bank and Gaza,
bringing severe negative effects to the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hosted a meeting of foreign ministers of the 22-member
Arab League on March 30 at which a resolution was adopted to
reactivate the Arab economic boycott of Israel and stop the
normalization process with the Jewish state in response to the
start of construction of 6,500 new Jewish homes in
Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described this Arab position as "balanced, steadfast and
moderate because we want to salvage the peace process from
collapse as a result of Israeli policies."
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that his talks with Kuwaiti officials deepened the
understanding between Kuwait and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait expressed utmost concern and dissatisfaction over the
peace process developments and accused Israeli move of
threatening the peace process and intensifying tension in the
region, calling for a decisive Islamic action against Israel's
"destructive" policy in the Arab territories last month.
</P>
<P>
Moussa arrived in Kuwait earlier today on a short visit
to the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival he told reporters that Egypt was strongly
opposed to an unbalanced peace in the Middle East only benefiting
Israel, saying that Egypt intended to help "achieve a just and
comprehensive peace" in the region.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy: Progress Achieved in Cyprus Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Resident Representative
Gustave Feissel said today that progress has been made
in the proximity talks on both the substance of the Cyprus
problem and the mutual good-will gestures aimed at fostering a
positive climate for direct negotiations between the two Cypriot
communities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival at Larnaca Airport from Geneva,
where he attended a meeting Wednesday between U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, the U.N. envoy said that "we have moved toward certain
things where the two sides are close and where it ought to
be possible to achieve a common understanding, including these
good will gestures that we have been working on."
</P>
<P>
Feissel, however, pointed out that although progress has been
made during his separate meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Denktash, the two sides have not yet reached
total agreement on both the substance and the good-will
gestures.
</P>
<P>
For the past three weeks, the U.N. envoy has held six separate
meetings with President Clerides and Denktash in a bid to
prepare the ground for face-to-face negotiations, and to get the
two sides to unilaterally adopt good-will gestures.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've had some good talks. We are close to doing
certain things, modest things. But until we do it there's
nothing," Feissel said, adding that once agreement is reached on
the good-will gestures, they will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the meeting in Geneva, Feissel said that
U.N. Chief Kofi Annan underlined to Denktash the need to move
forward to work toward an overall settlement of the Cyprus
problem. He also expressed both his personal interest in the
Cyprus problem and the great importance he attaches to it, the
U.N. envoy added.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting with the secretary general was important. He
underlined the significance of the moment and that nobody can
afford to see this effort and the direct negotiations, that
(which) will begin by mid year, fail. I think this was a very
clear message and I think that will be helpful," Feissel noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said Annan is keen on getting Denktash and
President Clerides to face-to-face talks by the middle of this
year. The U.N. chief is following the Cyprus problem "very
closely" and he will be present at the direct negotiations,
Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held
on and off for the past 23 years, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have not met since October 1994 when
the two men held two round of informal talks in Nicosia
under the U.N. auspices.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Lesotho Hold Talks Over Mutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government is
holding talks with South Africa to have two Lesotho policemen
currently in the country returned home to face trial in
connection with a recent police mutiny, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcasted in Maseru by Radio Lesotho, the
Lesotho government is trying through legal channels to have the
two policemen, who fled to South Africa after the crack-down of
the mutiny, returned home.
</P>
<P>
Positive talks are being held by the two governments over the
matter, the statement claimed.
</P>
<P>
The police mutiny started in February this year when a group
of Lesotho policemen came out in support of Lieutenant Phakiso
Molise and other seven junior police officers who took over
police headquarters in Maseru and refused to be arrested on
charges of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Molise, alleged to be the leader of the police mutiny, and his
fellow policemen Sergeant Motlatsi Makapeng, fled from his hiding
out in the Maseru Palace of King Letsie III shortly after the
military crack-down and holed up later in Pretoria for political
asylum, which rejected by the South African government.

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes Militarization of Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian said here today that the United Nations peacekeeping
operation is merely a supplementary means to political settlement
and can in no way replace it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations,
the Chinese deputy permanent representative to the UN noted that
there is a growing trend of authorizing member states to dispatch
multinational forces by the UN or sending troops by regional
military organizations.
</P>
<P>
"UN peacekeeping operations are, to a certain extent, moving
towards militarization. It is therefore necessary to carefully
study and summarize the pros and cons as well as the experience
and lessons in these practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
The success of peacekeeping operations, in the final analysis,
depends on the political will of all conflicting parties, Wang
said. "Those who participate in peacekeeping operations should be
peacekeepers rather than warriors," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As some important peacekeeping functions are being contracted
or sub-contracted to a small number of countries when the UN is
short of money, there is a trend of establishing some important
bodies in a way that deviates from the course of the UN and turns
it into a patent right for a small number of countries. "We are
deeply disturbed by these developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
On shortage of peacekeeping funds, he noted that member states
owed the UN 1.7 billion dollars in back dues for peacekeeping
alone at the end of 1996, with US arrears amounting to more than
half of the total.
</P>
<P>
Wang called on the major contributors to pay up their arrears
without further delay and pay their assessed contributions in full
and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed development as a means to remove deeply rooted
causes of conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Berlin Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
rejected the ruling of the Berlin court that charged Iranian
leaders behind the assassination of Kurdish opposition leaders
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iran has also recalled its ambassador to Germany Hussein
Musavian for "some consultations". The move indicates that the
relations between Bonn and Tehran are in trouble and might
downgrade further.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Ambassador to Tehran Horst Beshmann was
summoned by Iranian Foreign Ministry on Thursday to give
explanations about the allegations made by German Judge Frithjof
Kubsch implicating Iran in assassination of four Kurdish
opposition leaders at Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has ordered the expulsion of four German
diplomats from German Embassy in Tehran. However, the official
news agency IRNA did not give their identifications.
</P>
<P>
In the first official response to the verdict earlier today by
the Berlin court, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
termed the statement of a German judge against Iran as "biased"
and "unfounded".
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the statements made by a German district
court judge against Iran were unfounded and influenced by
political propaganda campaign launched against the Islamic
Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are awaiting a detailed and official account of the
court procedures in order to scrutinize the issue," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that the statements of the Berlin court
judge have been made in an unjust and biased manner based
on the false claims of counterrevolutionary elements and hostile
political propaganda of the Zionists", Mohammadi reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge of the Berlin district court accused
the political leadership of Iran of ordering the assassination
of four exiled Kurdish opposition leaders in Mykonos restaurant
in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court gave life imprisonment to one Iranian
national and a Lebanese and sentenced two other Lebanese to
long prison terms on charges of assassinating the four Kurdish
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court also found that the 1992 murder of the
Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin was ordered by the
"highest state levels" in Iran.
</P>
<P>
As a retaliation, the Iranian judiciary intends to bring 24
German companies to court after over 1,000 complaints were
delivered to the Iranian judiciary by relatives of toxic gas
victims.
</P>
<P>
The victims demand compensation and trial against these firms
as well as relevant German government officials who issued the
permit to export chemical weapons to Iraq during the war with
Iran from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
As a pre-caution measure for possible extremist violence upon
the announcement of the verdict on the Mykonos case, the
first group of German engineers from Siemens Company has been
called back this week from a power project in Iranian northern
province of Rasht, 325 kilometers north of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security measures have been reportedly intensified
around the German Embassy in Tehran on Thursday following the
announcement of the verdict of a Berlin court regarding the
Mykonos case.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Wages Attack on Berlin Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian press today swiftly
waged a harsh attack on the Berlin court over the ruling on the
Mykonos case, charging that Hitler's soul was ruling the court.
</P>
<P>
Persian evening paper Kayhan said that "Hitler's soul rules
today over the Berlin court and is supervising the performance
of the German judiciary and its agents."
</P>
<P>
This is the first response from Tehran after the announcement
of the verdict by the Berlin court earlier today.
</P>
<P>
With eight hours passed since the Berlin court ruled that
Iranian leaders ordered the assassination of Kurdish opposition
leaders in Berlin in 1992, the Tehran government headed by
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani had not officially reacted to
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
The state-run TV and radio have not yet reported the
verdict. The official news agency IRNA carried a very brief story
about the verdict from Bonn.
</P>
<P>
But, IRNA did not carry the part in which the Iranian
leaders were mentioned by the court of having ordered the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court Thursday found four of five defendants
guilty in the Mykonos trial. The Iranian national, Kazem Darabi,
38, and Abbas Rhayel, 29, from Lebanon, have both been given
life sentences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court has given an 11-year jail sentence to
Youssef Amin, 29, of Lebanon, for "being accessories to the
killing of four Kurdish dissidents" in a Berlin restaurant in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The third Lebanese, Mohamed Atris, 27, has received a sentence
of five years and three months.
</P>
<P>
The fifth defendant, Atallah Ayad, 30, also from Lebanon,
has been acquitted.
</P>
<P>
In a word, the five defendants were tried on charges of killing
three Iranian Kurdish opposition leaders and their interpreter in
Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court also said that it had found that the 1992
murder of the Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin was ordered by
the "highest state levels" in Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the court did not point the figure specifically to
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Rafsanjani, a
refrained move indicating that Germany is unwilling to jeopardize
its relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the relations between Bonn and
Tehran are facing great danger and subject to downgrading of
the bilateral relations from the ambassador level to charge
d'affaires level.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have been extremely nervous about the
Mykonos case verdict in the German court and claimed Wednesday
that Iran held a "wait-to-see" attitude pertaining to the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati attacked the German
court for using the testimony of some "questionable characters"
such as former President Abulhassan Banisadr.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister stressed that relations between
countries, including those of Iran and Germany, are based on
mutual respect and mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
"We expect Germany to observe that," he added.

on the Arab side, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria and other parties of
Latin American and African countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Many Rwandan refugees who
were repatriated to their country of origin in January this year
have been re-entering Tanzania through border posts.
</P>
<P>
Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC), Juma Ng'wana Ng'waka
told newsmen at Bukoba in northwestern Tanzania today that the
refugees who crossed into Tanzania, either hide in the bush or
are hidden by the residents who hire them as cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
The RPC pointed out that the refugees are posing a security
risk as some of them are said to be carrying fire arms.
</P>
<P>
"From January to early this month, the police have arrested a
total of 645 Rwandans, out of whom 300 were hiding at Lukole
Refugee Camp while 345 were hiding in the bush," he said.
</P>
<P>
The regional police chief raised concern that the Rwandan
refugees who are secretly returning into Tanzania are posing a
security risk to the nation because most of the former refugee
camps were closed down.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the public to expose the aliens and report any
suspects to the police.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM Defends Blueprint for Next Century (I) (by Hou Jia) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Critics dismissed the government's
ambitious blueprint on a better life for all Egyptians over the
next 20 years as mere dreams, but Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri
said the dream will come true.
</P>
<P>
Controversy is rife as the government document came out this
week detailing plans to speed up the Egyptian economy, which in
recent years has taken drastic steps toward a market economy so as
to achieve an annual growth of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said any mammoth project in Egypt
will inevitably meet various challenges and insisted the landmark
socio-economic plan was based on scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
Four plans, each covering five years, are primarily based on a
development program in the Nile Valley and establishing new
agricultural and industrial communities in the Western Desert and
the Sinai Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The targets also include quadrupling the inhabited area of the
country from 4 percent to 25 percent, thus accelerating the
economic growth from 4.8 percent to 7.6 percent, raising the gross
national product (GNP) from 257 billion Egyptian pounds to 1,100
billion (75.6 billion dollars to 325.3 billion) in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Under the ambitious plan, the per capita GNP will rise from
4,270 Egyptian pounds to 13,750 pounds (1,256 dollars to 4,044
dollars) in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
About 550,000 new jobs will be created every year, the annual
inflation rate will be brought down to 5 percent and the present
deficit in the trade turned into a surplus.
</P>
<P>
Achieving the goals will require 100 billion pounds (about 34
billion dollars) in annual investments over the next 20 years,
said the document.
</P>
<P>
Such an astronomical figure has raised eyebrows, with critics
citing the backwardness of the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
As much as 30 percent of the 63 million Egyptians is living in
poverty, while the population is growing by about one million
every 10 months and more than 20 percent of the work force is
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Financing the projects will be a major challenge, Ganzouri
admitted. But he also said that they are based on scientific
studies.

<HEADLINE> China's Vice Premier Calls for Improved Building Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said on a
national tele-conference thursday management of the country's
construction business should be enhanced to halt inferior building
quality.
</P>
<P>
Li said that related departments should increase cooperation
and supervision in the building industry. He said that some
progress has been made since a nationwide crackdown on
irregularities in the construction business was done by the
Construction Ministry last April.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 11 provinces and municipalities show that
12,000 cases involving irregularities in the building industry
were brought to light, resulting in 810 million yuan worth of
delinquent taxes being paid and over 25 million yuan in fines
imposed.
</P>
<P>
In engineering projects, Zou noted, the economic growth mode
should be changed from extensive to intensive, and an effort
should be made to adjust the investment structure and to avoid
duplicate construction projects.
</P>
<P>
He urged various departments to take steps to establish a
standardized administration system for bidding, project reports,
engineering, and quality control.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Reaches Compromise on Tax Exemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives has reached a compromise on income tax exemption
for individuals, according to official TV reports today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the compromise was reached after House Speaker
Jose de Venecia presided over a closed-door caucus of congressmen
last night in an effort to hammer out a final stand on individual
and corporate income tax measures.
</P>
<P>
The congressmen have agreed to lower the 184,000-peso (7,000
U.S. dollars) tax relief they proposed earlier to 140,000 pesos
(5,300 U.S. dollars), the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, an annual tax relief of 120,000 pesos
(4,580 U.S. dollars) would be granted to the two parents of a
family of six, and an additional 5,000 pesos (190 U.S. dollars)
would be exempted for each of the four dependents.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the new compromise would raise an
additional revenue of six billion pesos (230 million U.S. dollars)
for the government, which has complained that it will lose 37
billion pesos (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) a year if the congress'
previous tax scheme is approved.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has not been able to approve the income tax
reform measures, the last phase of the Comprehensive Tax Reform
Package, due to differences between Congress and the Department of
Finance on how much is the best tax relief both for the Filipino
laborers and to the government.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, which was satisfied with the
fast economic growth of the Philippines, had said it would allow
the country to graduate from the organization if it could finish
the last phase of its tax reform by June.

<HEADLINE> DPRK: Sincere Efforts Made on Korean De-nuclearization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has "made sincere efforts for
peace and de-nuclearization on the Korean Peninsula," a foreign
ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The de-nuclearization has not yet been achieved and the old
legacy of the cold war still remains, though. This is entirely due
to the anachronistic United States -- Korea policy," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the treaty for the creation of a
nuclear-free zone in Southeast Asia, which has recently taken
effect.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the official Korean Central News Agency that
the prospects for de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
depended on the attitude and stand of the U.S. as one of nuclear
states.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The United States is shipping huge amounts of
combat equipment into South Korea to continuously provide the
South Korean authorities with a nuclear umbrella."
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the coming into effect of the treaty for the
Southeast Asia nuclear-free zone, the spokesman said nuclear
states should immediately approve all the principles of the treaty
and commit themselves to providing security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear states should secure a practical guarantee for
the feasibility of a nuclear-free zone and join in the worldwide
trend of de-nuclearization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asia nuclear-free zone treaty stipulated that
signatories were obliged to ban the development, production,
stockpiling, keeping, introduction and use of nuclear arms in this
region.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed by ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) member states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- at the Bangkok
Summit in December 1995. Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar also signed
it.

<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank, the
People's Bank of China, has issued rules on open market operations
to standardize treasury bond transactions for healthier
development of the business, the central bank's office for open
market operations said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the rules are an important move in open market
operations, which began with treasury bonds on a trial basis last
year. The central bank uses them for financial leverage to
regulate the supply of base money. It will expand the practice to
policy-oriented financial bonds and central bank bonds, the office
said.
</P>
<P>
The rules also define transaction principles and criteria and
make clear the rights and obligations of primary dealers.
</P>
<P>
Qualified securities companies and firms engaged in the trust
and investment business can become primary dealers after getting
official approval, the rules say.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has already approved 15 commercial banks and
ten urban cooperative banks as the first primary dealers in open
market operations. The namelist will be made public in the near
future, the office said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide Aid for Romanian Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union supports
Romania's economic reform plan and will provide the country with
70 million ECUs (80 million U.S. dollars) of aid between 1997 and
1999, Jacques Santer, President of EU Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who is on a two-day visit to Romania, said
negotiations on Romania's entry into the EU, will start after an
EU meeting on July 16-17 in the Dutch city of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Romania was aimed at helping the country
prepare for its entry into the EU. But when it would be admitted
to the 15-member western alliance would depend on the achievements
of Romania's economic reform and the development of the
preparation work.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Romania on Thursday and Friday, Santer met
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said entry into the EU was Romania's strategic
objective, but it should not hurry because the EU was an
organization with intense economic competition.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the EU could increase its investment in Romania. So
far, the investment from the EU member states in Romania accounted
for 52 percent of the total inflow of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Romania officially applied for the membership of the EU on June
22, 1995. Media here predicts that Romania will be allowed into
the EU around the year 2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining world peace and
promoting economic growth is still the major task facing the
international community, a senior Chinese official told
Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jue, vice leader of Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC) delegation, made the remarks at a keynote speech at today's
general debate.
</P>
<P>
"World development is uneven. Despite the sustained growth of
the world economy, the gap between the rich and poor countries
keeps widening," said Zhou Jue, who is also chairman of the NPC's
Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It is the common aspiration of the world people to establish a
just and equitable new international political and economic order
of peace and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cold War mentality making the world today far
from tranquil, Zhou Jue said interference in other countries'
internal affairs under various pretexts, and indulgence in
sanctions-wielding, were threatening and undermining world peace
and stability.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration Widely Praised in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration on the Question of Macao, which was signed in 1987, is
widely praised in Macao on the eve of the 10th anniversary of its
signing.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen and celebrities who witnessed the signing of
the historical document called the declaration "a model in
handling disputes left over from the past" and "a guarantee for
Macao's stability and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"The declaration ensures China's resumption of sovereignty over
Macao through peaceful consultations and in the meantime takes the
interests of local citizens into consideration," said Ma Man Kei,
chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce. "That success should be
attributed to Deng Xiaoping's idea of 'one country, two systems.'"
</P>
<P>
The 10th anniversary of the signing of the joint declaration
will fall on this coming Sunday. Under the joint declaration,
Macao's capitalist system and basic life style will remain
unchanged for 50 years after the handover on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The principles set in the declaration have won a wide-range
support from the Chinese people, including those living in Macao,
and strengthened foreign investors' confidence in Macao, Ma told
Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
China has kept friendly relations with Portugal over the past
decade. Leaders of the two countries exchanged visits frequently.
Earlier this month, a senior Chinese official stationed here said
the declaration was a "further boost to the friendship."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Macao's political environment has been
stable and its overall economy has grown steadily, observers said,
adding that although minor problems did occur, the transition in
Macao has gone basically smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ng Fok, a well-known indigenous entrepreneur, who is
also a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
said that the joint declaration brought unprecedented
opportunities to Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Under the principle of 'one country, two systems' in solving
the issue of Macao, the local people will continuously get the
chance to create prosperity in Macao," said Ng.
</P>
<P>
The businessman is a major investor of the Macao International
Airport, which went into operation in November 1995 under joint
efforts of both China and Portugal. He said he had benefited a lot
from the friendly relations between China and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"Under the joint declaration and the Macao Basic Law, current
laws will remain basically unchanged, and Macao will continue to
be a free port, where capital can flow freely and foreign
currencies can be converted freely," said Ng. "That will legally
protect the interests of all sides and businessmen."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he would seek more chances to further expand
his business in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"I think it means an unprecedented historical opportunity," the
businessman said. "We can't just sit and wait for the transfer of
power in 1999. Instead we should help contribute to an economic
prosperity to prepare for the coming into being of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR)."
</P>
<P>
Another local celebrity, Chui Tak Kei, who witnessed the
signing of the declaration at the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing, also urged a better preparation for setting up the Macao
SAR.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hopes that China and Portugal will continue their
friendly cooperation in Macao in the remaining 900-plus days
before the handover," said Chui, president of the Macao Basic Law
Promotion Association. "The transitional affairs should be
completed as early as possible so that Macao will remain
prosperous and stable after 1999."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Calls For Coal Mine Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xianzheng, vice-minister of
China's coal industry, speaking at a national telephone conference
on safety in coal mines today, urged mines nationwide to improve
safety standards in the pits to put a stop to the growing number
of casualties, and to slow the growth in coal output as well.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that there were 203 more deaths in the first quarter
of this year than the corresponding 1996 period, while the number
of deaths in coal mines run by townships has increased by 48.
</P>
<P>
"Township-run coal mines are a major source of tragedies, where
coal miners operate improperly, and cause gas explosions in the
pits," he said, noting that "most of the casualties were the
result of gas explosions, and it is quite a challenge to stop
this."
</P>
<P>
He called for more restrictions to improve supervision of the
pits to ensure the safety of miners.
</P>
<P>
He said that China produced 279 million tons of coal in the
first quarter of the year, up 9.5 million tons, or 3.53 percent,
from the same period of last year. The growth rate was down 6.12
percentage points compared with the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China's total coal output this year will remain
the same as for 1996, and steps will be taken to cut the coal
surplus.

<HEADLINE> Iran Satisfied with Russian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said here today that he was
satisfied with the Iranian-Russian relations, but worried about
matters around the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-Russian relations were based "on a stable foundation,
long-term prospects and invariable interests," the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the drastic changes in Russia, Nateq-Nouri hoped
Russia would take part in programs for Iran's economic revival and
development.
</P>
<P>
At a plenary session of the Russian State Duma (lower house of
parliament), the Iranian speaker called the Caspian Sea "the core
of Russian-Iranian cooperation". He noted that the biosphere of
the Caspian may be irretrievably damaged, in particular by the
injurious squandering of its natural resources by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri said it is necessary to fix the status for the
Caspian Sea, whose natural resources should not only be used, but
also preserved by the Caspian countries.
</P>
<P>
He asked for more frequent Iranian-Russian talks and
consultations in the settlement of the Middle East problems.

<HEADLINE> Senior World Bank Official Praises China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Michel Severino, the World
Bank's Vice President of East Asia and the Pacific region, said
today that he is deeply impressed by China's rapid economic
progress and is satisfied with its use of the World Bank resources.
</P>
<P>
It has kept inflation to well below 10 percent while
maintaining a high economic growth rate and building up foreign
exchange reserves, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China's strong macro-economic situation and its
successful 'soft landing' were the result of the significant
improvements that have been made in recent years in macroeconomic
policies and management," he said.
</P>
<P>
Severino met recently with Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji and
other officials and inspected World Bank-supported projects in
Shanghai and east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
After these visits he said that the macro-economic policies of
the Chinese government in the recent years were correct and
effective and that the cooperation with the World Bank has been
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China will remain the Bank's largest
borrower in the coming years, and that annual lending to China
will remain about three billion US dollars. It will be used for up
to 15 projects each year, with priority given to agriculture,
rural development, infrastructure, human resource development,
poverty alleviation and environmental improvement.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the World Bank has supported 176
development and technical assistance projects in most economic
sectors and in almost all parts of China for a total of more than
26 billion US dollars, according to Bank statistics. China has
been the Bank's largest borrower since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Severino said that the Bank will reinforce its resident mission
here to offer more, better, faster and cheaper services in this
very important country.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China make good use of the current stable
situation to increase economic reforms, particularly in the areas
of the State-owned enterprises, finances, and social security.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident in China's ability to maintain macro-economic
stability and rapid economic growth," Severino concluded.

<HEADLINE> China's Finance Minister Calls for Greater Check on Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China should improve its audits
of urban collective enterprises because it is important to the
national economy, Liu Zhongli, the country's finance minister,
told a national meeting today.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to ascertain value of assets and capital stock of the
collective sector is an important way to get a thorough
understanding of it, and an indispensable link in reforming and
developing the sector," he said, explaining that it can provide an
effective solution to low efficiency and irrational distribution
of collective resources.
</P>
<P>
The check-up is for all collective enterprises and units
registered with the industrial and commercial administration
departments over the next three or four years.
</P>
<P>
It started in 226 cities and prefectures last year, in 13,000
urban collective enterprises. This year it will be expanded to
some 50,000 enterprises in all areas and sectors.
</P>
<P>
China had 495,000 urban collective enterprises at the end of
1996, including 210,000 commercial and trade businesses and
146,000 industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
Figures of total output and workforce of the urban collective
industry were about a quarter of those for urban industry in 1995
as a whole, making it the second largest economic force after the
state-owned sector.

<P>
Environmental protection should be backed by the public, Xie
said, and people's environmental awareness needs to be improved,
so the program is a good beginning.

<P>
TIRANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of Italian
soldiers arrived in Albania today to spearhead a multinational
protection force that aims to secure the country's key harbors and
airports.
</P>
<P>
The 20-strong vanguard is charged with preparing the ground for
the arrival of the 6,000-strong force from six nations that is due
to start arriving on Monday. The vanguard reached the port of
Durres after sailing across the Adriatic from the Italian port of
Brindisi on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by another group of 20 Italian paratroopers who
landed at Tirana airport half an hour later.
</P>
<P>
The advance unit is made up of engineers and marines, most of
whom had carried out missions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Italian-led multinational force was formed with soldiers
from Italy, France, Spain, Romania, Turkey and Greece after the
United Nations Security Council decided on its creation, on March
28. This is the first time Italy has led a multinational mission
since World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the protection force will be Italian soldiers, some
2,000-3,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The force's main task is to secure ports and airports, and
protect delivery of relief aid to the population of the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The collapse in January of bogus investment schemes, in which
thousands of Albanians put their life savings, sparked protests
across the country which quickly spilled over into armed
insurrection in March.
</P>
<P>
The country has since been gripped by unrest and anarchy.
Protesters demanded repayment of their hard-earned money and the
opposition Socialist Party launched an outcry for the resignation
of President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, Bashkim Fino, an economist from the Socialist
Party, was invited by the president to form a new government
which, in the following weeks, took effective measures to placate
nationwide unrest. It sought help from the European Union and the
Organization of Security and Cooperation for Europe.

<HEADLINE> GM To Set Up Joint Automobile Engine Venture in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior executive from the US's
General Motors Corporation today said that Opel AG, the company's
European subsidiary, is looking for a chance to start a joint
venture in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Gangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Louis R. Hughes, president of GM's International Operations,
told the press today that the proposed project, probably in the
Guangzhou Science and Technology Development Zone, is to
manufacture automobile engines for export.
</P>
<P>
Local government has agreed in principle to establish the
venture and has asked GM to provide a comprehensive report,
according to Hughes. And the report has also been submitted to
relevant departments in Beijing for review.
</P>
<P>
To support the project and coordinate GM activities in south
China, Opel set up an office in Guangzhou last year. According to
Hughes, Guangdong's prosperity has created conditions for the
purchase of private automobiles, and the Opel brand is recognized
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last month GM co-invested 1.57 billion US dollars with Shanghai
Automotive Industry Corporation to produce mid-luxury sedans in
China.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, Guangdong authorities announced that the
automobile industry was not one of the economic pillars of its
economic development program for the Ninth Five-Year Plan. But, a
provincial auto industry official said that the move should not be
interpreted to mean that Guangdong will not develop its auto
industry. Its intention is to concentrate its limited finances in
large auto groups or to carry out big projects with foreign
partners to adjust the present irrational industrial structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government said it will
take a series of measures to crack down on increasing organized
crimes in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Several security departments and the governor held a
closed-door meeting on Thursday, and decided to mobilize all
possible means to maintain public order and ensure safety of local
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government announced on Thursday night that it will
enhance training for crime-fighters and exercise of discipline
inspection, increase patrols and the police presence in
crime-prone sites, fight against organized crimes, and improve
legislation and coordination among different departments.
</P>
<P>
The government will also step up its fight against illegal
immigrants, and strengthen cooperation with neighboring regions,
especially police departments in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province
across the border, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to maintain social stability and
public order with all possible means," Macao Governor Vasco Rocha
Vieira was quoted as saying. "We will re-establish a safe
environment ruled by law so that citizens will live peacefully and
that social and economic development will be ensured."
</P>
<P>
The governor stressed that the regulations on underground gangs
should be revised as soon as possible and the spread of juvenile
delinquency be curbed effectively.
</P>
<P>
A wave of killing and gang fighting cases have occurred in
Macao since the beginning of April, reportedly most related to the
underworld fighting for interests in casinos. More than a dozen
people, including several policemen, were attacked and some
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he is optimistic that public order and public
security will be ensured with the joint efforts of the
government, police departments and local citizens.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Road to Peace in Angola Tortuous (by Yin Yongjian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Government of
National Unity and Reconciliation is sworn in in the capital of
Luanda today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on April 9, the National Assembly of Angola officially
went into operation with the participation of parliament members
from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The two events marked the conclusion of the peace process and
the start of national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The new born government of national unity and reconciliation
is a multi-party government led by the People's Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) which won the 1992 general elections
and formed by drawing other political parties, mainly the UNITA,
who have seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the coalition government, the UNITA occupies four posts of
ministers and seven posts of deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
The forming of the new government is the success of the peace
process in the past two years and more between the two warring
sides -- UNITA and MPLA who signed a peace agreement in Lusaka,
Zambia in 1994. A ceasefire was realized throughout the country
and peace process officially started immediately after the
signing of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, with the mediation of the United
Nations and the international community and through the hard
effort of the warring sides, big progress has been made for the
release of prisoners of war, the concentration of the armed
forces, disarmament, disolution and reassignment of armymen. With
nine generals from UNITA being posted in the unified army of the
state as the hallmark, decisive success has been achieved in the
solution of military issues and the peace process entered the
stage of solving political issues. The joint committee formed by
representatives from the warring sides, the United Nations, the
United States, Russia and Portugal began solving the four major
issues, namely the entry of UNITA parliament members into the
National Assembly, the establishment of state power organs
throughout the country, the formation of the government of
national unity and reconciliation and the special status of UNITA
president Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Of the four issues, the key issue is the status of Savimbi on
which the success or failure of the peace process hinges. After
15 months negotiations, the warring sides finally reached an
agreement on this issue and passed a document confirming Jonas
Savimbi as the leader of the biggest opposition party in Angola
and the document was further adopted by the parliament and
therefore possesses the power of law. The adoption of this
document has paved the way for the entry of UNITA parliament
members into the National Assembly and the official swearing in
of the government of national unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The new government is facing arduous tasks. Huge funds are
needed for the return of 300,000 refugees from neighbouring
countries, the resettlement and rearrangement of the 100,000
surplus soldiers, the removal of the more than 10 million mines
throughout the country and the restoration of production
facilities and other infrastructures damaged by the war.
According to statistics by an United Nations institution
concerned, as much as 228 million U.S. dollars will be required
in 1997 alone for work in these aspects. The major part of the
one billion U.S. dollars promised by contributor countries are
still not in place, thus making it difficult to accomplish the
above work and restore the economy. Therefore, the ultimate peace
and reconstruction of the country calls for the extremely great
effort by the new government.

<HEADLINE> Anti-German Demonstrations Held in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 Iranians today staged
demonstrations in front of the German Embassy here to protest
the Berlin court ruling which charges top Iranian leaders with
involvement in the 1992 murder of four Iranian dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators chanted such slogans as "Down with Fascist
Germany" and burnt the U.S. and Israeli flags in front of the
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations followed a lengthy speech by President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, blaming the U.S. and Israel for influencing
the court verdict.
</P>
<P>
A clergyman among the protesters read a written statement,
urging the government to sever diplomatic relations with
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Amid growing resentment to Germany, the demonstrators even
threatened to bring Germans to trial.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Court ruled Thursday that Iran's spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Rafsanjani had personally
ordered the killing of Kurdish leader Sadiq Sarafkindi
and three of his colleagues in the Mykonos restaurant.
</P>
<P>
But Iran has denied any involvement in the murder.
</P>
<P>
The German Embassy in downtown Tehran is under heavy security
and more than 300 policemen are deployed to maintain order and
guard against possible anti-German riots.
</P>
<P>
The street in front of the German Embassy was cut off during
the two-hour demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
There are about 500 German nationals living and working in
Iran. The first group of 30 German engineers has been called back
to Germany from Rasht, 325 kilometers north of Tehran this week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judiciary intends to bring 24 German companies to
court on charges of delivering chemical weapons to Iraq during its
war with Iran from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani said at today's Friday prayers that
Germany has lost its tremendous economic interests in Iran by
handing down the court verdict.
</P>
<P>
He Accused the U.S. and Israel of trying to avert world
attention from the deadlocked Middle East peace process by
lobbying the "pro-Zionist" Germans at the court to rule against
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Subcontracted Exports Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's major exports of goods
produced under subcontracts are expected to rise about 20 percent
this year compared with last year, the Vietnam Trade Ministry
estimates.
</P>
<P>
Last year, subcontracted manufactured goods generated 1,206
million U.S. dollars in revenue, accounting for 16.6 percent of
the country's total export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Major export products subcontracted by Vietnamese enterprises
in 1996 included garments, which earned 817.5 million dollars, and
shoes and sandals which generated 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing of subcontracted goods has created many jobs
for Vietnamese workers.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the past few years, the garment and leather
industries have employed more than 600,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> HK Hotel Industry Upbeat About Post-1997 Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong hotel industry
leaders are confident that the sector will continue to flourish
well beyond Hong Kong's return to its motherland later this year.
</P>
<P>
At a Horwarth's 8th annual Hotel Investment Conference, James
Lu, executive director of the Hong Kong Hotels Association, said
that there was no question of a room glut.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Hong Kong will have a pool of 116 hotels
offering 44,500 rooms.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of Chinese businessmen will increase
rapidly, offering a new market.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lee, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Hotels Association,
said last year's glowing occupancy rates were largely due to the
1997 promotion.
</P>
<P>
James Lu said he expected an anti-climax to reign after Hong
Kong's return, but after 1998 the tourism boom would continue.

HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong could become an
origination center to the debt market in the Chinese mainland by
taking advantage of its professional skills and experiences, Hong
Kong Standard reported today.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Warns of Explosive Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian council
Ahmed Queria has warned against the continuation of the explosive
situation in Palestine as the local people were losing hope for
peace.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Egyptian radio "Sawt Al Arab" (Voice of
the Arabs) today, he said that unless the peace process is back on
track, there would be a serious explosion which would not only
affect Israel but also the Middle East as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not optimistic about the current visit by a
Palestinian delegation to Washington because no change was
detected in Israel's hardline policy after a meeting between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Natanyahu early this week.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Israeli government still adheres to
its intransigent stance, as demonstrated by the continuing
construction of a Jewish settlement in Jabal Abu Ghoneim in East
Jerusalem, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of settlement building in the disputed holy
city has provoked deep anger from the Arab states and the
international community, and a sense of frustration is widely felt
among the Palestinians and other Arabs with regard to the
achievement of peace.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation headed by Mahmoud Abbas, Secretary
General of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), is
currently in Washington for talks with U.S. officials in a bid to
arrest the crisis confronting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Queria urged the U.S. to undertake its responsibility as
an honest sponsor of the peace process. He pointed out that should
the U.S. role interact with that of Europe, that will strongly
influence the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official called upon the Arab states to adhere
to the strategic option of peace decided by the Cairo Arab summit
last June. However, he warned the Israeli harsh measures would
pose dangers to Arab national security.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Blasts at Berlin Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today blasted at the Berlin court ruling on the
assassination of four Iranian-Kurdish dissidents, terming the
court as "sinister" and "disgraceful."
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president said that Germany "destroyed the
100-year friendship with Iran by handing down the baseless verdict"
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the emotional statement at Friday prayers on
the campus of the Tehran University, where thousands of prayers
listened to his hour-long speech amid loud chants of condemnations
of the German ruling. One slogan says the verdict causes hatred
among Muslims.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Berlin court ruled that the top political
leadership in Iran was behind the assassination of Iranian
Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in
September 1992.
</P>
<P>
The court gave life imprisonment to one Iranian national and
a Lebanese and sentenced two other Lebanese to long prison terms
on charge of killing the four Kurdish dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said "one of the most disgraceful developments for
the Westerners, particularly the Germans, was the timing and the
decision of the final verdict."
</P>
<P>
"The court acted like an advertising agency and such courts
are not uncommon in Europe," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian head of state said "the verdict had been expected
by us a long time ago. Some of their (German) brokers had come
to Iran to bargain over the issue."
</P>
<P>
"The mistake was not only that of a judge but also of the
country and the system," said Rafsanjani, pointing his finger at
the German government.
</P>
<P>
The president believed the verdict was "clearly influenced by
the Zionist and American lobbying."
</P>
<P>
"So finally the German government failed to protect its
interests in Iran," he added, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president revealed that German envoys had
previously voiced their indignation towards the German judge who,
they said, was trying to determine German's foreign policy
towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Was the gathering of the counter-revolutionaries from all of
Europe before the court to stage demonstrations against Iran
also the work of the judge?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
On the traditional ties between the two countries, Rafsanjani
noted, "The Germans know full well how much they stand to lose in
Iran...Our people can not forget this dastardliness of the
Germans."
</P>
<P>
"The announcement of the verdict coincided with the
announcement of the failure of the Arab-Israeli peace process by
the Americans," he added, charging the West with what he called
diverting attention from the deadlocked peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Iran has recalled its ambassadors in Bonn Hussein Musavian for
"consultations."
</P>
<P>
The row has provoked fears that the relations between Bonn
and Tehran would continue to sour to shake the foundations of
Germany's policy of close ties and continued trade with Iran.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Tehran Horst Beshmann was also called
back home after being summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry
Thursday for official explanations.
</P>
<P>
Germany expelled four Iranian diplomats, which triggered off a
tit-for-tat move from Tehran. The Islamic republic has ordered
four German diplomats to leave.
</P>
<P>
The European Union invited Thursday its member countries to
recall their ambassadors to Tehran following the Berlin Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Denmark was among the first to confirm it was to heed the
call. Australia also said it would do the same.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Iran's biggest trade partner, with trade exceeding
3 billion marks (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, despite a
U.S. call for sanctions on the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns hailed Thursday
the Berlin Court verdict, saying "it (Iran) must be contained by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the Iranian judiciary intends to bring 24
German companies to court after over 1,000 complaints were
delivered to the Iranian judiciary by relatives of toxic gas
victims.
</P>
<P>
The relatives demand compensation and trial against these
firms as well as relevant German government officials who issued
the permit to export chemical weapons to Iraq during the
Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
In precaution against possible extremist violence upon
the announcement of the verdict on the Mykonos case, the first
group of German engineers from Siemens Company has been called
back this week from a power project in the Iranian northern
province of Rasht, 325 kilometers north of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security measures have been reportedly intensified
around the German Embassy in Tehran Thursday following the
announcement of the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urged to Ban European Abortion Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica has been asked to issue a ban on RU-486, a
potent abortion pill that was already withdrawn in other countries
but is said to have entered the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency said that the call was made by
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople after recent reports in the
United States showed that European pharmaceutical giant Hoechst
Inc. plans to distribute the abortion-inducing pill to countries
that did not lay out strict guidelines for its use.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the U.S. Population Council may still offer
to sell the pill to underdeveloped countries including the
Philippines. Ople noted that the Health Department should formally
issue a ban on the pill.
</P>
<P>
The pill, which has been allowed for distribution in France,
Sweden and Britain, is said to clinically terminate unwanted
pregnancies if it is taken during the first two months of life of
the fetus.
</P>
<P>
However, Hoechst Inc. earlier announced it was withdrawing the
drug due to an incessant boycott by several anti-abortion groups
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ople said a total of 4,200 women died of birth complications
annually because of childbirth and abortion in the country.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Belarusian President Alexandr
Lukashenko said Thursday evening that the Russian-Belarusian Union
should consist of two sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko stressed in a television address that the

Lukashenko said Belarus did not want to be "a front country

<P>
"For me, the alternative of Russia or NATO does not exist,"
he said.

Lukashenko stressed: "Whatever happens in Russia, the
Belarusian people will form an alliance forever with its Slavic
brothers."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not favor to hold a referendum on the treaty on

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geoscientists Say Earthquake Predictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Earthquakes can be predicted, top
Chinese geoscientists told reporters in Beijing when asked to
comment on some U.S scientists' claims that quake-foretelling just
isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that earthquakes are predictable on the
basis that all earthquakes have warning signs and the energy a
strong earthquake releases needs a long period of time to amass,"
said Ding Jianhai, a research fellow of the State Seismological
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"China is the only country in the world which has set up
earthquake monitoring stations across the country to detect
warning sings of earthquakes," said Ding, who is also head of the
bureau's Earthquake Analysis and Prediction Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has been prone to strong earthquakes for
2,000 years, therefore China boasts detailed data of earthquakes,
which help a lot to China's earthquake prediction efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Chinese scientists have collected data
on more than 120 earthquakes measuring over 5 on the Richter
scale; of these, 20 measured over 7 points.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the varieties and complexities of earthquakes and their
warning signs, we are only able to predict certain kinds of
earthquakes under some favorable conditions," said Zhang Guomin,
another research fellow of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in predicting ten earthquakes measuring
over 6 on the Richter scale in the past two decades, and it made a
precise prediction of the earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter
scale in Haicheng, northeast China's Liaoning Province, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to pursue the cause of earthquake
prediction," said He Yongnian, deputy head of the State
Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to change our way of prediction from judgement
based on experience to that based on physical analysis," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects EU President Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today angrily rejected the EU
stance to recall all its ambassadors to Tehran and suspend
critical dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammoud Mohammadi, spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry,
described as "unprincipled" the call announced by Van Der Werff,
spokesman for the EU presidency, now held by the Netherlands until
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The EU call followed a Berlin Court ruling that the Iranian
leadership was involved in the 1992 assassination of four Kurdish
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that the EU stance was based on
unfounded verdict handed down by Berlin Court and pressure
exerted by those who were against Iran-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran respects international laws and
regulations in its foreign policy and does not allow the critical
dialogue with EU to be used a pressure lever against Iran," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has welcomed the critical dialogue with EU in the past
years so as to keep open an official channel with the EU that
sought greater economic interests in Iran, while critical of
Tehran's politics.
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, Iran has always been a witness to biased
provocations and sabotage by some of the (EU) members," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the EU Union is unable to demonstrate an
independent attitude based on goodwill, the Islamic Republic of
Iran will consider such talks as useless," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was believed here that the Berlin Court verdict would serve
the purpose of further isolating Iran, a western drive spearheaded
by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said in
Washington Thursday that the critical dialogue which Germany
attempted to maintain with Iran "has not succeeded in its original
aim which was to modify and moderate Iranian government behavior
through a series of discussions between European governments and
Iran."
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence whatever that critical dialogue has made
any difference," Burns asserted, pledging the U.S. will go ahead
with sanctions on Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states, reluctant to go along with the
U.S. sanctions, make up 41.3 percent of Iran's total imports and
32.8 percent of its total export.

<HEADLINE> China Willing to Expand Economic Ties With Italy: NPC Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MILAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of China's National
People's Congress (NPC), Qiao Shi, said today that China is
willing to expand economic cooperation with Italy on the basis of
equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have, for years, witnessed remarkable
achievements in their economic cooperation and bilateral trade on
the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit, he told the Italian
business community in Milan.
</P>
<P>
Italy had become China's second largest trading partner in
Europe, with bilateral trade hitting 5.08 billion U.S. dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Italy had invested in 1,010 projects
in China, with total investments amounting to 946 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Italy granted loans to help Italian enterprises
and products enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the two economies each have their own
characteristics and Italy enjoys superiority in energy,
transportation, communications and agriculture, which are
priorities for China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
There was a great potential for further development of economic
and trade cooperation between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
With joint efforts, cooperation in economic, trade and other
fields would be greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese NPC leader arrived here from Rome Wednesday and was
scheduled to leave for Mongolia later today.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Probe Illegal Activities on Foreign Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
formed a three-member committee to investigate into the illegal
activities of local employment broker agencies while recruiting
Nepali workers for foreign jobs, the official news agency RSS said
today.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed panel under the Labor Ministry will present
its report within two months with suggestions for making the
foreign employment business in the country more reliable, the RSS
said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali workers have been going abroad in huge numbers in recent
years to seek employment in countries of East Asia and the Middle
East as there is lack of enough job opportunities here.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's estimates, the number of Nepali
laborers working in Gulf countries alone is about 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The figure compared sharply to an earlier statement by the
Labor Ministry that the total number of migrant workers leaving
Nepal through licensed labor recruiting agencies was only nearly
7,000 since 1990.
</P>
<P>
A local trade union organization in its recent research found
that there are 5,000 and 2,200 Nepali workers respectively in
Japan and South Korea at present.

<HEADLINE> More Commercial Banks Likely to Be Merged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- More commercial banks are likely
to be merged in Zambia because of their failure to meet the
minimum capital requirement of two billion Kwacha (115 million
U.S. Dollars) effected by the central bank, Bank of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The central bank last year increased the minimum capital
requirement for commercial banks from 1.25 billion Kwacha to two
billion Kwacha which the commercial banks had to comply with by
December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Banking and Financial Services Act, Bank of
Zambia gave the defaulting commercial banks a grace period of
three months to restructure their operations and meet the new
requirement.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise they will either face closure or being merged with
other defaulting banks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Safe Deposit and First Merchant Bank were merged to
facilitate their continued operations.

<HEADLINE> US Report Lays Finger On China's Internal Affairs: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The US State Department's US-Hong
Kong Policy Act Report for 1997 is yet another example of the US'
attempt to lay a finger on the Hong Kong issue and meddle with
China's internal affairs, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question from Xinhua, spokesman Shen Guofang
said that the report, in woeful ignorance of the sound situation
of Hong Kong's return to China and confused about the Chinese
government's determination and sincerity on implementing the "one
country, two systems" principle in Hong Kong, made irrational
accusations against the necessary measures that the Chinese
government has adopted to safeguard a smooth return of the
territory to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The US State Department issued the report to the Congress on
April Fool's Day.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that in a number of days, the Chinese government will
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. The whole
situation of a smooth return of the territory and transfer of
power has already been set, he said.
</P>
<P>
The smooth return of Hong Kong is in the interest of the
territory and China's mainland, as well as all other countries
such as the United States, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the US side would proceed from the
overall situation of the Sino-US relationship, its own interest,
and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and do more things
that are beneficial to the territory's smooth transfer and
long-term prosperity and stability, instead of making
irresponsible comments about and pointing fingers at the Hong Kong
issue.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Main Commercial Bank Declared Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Commercial Deposit
Bank (TSBANK), one of the country's mainstays in the financial
sector, was declared bankruptcy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The TSBANK, established in February 1992, had been active in
its business with one third of its capital coming from the state
and the rest from the commercial groups.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, its capability of payment was weakened as
the state-owned Bulgarian People's Bank withdrew its shares from
it during the country's financial reforms in addition to increased
losses brought about by large amounts of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
It was placed under the supervision of the People's Bank last
october when it was unable to mortgage 400 billion leva (about
1.56 million US dollars) in loans provided by the bank, and, after
half a year's supervision, was declared bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
However, TSBANK's bankruptcy would not affect its customers as
the Bulgarian government had already promised to begin paying back
the individual customers by full and corporate customers 50
percent in a month.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the bank's remaining assets of 600 billion
leva (about 2.34 million US dollars) have been sealed up.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Shift More Defense Budget to Frontline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said today that the government would shift more defense
expenditure from the bureaucracy to frontline soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We are not reducing defense expenditure, but what we're going
to do is reduce money spent on the bureaucracy and give it to the
soldiers, for more training capacity, more equipment," Howard said
on TV Channel-9.
</P>
<P>
The 10 billion Australian dollar (7.8 billion US dollars)
defense budget has been quarantined from budget cost-cutting, but
the Defense Department must find major savings within the
portfolio to update Australia's military equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The review promised savings of up to one billion Australian
dollars (780 million US dollars) by cutting almost 8,000 jobs and
asset sales. It suggested the cutting of 3,100 civilian staff and
some 4,700 uniform jobs from the administration and support areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite the substantial savings likely to be generated, the
government concedes that a defense budget increase will still be
needed eventually for improving defense capabilities, including
new equipment and better training.

CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A tomb dating back to the era of
King Ikhnaton, 1379-1362 B.C. was discovered near Cairo, Egypt's

</P>
<P>
The tomb, believed to belong to the 18th Dynasty of the modern

</P>

Dahshour was known for containing the monuments of the old and

<HEADLINE> ANC Demands Full Probe into Hani's Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) has demanded re-investigations into the
assasination of former South African Communist Party leader Chris
Hani, the local daily Sowetan reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reason to reopen Hani probe was because new evidence suggested
more people than those convicted were involved in the killing, ANC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Marking on the fourth anniversary of Hani's death, the ANC
officials pointed out the assassination was not just the work of Clive
Derby-Lewis and Janus Waluz.
</P>
<P>
"Their network went beyond the borders of South Africa," they said,
stressing that "all those who were involved must be brought to book."
</P>
<P>
The ANC officials also said ANC would do everything to oppose the
application for amnesty by Waluz and Derby-lewis.
</P>
<P>
Hani, also former ANC National Executive Committee member and ANC
Military Commander, was assassinated at home in Johannesburg on
April 10, 1993. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iran: Berlin Court Ruling No Legal Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official
claimed here today that the Berlin Court ruling on the Mykonos
trial was devoid of any legal value.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and
International Affairs, said the remarks of the Berlin Court judge
lacked any legal value because the court had not investigated the
case in accordance with the undeniable legal principles.
</P>
<P>
Zarif noted that the court's ruling has solely relied on
remarks of a number of what he termed as terrorists and
hijackers, for whose arrest warrant has been issued by Iranian
judiciary and international police.
</P>
<P>
"These elements are members of the counter-revolutionary
groups, whose aim is to mar prestige of Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From legal point of view," he added, "statements of these
people lack any legal credibility and no legal decision could be
made on these remarks."
</P>
<P>
However, he critisized the Berlin Court for failing to provide
the defendant with an "equal right" to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zarif asserted that the Berlin Court ruling was nothing but a
political show.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Berlin Court ruled that the political
leadership of Iran was behind the assassination of four exiled
Iranian-Kurdish opposition leaders in Mykonos restaurant in Berlin
in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
The judge convicted two men of murder and two of being
accessories to murder in the killing of Kurdish leader Sadiq
Sarafkindi and three of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The court gave life imprisonment to one Iranian national and a
Lebanese and sentenced two other Lebanese to long prison terms on
charges of assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has denied any involvement in the
killing, and recalled its ambassador to Germany Hussein
Musavian for "consultations".
</P>
<P>
The row has provoked fears that the relations between Bonn and
Tehran would continue to sour to shake the foundations of
Germany's policy of close ties and continued trade with Iran.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Tehran Horst Beshmann was also called back
home after being summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry Thursday
for official explanations.
</P>
<P>
Germany expelled four Iranian diplomats, which triggered off a
tit-for-tat move from Tehran. The Islamic republic has ordered four
German diplomats to leave.
</P>
<P>
The European Union invited Thursday its member countries to
recall their ambassadors to Tehran following the Berlin Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Denmark was among the first to confirm it was to heed the
call. Australia also said it would do the same.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Iran's biggest trade partner, with trade exceeding
3 billion marks (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, despite a
U.S. call for sanctions on the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns hailed Thursday
the Berlin Court verdict, saying "it (Iran) must be contained by
the international community."

<HEADLINE> S. African National Road Network Faces Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April (Xinhua) -- South Africa, which has long
been enjoying a reputation of a good public transport network, is
now facing serious problems in road maintenance, traffic
officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Transport Ministry, South Africa
needs 3.45 billion U.S. Dollars annually for 10 years to overcome
the rural roads backlog, prevent the deterioration of national
road network and meet new demand.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Business Day quoted Dave Orton, chairman of South
African Bitumen and Tar Association, as saying that erratic
funding, abolition of the dedicated road fund and lower
government allocations meant the backlog in road maintenance has
reached a "hazardous level".
</P>
<P>
"A national investment in roads of more than 150 billion Rands
(34 billion U.S. Dollars) could go to waste if our roads do not
receive the maintenance they require to remain efficient
transport routes," Orton said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South African Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said the
country's road network was facing a crisis due to institutional
and financial problems including inadequate flow of funds,
inadequated conditions of employment to attract sufficient number
of experienced road engineers and technicians, lack of clearly
defined responsibilities, inadequate management systems and lack
of managerial authority and accountability, etc..
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90 percent of all passengers and freight are
carried by roads in South Africa, but treasure funds are adequate
for only 60 percent of maintenance needs.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve national road network, the South African
government recently outlined a restructuring of its transport
industry centered on commercializing many services and
introducing private sector partners within four to seven years.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Transport Ministry will be able to re-establish
the dedicated road fund and we would recommend that political
support be given to privately funded and operated roads," Orton
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Resents Applying Pressure to Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it
resents anyone or any country trying to apply pressure to resolve
international problems.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia believed in
constructive measures than applying pressure to resolve
international problems.
</P>
<P>
"This is our approach and I think our approach is much more
constructive than, every now and then, shouting we are going to
apply sanction. I think that is a very bad way of trying to
influence other countries," he said at a dialogue with British
corporate figures here today.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue followed a joint meeting of the British-Malaysia
Society and Malaysia-British Society here, which was opened by
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, very often Malaysia's approach was not
appreciated by Europeans and Americans alike as they believe that
the only way to get people to behave is "to whack them at the
bottom."
</P>
<P>
"We think that by talking to people we can achieve better
result. You could be right or we could be wrong. People resent
adding pressure, what always happen is that they get to fight
back," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's successes had helped towards changing the
attitudes of some countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also criticized the western media, especially the
British press, for highlighting only the negative aspects of
Malaysia but failing to report the positive ones.

<HEADLINE> Base Lease Bill Passed in Japan's Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- With the backing of key opposition
parties, a government-proposed bill to revise a law to facilitate
continued compulsory land lease for the U.S. military in Okinawa
was easily passed today in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), New Party Sakigake,
a non-cabinet ally of the LDP, the largest opposition New Frontier
Party (NEP), the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the Taiyo
Party voted in favor at a plenary session of the 500-seat lower
house.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party (SDP), another non-cabinet ally of
the LDP, and the Japanese Communist Party voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
The 252-seat House of Councillors (Upper House) will start
deliberations on the bill later in the day and is expected to give
the bill the green light by the end of the next week, just before
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's planned talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on April 25 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the government is allowed to continue using
land provisionally designated for U.S. forces after land leases
expire on May 14. This will be allowed even if application
procedures to renew lease have not been completed as long as the
government applies for an extension and pays compensation to
landowners before the expiration of current leases.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people who own a total of about 362,000 square
meters of land used by 12 U.S. military facilities in Okinawa have
refused to renew the leases.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Party Leaders Might Meet in Televised Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The hope for a televised debate
between British Prime Minister John Major and opposition Labor
Party leader Tony Blair was revived today after the Times
newspaper challenged them to meet.
</P>
<P>
After the two parties had disagreement late last month on the
form of the debate, the first such encounter in British politics,
the initiative for this election had seemed over.
</P>
<P>
However, Times editor Peter Stothard sent an open letter to
the two parties, which was published in today's Times
newspaper, asking their leaders to participate in a debate on
April 20, hosted by the newspaper and opened to the television
companies.
</P>
<P>
"This challenge is intended to break the stalement over a
leaders' debate and to offer the two candidates running for prime
minister a chance to discuss their different visions for the
future of Britain in a neutral setting," Stothard said.
</P>
<P>
A leading article in today's Times also said that the time was
ripe for a debate, adding "even without the prospect of a debate
to divert the campaigners' minds, the central issue has become one
of trust and personal character. Voters have been asked to believe
that the very soul of the Tory Party has somehow been rehoused in
Tony Blair."
</P>
<P>
Both parties have given positive replies to Stothard's
letter. Labor said Thursday night that it welcomed the letter and
would respond as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives, accusing Blair of running away last time,
welcomed the initiative by the Times and said they were willing to
"open discussions with the Times and the broadcasters
immediately."

<HEADLINE> Shops Gutted By Fire In Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- At Least 25 shops were gutted by
a big fire which broke out this morning at Pettah in Colombo, the
capital city of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The fire was already raging when fire engines arrived at the
scene within minutes. Over 100 firemen and 15 fire engines battled
the blaze which was put out later, the Fire Brigade said.
</P>
<P>
The shops housed in the century-old Victoria Building which
were destroyed by the fire were mainly in textile business and
kept a large stock of goods for the Sinhalese new year which falls
on April 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Police began investigations and estimated the losses at about
1.75 million US dollars, the Fire Brigade said.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations showed that an electric short circuit
may have caused the fire. But police and fire brigade officials
were conducting separate investigations to ascertain the cause of
the fire and sabotage is not ruled out yet.
</P>
<P>
A special police team also questioned a number of people who
lived near the gutted building.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Says China May Avoid Software Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist said here
today that the country may avoid a serious software crisis in the
near future thanks to its progress in the computer sector.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fuqing, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
told a press conference that China has developed a computer-aided
software engineering system that can raise software design
efficiency by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yang, director of the Computer Department of the Beijing
University, said that this is a "revolution in the history of
Chinese software."
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 1,000 companies engaged in software
design, but 80 percent of them have not used computer-aided
technology which is commonplace in Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that if these outdated design styles continue to
survive in China's software industry, the country will be in a
deeply serious situation brought about by the challenge from
Western giants like the Microsoft, which already have a big share
on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, the "Jade Bird" system, an idea born in the early
1980s and a state key program, will turn China's software industry
into a modern one, Yang said, adding that it simplify the
development of Chinese language software.
</P>
<P>
The program is backed up by the State Planning Commission, the
Ministry of Electronics Industry and the State Education
Commission, and is the work of 22 key universities and research
institutes, including the Beijing University, Fudan University and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the system can be used in the industries of
national defense, aerospace, oil, electricity, commerce and
finance.

<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings from agricultural

million US dollar in February this year from 88.58 million US
dollars in the same period last year, the Philippine News Agency

goods slid down by 19.24 percent from 117.34 million US dollars
posted in January.

Reported income from coconut products went up by 10.27 percent
to 58.98 million US dollars from 53.49 million US dollars the

<HEADLINE> EU Begins Withdrawal from Nigeria for Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has begun
to withdraw its financial aid from Nigeria which had just turned
down an EU loan worth one billion U.S. Dollars for promotion of
democracy and human rights and alleviation of poverty in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian Tribune, a local newspaper here
today, the Nigerian government rejected the loan under the Lome
4A and B Conventions, insisting that the money be handed over to
it for expenditure on EU's set objectives.
</P>
<P>
But EU insisted on disbursing the fund directly by itself.
</P>
<P>
"The military government said thank you for the offer, but we
are not interested unless the money is handed over to us to
implement the objectives," said Souderbery Jorgen, EU civil
engineering adviser in Nigeria, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The abandoned projects include a 250-million-Dollar tea
program, 200-million-Dollar oil palm projects and a
150-million-Dollar rural integrated program in some northern,
eastern and southern states.
</P>
<P>
The 60-million-Dollar EU program of rural integration was also
abandoned along with the multi-million-Dollar north-east arid
zone development program.
</P>
<P>
Due to the withdrawal, the EU recommended assistance in maize
projects will also suffer, the EU official said.
</P>
<P>
EU, following the Nigerian government's execution of nine
Nigeria's Ogoni human rights activists in November 10, 1995,
decided to impose arms embargo on Nigeria and suspended its
membership of the Lome Convention of African, Pacific and
Caribbean States.
</P>
<P>
All EU-funded development projects and lines of credit
guaranteed by EU member nations were subsequently frozen.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Kidnap Some 60 Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebels have kidnaped some
60 Lebanese nationals as they assembled at the airport in the
southeastern city of Lumumbashi before boarding a chartered plane
for safety, the Lebanese newspaper Daily Star reported this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese had spent six hours at the airport, waiting to be
airlifted to safety by a French airplane, when followers of rebel
leader Laurent Kabila stormed the airport building Thursday, the
English-language daily based in Beirut said.
</P>
<P>
All the passengers were rounded up, striped of passports and
luggage and led away at gunpoints to an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
The kidnaped had gathered at the home of a Lebanese
businessman several days earlier when the fall of the city to the
rebels seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
Using a citizens' band radio, they contacted relatives in
Lebanon who later arranged the French flight for their rescue.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, as the rebels' grip on the city began to
tighten, the Lebanese fled to the airport but the rebels arrived
there before the plane flew in.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the abducted remains unknown so far.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels view the Lebanese community in that country as
sympathetic to President Mobutu Sese Seko's government, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the government was still trying to determine the
identity of the kidnaped and their exact number.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Abdel-Amir Qabalan, a prominent Lebanese Shiite
religious leader, urged in a telephone call President Elias Hrawi
to take all steps to help rescue the kidnaped.
</P>
<P>
Qabalan also urged the Ministry of Emigrant Affairs to enlist
help of friendly countries in a bid to arrange safe departure of
all the Lebanese from the African country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leads Nation in Comprehensive Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai ranks ahead of other
Chinese cities in comprehensive social development, according to a
latest research conducted by the Shanghai Science and Technology
Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
By comparing various groups of data from Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang and Shenzhen cities, the
institute worked out a set of indices to assess social development.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai got the highest rating (13.467), a slight edge over
Beijing (13.440). Next came Shenzhen (11.461), Guangzhou (11.050),
Tianjin (7.467 ), Shenyang (7.353), and Wuhan (5.599).
</P>
<P>
Research workers explained Shanghai gained more scores for
better efficiency exerted by manpower, finance, property, science
and technology, or a higher growth rate in gross domestic product
(GDP), better quality of life, in addition to its overall rational
structure encompassing industries, science and technology,
investment, and international exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was, however, outstripped by Shenzhen, Beijing and
Tianjin in the social environmental comprehensive index featuring
safety and security, environment, culture and recreation, and
information services.
</P>
<P>
As China's biggest city and a leading industrial and commercial
center, Shanghai is also striving to build itself into one of the
world's important economic cities, said Gong Yiqing, a member on
the research team. The research, which helped Shanghai find its
strong and weak points, will play a positive role in advancing the
city's expansion and helping it achieve its goal, he added.

<HEADLINE> Economic Recession Denied in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's economy is not heading for
recession as some people have been saying recently, the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development has said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here yesterday by the ministry was quoted by
the local daily '' the New Vision'' today as saying, all indicators,
except food crop production and imports, indicate that economic
activity continues at a healthy pace.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the preliminary estimated rate of growth
for 1996/97 is 6.3 percent, which is not very far from the earlier
projected 7 percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
This is indeed a slow-down in the rate of growth but not a
downward trend, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It explained that the apparent slow-down is due to the widening of
the base of Uganda's economy since 1986 when the current government
came to power.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the lower rate of growth during this period
was also anticipated due to the end of the coffee prices boom.
</P>
<P>
Other factors cited for causing the slow-down include drought
which has led to the decline in the crop sector, from 4.4 percent
in the last financial year to a mere 0.7 percent in the current
one. However, this is expected to be compensated for with a
projected 15.4 percent in the cash drop sector in this financial
year. enditem

Shortly before Deve Gowda drove to the Parliament to seek a
vote of confidence, several leaders of the 13-party (UF) met him
at his residence this morning and suggested that he should make
way for another UF leader as demanded by the Congress in the last
two days' talks, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported, quoting
UF sources.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was believed to have told them that since it
was the unanimous decision of the Front Steering Committee that
there would be no change in leadership, he saw no reason to
succumb to the Congress pressure.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, the Congress party withdrew its support for the
10-month-old UF coalition government, which is now on the verge of
falling.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Zaire, which currently provides
asylum to an estimated 774,500 refugees, still ranks first among
the 10 leading refugee hosting countries in Africa, according to
a United Nations report today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Times quoted an African fact sheet compiled by the U.N.
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as saying that Zaire plays
hosts to more than 370,000 refugees from Rwanda, 76,000 from
Burundi, 200,000 from Angola, 110,000 from Sudan and 18,500 from
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Guinea ranks second, Tanzania third, followed by Sudan,
Ethiopia, Cote d'Ivore, Uganda and Kenya, according to the fact
sheet.
</P>
<P>
Kenya currently plays host to 168,000 refugees from war-torn
Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda, it said.
</P>
<P>
The fact sheet said UNHCR completed the repatriation of 1.7
million Mozambican refugees from six African countries in 1995,
the largest repatriation the UNHCR has ever undertaken in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that political stability over the past years in
Togo has prompted many refugees to return to the country and only
about 29,000 refugees are still out of Togo by the start of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Lesotho Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said here today that China wishes to further develop its
friendly relations with Lesotho on the basis of mutual respect,
equality, and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also vice-premier of the State Council, made the remarks
during his talks with Kelebone Maope, Foreign Minister of the
Kingdom of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Qian extended welcome to Maope on his first official China
trip. He said despite twists and turns in the relations between
the two countries, the Sino-Lesotho bilateral relations were
resumed after the Basotholand Congress Party came to power and
corrected the former government's erroneous China policy, and the
relations have been developing smoothly since, with increasing
cooperation in economic ties and trade, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Lesotho government's policy of sticking to
the "One China" stance and not pursuing official links with the
Taiwan authorities, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China treasures the friendship between the two peoples and has
always advocated that all countries, big or small, rich or poor,
and strong or weak, are all equal, Qian stated.
</P>
<P>
Qian also appreciates the Lesotho government's achievements in
maintianing national stability and developing economy and its
important contribution to regional unity and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the southern part of Africa, Qian said that
important progress has been scored in Angola's peace process
following the abolition of South Africa's apartheid system and the
realization of peace in Mozambique. At the moment, the peaceful
and stable trend in southern Africa has entered a new period of
accelerating the economic development there, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see deep and positive changes in southern
Africa and that China's cooperation with most member countries of
the Southern Africa Development Community has been effective."
China supports the Community's efforts in maintaining regional
peace and stability and in promoting regional cooperation towards
economic integration, Qian stressed, adding that China wishes to
strengthen unity and cooperation with the Community countries.
</P>
<P>
Maope said there is only one China in the world, and his
government would stick to the "one China" policy and develop
friendly relations with China, which has made great contribution
to the emancipation cause of the African people. Referring to
economic ties and trade between the two countries, Maope said he
hoped that Chinese firms would go to invest in Lesotho and
establish joint ventures there and to conduct technological
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Maope also said that he was happy with South Africa
government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with
China.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Diamond Exports Increase In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli diamond industry
achieved a dynamic 6.2 percent increase in polished diamond
exports in the first two months of 1997, with January-February
sales exceeding 775 U.S. million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of bi-weekly Israel Business attributed much of
the growth to increased sales to the U.S. and Hong Kong which
totaled 450 million and 170 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Israel Diamond Institute (IDI) Chairman, Moshe Schnitzer,
pointed out that buyers in the U.S. market expressed confidence
in Israel's ability to supply a comprehensive range of goods,
from mele'es to larger stones in all qualities.
</P>
<P>
Schnitzer added that the imminent political turnaround in Hong
Kong are not negatively impacting on the local market, and that
Israeli diamantaires are continuously expanding their marketing
network to relatively new consuming centers in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Israeli diamond cutters recently conducted
seminars on the polished diamond industry in Indonesia and the
Philippines under the auspices of the IDI.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 leaders of the diamond and fine jewelry trades
in both these relatively new markets attended the gatherings. In
view of the size of both markets, the event takes on considerable
importance.
</P>
<P>
Diamond industry is a major foreign currency earner for
Israel. The total exports in 1996 amounted to 3.998 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Produces Cotton Print with Naturally-Colored Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in producing
the first batch of cotton print made of naturally-colored cotton
grown in China.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was recently carried out by the Feitian Color
Cotton Company in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The cloth, which met the state-set standards, will be used to
make the first batch of pollution-free garments in the country.
</P>
<P>
China imported color cotton strains from the United States in
1995 and experimentally planted them in Dunhuang of Gansu and
Sanya in south China's Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
As the cotton has a natural colour, the processes of dying and
bleaching can be omitted, resulting in less production cost and
pollution.

<HEADLINE> China Making Efforts To Promote Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's hybrid cotton experiment
in Hunan Province has shown promising results that will be
translated into high productivity.
</P>
<P>
The province, China's major agricultural base famous for its
hybrid rice, will spread the cultivation of hybrid cotton to at
least 100,000 ha this year, according to the Provincial
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid cotton strain, developed by the Provincial Cotton
Science and Technology Institute through 20-plus years of hard
work, increases an average 20 percent of per-unit yield and
produces cotton of higher quality fibre.
</P>
<P>
The province planted the new breed cotton on 50,000 ha last
year and reported a good harvest. Anxiang County reaped 1,770 kg of
cotton for per hectare, up 12 percent over the previous year, in
spite of a serious flood.
</P>
<P>
China's cotton production declined by 570,000 tons to 4.2
million tons last year, mainly due to a drop of nearly 667,000
ha in acreage sown to cotton.
</P>
<P>
Agro-science will play a bigger role in promoting cotton
production and meeting domestic demand owing to the difficulty in
increasing farmland for cotton growing.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission has listed the
hybrid cotton among the projects to spread the use of agricultural
techniques during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period. It
will invest in a national-level hybrid cotton fine-seed breeding
center in the province. The Ministry of Agriculture will also join
in the campaign to push the wide-spread use hybrid cotton.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A commemorative envelope will be
issued here on Sunday by China National Philatelic Corporation to
mark the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao.
</P>
<P>
This is the first in a series of envelopes to mark the return

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has since last
year provided citizenship for more than 100,000 immigrants from
other member countries of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), local daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 199,596 applications received countryside by the
Department of Home Affairs, 100,218 applicants have been granted
citizenship, 87,600 have been turned down while the rest are
still waiting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The applicants took advantage of a cabinet decision early last
year to grant citizenship to some SADC nationals who had been
living in South Africa for a certain period of time, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
SADC, a regional political and economic organization, groups
South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest immigration regulations, those who expect to
get South African citizenship are demanded to have been in the
country for at least five years, be employed, have a relationship
with a South African, or have dependent children born or residing
lawfully in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to an official estimation, there are still between
2.5 million and 4.2 million illegal immigrants in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> New Efforts Made to Reunite UF, Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- New efforts are reportedly
being made to see if the UF and the Congress Party could get
together again as the Lok Sabha (Lower House) began its debate on
the one-line motion of confidence moved by Prime Minister Deve
Gowda here this moring, Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The efforts aimed at finding out a new way out after the vote
of confidence, which is expected to result in the fall of the
Gowda government. Those trying for a settlement maintained that
the country as well as the constituents of the UF and the Congress
Party could ill-afford fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
One possible scenario painted by them is that once Mr. Gowda
fails to secure the confidence vote, the Front and the Congress
could come together again under a new leader of the Front.
</P>
<P>
They would jointly approach President S.D. Sharma and tell him
that they would together, as a coalition or otherwise, provide a
new and stable government with a clear majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the Front leaders who tried to persuade Mr.
Gowda to step down remained a matter of speculation, but those
present at the prime minister's residence when the move was made
included Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, Tamil Nadu Chief
Minister M. Karunanidhi, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N.
Chandrababu Naidu and Tamil Maanila Party leader G.K. Moopanar.
</P>
<P>
These leaders had earlier met at the Andhra House this morning
to chalk out their new strategy. Later Naidu went to see
General-Secretary of the Communist Party of India H. Singh
Surjeet, even as grim-faced MPS walked into the Lok Sabha to
decide the fate of the 10-month-old Gowda government.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Mekong Subregional Cooperation Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh Ministerial-level
Conference on Economic Cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS) ended here this afternoon with progress in seeking financial
and expertise support from donor agencies and the business sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before the end of the meeting,
Bong-Suh Lee, vice president of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
said that during the two-day meeting, ministers of GMS countries
discussed resource mobilization, partnership and cooperation with
the business sector and donor community.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met representatives of the donor community this
morning and delegates of the business sector this afternoon,
seeking their financial and expertise management support for about
100 subregional projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
These projects, which have been identified in the past several
years, will take about 15 years to complete, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of this century, he said, the implementation of
energy and transport projects of the GMS program alone need about
14.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Lee said, the implementation of the identified
projects need not only the support of the donor community, but
also the participation of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the GMS program has moved from "the stage of
conception- building" in the past several years to "the stage
where actions are taking now," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, 17 donor agencies expressed their interest in
supporting some of the subregional projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), donor agencies and chambers of commerce and industry of
the GMS countries -- Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and
Vietnam, also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Gas Import From Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel is seeking gas imports
from neighboring Egypt despite new tension in the Arab-Israeli
relations.
</P>
<P>
The local bi-weekly Israeli Business, which came off the press
today, reported that Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure
Ariel Sharon has met with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Muhammad
Basyouni to express his country's willingness to start gas
business talks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has added his weight to the
project following a discussion on the topic with President Hosni
Mubarak during his recent visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians have warned that they will offer their natural
gas resources to other countries than Israel if significant
headway is not achieved in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently signed gas supply agreements with Jordan and
Turkey, although it is believed that Egypt could also meet
Israel's natural gas requirements if the political atmosphere
permits.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have reached a consensus on linking the
economic relations with Israel to the Middle East peace process, a
warning which seemed to be ignored so far by the Israeli
hardliners, now in power.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government headed by right-wing Likud leader
Netanyahu vowed not to bow to mounting international pressure to
stop settlement expansions in the occupied territories, an issue
which triggered off waves of protest throughout the Arab world
including Egypt in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it is unknown how Egypt would respond
to the Israeli call for gas business.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Seismologists Probe into Xinjiang Earthquakes  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Jiashi County in Xinjiang will
likely be jolted by another quake with a magnitude of about five
on the Richter scale, according to scientist Ding Jianhai.
</P>
<P>
Ding, a research fellow with the State Seismological Bureau,
said, "The quakes hitting the area have shown no obvious signs of
decline in terms of magnitude in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Five successive earthquakes estimated at over 6.0 on the
Richter scale have hit the county in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
On January 21, two quakes at 6.4 and 6.3 hit Jiashi
County. On March 1, a quake at 6.0, and another two at 6.3 and 6.4
struck the county on April 6.
</P>
<P>
It is rare in seismological history that there are so many
strong quakes hitting the same place in such short intervals, said
Ding, head of the Department of Earthquake Prediction and Analysis
Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that seismological experts of the bureau have been
watching closely over the recent seismological development in the
western part of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
They agree that the development in the area is not an isolated
phenomenon, which is closely related to the fact that the world
and China have entered into another period of seismological
activity.
</P>
<P>
"The geological location of the county is also one of the major
factors which triggered the earthquakes," Ding noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the county in southern Xinjiang and western
parts of the Tianshan mountains is located where the Pamir-Lake
Baikal seismological belt and the seismological belt of Himalaya
Mountains meet.
</P>
<P>
The geological conditions of Jiashi made the area vulnerable to
frequent jolts, and a similar phenomenon occurred in 1961, when
three earthquakes above six on the Richter scale jolted the area,
and after-shocks continued for 20 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The world has been prone to frequent earthquakes since 1994,
with stronger collisions between the Indian plate and
Asia-European plate, which triggered strong earthquakes in Iran,
Pakistan, central Asia, and western parts of Xinjiang in recent
months," said Ding.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has seen frequent strong seismic
activities in recent three years, during which both the frequency
and magnitude of earthquakes have all risen to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Up to early April, as many as 17 earthquakes above 5.0 on the
Richter scale have hit China's mainland. Most of them occurred in
western parts of Xinjiang and Yunnan Province in southwest
China. The two places are two major areas of collision between the
Indian plate and the Asia-European plate.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with China's annual average number of 20 earthquakes
above 5.0 on the Richter scale, the number of strong earthquakes
occurring earlier this year has revealed that China has entered
into another peak period of seismic activities," said Ding.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Regional Seismological Bureau had made correct
short-term predictions of the two earthquakes above six on the
Richter scale that hit the county on April 6, cutting the losses
of lives and property to a minimum, and with no death reported.

<HEADLINE> Rare Plants in Three Gorges Area Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 species of rare plants in
the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River, where the world's
largest dam is under construction, have been adopted by "new
homes."
</P>
<P>
According to the Institute of Botany of Wuhan under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, the plants have been successfully relocated
to the Dalaoling National Forest Park in Wuchang City, Jiugongshan
Nature Reserve in Tongshan County, and the Botanic Garden of
Wuhan. The Institute of Botany is located in the capital city of
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges area boasts the most abundant species of rare
plants in China, according to botanical experts. The 62,000-sq km
area is home to 3,964 species of seed plants, accounting for one
seventh of the national total. Fifty-four of the plants are under
key protection of the government and are deemed as living fossils
for the study of ancient geology, climates, plants, and geography.
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the rare plants became a heated issue well before
the start of the construction of the dam project. The Chinese
Academy of Sciences organized some 2,000 scientists to study the
impact of the dam project on the ecology and environment as early
as 1983. After 14 years of effort, the Institute of Botany of
Wuhan has basically determined the number of the plant species,
their geographical location and ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the rare plants in the Three Gorges area
have been relocated, according to Xu Tianquan, a senior engineer
of the Botanic Garden of Wuhan.

<HEADLINE> Report: Greek Jets Violate Turkish Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek Air Force planes have
violated Turkey's air space 70 times in the past two years,
including six in the first three months of 1997, local newspaper
Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a classified defense analysis as saying that
the Greek fighters had harassed Turkish military aircraft 36 times
over international waters of the Aegean Sea last year, leading to
even crashes in which pilots from both sides lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has never accepted Greece's claims that Turkey should
inform Athens of all its flights over the so-called Flight
Information Region (FIR), said a Turkish defense source, adding
that the FIR, as a matter of fact, was part of international air
space.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has long accused Greece of trying to expand its six
miles of air space to 12 miles, saying it constitutes a violation
of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Greece's action would be regarded as a
provocation of war if it extends its air space to 12 miles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over a number of
issues including the limits of air space, mineral rights below
the Aegean Sea as well as Greek joint defense policy with Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The hostility between Ankara and Athens, both NATO members,
has caused concern about instability in the Aegean region.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Sets Poverty Line for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- When Qi Huifu, a farmer in
north China's Hebei province, was paralyzed two years ago, the
family suddenly fell deep in the abyss of suffering as they lost
the sole source of family income.
</P>
<P>
But things have changed now. Qi, 43, no longer has to worry as
much about his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
Qi's family now live on 60 yuan and some food provided by the
local civil administration bureau every month. Last year, the
Qian'an city, where Qi and his family live, began to provide money
for farmers living beneath the level of subsistence.
</P>
<P>
Qi is not the only fortunate farmer in the city. More than
4,500 poor farmers are now enjoying the security system set by the
local government.
</P>
<P>
The city government set the bottom line at annual income of 800
yuan for one family. Families living under this line because of
the loss of their major labor force will be given 250 kilograms of
grain, and 15 to 20 yuan of relief per member of the family, every
month.
</P>
<P>
Considering the measure an important part of the rural social
security, 35 counties and cities in the province have adopted the
measure on a trial base.
</P>
<P>
Though the standards for the bottom-line differ from one
another, the measure has given farmers new confidence, said the
local government.

<HEADLINE> More to be Questioned on South Korean Hanbo Loan Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution will
summon 33 politicians and officials for questioning on the
allegation that they have received money from bankrupt Hanbo Group
chairman Chung Tae-soo, South Korean prosecutors said today.
</P>
<P>
The 33-member list includes 20 parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Because public suspension about the so-called Chung's list of
people Chung gave money to was ever increasing, the prosecution
could no longer delay the investigations into them until the
parliamentary hearing closes, a high-ranking prosecutor disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has been holding a hearing on jailed Chung and
others since Monday, but failed to get any progress to clear the
loans scandal, arising sharp public criticism.
</P>
<P>
Thus Kim Deog-ryong of the ruling new Korea Party, Kim
Sang-hyun of the opposition National Congress for new Politics and
Kim Yong-hwan of the opposition United Liberal Democrats will be
called in toward the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Also to be summoned are former senior presidential economic
secretaries Lee Suk-chae and Han Lee-horn, and bank officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution closed its investigation into the
allegation that Kim Hyun-chul, second son of President Kim
Yong-sam, has received a rebate of 250 million U.S. dollars in
connection with Hanbo's purchase of steelmaking equipment, after
the allegation was found groundless.
</P>
<P>
About 10 persons related to the Hanbo scandal, including four
parliamentarians and three bank officials, were in jail. They did
not reveal anything useful at the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Gold Sales up 20.3 Percent in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Gold sales in Thailand grew up by
20.3 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the
same period last year, according to the Thailand office of the
World Gold Council.
</P>
<P>
Apprehension over a possible devaluation of the baht and lower
gold prices could be among the factors contributing to the
better-than-expected performance of the local gold trade.
</P>
<P>
Local sales of gold in the first quarter posted 41.5 tons, 39
tons of which were in ornament sales, said Pongpan Pngsiribanyat,
manager of the office.
</P>
<P>
Despite constant complaints by a substantial number of
Thailand's 7,000 gold shop owners that their sales during the last
Chinese Lunar Year were not encouraging, research by the office
found that sales in Bangkok's Yaowaraj (China Town) gold market
remained strong, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Pongpan said that his office would step up promotions, adding
that he was confident that the second quarter would also show a
high growth rate.

"Spread of violence and lawlessness in educational

The president, who is also the chancellor of the university,
regretted that violence and lawlessness have tarnished the
glorious tradition of the country's student community in language
movement and freedom struggle in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Shahabuddin said the act of terrorism sometimes reaches such a
stage that the university area becomes a battle field.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the conscious students to be on the alert so that
they are not used as weapons of the political parties.
</P>

<P>
SAN JOSE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Central American countries will
call for a permanent mechanism for political dialogue with the
United States at a planned summit with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"What we seek at the summit are the political and economic
relations between Central America and the United States," Costa
Rican Minister of Foreign Affairs Fernando Naranjo said today.
</P>
<P>
Central American countries are interested in establishing the
mechanism at the ministerial level for annual meetings, and at the
presidential level for summits every four or five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, to be held here on May 8, a permanent
entrepreneurial forum between Central American countries and the
United States and negotiations for signing a free trade agreement
would also be proposed, Naranjo added.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo acknowledged that the new U.S. immigration law which
could provoke the deportation of thousands of Central Americans
would not be a major topic for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The new law, effective from April 1, makes it easier for the
U.S. Immigration and Neutralization Service to deport undocumented
immigrants and deny entry to travelers presenting invalid or
fraudulent documents.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to arrive in San Jose on May 7 from Mexico,
the first leg of his Latin America tour. He will leave on April 8
for Barbados, the last leg of his tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda will seek a vote of confidence in the lower house of
parliament today as two rounds of formal talks between his
minority United Front (UF) government and the Congress party
failed to resolve the 12-day-old political crisis Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was set by President S.D. Sharma who asked Gowda
to prove his majority in the parliament following the Congress
withdrawal of support to the UF on March 30.
</P>
<P>
Though the house is expected to have a marathon sitting today,
it is unlikely to take up any other business, the most important
of which relates to the budget for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight hours has been fixed for the debate that will
precede voting on the confidence motion presented by the prime
minister in the floor and voting on the motion has been
tentatively fixed at 20:00 hours (local time), according to
parliament sources.
</P>
<P>
If the UF is defeated in the floor, it is likely to recommend
dissolution of the lower house of parliament to the president.
</P>
<P>
Though a lot would depend on what the president decides, the
prevailing situation brings the country closer to another round of
polls, local press reports said today.

<HEADLINE> Albanian President Says Again He Will Not Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
said in a recent interview with an Austrian newspaper that he will
not resign until his people voted him out.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people in this country are behind me. I am a
democratically elected president and will stay on until the people
don't want me any more," the embattled president said in the
interview with Die Presse which was published today.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, in response to a recent call by Italian Foreign
Undersecretary Piero Fassino for his resignation, has repeatedly
said he will step down if his party loses elections in June.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was re-elected unopposed to a second five-year term by
a parliament dominated by his Democratic Party in early March. But
he is facing the worst unrest of his rule.
</P>
<P>
The country was in chaos after a string of fraudulent pyramid
investment schemes failed earlier this year and armed rebels took
control of southern Albania during an unchecked spree of looting
and banditry.
</P>
<P>
But Berisha said he was confident an international military
force, designed to guard aid deliveries to the ravaged country and
expected to operate from next week, would help to restore order.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of the international troops will have a big
psychological effect on the people in my country, with their help
it will be possible to restore public order," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Italian-led multinational security force
will run some but not too great risks, adding they will be
welcomed by the Albanian people if they stay neutral.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Italy sentiment flared in the south after an Albanian
refugee boat collided with an Italian navy ship and sank in the
Adriatic Sea late March. Four people died and 83 were missing.
</P>
<P>
In the southern port of Vlore, from where the ill-fated boat
left, people have threatened to shoot any Italian troops who come
as part of the force.
</P>
<P>
But a rebel spokesman has said it was keen for Italy to send
troops and they would run no risks.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the force is due to begin deploying next Monday on
a mission to guard aid deliveries to impoverished Albania.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been killed since rebels took control
of the south last month in an eruption of anger following the
collapse of shady savings schemes. Families who lost their life
savings blamed Berisha for their misfortune.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of small arms looted from abandoned weapons depots
are still on the streets and the Italian-led force has no mandate
to take them out of circulation.

Prodi, who was forced to seek a vote of confidence after his
Communist allies deserted his government over deploying Italian
troops in Albania, won the vote by 162-81, with one abstaining.
</P>
<P>
Luigi Marino, Head of the Communists in the Senate, said that
the disagreement over crisis-ridden Albania was an isolated matter.
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with the fair and steady support that
we've given the government over the past 11 months," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament, the
prime minister is to face another vote of confidence on Saturday,
which hinges on whether his Communist allies would stick by him.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of the swing votes he needed, Prodi had to
turn to the conservative opposition on Wednesday to win
parliamentary approval for the mission on Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Communists held that the mission would be dangerous for
Italian troops, as Albania has been gripped by violence and unrest
since the failure of investment schemes last month.
</P>
<P>
Italy is to lead the multinational force that, the Italian
Defense Ministry said today, will be deployed in Albania on Monday
to protect aid shipments to the tiny Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The country will contribute to the United Nations-approved
mission with over 2,000 troops, France 1,000, Greece 700, Turkey
700, Spain 500, Romania 400, Austria 100 and Denmark 50-100.
</P>
<P>
The Danish contingent won't arrive in Albania until May.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Police Recover Illegal Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's police have recovered
1,715 unauthorized firearms in the past few weeks, according to
police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that it was found that these firearms were
used during the local government election in March when election
related violence escalated.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 unauthorized firearms were distributed among the
politicians to protect themselves by the former United National
Party regime during the southern youth uprising, and not returned
after the uprising was suppressed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
An amnesty was granted till mid-March for the return of these
firearms and thereafter a special police unit was set up to
recover them.
</P>
<P>
Since then, police have recovered 146 revolvers, 14 pistols, 75
shotguns and 29 repeater shot guns.
</P>
<P>
Police will continue to recover the rest of the illegal
firearms in the hands of politicians in the island country, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force to Help Curb Crime, Says Albanian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino said today the arrival of a 6,000-strong multinational force
next week to secure seaports, airports and the country's internal
transport system would free the government to crack down on
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters the number of people holding weapons
plundered from army depots during last month's violent unrest was
a threat to stability in the country. The arrival of the
Italian-led force would free up Albanian police and troops to
concentrate on curbing crime.
</P>
<P>
Eight European countries have agreed to contribute troops to
the Italian-led force which is due to arrive in Albania next
week. The troops will safeguard ports, airports and roads to
protect the shipment and distribution of humanitarian aid to the
country which is trying to recover from the near anarchy of the
last two months.
</P>
<P>
Unrest flared in Albania after the collapse of get-rich-quick
pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of people lost their
life savings. Fino, from the opposition Socialist Party, was
appointed head of the coalition national government for
reconciliation to restore order to the country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank Not to Intervene Depreciation of Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand is
not expected to intervene despite the depreciation of the baht
against the U.S. dollar to a 10-and-a-half-year low on Thursday,
according to a Bank of Thailand source today.
</P>
<P>
The official mid-rate was pegged at 26.10 baht to the U.S.
dollar on Thursday, the lowest since August 1989, two satang up
from 26.08 baht on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The baht was quoted in a range of 26.09-26.12 baht to the
dollar, with low volumes seen ahead of the five-day Thai new year
holiday, which begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Siri Ganjarerndee, assistant governor of the Bank of Thailand,
said speculators are waiting to attack the baht, but the central
bank is ready to maintain liquidity at an appropriated level.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand sets the value of the baht mid-rate daily
against a basket of currencies which includes the German mark and
the Japanese yen but is heavily weighted towards the dollar.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Thailand had pursued a stable exchange
rate policy, which kept the dollar at around 25 baht.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they believe the dollar would remain strong for
the foreseeable future as concern continued over Europe's moves
toward a single currency and Japan's economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Those predictions have many worried that the weak baht will
hurt Thai exports. Since an average of 43.7 percent of the content
of exported goods is imported. Weak baht means higher production
costs.
</P>
<P>
The recent dollar surge is attributable to the strong outlook
of the U.S. economy compared to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Due to the dollar surge, the baht appreciated against the yen
and German mark by 6.85 percent and 8.08 percent respectively. The
exchange rates on Thursday were fixed at 20.66 baht and 15.19 baht
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Nepali House Seeks Clarification on Indian Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A joint committee of Nepal's
parliament has demanded the government to clarify its stand on the
alleged Indian occupation of a far-western area in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the parliamentary panel Thursday also decided to
seek the government's stand on the status of the Detailed Project
Report (DPR) of a major Nepal-India joint water project on a
border river between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 6,420-megawatt multi-purpose Pancheshwar project is
centerpiece of a treaty between Nepal and India on the integrated
development of the Mahakali border river.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali parliament last September ratified the Mahakali
Treaty which was signed between the two countries on prime
ministerial level early last year in New Delhi, India.
</P>
<P>
However, some MPs had demanded the government to ask India to
remove its troops allegedly stationed in Nepal's Kalapani area,
near the source of the Mahakali river, as a precondition for the
ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The joint parliamentary committee, comprising representative of
all political parties in parliament, was formed to supervise the
execution of the Mahakali Treaty, which Nepali officials hailed as
a watershed in Nepal-India bilateral cooperation of water
resources development on equal terms.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani told the committee that
work to demarcate Nepal's western border with India is underway
after a meeting of survey officials of the two countries early
this year.
</P>
<P>
The committee has demanded Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand to appear before its next meeting on April 20 and clarify
the government's stand in regard to the Mahakali issue.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Declares War on Official Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Thursday vowed to fight official corruption, saying that he was
determined to bring the struggle against graft to an end.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined...I will bring this difficult struggle to an
end," Yeltsin said in a regular radio address.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is one of the main reasons that the authority of
the Russian state is low today. This is preventing us from
bringing order to the country and is threatening the security of
Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate graft, the whole state bureaucracy needed to be
reformed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged government leaders at all levels to "select personnel
meticulously and dismiss those failing to live up to the trust
bestowed on them."
</P>
<P>
The president, who signed an anti-corruption decree Tuesday,
said that government officials would soon have to declare their
income and property, and that of their families, as part of the
anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
In his radio address, he announced a deadline of November 1 for
the drafting of an code of ethics and service regulations for
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to abolish certain improper
preferential terms on taxation and tariffs, and would open up the
system of public procurement beginning May 1 this year, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, a
leading market reformer, who was appointed last month in a major
government shake-up, is to chair a meeting on Saturday to pin down
details of a decree aimed at ensuring that federal contracts are
filled by fair and open tender.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin signed a decree on Tuesday intended to reduce
corruption. "By this presidential decree...we are closing all the
main channels for abuse in this area," Economy Minister Yakov
Urinson said.
</P>
<P>
In a poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Foundation last
month, 41 percent of the 1,500 respondents said that the main task
facing the government is combatting corruption, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, Canada Sign MoU Amendment on Fisheries Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) --The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Canada today made an amendment to the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between them to enable their
on-going fisheries project to be extended to the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the ASEAN-Canada MoU, reached in July 1991 on
Fisheries Post-Harvest Technology Project (FPHTP) - Phase II, was
signed here by Canadian High Commissioner Andre S.Simard on behalf
of his government and Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi on behalf of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Today's signing was witnessed by all the ambassadors of the
ASEAN countries in Malaysia except Singapore and Thailand which
sent representatives instead.
</P>
<P>
The FPHTP, which began operations on April 1, 1992, was due to
end last month, but some of its on-going project will prolong
until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment ensures that the on-going projects will be
extended to December 31, this year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment also makes possible the inclusion of Vietnam, the
latest ASEAN member, as a participant of the project.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries project is to improve the quality of fish and
fish products and to strengthen fish inspection services within
the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
It also assists in the development and promotion of improved
technology in fish processing, preservation and packaging, and
helps enhance the transfer of appropriate technology to the fish
processing industry in the region.
</P>
<P>
Three regional centers were established under the FPHTP -- the
Regional Center for Fish Inspection and Quality Control in
Jakarta, the Regional Center for Fish Processing Technology in

<HEADLINE> Arab Diplomats Ask Brazil to Press Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors from 14 Arab
countries have asked the Brazilian government to press Israel for
stopping its construction of a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors gathered at a meeting to approve the request,
in which they considered the Middle East peace process as being
imperiled by Israel, sources close to the forum as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has started to build a Jewish settlement
in Har Homa, of the traditional Arab east section of Jerusalem,
where the Palestinians want to establish the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians have occurred ever
since Israel announced its housing plan in March.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian ambassador Musa Odeh noted that Palestinians now
live in a dangerous situation caused by Israel, because the peace
process is threatened.
</P>
<P>
"We have never lost the hope of the international community
using its forces to protect the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the moment for the Israeli government to respect the
peace agreements and United Nations resolutions," the diplomat
added.
</P>
<P>
However, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who is now
in Chile on a two-day visit, rejected today international pressure
on countries involved in the Middle East peace process, saying it
was an internal affair for those nations.
</P>
<P>
"Basically I believe that peace cannot be imposed from
outside. It must be decided within countries themselves," said
Peres after a meeting with Chilean Vice President Carlos Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
"The world must not press Israel. But at the same time I
believe that within my country we have to try all possibilities
for returning to the path of peace," said the Nobel Peace Prize
winner, who is expected to visit Brazil later.

<HEADLINE> Single Currency Inevitable in 1999: Austrian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The launching of the single
European currency, the Euro, as scheduled on January 1, 1999 is
inevitable, Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Klima said here today.
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting Hamburg mayor Henning Voscherau,
Klima said that the launching of Euro is of great importance to
maintain European competitiveness in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Any delay of the launch date will lead to the postponement of
the whole package of European integration for at least 10 years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French
President Jacques Chirac also stressed that any change in the
timetable for the launch of the Euro and the criteria for
membership of the single currency would not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, EU finance ministers and central bankers held an
informal meeting in the Netherlands, agreeing that the decision on
which countries join the single currency would be made in late
April and early May.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty sets out a list of convergence criteria
on budget deficits, debt, inflation, interest rates and exchange
rates, which EU member states must meet before they can join the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
But several EU countries are having trouble meeting some of the
 criteria, notably the budget deficits conditions.
</P>
<P>
Austrians, like people in many other EU countries, fear that
the change in government policies to meet the Maastricht Treaty
criteria may come at the expense of their present prosperity,
Klima said.
</P>
<P>
To quell these fears, Klima said the government will freeze
prizes for a certain period and lower service charges on
exchanging the Austrian schilling into the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Both Klima and Voscherau called for the harmonization of
employment and social policies within the 15-member bloc and for a
unified tax system.

<HEADLINE> Official: China Scores High in Rights Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official told a
United Nations panel here today that his country's government has
made untiring efforts to promote and protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangya, alternate representative of the Chinese
delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights, said the efforts
began with the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang noted, "the past seven years happened to be the
period in which the most outstanding achievements were recorded in
the field of human rights, with 1996 seeing the greatest progress."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, "China's national economy witnessed sustainable, rapid
and healthy growth and the living standards of the Chinese people
were further improved," he said to the commission's 53rd session.
</P>
<P>
With seven million Chinese now out from poverty during the
seven-year period, the official acknowledged, the number of poor
people in China has reduced to 58 million from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, "we have continued to focus on the
build-up of democracy and legal systems, with special efforts
devoted to promoting and protecting the rights of individuals."
</P>
<P>
New village committees were elected by direct suffrage in most
of China's provinces, autonomous regions and the municipalities
under direct administration of the central government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And in last March, the revisions of the Criminal Procedural
Law, which further specify the statutory principle for convictions
and levels of punishment, had a significant bearing on the
promotion and protection of the rights of individuals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, in refuting accusations by some Western countries against
China, said these undertakings by the Chinese government "are
known to all and no calumny or slander will serve to deny them."

States (OAS) will hold its annual assembly in the Peruvian capital
Lima in June to demonstrate its solidarity with the Peruvian
government in its attempts to end the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
OAS general secretary Cesar Gaviria made the announcement here
today after attending the Interamerican Tourism Congress.
</P>
<P>
Assuring his "unconditional support" to Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori in the 115-day crisis, Gaviria told the press
"whatever the circumstances are," the assembly will be held in
Lima as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Peruvian rebel Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement (MRTA) stormed the residence of the Japanese ambassador
in Lima on December 17, 1996, taking more than four hundred people
hostage, including many senior officials and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The MRTA is still holding 72 people hostage in return for the
release of 450 members of the movement from several prisons in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue between the MRTA and the Peruvian government has been
suspended for almost one month.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Upgrade Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province, a major manufacturing center in China, has intensified
efforts to upgrade its agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The province has made achievements in agricultural development
since the reform and opening up policy was initiated in
1979. Currently, the per capita production of grain in the
province reaches 400 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The per capita share of non-staple food, such as vegetables,
meat and egg, are also higher than country's average.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, with advanced techniques and a favorable geographic
position as a coastal province, has good conditions to upgrade its
agriculture, said the local government.
</P>
<P>
More funds, techniques, and personnel have entered rural
areas. Statistics show that some 500 million yuan of funds flow to
the animal husbandry sector in the province every year.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 firms integrating agriculture with industry and
trade have been set up.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to invest more than seven billion yuan in
some 100 firms engaging in farm product processing before
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A distribution network for agriculture products has also been
set up in the province.
</P>
<P>
The opening-up policy will help quicken the pace of
agricultural development, said the local government. The province
has used 1.1 billion US dollars in foreign funds, including 85
million dollars in loans from the World Bank, and introduced
advanced techniques and new varieties of crops.

official paper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, which began on Thursday, was jointly

Studies (MISIS) and the Hanns Seidel Foundation (HSF) of Singapore
in cooperation with Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Delegate: China Attentive to Cooperation in Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has attached great
importance to international cooperation in the field of human
rights, a senior Chinese delegate said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Wang Guangya said China "is sincere in its desire
for cooperation with the U.N. human rights bodies."
</P>
<P>
The country is "ready to make further efforts to broaden the
scope of cooperation," said Wang in his capacity as the alternate
representative of the Chinese delegation to the U.N. session.
</P>
<P>
"China has ratified or acceded to 17 international human rights
instruments and submitted implementation reports to the relevant
treaty bodies as required," he told the international gathering.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he noted, the Committee against Torture, the
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered China's reports.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along positively appraised the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, the representative acknowledged, has
decided to sign the latter before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
China has always supported the work of the U.N. commission's
thematic special rapporteurs and the working groups concerned, he
said, citing as an example Chairman of the Working Group on
Arbitrary Detention Louis Joinet's visit to China last July.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese official slammed some Western countries
for looking upon themselves as the judges at the U.N. commission
and the majority of developing countries as the accused.
</P>
<P>
"While they claim that their draft resolutions on the human
rights problems of other countries are aimed at the promotion of
human rights, they have never tabled any draft resolution on the
human rights problems in their own countries," Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"They willfully trampled on the norms of international
relations and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter,
blatantly spread lies and vicious slanders against sovereign
states, yet would not allow the developing countries to speak to
defend themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This practice of pursuing hegemonism and power politics, and
introducing double standards in the field of human rights are
running into the resistance of more and more countries," he
warned.

<HEADLINE> Canada Not to Limit Wheat Export to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada will not limit its wheat
exports to the United States despite the latter's concerns, Trade
Minister Art Eggleton said today.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any caps. We're following all rules under (the
North American Free Trade Agreement)," Eggleton was quoted as
saying a day after a visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"And I expect the United States to honor those," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the current crop year, Canada has shipped
760,000 metric tons of wheat to the United States, compared to
900,000 tons for the entire previous year.
</P>
<P>
This has led to the complaints by U.S. farmers that Canadian
wheat will flood their markets.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky voiced
the concern that her country should not become "a dumping ground
for Canada's industry overhang."
</P>
<P>
Canada's wheat shipment was reportedly one of the major topics
in talks between Eggleton and Barshefsky in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Although Canada has agreed to low-level meetings to address the
American concerns, Eggleton insisted that his country will not
accept any kind of cap or limit on wheat shipments.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to have meetings to try to provide more
information on this and convince them we are doing things the
right way," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994-1995 crop year, Canada was forced to accept a cap
of 1.5 million tons a year. The quota ended in September 1995.

<P>
TIANJIN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- State-owned firms witnessed a
rapid growth rate of 10.4 percent in the first quarter of this
year in Tianjin municipality, the largest industrial base in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The local statistics bureau reported that these firms completed
output added value of five billion yuan, and sales volume of 21.9
billion yuan, up 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributed the achievements to the reform
measures adopted in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the municipal government issued a series of
measures related to mergers, bankruptcy, setting up enterprise
groups, and easing firms' burden.
</P>
<P>
So far, 80 firms have reported bankruptcy or been merged, while
514 small businesses adopted the joint stock system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, backbone industries have been set up, including
electronics, chemicals, motor vehicle machinery, and
metallurgy. These industries made up 49.4 percent of property
assets of the total industries in the municipality at present,
said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The municipality also improved its cooperation with the central
and western parts of the country. At a trade fair held recently,
the municipality signed 1.7 billion yuan-worth contracts with
inland areas on cooperation projects and trade.

OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien today reaffirmed his country's support for the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri
here, Chretien also reiterated Canada's support for a United

</P>
<P>

<P>
"Canada and Lebanon share a mutual interest in creating a
stronger and more prosperous Lebanon and a commitment to the
pursuit of peace in the Middle East," Chretien said before
Al-Hariri's arrival.
</P>
<P>
"Canada looks forward to assisting Lebanon in its
reconstruction efforts... We believe that stimulating trade and
investment is the best way to contribute to rebuilding Lebanon's
infrastructure and to support the creation of jobs and growth in
our countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Secretary Tries to Slow Dollar's Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said today that he shared Japanese officials' concern about
the high-flying currency, apparently trying to slow the rising of
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka had called the
yen's drop against the U.S. dollar excessive.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka's statement triggered traders' concern that the Bank
of Japan was preparing to try to halt the dollar's ascent by
selling dollars in world currency markets.
</P>
<P>
"We share the concern expressed by the Japanese authorities...
about recent movements in the yen," Rubin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin balanced those remarks by saying that U.S.
government policy on the dollar is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"Over time, exchange rates generally reflect fundamentals, and
the fundamentals of the U.S. economy have been relatively strong
for the past four years," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals to which he alluded include brisk U.S.
economic growth and an increase in interest rates from the Federal
Reserve last month. That makes dollar-denominated securities a
more attractive investment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was trading at 125.65 yen in New York late
today, down from 126.77 the day before.
</P>
<P>
It was Rubin's second attempt this year to manage the dollar's
rapid rise in value. His first attempt to dampen the dollar's
fast increase came in February, just before a meeting in Berlin of
the Group of Seven, the world's seven richest industrial
countries.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Send Troops to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Romania is to send 400 soldiers
to Albania to take part in the 6,000-strong Italian-led
multinational protection troops sent to secure the safe transport
and distribution of aid in the crisis-hit Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was adopted today in a vote at a joint session of
the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, with 239 votes in favor,
62 against and 64 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The troops will be in Albania from April 14 to the end of
September. Some of Romania's advance troops were sent to Albania
on April 7, with the rest due to arrive by sea by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers from the ruling party supported the sending of
troops as it would help the country's bid to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
But other lawmakers argued that Romania should send aid but no
troops as no other eastern European country was sending military
forces.
</P>
<P>
The Romania troops are expected to be sent to the southern part
of Albania, the stronghold of the rebels who have been at the
forefront of the violent unrest which has gripped the country over
the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The troubles erupted after the failure of get-rich-quick
investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost their life
savings. The Albanian government has asked the international
community to send a multinational force to help restore order and
secure the distribution of humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> China Not to Raise Electricity Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has no
plan to raise electricity prices sharply in the foreseeable
future, a senior Chinese government official said here.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dazhen, minister of the Power Industry made this statement
in response to the assumption that the establishment of the China
National Electricity Corporation may trigger a round of
electricity price hikes.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, the founding of the state-owned company is
designed to support the construction of the Three Gorges Project
and promote the hookup of China's regional power grids.
</P>
<P>
"The move in the long run can help keep electricity prices
stable and even lower the prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
The price adjustment is under strict state control. The price
of electricity doubled in the past two decades, "far less than the
rise in the overall price index in the same period," he said.
</P>
<P>
A series of measures to be taken by the ministry can also be
considered "positive factors" to stablize the price in the future,
he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Fight promoter Bob Arum
doubted Mike Tyson's injury which caused postponement of his May 3
re-match with Evander Holyfield, according to reports from Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"I knew as soon as the fight was announced that it wasn't
happening on May 3," Arum, rival of Tyson promoter Don King, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was cut over his left eye while sparring in Florida last
month. The cut reopened when he was training in Las vegas last
week, forcing the postponement.
</P>
<P>
"He took a scratch and turned it into a means for
postponement," Arum was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arum said that Tyson wanted to postpone the moment of truth
against Holyfield for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say he's not going to win," Arum said. "But if
you're facing life or death, you want to prolong it as long as
possible."

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Ukrainian warships will take
part in a 12-day military exercise with the Russian Black Sea
Fleet starting April 15.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Ukraine has joined Russian maneuvers
since the two former Soviet Union republics started the division
of the disputed Black Sea Fleet (BSF) last April following five
years of negotiations which are still underway.
</P>
<P>
The wargames, involving more than 50 warships, will take place
in the Black Sea and will be directed by the Russian BSF Commander
Viktor Kravchenko.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian-Russian relations have become strained over the
division of the BSF and the status of Sevastopol, the main base of
the fleet on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Personal Spending in Beijing Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's capital have
increased their personal spending annually over the past few
years, according to a survey by the local statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the per capita personal spending in 1996
in this capital city reached 279 yuan, up 24 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Noting that improved living standards brought about increased
consumption, the survey found spending on articles for personal
use still constituted the bulk of Beijing residents' total
consumption. Statistics show the average Beijing resident spent
130 yuan buying articles for personal use in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Spending on jewelry and cosmetics increased by a large
margin. In 1996, per-capital spending on jewelry was 35 yuan, up
17 percent over the previous year and that on cosmetics was 38
yuan, up 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijingers also paid more for tourism, said the
survey. Per-capita tourism spending shot up 13 percent to 82 yuan
in 1996. The bureau predicted higher spending on tourism this
year, noting the year 1997 is designated as "Visit China '97."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Beijing residents are enjoying more services of
various kinds. Per capita spending in this respect, mainly haircut
and bath, rose by 23 percent to 25 yuan in 1996, according to
statistics.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- the Indonesian air force will

</P>
<P>
Speaking after a military ceremony marking the 51st anniversary

He declined to comment on how mach money would be spent buying
the simulator.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President, U.S. Defense Chief Meet in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
met visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen here today for
talks mainly on the situation in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The president said there could be no major improvement in
relations between the DPRK and the U.S. unless there is progress
in inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed on the need to maintain firm joint defense
readiness, the presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen reassured Kim that U.S. forces in the Pacific area
including those in South Korea would be unaffected by Washington's
review of the size of American forces overseas.
</P>
<P>
In separate talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo
Cheng-ha, Cohen said the U.S. has no intention of making any
changes to its current level of military commitment to the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The two men also agreed that the two countries should not allow
any rift in bilateral cooperation in dealing with issues related to
the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
According to South Korean news sources, Cohen did not take
issue with Seoul's bid to buy Russian-made missiles, but said he
was confident South Korea would buy U.S.-made patriot anti-air
missiles.
</P>
<P>
But before his arrival in Seoul, Cohen reportedly warned Seoul
of political repercussions if it bought Russian Sa-12 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit on the third
leg of his first Asia-Pacific trip since taking office in
January. He has already been to Honolulu and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Changes in Dalai Lama's Hometown (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Daincai, in Ping'an Country in
northwest China's Qinghai Province, is an ordinary village that
left its mark on history because of a three-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
In 1938, the young Lhamu Dundrub, a farmer's son, was affirmed
as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader
of Tibetan Buddism.
</P>
<P>
The child was later enthroned in the Potala Palace in Lhasa as
the 14th Dalai Lama, Dainzin Gyaco.
</P>
<P>
The rough trail the boy took from his village 2,800 meters
above sea level to follow this calling is now a road alive with
trucks and tractors. The Dalai Lama, who now lives in India, might
not know that an airport has been built 40 kilometers from
Daincai, and that his countrymen can travel easily to places as
far away as Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But the Buddhist stupas are still there in the village,
overlooking streams and trees, and birds still chirp and villagers
sing folk songs.
</P>
<P>
"The village used to be one of the poorest in Qinghai Province,
and even the Dalai himself was born in a poor farmer's family,"
said Nyu Soinam, head of the village. "But now you can see for
yourself."
</P>
<P>
Several tractors, dubbed "mobile markets," carrying rice and
vegetables, are parked along the roadside and business is brisk.
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem having food and clothing," said Cailhang,
60. "But in the past, we did not even have Qingke to eat," he
said, referring to the highland barley, a staple foodstuff for
Tibetans.

<P>
The village has a population of 250, with 30 Tibetan families,
and 20 households of Han people.
</P>
<P>
The oldest villager is 87-year-old Lhamoico, who is healthy,
happy and hospitable. "Life in the village is now really good. All
of my sons and grandsons are very kind to me. Why should not I
live to be 100 years old?" asked the smiling old lady.
</P>
<P>
Daily work in the village involves farming and raising
cattle. People also gather medicinal herbs and transport goods
during the slack farming season.
</P>
<P>
Ping'an is a small county, with only 107,000 people. In 1996,
farmers' average annual per capita income was 682 yuan (80 US
dollars), more than ten times that of 20 years ago when China
initiated the policy of the reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
"A question that comes to my mind quite often is how to raise
money to set up a cattle farm that will make everyone
prosperous," said Nyu Soinam.
</P>
<P>
But, schooling is just as important as building farms, and the
biggest yard in Daincai is occupied by a primary school on land
previously belonging to the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of promoting education, which is the most
important thing we care about," noted Zhaxi Dongzhub, 50,
headmaster of the school and a nephew of the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"Villagers under the age of 50 can read and write and everyone
of schooling age is at school. Some of my students have become
university students, secondary technical schools, government
officials and technicians," he said.

In 1994, a school was set up to teach the Tibetan and Han
languages simultaneously. Forty students were enrolled.
</P>
<P>
"A first-grade student, Han or Tibetan, can become familiar
with 500 Tibetan words in half a year, and can understand what I
say in the classroom," said Nyu Zholma, 27, a Tibetan language
teacher. "This form of education is marvelous. I promise to teach
the students well so that they love their hometown and motherland
from their childhood."
</P>
<P>
Tibetans and Hans live in harmony, the result not only of
bilingual education but also because of daily cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Xue Yousan, a Han, is a widow and is also handicapped. Raising
two children meant difficulties for her, so 49 other families in
her village agreed to grow grain crops for her, and provide her
with 500 kilograms of grain every year.
</P>
<P>
"We always aid each other, since the Han and Tibetans belong to
one family," said Nyu Soinam.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans do not eat horse, donkey, dog, or mule meat, a
favorite of many Han. So, out of respect for Tibetan customs, Han
villagers no longer eat the meat of these animals.
</P>
<P>
The Han and the Tibetans, who both believe in Buddhism, hold
religious ceremonies together, Soinam noted.

A private temple, called Xatsong and used by the Dalai Lama,
has also been renovated by the government and has been designated
as an important historical site. The temple's former abbot was
Daincai, the Dalai Lama's elder brother.
</P>
<P>
Xatsong Temple is honored because Tsong Kha-pa, founder of the
Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism and master of both the first Dalai
and the first Panchen, practiced Buddhism there.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great opportunity for me to learn Buddhism in such a
place," said a 21-year-old lama, Gentoin Gyainke. The temple now
has four lamas.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ruizhi, vice-chairman of the Ping'an County Committee of the
People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the
government will install a satellite ground station in Daincai to
receive TV programs and further improve transportation conditions
there this year.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the Dalai Lama should pay closer attention to
his countrymen's wishes.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama's attempts to split the nation and create an
independent Tibet will only make our enemies happy, but will make
his countrymen sad. We will certainly foil his attempt," he said.

"The Dalai Lama is now over 60. How many 60-year cycles can
there be in a man's life? As a religious leader, he should pray

<HEADLINE> Changes in Dalai Lama's Hometown (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Binlin is another village, the home of the Dalai Lama's sister,
which is famous for its spring water, which is said to contain
minerals with curative effects.
</P>
<P>
The Han and Tibetans have built two convalescent hospitals,
profiting from the springs, and are planning to open a mineral
water company.
</P>
<P>
In spite of sweeping changes that have taken place in the Dalai
Lama's hometown, Tibetan traditions and religion have been
preserved. In valleys outside the village, eight stacks of stones
still stand, which are believed by villagers to have magic powers
that can prevent storms from damaging farmland and houses.
</P>
<P>
Villagers continue to hold a hill sacred, where they hold
religious ceremonies for the God of the Mountains.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the central government allocated 350,000 yuan (40,000
US dollars) to repair the Dalai Lama's former residence. The home
is now managed by the family of Chi Losai, the Dalai Lama's
cousin. She visited him in India three times and showed him the
photos of his home.
</P>
<P>
Chi was a member of the People's Political Consultative
Conference of Qinghai Province, but died of a stroke in
1994. Zhaxi Dongzhub, her son, said, "My mother's greatest wish
was that the Dalai Lama would one day come back to the motherland
and have a family reunion in his hometown."

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Makes a Drive for Technological Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a traditional heavy
industrial base in northeast China, will revitalize its
state-owned firms by launching a technological transformation
drive.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to help state-owned enterprises to adapt to a
market-oriented economy and build a modern enterprise system by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Guo Tingbiao, vice governor of Liaoning, called on the 30,000
state-owned firms in Liaoning to develop new products and put them
into production.
</P>
<P>
Petro-chemistry, metallurgy, machinery, and electronics have
been listed as key sectors to promote technological upgrade in the
four years up to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will carry out experiments in 100
designated state-owned industrial enterprises, pay attention to
the development of 200 key new products, build 40 provincial level
technical centers, and accelerate the use of new inventions.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province will develop 6,500 new products, 4,500
of which should go into mass production. Some 450 new projects
will reach the level of developed countries and 1,800 other will
be up to advanced level in China. The annual output value
generated from new products are expected to hit 25 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises in Liaoning make up one tenth of the
total large and medium-sized state firms in China. However, they
lag behind other industrial centers in development because of
their inefficient management system in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The only way to rid the state-owned enterprises of the current
awkward dilemma is to build a mechanism which helps to promote
technological progress in enterprises, said Li Yingpeng, an
official with the provincial commission of economic cooperation
and trade.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Enjoy Privilege in Shenyang City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior citizens of northeast
China's Shenyang City now can pay less for going to park, public
toilet, hospital, theater and museum than before since the city
gave them privileges.
</P>
<P>
Every resident older than 70 in this capital city of Liaoning
Province have got a privilege card since April 1, which allowed
them to go to parks and public toilets free of charge, according
to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The card holders can also see the doctor without paying
registration fee, pay little for bus fare and enjoy a 50 percent
discount on admission to theaters and museums, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to lower annual expenses of card
holders, more than 160,000 in the city, by more than 1,000 yuan
(120 US dollars), the newspaper quoted a spokesman of the city's
Commission for the Aged as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the elderly in this old industry city are
retired blue-collar workers, and for them, even paying the average
one yuan park admission every day adds up to too much, it said.
</P>
<P>
Like elderly in other Chinese cities, most of senior citizens
in Shenyang are frequent visitors to parks, where they can stroll,
do physical exercises or chat with friends.
</P>
<P>
And they often have to go to hospital since two-thirds of them
suffer from various illnesses.
</P>
<P>
"Easy access to doctor, thanks to the free registration, will
help them receive treatment," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the city government is planning to extend the
privileges to those between 65 to 70 years of age in the next
years, who account for about 10 percent of the city's 6.7-million
population.

<HEADLINE> War Tunnels Turned to Tourist Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Tunnels built by villagers
in north China to fight the Japanese during the Second World War
have been opened to overseas tourists after renovation.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are offered to make a trip along the 2,000
kilometer-long tunnels which are part of an underground network
where people of Ranzhuang Village resisted the enemy's occupation.
</P>
<P>
The network, by linking every household up, ensured flexible
manoeuvres for the villagers' attack, defense, and retreat.
</P>
<P>
Located about 200 kilometers south of Beijing, the site has
long been used as an example to educate Chinese to remember that
bitter history. In 1996, 2.64 million yuan(318,070 US dollars)
were earmarked by the local governments to improve the attraction.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the exhibition hall has been enlarged, 400 meters
of tunnels renovated, and demonstration places employing modern
sound and light effects were added to reflect the vividness of the
past war.

PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Paris St Germain of France
overpowered Liverpool of England 3-0 in their first leg semi-final
of European Cup Winners' Cup soccer tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Parisians, bidding to become the first team to retain

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (15-16) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (15-16)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Why will the central government station troops in
Hong Kong after 1997? Who will pay military expenses?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The stationing of Chinese troops in Hong Kong after
1997 represents Chinese sovereignty over the region. It is also
out of the need to safeguard Hong Kong's social stability.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping once said: "What represents China's exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong apart from the stationing (Chinese)
troops? The stationing of troops in Hong Kong has another role: to
prevent turmoil. Those Who intend to create turmoil will think
twice if they know there are Chinese troops in Hong Kong. Even if
turmoil does occur, it can be solved promptly."
</P>
<P>
Chinese troops will be responsible for the defence of Hong Kong
and will not interfere in local affairs. The Hong Kong SAR
government will be responsible for the maintenance of public order
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government may, when necessary, ask the
central government for assistance from the garrison in the
maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
In addition to abiding by national laws, members of the
garrison should by laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, expenditure of British troops in Hong Kong has
been borne by Hong Kong people. After 1997 Hong Kong people will
not pay any military expenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, expenditure of Chinese troops
stationed in Hong Kong will be borne by the central
government. This is a special privilege granted to Hong Kong
residents by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Question: Why will six national laws be applied in the Hong
Kong SAR when a policy of "one country, two systems" will be
implemented with regard to the region? Will other laws that are in
force in the mainland be enforced in Hong Kong apart from
provisions of the Basic Law?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After 1997, the central government will implement a
policy of "one country, two systems" for Hong Kong. In defining
principles for the applicability of national laws in Hong Kong,
therefore, both the concept of "one country" and the concept of
"two systems" should be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
In other words, laws in Hong Kong must ensure both national
unity and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thus it is incorrect to say that all national laws are either
applicable or inapplicable in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong after 1997 will be a local administrative
region enjoying a high degree of autonomy, most laws that are in
force in the mainland such as civil law, criminal law, law of
civil proceedings and law of criminal proceedings will not be
applicable in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, however, some national laws, such as those
regarding national defence and foreign affairs, will be applicable
in the region since national defence and foreign affairs are
matters that represent the exercise of sovereignty. Laws regarding
these fields need to be enacted sometimes for enforcement
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Some national laws do not concern national defence and foreign
affairs, but their nature requires that they be applied throughout
the country. According to the Basic Law, such laws are outside the
autonomous powers of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the enforecement of national laws in Hong Kong,
dispel the misgivings of some people in Hong Kong, and prevent
improper interference in the independent legislative power of the
Hong Kong SAR by the central authorities, the Basic Law lists six
national laws in its Annex III that will be applied in Hong Kong
with effect from July 1, 1997 by way of promulgation or
legislation by the Hong Kong SAR. They are:
</P>
<P>
1. Resolution on the Capital, Calendar, National Anthem and
National Flag of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
2. Resolution on the National Day of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
3. Order on the National Emblem of the People's Republic of
China Proclaimed by the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Attached: Design of the national emblem, notes of explanation
and instructions for use.
</P>
<P>
4. Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of
China on the Territorial Sea.
</P>
<P>
5. Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
6. Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning
Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities.
</P>
<P>
National laws not listed in Annex III to the Basic Law will not
be applied in the Hong Kong SAR. The NPC Standing Committee may
add to or delete the laws in Annex III after consulting its
subordinate Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR and
the government of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Laws listed in Annex III will be confined to those relating to
defence, foreign affairs and other matters outside the autonomous
power of the Hong Kong SAR as specified by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In the event of the NPC Standing Committee decides to declare a
state of war or it declares a state of emergency in the Hong Kong
SAR by reason of turmoil there that endangers national unity or
security and that is beyond the control of the regional
government, the central government may issue an order applying
relevant national laws in the Hong Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> South China Stock Exchange To Increase B-Share Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one
of China's two bourses, is taking steps to promote trading in
b-shares to attract more foreign funds, according to a senior
government official.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yingchun, deputy secretary-general of the Shenzhen City
government, said that a new information system will be introduced
to help overseas investors keep abreast of the latest situation in
the B-share market and new means will be adopted to expand the
market.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after a month-long B-share promotion tour in
Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States and the
Britain Chen and officials from the Securities Regulatory Office,
the bourse, and several Chinese securities dealers.
</P>
<P>
The delegation held talks with a large number overseas
investors and collected opinions and ideas.In future, Chen said,
the city government will sponsor a similar tour once a year. The
Asia-Pacific regions will be the prime target, with the European
and American market coming next.
</P>
<P>
The bourse will set up its own media system in Hong Kong to
provide accurate information for overseas investors, and new
measures will be taken to help Chinese enterprises, which have
issued b-shares, h-shares or red-chip stocks, enter the
international capital market via Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
A move will be made to get B-shares listed on overseas
exchanges. They are now only listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai
exchanges. The two exchanges trade in A-shares, designed for
Chinese investors only, and B-shares designed for investors of
foreign nationals only.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three B-share companies are listed on the Shenzhen
exchange, with 5.292 billion shares and a capitalization of about
37 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said today Africa needs to cultivate fresh avenues for growth
after years of colonial subjugations, the Kenya News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at the second summit of the heads
of state and government of the Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA) in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that Africa should aggressively seek regional
integration as "a viable mechanism" to being an active
participant in the global market place.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that east and southern African region has
already made good progress in the field of tariff reduction,
removal of non-tariff barriers and trade information network.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader urged member states to comply with the
tariff reduction time table to zero tariff rate by the year of
2000 so as to pave the way for the establishment of the common
external tariff by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that Kenya has eliminated most of the
non-tariff barriers to intra-COMESA trade and implemented
harmonized road user charges, road customs transit declaration
document and the road fund.
</P>
<P>
In the field of monetary, financial and technical cooperation,
Kenya supports efforts for the establishment of the metallurgical
technology center, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moi warned that natural calamities such as famine, civil wars
and poor terms of trade have made Africa's future prospects look
even more bleak.
</P>
<P>
After returning here from Lusaka today, President Moi stated
that without unity African countries risk lagging behind in
development.

<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
has claimed responsibility for a shooting attack which seriously
wounded a policewoman in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, according
to a BBC television report this evening.
</P>
<P>
The woman police officer was on duty close to the building in
Bishop Street when she was hit by a gunman from a passing car this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was wounded in the chest, is said to be in a
serious but stable condition after being immediately rushed to a
hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
A leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said that
the Londonderry shooting was a "matter of regret", underlining the
need for a credible peace process.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring is reported as saying in
Dublin this evening that the attack had taken Sinn Fein "outside
the political process" of the all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland.

It made it hard to accept the bona fides of those in Sinn Fein
who said they wanted peace, he added.

<P>
BONN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker Volkswagen (VW)
today reported an increase of 9.5 percent in its sales in the
first quarter of this year, following last year's strong results,
said reports reaching here.
</P>

with net profit reaching 678 million marks (399 million US
dollars), more than doubling the 1995 result of 336 million marks.
</P>
<P>
"Demand for nearly all our models is currently running at a
high level," said VW chairman Ferdinand Piech at a press
conference on the company's 1996 performance.
</P>
<P>
According to Piech, sales growth through March was strongest in
Eastern Europe, with 27.9 percent, followed closely by the
Asia-Pacific region with 26.5 percent. The figure was 17.9 percent
in South America and Africa, 15.2 percent in North America and 2.5
percent in Western Europe, which was the chief market.
</P>
<P>
VW sales at domestic market declined by 4.9 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that VW sold in the first quarter of this year
about 234,000 units of VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda cars.
</P>
<P>
Piech said that VW's medium-class "Passat" limousine which was

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government and the
tourism sector will do their utmost to promote the island's
competitiveness as an eastern Mediterranean tourist hot-spot,
according to the participants of a hoteliers' meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
At the Cyprus Hotel Association's Annual General Meeting here,
the hoteliers called for implementing measures aimed at
attracting a wider spectrum of tourists.
</P>
<P>
In response to the hoteliers' call, Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said that his government has done a lot of work to
attract more tourists, including the construction of three new
marinas and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kikis Constantinou, the association's
president, proposed a three-year action plan to revive the
island's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Constantinou noted that the island's tourism can be boosted by
cutting tourist package prices by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO) President
Antonis Andronikou told hoteliers at the meeting that Cyprus is
emphasising the new forms of tourism, such as cultural, athletic,
convention and agro-tourism.

marketing campaign in traditional markets to promote Cyprus as a
vacation Mecca, and it is also finding its way into new markets
such as Poland, Hungary, Switzerland and the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
"According to the messages we have received from markets
abroad, the numbers of reservations in Cyprus during the Summer
period are increasing," the CTO official said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' economy heavily relies on the tourism sector, which can
earn about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars from over two million
tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The ambassadors of the United
States, Belgium, France, Germany and the representative of the
European Union met today with Zaire's new prime minister, General
Likulia Bolongo in Kinshasa, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted
official sources in the Zairian capital as saying.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the gesture by the ambassadors indicated their de
facto recognition of the new prime minister, who was nominated by
President Mobutu Sese Seko to replace Etienne Tshisekedi on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States ambassador Daniel Simpson reportedly said
that he does not think Mobutu should be the only one held
responsible for the present situation of Zaire, and said that
"Zaire simply needs a change."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Belgium have publicly called for the
resignation of Mobutu, but they also fall short of expressing
support to the rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said today that Belgium
considers "the page of Mobutism has been definitely turned for a
long time," and accused the Kinshasa government of being "a
military dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
The United States said on Wednesday that Mobutu "is on the
point of becoming a creature of history."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Zairian prime minister said that the Zairian
government does not take seriously the call by some Western
countries for the departure of Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
France today called on the warring parties of Zaire to stay
loyal to their commitment to the holding of legislative elections
scheduled for May.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, incoming chairman of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), today urged the regional body to meet
the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day COMESA summit, at which he was elected as new
COMESA chairman, Chiluba said the 21st century will be a period
of intense globalization and competition and only those countries
and regions which take the challenges and opportunities head-on
will be winners.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a century which imposes harsh penalties on
countries and regions that fail to merge their economic space
across national frontiers," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Regional integration in essence involves the redrawing of the
economic map of the world, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"We in the developing countries must turn this era into an
opportunity for integration and development," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called for implementation of the programs and
decisions worked out by COMESA, saying that a truly efficient
functioning common market will not take place until and unless
the member countries are bold enough to take and implement the
collective decisions.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Chiluba called for accelerated tariff
reductions, trade liberalization and strengthening existing
COMESA institutions.

PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) party today protested Belgium's decision to
ban a demonstration of silence scheduled by FIS supporters for
Saturday in Brussels to protest the violence in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn-based FIS executive instance in exile told Agence

Belgium, after it had "asked for authorization of a manifestation
which was agreed upon earlier by the competent authorities" of
Belgium.

Belgium said that the demonstration could harm public security

From 60,000 to 80,000 people are estimated to have been killed

<HEADLINE> Albright: Mideast in "Unpredictable and Dangerous" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Thursday that there is an "unpredictable and
dangerous" situation in the Middle East, which she attributed to
both Israel and the Palestinians, ignoring the real cause of the
recent crisis erupting in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the American Society of Newspapers Editors,
Albright said: "Today, in the Middle East, we face an
unpredictable and dangerous situation caused by deterioration in
the Arab-Israeli negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East situation has been deteriorated as the Israeli
government decided last month to build a Jewish neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem and moved bulldozers into the
area for the housing construction on March 18.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, in protest against Israel's violation of peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, went to street and
clashed with Israeli soldiers. On Tuesday, a Jewish settler shot
dead an Arab, which ignited fierce street battles in which
Israeli soldiers shot dead two more Palestinians and would about
100 of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
In what was called an unbiased attitude, Albright said the
negotiating peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians has
been disrupted because both sides have lost confidence in one
another: the Israelis began to lose confidence in the Palestinian
commitment to prevent terror and violence, and the Palestinians
saw Israeli decision of housing construction as pre-empting move
reserved for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The reason is that Arabs and Israelis alike have begun to lose
faith in one another. The Oslo process and the working partnership
between Israelis and Palestinians have broken down," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Both must assume responsibility for reversing the
deterioration in the negotiating environment," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks came as a Palestinian delegation arrived in
Washington for talks with U.S officials on how to reviving the
moribund peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright was to meet later with top Palestinian negotiators
Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas. The two men made no statement as
they arrived at the State Department for preliminary talks with
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. Justice
Department official Thursday expressed disappointment in a court
ruling upholding California's ban on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a judge's order that blocked prompt enforcement of
California's ban -- Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote for the court that the U.S.
Constitution "barely permits" preferential programs and that
Proposition 209 is a neutral law that violates no one's right to
equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department had argued in a friend-of-the-court
brief that the voter-approved ban would violate the equal
protection clause of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of law, the Justice Department is disappointed
with the contrary ruling of the three-judge court," acting Deputy
Attorney General Seth Waxman told a news conference. Waxman was
filling in for Attorney General Janet Reno, who was out of town.
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit ruling does not take effect for 21 days, a
period automatically extended when proposition opponents gave a
preliminary indication that they plan to request a rehearing by
the full 11-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who opposed Proposition 209 during
the campaign and in court, said Tuesday that "we'll all have to
regroup and find new ways to achieve the same objective" if the
measure is upheld.
</P>
<P>
Proposition 209, approved by 54 percent of California voters
last November, amends the state's Constitution to forbid racial
and gender preferences in state and local government employment,
contracting and education.
</P>
<P>
The measure's scope is sharply disputed, but it would eliminate
a variety of programs, including hiring goals for minorities and
women in state employment and consideration of race in public
college admissions.

LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
said today it is trade and investment, rather than aid, which
produce the dynamic effects that sustain economic growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address at the Common Market for Eastern and

implementation of trade promotion and development is a catalyst

"The other sectoral programs are designed to support the

explained.
</P>
<P>
He said events in the international trading system show
clearly that countries can only succeed through regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
"We must move fast to expand our economy through regional
integration in order to withstand the challenges of the new
international economic order," said the Malawian president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the huge debts affect African economic
development as foreign debts of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole
increased to 221 billion U.S. Dollars in 1994 from 101 billion
Dollars in 1980.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
a 12 million U.S. dollar credit to Tajikistan to help finance a
pilot poverty alleviation project.
</P>
<P>
The project, financed by the credit from the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional
lending arm, will back the government's efforts to restore
economic and social stability. The project will revive local
economic activity and enhance community-based social
infrastructure and service.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be used for expanding existing poverty
alleviation programs, such as the Shelter and Housing
Rehabilitation Program, the Micro-Credit Program, the Program of
Support to Female-headed Households and Agricultural Reform
Program, which all are aimed to improve the quality of life for
the poorest segments of the country's population. A part of the
credit will be provided for Tajikistan Social Investment Fund to
channel new funds to many poor communities.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is some 12.7 million dollars. In
addition to the IDA credit, the Government of Tajikistan will also
contribute 0.7 million dollars for the project.

<HEADLINE> Catalyzing Regional Integration Urged by Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 10 (Xinhua)-- Ugandan Minister for Information
Ruhakana Rugunda today called on public relations officers in the
east and central Africa regions to Catalyze the process of
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the public relations convention for
east and central africa regions here, Rugunda said that the
process can only be catalyzed by way of forging cooperation of
the institutions they represent on a region level.
</P>
<P>
He said paying lip service to the cooperation should be
substituted with concrete actions to benefit all peoples of east
and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the theme of the convention which is "image
building for Africa", Rugunda said there is no better way of
building the image of Africa than discarding practices such as
disrespect of the rule of law, state inspired insecurity, and
undemocratic methods of work which had hitherto tarnished the
image of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Rugunda told the convention that the Ugandan government has on
its part halted these negative trends in Uganda and has embraced
the national system of governance on constitutionalism.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the starting point for building Africa's
image is to have the right political leadership and to evolve
democratic systems of governance that respect human rights and
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Rugunda added that a popularly mandated leadership that is
accountable to the people would have the moral authority to
supervise and enforce clean leadership through the sub-systems of
national governance.
</P>
<P>
He called on public relations associations in the region to
form cooperation units on a regional and continental level to
evolve effective linkages which would be used to coordinate the
public relations efforts.
</P>
<P>
The minister welcomed the formation of the Federation of
African Public Relations' Association (PAPRA) and advocated for
setting up a public relations body for the COMESA at regional and
for the east African countries on a sub-regional level.
</P>
<P>
The convention, organized bys the Public Relations and
Marketing Consultancy (PRMC) in conjunction with Federation of
African PAPRA and Venny Communications, is attended by public
relations officers from different institutions and agencies from
Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Irish National Airliner Instructed to Find Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Aer Lingus, the Irish national
airline, has been instructed by the Irish government to find a
strategic partner by the end of this year, according to press
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Alan Dukes, the Irish minister for transport, energy and
communications, said on Wednesday that he had told Aer Lingus
board to "explore the possibilities of entering into a major
strategic alliance with or without the transfer of equity by the
year-end."
</P>
<P>
However, Aer Lingus chairman Bernie Cahill urged a more
cautious approach by saying that the airline should only embark on
similar alliance discussions "from a position of strength."
</P>
<P>
The company more than doubled pre-tax profits last year from
17.8 million Irish pounds (about 28 million U.S. dollars) to 40.9
million Irish pounds (about 66 million dollars) after an emergency
government rescue, which returned it to the black in 1995 for the
first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
Cahill stressed that such good results had been achieved during
a peak of activity in international aviation, which was probably
at the top of its trade cycle.
</P>
<P>
The Irish national air carrier is planning to increase
transatlantic capacity by 16 percent this year through an
additional Airbus A330 and a Lockheed TriStar.

<HEADLINE> EU Council of Ministers Expresses Confidence in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Council of
Ministers is confident in the future of Hongkong and believes that
the close cooperation between the United Kingdom and China will
guarantee the smooth transfer of the territory, a senior Dutch
official said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Michiel Patun, state secretary for foreign affairs of the
Netherlands, which holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union (EU), made the remark Wednesday to the European Parliament
in Strasbourg of France on behalf of the European Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hongkong to China is a big event, he said, adding
that what has happened to the territory will influence its trade
partners, including EU member nations, whose trade volume with
Hongkong reached 42.8 billion ECUs (some 55.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Hongkong was not only a door to China, but
also a commercial and financial transfer station for the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the future of Hongkong would also decide the
fate of its six million population, who has been promised to
maintain their present mode of life over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Patun held out hope that the two parties concerned, the United
Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, would continue to have
deepened consultations with each other in order to have a smooth
turnover of Hongkong's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
A number of issues have been resolved through the negotiations,
like the continuity of the high-level administration. The Council
of Ministers expressed the hope that all the talks still going on
would be well concluded in the remaining four months.
</P>
<P>
A certain number of events, which were important to the future
of Hongkong, took place in the past several months, Patun said,
noting that one of them was that in December 1996, China
designated a provisional assembly to replace the Legislative
Council from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers hopes that this provisional assembly
will not have a negative impact on either the smooth transfer of
the territory or its future development. It believes that a
legislative council chosen on the basis of the clauses of the
Fundamental Law will replace the provisional assembly after the
transfer as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Patun congratulated Mr. Tung Chee-hwa on his nomination as the
first chief executive of Hongkong, saying that his nomination had
clearly clarified one of the elements of uncertainty concerning
the transfer of Hongkong to China.
</P>
<P>
The choice made by Tung of the high-ranking officials and
members of the Executive Council has reflected his determination
to maintain the continuity of the high-ranking administration as
the the best as he could, on which the Council of Ministers also
congratulated him.
</P>
<P>
The passing of China's leader Deng Xiaoping, the architect of
the "one country, two systems" pattern, will not change China's
policies towards Hongkong, the Dutch official said on behalf of
the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Patun said that it should be believed that the Chinese
government was determined to put its "one country, two systems"
principle into concrete form after July 1, adding that there was
no denying that the Chinese government also hoped that Hongkong
would have a stable and prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that at the EU's Dublin Summit in 1996, the EU
expressed its concern about the future peace and prosperity of the
Hongkong Special Administrative Region within the sovereignty of
the People's Republic of China and it pledged to do all it can to
contribute to the smooth turnover of Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
The EU would continue to maintain its relations with the
Special Administrative Region of Hongkong within the framework of
the World Trade Organization and other organizations where
Hongkong had an autonomous role according to the Fundamental Law,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers has asked the European Commission, the
EU's executive body, to make proposals in the year of 1997 as to
the best way of ensuring a close economic cooperation with
Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
Patun emphasized that the full implementation of the Joint
Declaration was the best guarantee that Hongkong would remain a
prosperous place and its people could continue to live as they
used to.
</P>
<P>
That was why the Council of Ministers had been paying attention
to the implementation of the clauses of the declaration, a
demanding international convention concluded between the United
Kingdom and China, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He noted that several elements had been put in place to ensure
the continuing success of Hongkong, the economy was doing well and
people in Hongkong had confidence in their future.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was inevitable that in the several months to
come, there would be anxiety and worry, which he labeled as
something natural during a transitional period.
</P>
<P>
What was remarkable was that it was always people outside
Hongkong who were worried the most, on the contrary, people in
Hongkong seemed optimistic about their future, Patun noted.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Patun said the Council of Ministers was
confident in Hongkong's future and it expressed the support in
Dublin for a close cooperation with Hongkong in the future.

<P>
Ganzouri said the money could come from a rise of petroleum and
gas revenue with 46 new discoveries made in 1996-97, the export of
surplus electric power, money from iron ore discovered in the
south with expected annual production of 305 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The solution might also be the planned speedy implementation of
a wide-range economic reform program, including the privatization
of more than 300 state-owned firms to encourage more profitable
business and high economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But opposition politicians, calling the ambitious plan a dream
that needs further study, said they will prepare a document of
their own for the government's evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Serageddin, spokesman of the Wafd Party, said the plan
is "all dreams" and called for more realistic and thorough
studies on the subject.
</P>
<P>
He even offered Wafd's recipe that "will cost one tenths of
what will be spent on the government project," and are "easier and
more realistic alternatives."
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Kamel Murad, leader of the Liberal Party, criticized
the government for being "dreamy" when making such gorgeous
promise.
</P>
<P>
"It sounded good but is is impossible to achieve. Moreover,
where will this 100 billion come from every year? The figure is
totally illogical," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Shukri, leader of the Labor Party, sounded more upbeat,
saying that the government has confidence in its ability because
it has improved the national infrastructure, including the sewage
system, electricity and telephone, in a short period.
</P>
<P>
"Every new project that has a bearing in a nation's future
starts with an idea that seems out of reach, but experience shows
that many of our dreams did come true," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's economic reforms have already scaled down inflation to
7 percent from 20 percent in 1991 and raised foreign currency
reserves to a healthy 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with a basket of monetary reforms, Egypt's burgeoning
stock market grew rapidly and became a most attractive and liquid
emerging market in the region, drawing 400 million dollars in
foreign investments in the second half of 1996.

<HEADLINE> US to Test Experimental Consumer Price Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department will
begin publishing an experimental price gauge on April 22 aimed at
correcting one of the bias problems highlighted in the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) in the country.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the decision today, the department's Bureau of
Labor Statistics estimated that the experimental index could
reduce the CPI by as much as 0.25 percentage point annually.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the agency said that any decision on replacing
the current CPI with the new measurement would not be made until
the end of this year and would not go into effect until January
1999.
</P>
<P>
A panel of prominent U.S. economists headed by Michael Boskin
of Stanford University released a report last December saying the
current CPI was overstating inflation by 1.1 percentage point
annually.
</P>
<P>
Lowering the CPI by that amount would mean less of an increase
in pension benefits for the Americans and more taxes paid. Over 12
years, these changes would translate into 1 trillion dollars in
budget savings, the panel estimated.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Department officials said they would monitor price
changes in the experimental CPI until the end of the year and then
decide what types of categories would be appropriate for use of
the new averaging process and which should be unchanged.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 9,108 categories of products and services
for which prices are obtained each month in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPI is used to make annual cost-of-living adjustments for
Social Security and other retirement programs and to adjust the
income tax to remove the impact of inflation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Proposes Procurement Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is considering
to launch far-reaching reforms in public sector procurement,
including the dismantling of the State Tender Board, said a
source today.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a government green paper in Pretoria, Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel said government institutions should be
allowed to handle their own procurement according to national
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Manuel said a procurement compliance office
should replace the present state and provincial tender boards to
issue such directives and ensure they are adhered to by
government departments and provinces.
</P>
<P>
At present there are one national state tender board, nine
provincial boards, and more than 500 municipalities with their
tender committees.
</P>
<P>
The green paper on public sector procurement reform in South
Africa was a joint initiative by the ministries of finance and
public Works, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The main themes of the document are stricter financial control
over procurement and the attainment of certain socio-economic
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe said that
affirmative procurement to give small, medium and
micro-enterprises greater access to state tenders was one of the
several new concepts presented in the document.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates our government's commitment to achieve a wide
range of socio-economic objectives through public sector
procurement," said Radebe.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Act Toward Better Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police are to carry
out a nation-wide review of its personnel, equipment and assets
as part of the efforts to keep it in a better shape for future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) hinted in a report
today that the review might be a prelude of massive
rehabilitation of police facilities by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
In a connected development, the police also announced that it
will soon start a nation-wide recruitment of doctors, engineers,
computer analysts and programmers and other specialists to man
its expanding operations.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the police may soon lift the ban on the
recruitment of rank and file imposed four years ago, as police
commands in many states have complained of shortage of hands.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) is expected to respond next week to a
U.S.-South Korea proposal for four-party talks, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope it's going to be positive although they have not
indicated to us as far as I know what their essential response
will be," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK will give the answer to the proposal during a meeting
with American and South Korean officials in New York next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting will be U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State Charles Kartman, DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye
Gwan and South Korean Assistant Foreign Minister Song Young-shik.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and DPRK officials will hold a separate meeting
afterward on such issues as missile proliferation and proposals to
establish diplomatic offices in each other's capitals.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean
President Kim Young-sam proposed direct peace talks between the
two Koreas with the United States and China to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Last month, DPRK officials met with U.S. and South Korean
officials in New York to get detailed information about the
proposal.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Doubles Input in Nigerian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has decided to inject 60 million Naira (about
705,900 U.S. Dollars) this year into Nigeria's Federal Capital
Territory (FCT).
</P>
<P>
The figure doubles last year's 30 million Naira the UNDP
provided for its programs in the FCT, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fund for this year, according to Babashola Chinsman, UNDP
resident representative in Nigeria, will be spent on the
provision of services and facilities in Abuja, the national
capital, and its environs.
</P>
<P>
"The UNDP is already undertaking development support services
such as women-in-development, mass literacy, small and
medium-scales industrial development, environmental protection,
health and manpower and skills programs in six areas of the FCT,"
Chinsman said.
</P>
<P>
Last year's UNDP financial assistance in the FCT achieved
remarkable impact on the lives and welfare of the rural dwellers,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called on beneficiaries of the UNDP programs to always
ensure judicious utilization of funds, equipment and other
facilities released by the UNDP for its programs and activities.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Cooperates with Nile Countries for Optimum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today it is cooperating
with other Nile basin countries to make the optimum use of the
water resources and develop their agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium on food production in Egypt, Egyptian Deputy
Premier Youssef Wali claimed that there was no problem between
Egypt and Sudan, its southern neighbor, or other eight Nile basin
countries, as regards water quotas.
</P>
<P>
The only agreement on the Nile water quotas dates back to 1959
when Egypt and Sudan, which use 94 percent of the quotas, divided
it between themselves. Egypt has access to 55.5 billion cubic
meters, which constitute 99 percent of its sweet water resources.
</P>
<P>
Wali said there are strong relations between Egypt and the
other nine Nile basin countries and a lot of joint work is going
on to make full use of available resources of the Nile River.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who doubles as minister of agriculture and land
reclamation, said that Egypt is undertaking projects to clear the
Nile course in Uganda. He added that experiments to cultivate 20
brands of Egyptian wheat in Uganda are carried out and their
cultivation is being expanded.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is also cooperating with Kenya to dig 120 wells to
provide more water for irrigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Egypt also made an unusual offer to help Ethiopia
make use of the river, which the two countries are expected to
increasingly compete over in coming years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is considering building four dams on the Blue Nile,
the larger one of the river's two branches which meet in
Sudan. Egypt fears that such construction would limit its share.
</P>
<P>
But Osama el-Baz, political adviser to President Hosni
Mubarak, said the Egyptian government was willing "to help
Ethiopia use its share of water, especially the water wasted."
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin groups Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi, Kenya, Zaire, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> UK Supports EU Call to Withdraw Ambassadors From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it would endorse the European Union's (EU) call
for member states to recall their ambassadors from Iran.
</P>
<P>
The EU Dutch presidency has invited all the 15 EU member states
to withdraw their ambassadors from Iran for coordinated
consultation on the future relationship between the EU and Iran
following a German court accused the Iranian government of
ordering the killing of exiled Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement issued
this afternoon, "We will give maximum support to Germany in the
aftermath of the judgement and we will work actively with the
Dutch presidency and our EU partners to agree a firm response."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian government, which has flatly rejected
the allegation, ordered four German diplomats in Tehran to leave
Iran in a tit-for-tat retaliation after Bonn expelled four Iranian
diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Delegation Visits Kisangani on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A Rwandan delegation has arrived
in Kisangani, Zaire for a two-day visit to discuss plans for the
repatriation of some 100,000 Rwandan refugees encamped along the
road south of the city on the right bank of the Zaire River.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR release said here today that the Rwandans held
discussions with the UNHCR and representatives of the rebel
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire
(ADFL) which now controls about half of Zaire after taking
Lubumbashi on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The release said the talks covered a number of issues,
including the planned airlift, entry point -- either at Goma,
Bukavu or Kigali of Rwanda -- and the number of refugees that
Rwanda can accept daily.
</P>
<P>
Today, the group visited makeshift camps at Kasese, 25
kilometers south of Kisangani, the third largest city in Zaire,
and Biaro, 15 kilometers farther south.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has plans for the repatriation of refugees by air
and by land. But preference is for them to return by air to
Kigali, Rwanda as the 630-km route from Kisangani to the eastern
border with Rwanda has several impassable stretches.
</P>
<P>
Besides, heavy rains and flood disrupt aid for refugees at
some camps, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees come from areas in the south and
southwestern parts of Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> German Electoral System Is Constitutional, Court Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany's highest court, the Federal
Constitutional Court, today turned down a lawsuit which questions
the legality of the country's complex electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed by the local government of Lower Saxony
state and Professor Werner Hoppe, a constitutional expert of
Muenster University, doubts the aspects of Germany's dual voting
system are consistent with the constitutionally guaranteed concept
of the equality of votes.
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's electoral system, voters have two votes in
general elections to select members of the Bundestag, the lower
house of the parliament. The first of which is given to a specific
candidate in their constituency. The second vote is given to a
lists of candidates put up by the parties.
</P>
<P>
If a party has won more direct seats through the first vote
than justified by its proportion of votes won overall nationwide,
it is allowed to keep them.
</P>
<P>
In the last general elections in 1994, this dual system worked
to the advantage of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) party, which was able to win 12 extra seats in the
Bundestag through this way. The main opposition party, the Social
Democrats (SPD), claimed only four extra seats through the dual
voting system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In another aspect of German electoral system, parties that do
not gain more than five percent of the vote are barred from
entering the parliament.
</P>
<P>
As an exception, smaller parties that are able to win three
electoral districts outright are allowed into the parliament.
Through this way, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) managed
to enter parliament with 30 seats in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hoppe and the Lower Saxony government ruled by the
SPD had deemed the extra seats in both cases a violation of the
equality of votes.
</P>
<P>
The judges however argued that among other things, the existing
electoral system was decided by law makers and therefore it is
consistent with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the court ruling, the SPD today called on the
law makers to immediately start discussing a reform of the
electoral system.
</P>
<P>
This call, however, was rejected by the CDU and its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) which hailed the court
ruling as a failure of the SPD to challenge the parliamentary
majority held by Kohl's ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> Body of Missing Israeli Soldier Found Near Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The body of an Israeli
soldier missing for seven months has been found in a village
near the West Bank city of Hebron, the state-run Israel Radio
reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, Sharon Edri, is now known to have been
kidnaped and killed by members of the Islamic Resistance
Movement, also known as Hamas.
</P>
<P>
At first, Edri's disappearance was assumed for personal reasons
and police believed he had committed suicide. But his family
insisted that he had been abducted by Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Israeli troops entered Tsurif Village in the
Hebron area, where the body was found, and arrested at least
20 villagers belonging to Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The whereabout of the body was discovered several days ago by
investigators of the Israeli General Security Service. Several
Hamas members, who were involved in the murder, were arrested by
Palestinian security service in the autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
From the same village was Moussa Ranimat, who blew himself up
in the Apropo cafe in Tel Aviv on March 21, killing three Israeli
women.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas cell is also known to have been responsible for
several other operations, in which 10 Israeli soldiers were
killed and 49 Israelis were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who is now on a
visit to the Netherland, expressed thanks to the Palestinians for
their cooperation in the case.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat ordered
the arrest of those Hamas members after approached by
U.S. intelligence officials, said the radio.

<HEADLINE> Government Forces Repel Rebel Attack in Eastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Government troops has repelled
an attack by rebel forces along Sudan's eastern borders, the
spokesman of the Sudanese Armed Forces said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman General Mohamed Ahmed announced that government
troops repelled the attack launched by the Sudanese opposition
forces Wednesday from inside Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
The attack, he said, targeted the territories of Tuqman,
Qudmayit and Kandib along the eastern borders with Eritrea in the
east Sudan Kassala State.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Governor of Kassala General Abul Qassim Ibrahim
Mohamed today revealed details about the attack.
</P>
<P>
He said large groups of the northern and southern opposition
forces, backed by tanks and heavy machinery, attacked the Sudanese
garrisons, some 300 kilometers south east of Kassala, but Sudanese
troops stationed there fought back and compelled them to flee,
leaving their dead and equipment behind.
</P>
<P>
The Kassala State Governor pointed out that the rebels launched
the attack in order to cut the route connecting the capital city
of Khartoum with Port Sudan, largest port of the country
overlooking the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The same garrisons had time and again been exposed to attacks by
Sudanese opposition forces using Eritrea as spring board, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the eruption of fighting in east Sudan months ago,
the Sudanese government has rushed large military reinforcements
to offset opposition attacks.
</P>
<P>
However official sources do acknowledge that the opposition
forces were still holding positions in the rugged hilly area
around the eastern territories of Qaroura and Eterba which they
had captured last month.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Attacks Labor on Europe Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
attacked the opposition Labor party's European policy today,
accusing Labor of threatening to put jobs at risk.
</P>
<P>
During a tour round central England to boost his campaign for
the May 1 election to win his fifth term in Downing Street, Major
criticized Labor leader Tony Blair's pledge to sign up to the
European Social Chapter, saying it was the result of a secret deal
with the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Blair signed the Social Chapter, Britain would be
powerless to stop policies that have helped create the worst dole
queues in post-war Europe being injected into Britain," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who is lagging behind Blair by around 20
points in opinion polls, said the unions were waiting for a payoff
for the funds they contributed to the Labor party.
</P>
<P>
"The unions have long seen Europe as the back-door to power in
Britain. While (former premier) Margaret Thatcher and I have been
in charge, that back-door has stayed firmly bolted. A Labor
government would slip that bolt ever so quietly open," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Social Chapter sets minimum levels of workers' rights
across the union but Britain has opted out of it. Major's move on
the issue was designed to increase pressure on Blair before Labor
is to launch its business manifesto on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major's decision to widen the attack to Europe, a subject which
has dogged his efforts to unite the party in the run-up to the
campaign, underlined his growing confidence.
</P>
<P>
He has been buoyant by a MORI poll in today's Times which
showed a sharp 12-point fall in Labor's lead in a week. But the
poll still gives Labor 49 points to 34 for the Conservatives, and
a daily Gallup poll in today's Telegraph newspaper showed Labor's
lead up four points on the day before to 23, leaving Major a
mountain to climb to win the election.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAKAR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Most of the 80,000 Mauritarian
refugees living in Senegal since 1989 wish to go home, as their
living conditions continue to deteriorate, said a refugee
association here today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Association of Mauritanian Refugees in
Senegal said that his organization wishes to repatriate 66,000 out
of the 80,000 refugees, who came to Senegal after the ethnic
violence broke out between Arabs and black Africans in Mauritania
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Kaaw Toure, said that the repatriation should be
organized by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and
under the condition that these refugees be recognized as
Mauritanian citizens, their properties be returned by the
Mauritanian government and their security guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the refugees are living a hard life by
renting farmland from local inhabitants and doing cattle trade.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have recently staged several sit-in's in front of
government buildings to protest the hardship of their life.
