<HEADLINE> Any way you spell it, Scrabble rules remain -- for now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - M-A-J-O-R-I-T-Y.
</P>
<P>
   Eight letters on the Scrabble board. Worth 110 points if you
play it on a triple word score (60 for the word plus 50 for using
all seven tiles).
</P>
<P>
   In Scrabble circles, that's a darned good score for a single
turn.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the word the National Scrabble Association used to lay
to rest the issue of which dictionary to use for the popular word
game.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of nearly 2-1, the nation's club and tournament
players have rejected the idea of combining the North American
Official Scrabble Players Dictionary with the British Official
Scrabble Words dictionary. And so, SOWPODS - as the proposed combo
was affectionately or derisively termed by supporters and
detractors - is dead.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   On its website, the National Scrabble Association said the tally
isn't final but it looks like, for the next five years anyway,
players in the United States, Canada and Israel will continue to
use their dictionary (OSPD) and the United Kingdom and the rest of
the Scrabble-playing world will use theirs (OSW).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to put aside the acrimonious discussions,
finger-pointing and name calling,'' said John D. Williams,
executive director of the association. ''Wherever you stand on this
issue, you'd have to agree that this has been for better or worse a
historic event for the NSA. The NSA and the NSA Board have tried to
handle this issue in the most responsive, democratic way possible.
It is, in fact, the first-ever referendum held for our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial results show 1,351 members (nearly 65 percent)
opposed ''SOWPODS,'' as the combined dictionary was called. Of
those members who returned ballots, 696 (about 34 percent) favored
it. There are about 10,000 tournament Scrabble players and 200
clubs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the OSW to the OSPD would have meant expert players in
North America would have to add some 40,000 additional words to
their vocabularies.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argued that the entire English-speaking world should
have the same word source and that adding words to the lexicon
would make for a higher scoring, more wide-open game.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the change would benefit only those few dozen
players who qualify for the biennial world championships and would
be a hardship on casual club players who would have to use a word
list without definitions. Adding words like ''QI'' and ''ZO'' would
make it almost impossible to strand opponents with high-scoring
letters at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The NSA wrangled over possible compromises, including using just
two or three letter words at first then gradually phasing in the
entire British dictionary. Another called for using each system at
different tournaments and events but Williams worried that would
create an ''in-your-face'' atmosphere of ''us versus them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two factions will certainly renew the debate when they meet
Aug. 5 in Providence, R.I., for the North American Scrabble
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   D-E-T-E-N-T-E: Eight points.

<HEADLINE> Padres 5, Rockies 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Adam Eaton won for the first time in nine starts
and went 3-for-3 and Al Martin drove in two runs as the San Diego
Padres beat the slumping Colorado Rockies 5-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton (2-1), who won on May 30 against Milwaukee and had seven
no-decisions since, fanned three, walked four and gave up a run and
seven hits in 7 1-3 innings, his longest stint of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old right hander also walked and became the first
Padres pitcher in over five years to steal a base.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had a two-run single. Ryan Klesko, Damian Jackson and
Ruben Rivera added RBI hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (4-7), who has allowed 41 earned runs in 40 2-3
innings at Coors Field, allowed five runs in 4 2-3 innings and is
2-4 in eight starts since returning to the starting rotation.
Colorado lost for the 13th time in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton allowed a first-inning run on a two-out single by Jeffrey
Hammonds, a wild pitch and a single to left by Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took advantage of Bohanon's wildness in the fourth
inning to take a 3-1 lead. Bohanon walked Klesko, allowed a bloop
single to Phil Nevin and walked Bret Boone before Martin singled
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Davis forced Martin at second, but Jackson slapped a two-out
single to right to score Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton helped himself with a one-out single in the sixth, stole
second and scored when Ruben Rivera singled. Klesko doubled to
left, scoring Rivera to build a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes:@With RHPs Carlton Loewer and Brian Boehringer undergoing
season-ending shoulder surgery on Tuesday, seven Padres will have
had surgery since opening day. ... San Diego purchased the contract
of LHP Dave Mauer from Triple-A Las Vegas, placed RHP Steve
Montgomery on the 15-day DL and transferred RHP Brian Boehringer
from the 15-day to the 60-day DL. ... Colorado SS Neifi Perez
batted second for the third time this year. Lansing has been in
that spot for 77 games. Lansing got his second RBI in his last 17
games. ... Scott Sanders was the last Padres pitcher to steal a
base on June 14, 1995.

<HEADLINE> USDA To Stop Stamping Imported Meat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meat imported from other countries and
inspected in the United States soon will no longer carry USDA grade
stamps, the Agriculture Department announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all meat inspected in the United States, regardless
of where it is produced, gets a USDA stamp such as ''prime,''
''choice'' or ''select.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA said it was changing the practice because of consumer
confusion over origin of meat products.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ranchers had sought the change, saying the USDA stamp
serves as a form of advertising not meant for foreign meats.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota's two Democratic senators, Minority Leader Tom
Daschle and Tim Johnson, urged President Clinton to direct the USDA
to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   ''American livestock producers must pay millions of dollars
annually to various check-off programs to promote their
industries,'' Daschle said. ''Foreign producers are not required to
pay into these funds, but still reap the benefits of increased
demand for their products.''
</P>
<P>
   A rancher lobby organization applauded the decision, but pointed
out that the planned action only affects carcasses, not live
animals imported to the United States and later slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   Leo McDonnell Jr., chairman of the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action
Legal Fund in Columbus, Mont., said Mexico and Canada export about
2 million live cattle a year to the United States. His group
contends that those cattle should not be allowed to receive the
stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA said the change will take place later this summer.

<HEADLINE> 18 in N.C. Accused of Hezbollah Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Federal authorities Friday charged 18
people with smuggling cigarettes out of North Carolina to raise
money for the terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Agents arrested most of the suspects in raids of houses and
businesses in and around Charlotte early Friday. An FBI affidavit
said investigators were searching for evidence that the defendants
were providing resources to Hezbollah, but it did not specify how
much money the alleged scheme has funnelled to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen suspects were arrested Friday, according to FBI
officials in Charlotte. All were indicted on federal charges
including immigration violations, weapons offenses, money
laundering and cigarette trafficking, U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway said at a hearing that they were not alleged to have
participated in terrorist activities. But three of the suspects are
believed to have provided Hezbollah with material support or
resources, including night vision devices, global positioning
systems, digital photo equipment and computers.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the men arrested, Mohamad Youssef Hammoud, identified
as the group's ringleader by a state-federal task force that
investigated the group, was described in an affidavit as
well-connected to Hezbollah members in Lebanon. The affidavit said
he is believed to have received Hezbollah-sponsored military
training.
</P>
<P>
   One source that spoke to the task force ''believes that if
Hezbollah issued an authorization to execute a terrorist act in the
United States, Mohamad Hammoud would not hesitate in carrying it
out,'' the affidavit read.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Hammoud or any of his co-defendants had
an attorney who could comment on the case. No one answered the door
at Hammoud's house Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The ring allegedly bought cigarettes in North Carolina, which
has relatively low cigarette taxes of five cents a pack, and
unloaded them in Michigan, where prices are higher because of
75-cent-a-pack taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The profits were allegedly used to smuggle money to Hezbollah in
Lebanon since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI informant said one of those arrested, Ali Hussein
Darwiche, had transported more than $1 million to Lebanon. Another
$360,000 in cashiers checks was traced to Lebanon, according to an
affidavit filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah draws its support from the 1.2 million-member Shiite
Muslim community, Lebanon's largest sect, and enjoys the financial
backing of Iran and the crucial political endorsement of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hezbollah guerrillas have been treated like
heroes in much of the Arab world. Their years of resistance to
Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and infliction of casualties
on Israeli forces there weakened Israel's resolve. Israel ended its
18-year occupation of the area in May.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah remains shunned by Western governments. In the 1980s,
it was believed to be the umbrella group for militants who
kidnapped Westerners and destroyed two U.S. Embassy compounds, the
U.S. Marine headquarters at Beirut and a French military base. A
total of about 290 Americans and about 60 French soldiers were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who follow terrorism and Middle East politics said
terrorist groups such as Hezbollah use different legal and illegal
means to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Eldridge, a political science professor at Duke
University who teaches a course on international terrorism, said
this is the first time he had heard of a terrorist group
trafficking in cigarettes to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to be able to tap into large amounts of cash,'' he
said. ''And so, what comes to mind immediately today where there
are large amounts of cash: drugs or, increasingly, cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in 1996 when Iredell County authorities
noticed people with out-of-state license plates making large cash
purchases from JR Tobacco, a discount tobacco outlet.
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet, middle-class neighborhood where Hammoud lives,
neighbors said his gray-blue house was notable for little other
than periodic gatherings and what appeared to be a constantly
changing set of occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than all the meetings, where there'd be 15, 20 cars
parked in front of the house ... they didn't bother anybody,'' said
Paul Booher, who lives two houses down.

<HEADLINE> Israel Makes Jerusalem Concession  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Middle East summit is in low gear in
deference to the Jewish Sabbath, but negotiations are going on,
quietly and informally, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders await
President Clinton's return.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Jews devote Saturday to prayer and rest; secular
Israelis normally do neither. But it could be politically unwise
for an Israeli official to conduct normal business on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, discussions were apt to be quiet at the Camp David
presidential retreat as the summit passed through a slow period
until sundown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, attending an economic summit in Japan, trimmed his
schedule so he could return to the Camp David talks by Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president was
briefed on the status of the talks while en route to a meeting
Saturday morning (Friday night EDT) with Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori, and ''his intention is to get back to Camp David as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have continued their discussions, but there are some
things the leaders have to do among themselves,'' Lockhart said.
''I expect him to get right back to work when he gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is acting as host in
Clinton's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view, the parties are making serious efforts,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday, before the onset
of the Sabbath. ''But nonetheless, it is hard going.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations remained shrouded in the secrecy that has marked
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher provided scant information before a ''lid'' was clamped
on public statements until Sunday morning. He said some news
reports of summit proceedings have been accurate, but most were
not.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, two Israeli officials disclosed Friday that the
United States was promoting an Israeli-initiated proposal to
recognize Palestinian administrative control over Arab
neighborhoods of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to clear the most stubborn obstacle to a Camp David
peace agreement, deep differences on Jerusalem's future.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Melchior, a rabbi who is a member of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's cabinet, said the proposal conveyed the
''characteristic'' of Palestinian sovereignty in the eastern area
of the contested city, a long-cherished Palestinian goal.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting coolly to the ideas, Hassan Abdel Rahman, Washington
representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said:
''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, there
is not a ground for an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman told The Associated Press by telephone he could not
verify that such a proposal had been put on the table at secluded
Camp David, where the summit was in its 11th day.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is demanding sovereignty over
East Jerusalem, the city's older area that Israel captured from
Jordanian troops in the 1967 Six-Day War. He envisions it as the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to keep Jerusalem a united city.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has refused to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's
capital, although Clinton promised that recognition in his campaign
for the White House eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Palestinians
in 1991 that Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem was invalid,
Rahman recalled, ''and I have not heard the United States had
changed its position.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current plan, Palestinian areas outside the city also
would be placed under Palestinian administrative control.
</P>
<P>
   ''These villages are not really ours,'' Israeli Justice Minister
Yossi Beilin told Israel army radio. ''We must not allow this
mirage to become an obstruction to Ehud Barak to arrive at the
dream of peace with the Palestinians, now so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Melchior said the plan would give the Palestinians some
''symbols of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   He said later through an aide that this characterization was his
own and did not emerge from the talks at Camp David.

<HEADLINE> Report Accuses U.S. Troops in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- For more than a year, a Serb father
and his two sons have been held in an American detention facility
accused of killing an ethnic Albanian. Now, new evidence raises the
possibility that the victim may have been killed by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military and U.N. officials offered no explanation why it
took so long for the new evidence to emerge. The unit involved has
been rotated to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patrice De Charette said Friday the new evidence was
contained in a 130-page report submitted by U.S. authorities to the
court trying Mirolub ''Mirko'' Momcilovic, 60, and his sons
Jugoslav, 32, and Boban, 25, on charges of killing Afrim Gagica on
July 10, 1999, in a confrontation in southeastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The French trial judge said the Americans confirmed in the
report that U.S. troops had killed two people that day, instead of
one as had been acknowledged previously. The U.S. military said
American troops shot Naser Azemi in the same area that day after
they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   De Charette refused to give further details until the report is
admitted into evidence Monday. However, a U.N. official familiar
with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
Americans now confirm the second person killed that day was Gagica.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel, summarizing a report from de
Charette, said the Americans testified that one man had been firing
at an observation tower where U.S. soldiers were stationed.
</P>
<P>
   The armed man then fled into a shed, pursued by an American
soldier who fired two explosive rounds near the building and
''successive rounds into the shed door,'' Manuel said. U.N.
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gagica was
killed at a shed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops involved in any shooting incidents are thoroughly
debriefed, and it was unclear why the Army waited so long to
provide information in a case that has dragged on for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The case emerged at a time when key figures in Congress were
objecting to the establishment of an international criminal court,
arguing that U.S. soldiers on peacekeeping missions might someday
be charged with offenses committed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Army asked the court to reconsider the
detentions of Momcilovic and his sons because an investigation by
the Army's Criminal Investigation Division had uncovered
''additional investigative materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army said it reopened the investigation after receiving an
inquiry from the media, and it passed on its findings to the court.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence marks another strange chapter in the case
against the Momcilovics, which began during the early, often
turbulent months of the international peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Their trial began April 25 and was suspended the following day
after the defense asked to introduce a security videotape showing
some of the events of the day of the shooting. Although the tape
does not indicate who killed Gagica, it shows the elder Momcilovic
answering the intercom of his motorcycle repair shop and speaking
with a stranger who ultimately demanded that he come out and
surrender his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Gun drawn, a man later identified as Gagica tried to kick the
door down as a group of his armed companions looked on. An exchange
of gunfire followed. Minutes later, U.S. troops entered the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tape does not show who shot Gagica, human rights
observers long have contended that it raises reasonable doubt that
the Momcilovics were responsible. The court refused to accept the
tape into evidence, saying it could not determine whether it had
been altered.

Cheney Said To Be Bush's Top VP Pick

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two highly placed GOP officials said Texas Gov. George W.
Bush is seriously considering former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as his
Republican running mate, turning to a respected Washington insider in the final
days of his search for a vice presidential candidate. The former lawmaker, White
House chief of staff and Defense Secretary -- the man heading up Bush's search
team -- thrust himself into the process by changing his voter registration
Friday from Texas to Wyoming. Cheney, who is considered the leading candidate,
made the move to ensure he is eligible for the job if the governor decides to
offer it, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

space satellites. Clinton said North Korea's proposal needs to be explored but
added, ''It's not clear to me exactly what the offer is and what is being
requested and the time for it. North Korea's suspected missile ambitions are a
key factor in the U.S. drive to develop a missile shield to protect all 50
states from nuclear attack. Clinton is to decide in the next few months whether
to move ahead with the controversial program, heatedly opposed by Russia.

Department announced Friday. Currently, all meat inspected in the United States,
regardless of where it is produced, gets a USDA stamp such as ''prime,''
''choice'' or ''select. The USDA said it was changing the practice because of
consumer confusion over origin of meat products. U.S. ranchers had sought the
change, saying the USDA stamp serves as a form of advertising not meant for
foreign meats.

   DENVER (AP) -- Adam Eaton won for the first time in nine starts and went
3-for-3 and Al Martin drove in two runs as the San Diego Padres beat the
slumping Colorado Rockies 5-1 Friday night. Eaton (2-1), who won on May 30
against Milwaukee and had seven no-decisions since, fanned three, walked four
and gave up a run and seven hits in 7 1-3 innings, his longest stint of the

pitcher in over five years to steal a base. Martin had a two-run single. Ryan
Klesko, Damian Jackson and Ruben Rivera added RBI hits.

<HEADLINE> Israel Newspaper Plans Web Radio  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jerusalem Post reporters are supposed to carry
tape recorders and microphones these days to gather sound for the
newspaper's new Internet radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion to online radio hasn't pleased everyone. Some
veteran notebook-and-pencil reporters refused to tote the
equipment, said David Zev Harris, the station's news director.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the younger ones are keen. They find radio sexy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's Internet radio service went online May 31. Six radio
staffers provide news updates, reports and features about Israel
and the Jewish world, using material they gather and the resources
of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the new station reflects the paper's policy to be a
news provider, rather than just a print outlet. The Internet Web
site recorded 4.8 million hits in May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters noted that the newspaper, owned by the Canadian
Hollinger Group Ltd., is up for sale, and the radio channel could
add value to the property.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 34, worked for the BBC in London before moving here in
1996. Station manager Michal Cohen and presenter Teisha Bader came
over from Radio West, a popular English-language pirate station
shut down last year by Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio's three-room offices in the Jerusalem Post
building, production manager David Starck, who moved here from
Chicago in 1996, was updating the station's program, inserting the
latest sports report.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a microphone, he used a desktop computer to feed the
digitalized sports report through Everstream, a Cleveland-based
company that serves about 150 newspaper audio Web sites in the
United States, providing mostly music programming. The Jerusalem
Post is Everstream's first foreign client.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the new sports report appeared on the station's
Internet menu. Harris said this underlines the advantage of the
station over on-the-air broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   If a listener tunes in to a radio newscast a minute late, he
misses the top story, Harris said. The newspaper radio service
allows a listener to start a newscast whenever he wants. Also, he
or she can pick a specific story or feature, instead of listening
to an entire program.
</P>
<P>
   The technology allows the radio sound to play while the listener
uses the same computer for other purposes. ''It's just like having
a radio playing in the background,'' Harris said.

<HEADLINE> Labor To Fete GOP Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Republican congressmen will be feted at
the GOP convention next month by an unlikely source -- 16 labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from the Air Line Pilots Association to the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, the unions, joined by the
AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades Department, are honoring
Reps. Jack Quinn of New York, Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Ray
LaHood of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the AFL-CIO has begun its election-year TV
campaign with ads in five key districts held by congressional
Republicans facing tight races. The AFL-CIO is targeting them for
failing to support a Medicare prescription drug plan backed by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   All three GOP lawmakers to be honored Aug. 2 sit on the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Half of the unions
sponsoring the reception represent transportation industry workers.
</P>
<P>
   The three congressmen ''have been very good on labor
transportation issues,'' said Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the
Association of Flight Attendants, one of the unions sponsoring the
reception. ''We support politicians who support issues important to
flight attendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Zack said the lawmakers helped push through provisions that gave
increased protection for flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking Republican leaders, Quinn played a key role in 1996 in
the successful effort to raise the minimum wage. The AFL-CIO has
given him a lifetime pro-labor voting record of 55 percent.
LoBiondo's lifetime record is 46 percent. LaHood has a much lower
rating, 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If labor unions want to get together in support of
Republicans, we're all for it,'' said National Republican
Congressional Committee spokeswoman Marit Babin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this show of support for some GOP lawmakers, organized
labor is still firmly planted on the Democratic side. Since Jan. 1,
1999, unions and their members have given $40.2 million to
Democratic candidates and party committees, compared with $3.1
million given to Republicans, according to the Campaign Study
Group, a nonpartisan consulting firm that analyzes campaign finance
data.
</P>
<P>
   And when the AFL-CIO's 30 transportation unions met on Thursday
and Friday, they heard from Vice President Al Gore, Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle and House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt. Their Republican counterparts were not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO is spending ''a couple hundred thousand
dollars'' for ads in the five congressional districts, spokeswoman
Denise Mitchell said. The commercials began airing this week in the
districts of Republican Reps. Charles Bass of New Hampshire, Ernie
Fletcher of Kentucky, Don Sherwood of Pennsylvania, and Jim Rogan
and Steve Kuykendall of California.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very focused on trying to be sure working family issues
get elevated in the debate,'' Mitchell said. ''Obviously members
(of Congress) who are more sensitive are people who are in marginal
races.''

<HEADLINE> New Bills Confuse Vending Machines  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Without special software, vending machines
aren't processing the new $5 and $10 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Of an estimated 6 million food and beverage vending machines in
this country that accept $5 and $10 notes, only 1 million have been
modified to recognize the bills, said Larry Felix of the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
</P>
<P>
   The new bills, bearing portraits of Abraham Lincoln and
Alexander Hamilton, were redesigned to thwart high-tech
counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machine owners are working to modify their machines to
accept the new bills, Felix said Friday. He said the process will
likely take some time, but he is confident the changeover will go
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Allen, a spokesman for the National Automatic
Merchandising Association, said: ''Some of the equipment is very
simple to change. Other machines need more major modifications.
Generally speaking, we are working as fast we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The government supplied some of the new notes to vending
equipment companies late last year to give them time to develop
software to recognize them and test it on vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things industry asked us to do was to introduce the
new $5s and $10s together,'' thus allowing companies to make
modifications for both at the same time and cut costs, Felix said.
</P>
<P>
   Some vending machines take $20 bills, which got a facelift in
1998, but many more take $5 and $10 notes, Felix said. ''That's a
large leap -- a much bigger job'' for the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Felix said only about 10 percent of the new $5 and $10 notes are
in circulation. The old bills will continue to be accepted and
recirculated until they wear out.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said some vending machine operators were waiting to phase
in the changes as the new bills come into wider circulation. ''It's
an expense and business decision on their part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new $5 and $10 bills include a number of new features, but
it's the big, and slightly off-center portraits of Lincoln and
Hamilton that people will notice first.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the notes joined an oversized Andrew Jackson on the $20
bill, Ulysses S. Grant on the $50 and Benjamin Franklin on the $100
in makeovers designed to trip up counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   Other new features of the redesigned $5 and $10 notes include
watermarks that are visible when held up to a light; embedded
polymer security threads that glow blue on the new $5 bill and
orange on the new $10 bill when exposed to an ultraviolet light;
and very tiny printing, visible with a magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, counterfeiters have graduated from offset
printing to color copiers, computer scanners, color ink jet
printers and publishing-grade software -- technologies that are all
readily available.

<HEADLINE> North, South Korea To Hold Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea agreed on Saturday to
high-level government talks in the South Korean capital this month,
a meeting that would mark the first visit to Seoul by a senior
North Korean official in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean Prime Minister Hong Sung Nam said in a letter to
his South Korean counterpart, Lee Han-dong, that his country will
send a 35-member delegation led by a Cabinet-level minister to
Seoul for July 29-31 talks.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings will focus on how to implement the agreements of
last month's historic summit, at which leaders of the two Koreas
pledged to reconcile after five decades of animosity. Seoul
officials expected the talks would lead to a series of lower-level
talks on military, economic and sports exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June 13-15 summit, a thaw has been spreading rapidly
on the Korean Peninsula. Both sides have ended propaganda
broadcasts against the other. Foreign ministers of the two
countries will meet in Bangkok, Thailand, next week during the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas also will allow hundreds of separated family
members to reunite temporarily in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean entourage to Seoul this month will include five
government negotiators led by a Cabinet level minister, 10
journalists and 15 supporting personnel.
</P>
<P>
   No North Korean government officials have visited Seoul since
1992, when the prime ministers of the two nations visited each
other's capital for a series of reconciliation talks. During those
talks, both sides pledged to renounce hostilities. But relations
chilled again amid suspicions over North Korea's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's summit was the most significant diplomatic
breakthrough in relations between the Koreas, which were
partitioned into the communist North and the pro-Western South in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have never signed a peace treaty to end their 1950-53
war, and their border is the world's most heavily armed.

<HEADLINE> Bizarre Roll Call For Thai Election  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A former manager of the national soccer
team, a flight attendant known for shadowing the prime minister and
a political veteran who has capitalized on surviving a bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not characters in a spy movie, but some of the candidates in
Sunday's election to decide who runs Thailand's urban nightmare --
Bangkok, a metropolis of 10 million people cursed by traffic jams,
floods and chronic pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three candidates, most doomed to be distant also-rans,
are running for the city governorship. It carries a monthly salary
of only $2,500, and the winner will take flak for everything from
the state of the sidewalks to the begging elephants and their
handlers cluttering the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But even national political heavyweights are challenging for the
job, which oversees a $600 million annual budget. The result of the
election could affect which party grabs parliamentary seats in
Bangkok in general elections this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a 24-hour-a-day job,'' says outgoing governor Bhichit
Rattakul, credited with making Bangkok a slightly greener place
during his four-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ''My advice for my successor is to stay out of politics, and
save the time for smoothing out the traffic and planting trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades of rapacious development, slowed only by the Asian
economic crisis that struck in 1997, have left the city with
brackish waterways, just a handful of public parks and inadequate
roads that lead to almost constant gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates with little hope of winning more than a bit of
publicity have been promoting unlikely cures for Bangkok's ills.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-infantry commander who campaigns in camouflage fatigues
wants to employ 50,000 security guards to fight drugs and crime.
</P>
<P>
   A former flight attendant -- who made her name by sticking to
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai like a starstruck teen-ager -- proposes
that Bangkok children study at home via television so they don't
cause traffic jams by traveling to school.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are always opportunists who will present themselves to
the Bangkok electorate and expect to create a new fad and hope
they'll get elected,'' said Pasuk Phongpaichit, lecturer at the
city's Chulalongkorn University.
</P>
<P>
   The man favored to win is sharp-tongued political veteran Samak
Sundaravej, who has been a national lawmaker 10 times and deputy
premier three times. The 65-year-old says if he loses this election
he will become a talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   His main rival is Sudarat Keyuraphan, 39, from the new Thai Rak
Thai party, which could form the next national government --
especially if it proves popular in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Former Thailand soccer manager Thawatchai Sajakul, 57, is the
ruling national Democrat Party's candidate. Because he is unlikely
to win, the government is hoping Samak does in order to shut Thai
Rak Thai out.
</P>
<P>
   Samak, a conservative who made his mark in the 1970s before
democracy got a proper foothold, fiercely opposes political reforms
Thailand adopted after the economic crisis to fight graft and make
government more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   He says critics who accuse him of supporting a military massacre
of protesting students in 1976 were responsible for a bomb blast at
one of his rallies on July 13, which injured eight people.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on public sympathy after the bombing, Samak has surged
ahead in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's 100,000 votes gone just like that,'' Sudarat was quoted
as saying in the Bangkok Post newspaper the day after the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Residents just hope to see some of the city's problems solved.
</P>
<P>
   Pornchai Sae Jiew, 43, a drinks vendor, wants the governor to
make good on something every candidate has promised -- dealing with
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Thawat Phooyaem, 55, a blind lottery ticket seller, wants better
access in the city for the disabled, but has no faith in Thai
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''They come to meet us at the handicapped club and promise
everything we ask for. But when they win, they forget all their
promises,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pig Music Ordered Turned Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. (AP) -- Golfers at the Florida Club will still have
to endure the stench from a neighboring pig farm, but at least they
won't have to listen to twangy tunes played for the porkers'
enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Ben Bryan on Thursday threw out his previous order
requiring Thomas Rosin and his family to remove the pigs from their
property by Aug. 2. Bryan said the Rossanos' battle to keep their
pigs is with Martin County, not the court.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan also ordered the Rossanos to turn their music down eight
decibels below what's allowed by the county's noise ordinance and
to direct their outdoor speakers away from the Florida Club, a golf
course that sits about 100 yards across the street from the pig
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want any monkeying around with the noise bothering
these folks,'' Bryan sternly told Rossano.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre case of old Florida versus new, Rossano had been
fighting the golf club's claims that the pigs he raises smell and
the country music he plays to soothe the animals are a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said he ''reacted too quickly'' when he ordered the
Rossanos to get rid of the pigs, and that he changed his mind after
hearing testimony during a five-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that time, I thought Mr. Rossano had no respect for court
orders and thought he was thumbing his nose at the whole process,''
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question in my mind that the hogs were there before
the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossano said he will comply with Rossano's new order while
continuing to fight with Martin County to keep his swine.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all we asked for in the beginning,'' Florida Club
attorney Louis Lozeau said. ''This case for us was always about the
music. ... Unfortunately, the Florida Club and the Rossanos had to
go through three-and-a-half years of a lot of money and a lot of
heartache.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossano's attorney, Lance Richard, called the judge's ruling a
''victory for the little guy,'' but one that may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County's code enforcement board has taken steps to file
another lawsuit seeking removal of the Rossanos' pigs because the
limited agricultural zoning of their property does not permit
livestock.

<HEADLINE> Party Money Funneled Through States  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seizing another loophole, Democrats and
Republicans are funneling money through state parties to buy their
television ads in a tactic that preserves the limited dollars they
can spend directly on candidates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If the national parties had bought the ads themselves, they
would have been required by federal regulations to use mostly
''hard money'' -- the limited contributions that can be spent
directly in support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But by routing dollars first to state affiliates, the parties
can use a greater portion of ''soft money,'' the unlimited
donations from unions, corporations and wealthy individuals that
are easier to raise and cannot be directly used to help elect
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So while the ads star Al Gore and George W. Bush, are produced
by creative minds in Washington and paid for with money raised by
the national parties, as far as election law is concerned, it's the
state parties who are behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think this is in any way undermining the letter or
the spirit of the law,'' said Joseph Sandler, general counsel for
the Democratic National Committee, which pioneered this technique
in 1996. ''This is like the tax code. You don't pay more taxes than
you owe.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the same. ''There are laws and there are rules
and we're very careful to comply with them fully and completely,''
said Cliff May, spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission has said it's all perfectly
legal, and that disturbs those who advocate changes in campaign
finance law.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are really no rules,'' said Larry Makinson, executive
director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors
political fund raising. ''You can spend just about anything just
about anywhere as long as you dot your i's and cross your t's. And
both parties are doing plenty of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And even some of those involved agree that the system is
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the end result of an antiquated and archaic federal
election law that needs to be seriously revamped,'' said David
Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ''But these are the
rules that everyone is playing with, and so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   These rules mean that a dollar spent for an ad in Oregon travels
across the country at least three times before it arrives at the TV
station.
</P>
<P>
   The money is raised by the Democratic and Republican national
committees in Washington, and when they are ready to run an ad,
they electronically transfer it to the state political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The states then transfer the money back to Washington, into the
accounts of ad buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the buyers send it back to the targeted states yet
again, to TV stations to pay for the ads.
</P>
<P>
   And while a state party can veto an ad coming into its state,
strategists in Washington will determine what the ads look like,
what issues they tackle and where they will run.
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer, the DNC has spent nearly $20 million on TV
ads in 17 states promoting Vice President Gore. The RNC has spent
more than $17 million on ads touting Texas Gov. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of it has been channeled through the state
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that, in an election year, if the national
party does the buying, 65 percent of the money must be limited and
more scarce hard dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules are different for state parties, where a formula
determines the ratio of hard-to-soft money. The formula accounts
for the number of federal vs. state and local candidates on the
ballot, and in many cases, the percentages are virtually flipped,
with only a third of the dollars having to come from hard money
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the parties with more hard money, which can then be
channeled into congressional races across the country this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The parties point to another advantage to channeling the money
to state parties. The ads say that they are paid for by the ''Ohio
Democratic Party'' or the ''Oklahoma Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the message is more powerful when we have a local
messenger,'' said the RNC's May. ''And that is the state party.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros hit a go-ahead three-run homer in
the eighth inning, lifting the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-5 victory
Friday night over the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Mark Grudzielanek and a single by Shawn Green gave the
Dodgers runners at the corners with none out against Giants starter
Shawn Estes, who was charged with five runs and six hits in
seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez (3-1) relieved Estes with a 5-3 lead and retired
major league home-run leader Gary Sheffield on a popup, but Karros

his 26th homer.

   The loss dropped the Giants 2&AMP;frac12; games behind Arizona in the NL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (7-0) won despite giving up Barry Bonds' 32nd homer,
which put him within one of Sheffield. Herges allowed two hits
during his inning of work and Jeff Shaw got three straight
pinch-hitters -- two on strikeouts -- for his 14th save in 21
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   	   J.T. Snow capped a four-run sixth inning with a go-ahead two-run
single. But it wasn't enough for Estes, who received fewer than six
runs to work with for the first time in seven starts. The
left-hander, 4-0 during that span, entered the game leading the
majors in run support.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was only the fourth for the Giants in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Carlos Perez, returning from a five-game
suspension that resulted from a brawl with fans at Wrigley Field,
blanked the Giants on four hits through the first five innings. He
drove in two runs with a second-inning triple as the Dodgers built
a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvin Murray led off the sixth with a bunt single that
triggered the Giants' sixth-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   Murray took third on a single by Russ Davis and scored San
Francisco's first run on Bonds' sacrifice fly. Green robbed Jeff
Kent of extra bases with a running grab on the warning track in
right field, but Ellis Burks singled, Rich Aurilia followed with an
RBI double and Snow hit a bloop single that drove in two and put
the Giants ahead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds made it a two-run lead in the eighth when he lined Herges'
1-1 pitch into the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth's sacrifice fly in the second opened the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who was 1-for-32, made it 3-0 later in the inning by
lining a pitch into the left-field corner for his first two RBIs
this season. It was Perez's second career triple.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander allowed four runs, nine hits and no walks in
seven innings. Perez is 0-2 in 11 starts since beating the Marlins
12-6 on May 20 at Florida.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd of 53,563 on ''Rally Towel'' night was the
largest at Dodger Stadium this season, and the fifth sellout. ...
Dodgers reliever Mike Fetters served his one-game suspension
stemming from the Wrigley Field brawl. The suspension was reduced
from five games last month. ... Perez has not had more than two
RBIs in a season since 1995, when he drove in five runs as a
Montreal rookie. He tripled for the first time since June 1, 1995.
The last Dodgers pitcher to triple was Brian Bohanon on Aug. 19,
1998. ... Estes has allowed only two home runs in 91 innings over
his last 14 starts, and only four overall. Last year he surrendered
a career-worst 21 homers.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 12, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Carlos Guillen singled twice during a seven-run
first inning and Jay Buhner and Mark McLemore homered in a five-run
third Friday night as the Seattle Mariners beat the Texas Rangers
12-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners combined four hits, four walks and an error in
knocking out Matt Perisho (2-3) in the opening inning.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott (6-3) blanked the Rangers until Frank Catalonotto
led off the sixth with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Texas played without catcher Ivan Rodriguez. Manager Johnny
Oates decided his slumping All-Star a night off.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson and Guillen started the Mariners first with
singles, and Edgar Martinez and John Olerud added RBI singles.
After Jay Buhner flied out, Perisho walked three straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davis relieved and walked Henderson with the bases loaded
to put Seattle ahead 5-0. Guillen singled home a run and another
scored on the play on second baseman Catalonotto's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got a two-run homer from McLemore and a three-run
homer from Buhner, his 16th, off Davis in the third to go ahead
12-0.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen finished with four hits. David Segui hit his 10th homer
off Brett Tomko in the Texas eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott improved his career record to 4-0 against Texas and
raised his record to 5-1 in his last nine starts. He pitched seven
innings and gave up two runs on six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho lost to Seattle for the second time this month and
dropped his third straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   Making their first visit to Safeco Field, which opened July 15,
1999, the Rangers got to see its retractable roof close in the
bottom of the second following a cloudburst that sent many in the
crowd of 44,765 scurrying for cover. The rain was accompanied by
thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Texas became the last AL team to visit Safeco. The Rangers were
the last team to play in the now imploded Kingdome on June 27,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rodriguez has a five-game hitting streak, but is 6-for-31
on Texas' current road trip. He played in 88 of the Rangers' first
93 games, and Oates said the catcher will play Saturday and Sunday.
''He's played almost every game for us,'' Oates said. ''And he's
been dragging a little bit.'' ... All-Star SS Alex Rodriguez is
close to getting back in the Mariners' lineup. Rodriguez, who is on
the DL with a sprained right knee, took ground balls and, did some
hitting and some running before Friday night's game. Afterward,
Rodriguez and trainer Rick Griffin agreed that Rodriguez has a
chance to play at home Monday night against Oakland. ''By Monday,
I'll be in the lineup,'' Rodriguez said.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Said To Be Bush's VP Pick  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning to a respected Washington insider in
the final days of his search, George W. Bush is seriously
considering former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as his Republican
running mate, two highly placed GOP officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former House member, White House chief of staff and
defense secretary -- and head of the vice presidential search team --
changed his voter registration Friday from Texas to Wyoming to
ensure he is eligible for the job if the governor decides to offer
it, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. One
said he is the leading contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has not made his decision but will do so this
weekend, promising to ponder ''long and hard'' in the privacy of
his Texas ranch. ''The days of speculation are over,'' Bush said,
and aides indicated an announcement could come as early next week,
just days before the July 31 opening of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Cheney serves to shift focus away from a
campaign by at least 60 House lawmakers to get Arizona Sen. John
McCain on the ticket. Bush advisers say he has shown no inclination
toward selecting his vanquished rival, and the lobbying effort is
viewed as an unwelcome distraction at Bush's headquarters in
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have figured prominently in the speculation include
Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and
George Pataki of New York; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and Sens. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska and Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, both of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A respected public figure with a long record of service, Cheney
would be a low-risk choice, something Bush signaled this week he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   At 59, he is just five years older than Bush but would bring a
range of experience and stature lacking in the presumptive nominee.
Bush has tried to close the gravitas gap with Vice President Al
Gore, his Democratic rival, by suggesting that Washington veterans
such as retired Gen. Colin Powell and McCain may be part of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sources called Cheney the leading candidate, saying
Bush was very close to settling on the man who once served under
Bush's father, former President Bush. A second official, also
familiar with the selection process, cautioned that Bush normally
doesn't rank his personnel choices in terms of front-runners and
leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both sources said Bush could still turn elsewhere, noting that
he has kept his own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The officials made the disclosure after confirming that Cheney,
a Texas businessman, switched his voter registration to Wyoming.
''Today was the last day for him to register to vote in Wyoming so
he could be a viable candidate for the governor's consideration,''
one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney wanted to avoid conflict with language in the 12th
Amendment to the Constitution that forbids Electoral College
members in Texas from voting for both the president and vice
president who are ''inhabitants'' of their state.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has a history of heart trouble, would be a surprise
pick. He suggested weeks ago that he would not be a candidate,
after accepting the job of reviewing the backgrounds of potential
candidates and helping Bush narrow his list.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney worked in the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Cost of
Living Council and the White House in the 1970s, serving as
President Ford's chief of staff. He served six terms in Congress
from Wyoming before going to the Pentagon under President Bush,
where he was a key strategist in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush plucked Cheney from the oil services firm Halliburton
Co., where he was chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Cheney appealed to moderates but racked up a
conservative voting record and was a solid Ronald Reagan supporter.
He was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for
Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks by age 48 and has
undergone coronary bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A rare black mark on his record: He admitted writing 21 bad
checks from the House bank but told the Ethics Committee that
investigated the banking scandal that he always had a positive
balance and no checks were returned for insufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney emerged as the leading contender as the Bush campaign
tried to dampen a lobbying effort on behalf of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who battled Bush unsuccessfully for the
nomination -- and is anything but close to the Texas governor -- was
injected forcefully into the late speculation. Several Republican
sources said the head of the GOP House campaign committee, Rep. Tom
Davis of Virginia, had solicited signatures on a letter to the Bush
campaign urging consideration of the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave no indication he would be influenced by the pressure,
and observed he was certain that McCain would be a ''loyal soldier
for my candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, ''I don't believe anything has changed'' since a
May meeting in which he told Bush he did not want to be considered.

<HEADLINE> China Savages Falun Gong  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Falun Gong followers marked the first anniversary
of China's ban on the group Saturday, unfurling banners and
meditating in scattershot protests that were snuffed out within
seconds by legions of police.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's sprawling Tiananmen Square has been a popular venue
for the protests, which usually involve individuals or small
groups. But on Saturday morning, about 25 protesters managed to
raise a banner and block police from immediately seizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Police -- some in green uniforms, others in T-shirts and shorts --
grabbed the banner and later dragged one man away from the scene by
his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people were rounded up Saturday morning, and more were
expected to be picked up as the daily displays of civil
disobedience continued in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police were stopping and questioning some suspected members,
including two middle-aged women who were hustled away by officers
although they apparently were not involved in protests.
</P>
<P>
   On the northwest corner of the square, a pair of women held up a
yellow banner with one of the sect's names, ''Falun Dafa,'' in red
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
   The banner was up for about 20 seconds -- an eternity compared to
most protests -- before police swooped in and grabbed the women by
their arms and confiscated the banner.
</P>
<P>
   One middle-aged woman walking by with her family spotted the
banner and yelled ''Arrest them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the government banned the sect one year ago, police have
been detaining members and state-run media have been denouncing the
group in a fierce smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers on Saturday ran a commentary by the official
Xinhua News Agency that said Falun Gong is a ''poisonous torrent''
that is ''anti-humanity'' and ''anarchistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua said the group's exiled leader, Li Hongzhi, has
encouraged followers to break the law and demonstrate, resulting in
a recent increase in illegal gatherings at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong followers have traveled from around China to Beijing
this month to carry on their civil disobedience campaign. In recent
weeks, police have detained about 200 followers daily in Tiananmen
Square, according to a Communist Party official.
</P>
<P>
   Founded eight years ago, Falun Gong attracted millions of
followers, drawn by its blend of slow-motion exercises and ideas
drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and its founder, an ex-government grain
clerk. Followers say practice promotes health, moral living and, in
experts, supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has called Falun Gong an unprecedented threat to
communist rule. It has accused Falun Gong of cheating followers and
causing 1,500 deaths, mostly of followers who it said refused
medical treatment according to what it claims are the group's
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Police have become efficient in cracking down on protests in
Tiananmen Square. Equipped with binoculars and walkie-talkies, they
quickly can spot Falun Gong members who protest by sitting in the
lotus position. Within minutes, the protesters are apprehended and
hauled into police vans and driven away.
</P>
<P>
   Blistering hot weather Saturday made the job difficult for the
police because their views were obstructed by hundreds of visitors
carrying umbrellas, which Chinese use to block the sun.
</P>
<P>
   After plainclothes police grabbed one man sitting cross-legged,
they took a camera away from a foreign tourist who was taking
pictures in the area. They took the film out of the camera and
exposed it to daylight, ruining the photos. The police walked away,
ignoring the tourist's protests.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Changes Voter Registration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) -- Dick Cheney walked into the county clerk's
office alone, changed his voter registration from Texas to Wyoming
and boosted his chances of becoming George W. Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   If Cheney had kept his registration in Texas, where he now lives
and where Bush is governor, he might be prohibited from sharing the
Republican ticket. The 12th Amendment of the Constitution forbids
Electoral College members in Texas from voting for both the
president and vice president who are ''inhabitants'' of their
state.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the voter registration change just in time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the deadline to register to vote in the Aug. 22
primary in Wyoming, where Cheney grew up and went to school and
where he served as a representative to Congress. Cheney filled out
the paperwork around 11 a.m., said Teton County Election
Administrator Sharon Nethercott.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has a home in Jackson Hole and spends considerable time
there, according to Wyoming Secretary of State Joe Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   The change in registration was the first signal that Bush is
seriously considering the former defense secretary as his running
mate, two highly placed GOP officials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has not finalized his decision but will do so this
weekend while pondering the decision in the privacy of his Texas
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   News that Cheney, who has headed Bush's vice presidential search
team, is a leading candidate surprised two friends.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Scarlett said Cheney has said he is not interested in
being vice president. A Republican National Convention delegate,
Scarlett said she has known the Cheneys more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled with the possibility and grateful he would
consider,'' Scarlett said. ''I think he would be a very strong
candidate in his own right for whatever office he chose to run for.
I think for the nation and for all of us it would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Larimer, a Republican national committeewoman who is
co-chair of the upcoming GOP national convention, said there has
been no talk around Philadelphia about Cheney's chances of becoming
Bush's running mate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Regrets Marine Attack  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- President Clinton told Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori on Saturday that a recent attack on a local
girl by a U.S. Marine ''hurt me in the heart,'' a Japanese official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed regret over the incident when the two leaders
met at the Group of Eight economic summit, according to a spokesman
for the Japanese delegation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the Japanese considered Clinton's comments an
apology. A White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Clinton ''just expressed a general regret that
incidents like this have happened,'' but did not discuss specifics
of the latest case because it is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   During their meeting, Clinton and Mori agreed Japan would reduce
the amount it pays for U.S. bases located in Okinawa, the official
said. They also agreed to extend for a fourth year trade talks on a
broad range of business sectors, from telecommunications to
financial services and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   While the American military presence has helped the economy,
Okinawans angrily blame U.S. troops for crimes ranging from thefts
and assaults to rapes and killings. Local ire flared anew after an
unidentified 19-year-old Marine was arrested July 3 for entering a
private home, crawling into a 14-year-old girl's bed and fondling
her in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman quoted Clinton as telling Mori, ''Most of the
troops have been good neighbors, but the incident hurt me in the
heart.'' The president was scheduled to address U.S. troops at the
Camp Foster Marine base Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival Friday, Clinton promised the citizens of
Okinawa that the United States would ''reduce our footprint on this
island'' and follow through with the process begun five years ago
of consolidating U.S. military bases here. ''We take seriously our
responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the
United States when we do not meet that responsibility,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Clinton offered Mori assurances on U.S. troop
discipline, deputy national security adviser Jim Steinberg said
Mori thanked Clinton for his statement ''about the importance of
good neighborliness,'' and that Clinton ''indicated this was
something that we were deeply committed to and that we would
continue to take every measure that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Okinawa since
Dwight Eisenhower made a one-day stop in 1960. The United States
returned control of the southern islands to Tokyo in 1972 but still
maintains a high military profile. Military bases occupy about 20
percent of Okinawa, and are home to 26,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley and Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston, the
commander of the U.S. Marines on Okinawa, already apologized to
Japanese officials for the incident before Clinton's arrival, and
imposed a late-night curfew and drinking ban on soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, one day before Clinton's arrival, tens of thousands
of Japanese demonstrators held hands around the Kadena U.S.
military base to demand the reduction of bases and U.S. servicemen.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Monks Nix Changes  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- President Chandrika Kumaratunga's hope
to end the war with Tamil Tiger rebels has hit a new snag, with Sri
Lanka's powerful Buddhist monks opposing the government's proposed
constitutional changes to allow Tamils more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sri Lanka's Buddhist clergy generally preach
nonviolence, they have urged the government to carry on its war
against Tamil militants. They say the country's minority Tamils,
who are mostly Hindus, should not be given any special privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The monks said Friday they would oppose the government's
proposed draft constitution, to be presented to Parliament before
Aug. 24, because it makes too many concessions to the Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is unacceptable to us and we reject it,'' Maduluwawe
Sobitha, president of the National Council of the Buddhist Clergy,
told The Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan betrays Buddhism,'' Sobitha said, expressing fear
that under the proposed constitution Buddhism would lose its status
as the dominant religion in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Monks in Sri Lanka -- where 76 percent of the people follow the
teachings of Buddha -- wield immense influence.
</P>
<P>
   Tamils make up 3.2 million of the country's 18.6 million people,
and Tamil rebels have been fighting for 17 years for an independent
homeland in the north and east. The war has claimed 62,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the new constitution have not been made public, but
general outlines have been discussed. The government and the main
opposition United National Party have agreed on the constitutional
changes and they have enough votes to pass it in Parliament before
the session ends and elections are called.
</P>
<P>
   But the government needs broad support to make the plan work.
</P>
<P>
   It already has been rejected by Tamil political parties and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels. The parties say the draft
constitution does not give regions enough autonomy. The rebels say
they will settle for nothing less than a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddhist monks have told Kumaratunga, who wants to end the
war, to finish the rebels off militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now advise you to act as a patriotic head of state by
ceasing all negotiations immediately, crushing this cruel terrorism
without delay by the use of state power. Toward this end you will
get our blessings,'' the country's top four monks said in a March
letter to Kumaratunga, who is a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   The letter came a month after the government announced its plan
to discuss constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also bound by the constitution, which says it
is the duty of the state to protect and foster Buddhism. The
country's 30,000 monks have influenced political decisions in the
past.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Plans More Force in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed
that the U.N. force remain in Lebanon for another six months,
provided Lebanon allows peacekeepers to deploy toward the Israeli
border and Lebanese forces strengthen their presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has said it would consent to U.N. deployment to border
areas only after Israeli violations of the U.N.-designated line of
withdrawal have been corrected. On Friday, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Israel had fixed all but two of those violations.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon also has said that it would deploy additional troops and
internal security forces to the south after Israel's violations of
the line are corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Annan issued his report on the status of the U.N. mission as
U.N. and Lebanese officers wrapped up weeks of border inspections
to check the violations and just before U.N. envoy Terje
Roed-Larsen returns to Beirut to discuss further deployment of
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on its northern
communities from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. cartographers last month drew the line between Lebanon and
Israel to confirm Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan said it was fortunate that large-scale
violence didn't break out after the unilateral withdrawal and when
Hezbollah guerrillas moved into areas formerly under control of
Israel and its allied militias.
</P>
<P>
   ''I note, in particular, that the fighters of the Lebanese
resistance conducted themselves in a controlled manner that
deserves to be acknowledged; there were no acts of vengeance as
they reclaimed the area vacated by the Israeli forces,'' Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has complained about border violations by Lebanon. It
said Thursday it has notified the United Nations of 172 violations.
The Israeli army said it had filed 49 complaints this week alone
for violations including stones and metal objects thrown at
soldiers guarding the border and at farm workers in fields nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also has called for the United Nations to fully deploy to
the border areas in line with 1978 resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan said he would recommend the Security
Council keep the mission in Lebanon for another six months ''on the
understanding that the force will be enabled to deploy and function
fully throughout its area of operation, and that the Lebanese
authorities will strengthen their own presence in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan also called for countries to contribute troops to the
current 5,075-member force. And he appealed for international
assistance to help southern Lebanon recover from the Israeli
occupation, including removing land mines and starting development
projects.

Cheney Said To Be Bush's VP Pick
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning to a respected Washington insider in the final
days of his search, George W. Bush is seriously considering former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney as his Republican running mate, two highly placed GOP
officials say. Cheney, a former House member, White House chief of staff and
defense secretary -- and head of the vice presidential search team -- changed
his voter registration Friday from Texas to Wyoming to ensure he is eligible for
the job if the governor decides to offer it, said the officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity. One said he is the leading contender. Bush said he has
not made his decision but will do so this weekend, promising to ponder ''long
and hard'' in the privacy of his Texas ranch.

China Cracks Down on Falun Gong
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Falun Gong followers marked the first anniversary of China's
ban on the group Saturday, unfurling banners and meditating in scattershot
protests that were snuffed out within seconds by legions of police. Beijing's
sprawling Tiananmen Square has been a popular venue for the protests, which
usually involve individuals or small groups. But on Saturday morning, about 25
protesters managed to raise a banner and block police from immediately seizing
it. Founded eight years ago, Falun Gong attracted millions of followers, drawn
by its blend of slow-motion exercises and ideas drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and
its founder, an ex-government grain clerk.

Israel Makes Jerusalem Concession

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The United States is promoting an Israeli-initiated
proposal to recognize Palestinian administrative control over Arab neighborhoods
of Jerusalem, in a bid to clear the most stubborn obstacle to a Camp David peace
agreement. The proposal conveyed the ''characteristic'' of Palestinian
sovereignty in the eastern area of the contested city -- a long-cherished
Palestinian goal, an Israeli Cabinet officer said in Jerusalem. Reacting coolly
to the ideas, Hassan Abdel Rahman, Washington representative of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, said Friday: ''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty
over East Jerusalem, there is not a ground for an agreement.''

Americans increase Hispanic donations. The formal agreement, signed Friday in
Mexico City, was not necessary from the American point of view, given that the
U.S. network regularly shares information with other nations. But Mexican
authorities wanted to establish a formal relationship. The agreement is meant to
help Mexico's National Transplant Council develop a nationwide system for

<HEADLINE> Danforth Clears Feds Regarding Waco  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- After a 10-month independent investigation, a
former senator has concluded that the blame for the catastrophe at
Waco that killed 80 people rests solely with Branch Davidian cult
leader David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no doubts in my mind,'' Special Counsel John
Danforth said Friday. ''This is not a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth concluded with ''100 percent certainty'' that federal
agents did not start the fire or shoot at cult members during the
1993 inferno. The government also did not improperly use the
military and did not engage in a major cover-up, Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   While the 152-page preliminary report marked the second time in
a week that federal agents were exonerated, Danforth said he was
still investigating the decision of an unnamed FBI agent and
lawyers to deny for six years that three pyrotechnic tear gas
canisters were used on the final day of the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Republican senator from Missouri was appointed by
Attorney General Janet Reno last September to investigate the siege
after the government acknowledged, following years of denials, that
it used pyrotechnic tear gas canisters during the final assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the government did nothing evil on April 19, 1993,
its failure to fully and openly disclose to the American public all
that it did has fueled speculation that it actually committed bad
acts on that day,'' Danforth said in his report.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that the pyrotechnic devices were fired four hours
before the fire and had nothing to do with the destruction of the
Branch Davidian complex in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The blame rests squarely on the shoulders of David Koresh,''
Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Also unresolved is what happened to the shells and pyrotechnic
projectiles that are missing from evidence. Danforth said he would
continue to investigate those questions and did not rule out the
possibility of criminal charges after his final report is issued,
in about 3&AMP;frac12; months.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth cleared Reno and other top government officials of any
responsibility for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said:
''Today's independent review sheds further light on the truth and
discredits many of the unsubstantiated allegations that have skewed
the public's perception of the events of April 19, 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, FBI Director Louis Freeh was heartened by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple truth, as the FBI has maintained since April 19,
1993, has been unmistakingly confirmed again today -- the FBI fired
no shots on that day and the Davidians started the fire that
ultimately engulfed the compound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Danforth investigation was done by 17 private
lawyers and 38 postal investigators to make sure it was independent
of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he expects to spend $11 million to $12 million.
About 900 witnesses were interviewed, and 2.3 million pages of
documents were examined.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, a five-member jury in a civil trial in Waco decided
that the government was not responsible. The ruling came in a $675
million wrongful-death suit brought by surviving cult members and
the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, who represented several survivors and relatives at
the trial, said the Danforth report ''failed to address the
obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If their conduct was so right,'' Clark asked, ''how did it end
so very wrong, with so many deaths?''
</P>
<P>
   Clark added that Danforth's report, along with the jury verdict,
only reinforces dangerous law enforcement practices.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth did not address whether government agents used poor
judgment. ''This was an investigation into bad acts, not bad
judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began Feb. 28, 1993, when Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents tried to arrest Koresh. A gunfight broke out,
leaving four ATF agents and six Davidians dead, and the standoff
began.
</P>
<P>
   It ended April 19, 1993, when tanks driven by FBI agents pumped
tear gas into the compound. A fire broke out and nearly all of the
Davidians, including Koresh, died, some from the fire, some from
gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   The government has long contended the Davidians set the fire and
caused their own deaths.

<HEADLINE> G-8 leaders Focus On Third World  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- The Group of Eight industrial powers
pledged Saturday to help poor nations join the information
technology revolution so they can one day leave the Third World
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the last G-8 summit President Clinton will attend
with the leaders of Japan, Italy, Britain, Germany, France, Canada
and Russia, the leaders agreed to pool efforts to expand Internet
access and make it more affordable in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone should be able to enjoy access to information and
communications networks,'' a charter signed by the members said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also said governments should avoid regulating
information technology too tightly, and they pledged protections
for intellectual property rights in cyberspace. A task force will
report on the success of its efforts at next year's G-8 summit in
Genoa, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   --Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and Clinton agreed to
extend for a fourth year trade talks on a broad range of business
sectors, from telecommunications to financial services and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton said he would leave Okinawa a few hours early on Sunday
to return to the Mideast peace talks being held at Camp David in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton questioned North Korea's reported offer during its
summit this week with Russia to abandon its missile program in
exchange for help in launching space satellites. ''It is not clear
to me what the offer is...what is being requested in return,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Japanese officials said Clinton expressed regret over a recent
attack by a drunken U.S. Marine on an Okinawan girl that rekindled
opposition to the many American military bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the G-8 leaders congratulated themselves for the
robust global economy and marveled at the distance traveled since
the Asian financial crisis of three years ago. With the notable
exception of Japan, many of the hardest-hit crisis countries are
staging strong recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 leaders said while prospects for world economic growth
have improved, there are worries that a huge run-up in oil prices
could spoil the good times.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also promised to share global prosperity with poor
countries, speeding up the process of forgiving their heavy burden
of debt or at least rescheduling payments under more favorable
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting on the Okinawa island of semitropical beaches and coral
reefs, the leaders began the day Saturday by planting a new, local
pine tree in front of the summit venue, the seaside Bankoku Shinryo
conference hall. It was built for the summit and named after the
inscription on a 15th century bell, which in Japanese means ''a
bridge between nations.''
</P>
<P>
   During a private meting with the Japanese prime minister,
Clinton said he regrets such incidents as the recent alleged attack
on a teen-age Okinawan girl by a drunken 19-year-old Marine. The
man allegedly broke into the girl's home on July 3, crawled into
her bed and fondled her.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother removed her screaming daughter from the bed,
and the unidentified serviceman was later arrested as he slept
there.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, one day before Clinton arrived in Okinawa for the
G-8 summit, tens of thousands of Japanese held hands around the
Kadena U.S. military base to demand the reduction of bases and U.S.
servicemen.

<HEADLINE> Former Nassau Democratic chair sentenced to 8 years in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) - Former Nassau Democratic County Chair
Stephen Sabbeth, who was convicted in March 1999 of bankruptcy
fraud, was sentenced to 97 months in prison Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth is to remain free on bail until September 22, when he
must surrender at a facility to be named later. The eight-year,
one-month sentence is on a money laundering charge. He was also
given five 60-month sentences, to be served concurrently, on other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Sabbeth was charged in an 11-count indictment with
concealing more than $750,000 from creditors before declaring the
family's lumber business bankrupt in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Sabbeth will have three years to repay
$125,000 to the banks he was convicted of defrauding.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth chaired the Nassau Democratic Party from 1993 until his
resignation last year, a few weeks after his conviction.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Decries Anti-Missile System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea lashed out at Japan on
Saturday for backing Washington's proposed anti-missile defense
system, calling its island neighbor ''cancer in the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the biggest destabilizing military factor in East Asia
is the development of the 'Theater Missile Defense' system jointly
stepped up by the United States and Japan,'' the North's official
foreign news outlet, KCNA, said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
   It accused Japan of trying to gain military supremacy in East
Asia through the missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proves that Japan is the most unstable state in the world
that sparks a new arms race,'' said the commentary, monitored in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, the communist North shocked East Asia by
test-firing a long-range missile that flew over Japan and landed in
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il this week in Pyongyang, later indicated that North
Korea may abandon its missile program in exchange for help in
putting peaceful satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The North's missile program is one of the reasons the United
States wants to build its missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   KCNA accused the United States and Japan of fabricating missile
threats from the North to justify their missile defense program.
North Korea says its rocket programs were meant for peaceful
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations, including Russia, China, France and Germany, have
criticized the proposed defense system as a potential threat to the
goal of global disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. missile defense would require an amendment to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans national missile
defenses. Russia already has refused to approve such a change.

<HEADLINE> India Floods Spur 20,000 Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDERABAD, India (AP) -- A swollen river in southern India
overflowed its banks and blocked roads, cutting off 50 villages and
prompting officials to move 20,000 people to safety, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Godavari River has inundated low-lying parts
of Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh state, 280 miles northeast of
the state capital, Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods, said
Relief Commissioner Bhaskar Prasad. There have been no reports of
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Two air force helicopters and 25 motor launches were used to
evacuate the marooned people and to provide food and water to
others, he said. Officials set up 33 relief camps in the area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Incessant rains in Andhra Pradesh and neighboring Mahrashtra --
where the Godavari originates -- have caused the river to rise over
the danger mark in several places. The floods damaged roads,
uprooted trees and disrupted communication links.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilgrim town of Bhadrachalam, 280 miles northeast of
Hyderabad, roads were under five feet of water and the famous Hindu
Rama temple was flooded, he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kohl Probe To End in Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Prosecutors looking into criminal charges against
Helmut Kohl for his role in a party financing scandal will end
their investigation soon and levy a $96,000 fine on the former
chancellor, a magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Der Spiegel reported that while Bonn prosecutors believe they
have gathered enough evidence to prove breach of trust charges,
they say Kohl's independent fund-raising action to compensate for
fines caused by his illegally received donations demonstrates he
has tried to set things right.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bonn prosecutor's office, Bernd Koenig,
declined to comment on the report, saying by telephone that a
decision on ending the investigation could likely take several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl admitted in December that he accepted some $960,000 in
anonymous donations in the 1990s, saying the money was given to
help his party in former communist East Germany. He has steadfastly
refused to name the donors, despite demands from his own Christian
Democratic party and parliament investigators, saying he gave his
word.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's attorney said earlier this week that the ex-chancellor
would be willing to pay a fine for his role in the scandal if
prosecutors closed the case, allowing him to avoid a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kohl launched an independent fund-raising
campaign to cover potential fines for his anonymous donations. Last
month, he transferred the more than $3.8 million collected so far
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   The first fines against the party directly related to Kohl's
actions came this week, when parliament president Wolfgang Thierse
ordered the Christian Democrats to repay the amount Kohl illegally
collected by Aug. 21. Under sanctions provided by German law, the
Christian Democrats also must forfeit twice the amount accepted by
Kohl -- or $2.1 million -- in matching campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   As Kohl looks to escape the scandal without going to trial, he
also gained further support for his return to a greater role in his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Joining calls of other party members, the governor of Hesse
state also told Spiegel that Kohl should be speak again at public
events.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl is a ''pillar of the Christian Democratic party and its
history,'' Roland Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has been invited to an Oct. 3 ceremony in Dresden on the
10th anniversary of German reunification -- his crowning achievement
-- but has not been asked to speak.

<HEADLINE> China TV Program Gets Taiwanese Host  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Prominent Taiwanese political commentator
Li Ao is the host of a new show on China's state-run television,
and he says this is a sign Chinese leaders are becoming more
tolerant of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute program, which aired Friday on Central Television,
was the first time a Taiwanese was the host of a Chinese public
affairs program.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese station picked Li to be the host of the program
because it believed he would ''speak the truth and harbor no
malice,'' said the writer and historian, who ran for president last
March for the small pro-China New Party. Li won about 1 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Li said he hoped the weekly program can help resolve the
deep-rooted misunderstandings between Taiwanese and Chinese
resulting from five decades of separation. The two sides split amid
civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless they are crazy, no rulers would like to aim their
machine guns at people or forbid them to speak out,'' Li told The
Associated Press. ''They did so only when they feel insecure and
fear unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Li was born in China and fled to Taiwan with Gen. Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists after the communists took over the
mainland. He was jailed for years for criticizing Chiang's
authoritarian government.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, who favors eventual reunification with China, has a
talk show on Taiwanese cable television. Although many Taiwanese
don't share his views, they watch his program for his sharp, witty
comments about Taiwanese politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The communists have been reasonable and patient about
Taiwan,'' Li told the AP. ''They are reluctant to use force, and
all they want is Taiwan's verbal commitment to be a part of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the rival governments to an estranged couple, Li said
China would allow Taiwan to have extramarital affairs but would
never approve a formal divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In the Friday program, Li said he supported the formula of ''one
China, two systems'' proposed by China as a model for
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system -- used for the former British colony of Hong
Kong after its handover to China in 1997 -- Taiwan would be given
autonomy for 50 years. But most polls say Taiwanese oppose it
because they fear they would lose their political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two sides can compete under the formula to see which does
better,'' Li said. ''It would allow us to stall on the issue.
Things change so fast and who knows what will happen 50 years
later?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Li said he also told the Chinese audience not to feel hurt by
the snobbish Taiwanese who like to show off their wealth when
visiting the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese are to be blamed for the poverty of their Chinese
compatriots, which was partly caused by Chiang's shipment of
920,000 ounces of gold from the China to Taiwan when he fled to the
mainland, Li said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many understandings resulting from political
biases,'' Li said. ''I am the first one to speak the truth across
the Strait.''

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns of Nazi Web Hit List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Neo-Nazis are targeting left-wing representatives
and foreigners for attacks by publishing lists on the Internet with
their names, addresses and photographs, German justice officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   There have not yet been any attacks on people named in the
lists, also published in extremist periodicals, Urlich Kersten,
head of Germany's main domestic law enforcement agency, told the
Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an article to be published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The director of that agency, the Bundeskriminalamt, told the
Mitteldeutsche Zeitung newspaper that the greatest risk of violence
is in eastern Germany. Manfred Klink said a study showed that 40
percent of neo-Nazi motivated crimes took place in the former East
Germany -- despite its accounting for only 19 percent of the
reunified Germany's population.

<P>
   Meanwhile, police said a mosque in the town of Uetersen, about
18 miles west of Hamburg, was the target of a failed arson attempt
early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The motive and identity of the suspects, who threw a Molotov
cocktail at the building, wasn't known, but witnesses saw two
people driving away on a motor scooter.
</P>
<P>
   The fire extinguished itself and caused about $475 in damage to
the building.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani criticizes state and federal spraying restrictions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - State and federal environmental groups are tying
the city's hands in its fight against the West Nile virus by
blocking the use of pesticides in wetlands and other marsh areas,
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor criticized the National Parks Service, for preventing
spraying inside the Gateway National Recreation Area, and the state
Department of Environmental Conservation, for strictly enforcing a
federal prohibition on the use of pesticides in ponds and wetlands
elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that danger to human life is more important
than birds, fish and insects,'' Giuliani said Friday. ''We catch
fish to eat them, so if we lose a few fish to save human lives, I
don't understand,'' he said, acknowledging that spraying the city's
pesticide, Anvil, over water would kill aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Parks Service said it would allow the city to
spray in the Staten Island section of Gateway at the same time it
sprays Staten Island and northern Queens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Johnson, deputy assistant administrator for the
Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, said the agency
would consider granting the city an emergency waiver allowing the
city to spray Anvil over water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal and our desire is to make sure we are providing
complete health protection,'' Johnson told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said Friday that the West Nile virus had killed
a blue jay in Douglaston, Queens, and a crow and a sparrow in the
Great Kills and Bay Terrace sections of Staten Island during the
first week of July.
</P>
<P>
   The dead birds are among five identified in the city this year
that were infected by the virus, which was responsible for 62
confirmed cases, including seven deaths, last fall.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said 29 birds had been killed by the
virus this year, including five crows in Rockland County and a blue
jay in Westchester County. Also, a mosquito carrying the virus was
found in Orange County and infected mosquitoes were detected in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying has already begun in parts of New Jersey and in Staten
Island and Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk counties in New York.
New Jersey health officers in five counties are scheduled next week
to begin ''active surveillance'' of hospitals for possible cases of
West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in humans this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is most problematic for children under 5, the elderly
and people with weakened immune systems. Otherwise, it causes
flulike symptoms in healthy adults.

<HEADLINE> Owner wants to put fire-breathing dragon atop pizza parlor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAPLES, N.Y. (AP) - A businessman trying to win permission to
place a remote-control, fire-breathing dragon atop his pizza parlor
wants the village to reimburse him almost $2,600 in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Gallo drew 200 people to a public hearing before the
village planning board in mid-July by handing out 100 free ''Fire
Up the Dragon'' T-shirts, sending a giant dragon puppet cruising
the streets and hiring musicians to play ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, who owns Luigi's on Main Street, now thinks the village
board steered him down a fruitless path. He wants to be reimbursed
$2,596.69.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo claims the planning board is asking for too much
information and putting off making a decision. ''I believe now I'm
being played,'' he said in Friday's Daily Messenger of Canandaigua.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo first presented his idea over a year ago to house a dragon
atop Luigi's. The steel likeness would live in a den on the roof
but move to the front of the building every 30 minutes each
evening, when it would roar and spew forth a 10-foot flame.
</P>
<P>
   His application before the village planning board in April led
to a review by a county planning board. The county denied his
request, saying the dragon would distract drivers, and recommended
that the village's Zoning Board of Appeals decide if the dragon is
a sign.
</P>
<P>
   According to village zoning law, signs are not allowed atop
buildings. Because Gallo refuses to treat the dragon as a sign, the
village believed he had to be referred to its planning board. But
Gallo thinks that was a redundant step that wasted his money.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he should have been sent directly to the village's
Zoning Board of Appeals, which is responsible for interpreting his
creation and deciding whether he should be given a variance.

<HEADLINE> Angola Church Seeks Cease-fire  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRIO SIONA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Wrapping up a four-day peace conference,
Angola's religious leaders urged the government and UNITA rebels to
declare a cease-fire as a first step toward ending their protracted
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released late Friday, the church also asked the
longtime foes to promote a broad dialogue in which civil society
may play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ''This endless war continues to destroy the country, to decimate
its people and to widen the gulf of hatred between Angolans, making
reconciliation ever harder,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's civil war began when Portugal granted the Southwest
African country independence in 1975. Three peace deals have since
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of fighting was ignited in December 1998 as a
U.N.-brokered pact unraveled amid lingering hostilities and
breaches of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress for Peace marked the climax of an intensive
campaign, led by the church, for both sides to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   International observers and senior politicians joined the
initiative, as well as grass-roots movements -- a sign that Angola's
civil society is growing bolder and its voice louder.
</P>
<P>
   Public dissent has mostly been stifled as President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos' party, the MPLA, has ruled the country with an iron
fist since independence.
</P>
<P>
   News editors also have been led to self-censorship at times
because dozens of journalists were harassed and jailed since the
government imposed a blackout on war reporting after the resumption
of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Press freedom also was discussed at the peace congress and news
organizations were urged to contribute to the search for peace by
''transmitting the spirit of forgiveness, tolerance, fraternity,
peace and moral principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference opened with a message from Pope John Paul II, who
urged the government and UNITA to negotiate in a bold and
courageous way, so Angolans may finally know peace.
</P>
<P>
   The war has killed, maimed and uprooted millions of people.
Currently, an estimated 1 million people -- nearly a tenth of the
population -- rely on international aid, which has become less
abundant because donor countries are weary of funding relief
programs in a country with a 25-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Food deliveries have also been hampered by fighting, road
ambushes and land mines which were laid anew by both the government
and UNITA, a Portuguese-language acronym for the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Angola signed the Mine Ban treaty in 1997. Members of the peace
congress also urged both sides to respect that commitment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denounces GOP Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton contended Saturday that tax
cuts sought by the Republican-led Congress over the past two years
are so enormous they would ''completely erase'' the projected
budget surplus and disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have the chance to pass responsible tax cuts as we
continue to pursue solid economic policy,'' the president said in
his weekly radio address. ''But instead of following this sensible
path that got us here, congressional Republicans are treating this
surplus as if they won it in the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP's radio response, Sen. Rod Grams laid out a case for
Clinton to reconsider his threat to veto recently passed bills
intended to ease the income tax marriage penalty and repeal
inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single dollar of that surplus was created by the
American taxpayers and a strong economy,'' said Grams, R-Minn.
''It's the workers' property. It doesn't belong to the White House
or Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited a White House analysis released Saturday that
estimated the 10-year cost of major tax cuts passed or moving in
the Republican-led Congress at $712 billion. Because the public
debt would also be paid back in a slower pace, the White House
analysis predicted higher interest costs would raise the overall
price tag of the tax cuts to $913 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the GOP's $792 billion tax cut Clinton vetoed last
year, which contained many of the tax measures moving again this
year, the total comes to almost $1.8 trillion over 10 years,
including additional debt interest of $349 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taken together, the tax cuts passed last year and this year by
this Congress would completely erase the entire projected surplus
over 10 years,'' the president said in his address, taped during a
visit to Japan. ''The majority seems to have forgotten that
projections in a report are not the same as dollars in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The total projected surplus is actually much larger, but
Republicans and Democrats alike have committed to walling off money
earmarked for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Grams said, however, that ample room is available in the
non-Social Security surplus -- $2.17 trillion over 10 years,
including Medicare -- to cut taxes rather than to allow extra
revenue collections to pay for bigger government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxpayers fund every agency, program, project and bureaucrat,
yet somehow they're the most used, abused and underappreciated
people in America,'' Grams said. ''The Republican Congress believes
that Americans already spend too much of their money paying
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed that a portion of the surplus could go back to
taxpayers, but he said the GOP proposals would disproportionately
benefit the wealthy. A Treasury Department analysis shows that the
major tax cuts passed by the House this year would give 27.5
percent of the benefits, or $18 billion a year, to people with the
top 1 percent in annual incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we should have tax cuts this year, but they should be the
right ones, targeted to working families that help our economy grow
-- not tax breaks that help only a few while putting our prosperity
at risk,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Less costly tax cuts, Clinton added, would enable some of the
surplus to be spent on a Medicare prescription drug benefit,
efforts to keep Social Security solvent and pay off the public debt
by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the resources. What we need is a common vision that
extends beyond the November elections and a commitment to benefit
all Americans, not just a few,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Grams said the claim that the tax cuts are skewed to the wealthy
is ''just plain rhetoric, not reality. A young family struggling to
meet the mortgage and pay for their kid's braces is by no means
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Clinton, we're asking you to put aside election-year
politics and help families live the American dream,'' Grams added.
''If you do your part and sign the bills we have sent you, ...
Americans can keep a little more of their hard-earned money.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The inheritance tax repeal is H.R. 8. The marriage penalty bill
is H.R. 4810.

<HEADLINE> ADA 10 years old  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Ten years ago Wednesday, then-President
George Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Robles, at the time a student at Rutgers University, knew
just what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went out for a few drinks. That's the way we celebrated in
college,'' said Robles, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury in
his teens when he fell out of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were ecstatic,'' he said of the ADA, turning serious.
''People with disabilities finally had something to hang their hat
on.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Robles, now 33, is deputy executive director of
the state Office on Disability Services.
</P>
<P>
   If he needs to, he can take a handicapped accessible NJ Transit
train and bus to his Trenton office from his Edison home.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ADA's enactment, Robles remembers having to book far
in advance for one of NJ Transit's rare accessible buses, if one
was available at all.
</P>
<P>
   It was relatively easy for a wheelchair-bound student to
maneuver at Elizabeth High School, where he attended, but ''the
city itself needed a lot of work,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Later at Rutgers, Robles and fellow disabled students fought for
things that now seem simple - ramps and an electronic door at the
student center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, thank goodness, when I go on a date with my wife or
take my daughter to Chuck E. Cheese, I feel more comfortable
leaving my house than I did 10 years ago,'' Robles said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Robles recognizes that the disabled still face
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA is a civil rights law that guarantees disabled people
equal opportunity in employment, public accommodations,
transportation, state and local government and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Even through the ADA has been on the books for 10 years, Clara
R. Smit, an East Brunswick attorney who specializes in representing
deaf clients, remains busy fighting to make sure the law is
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Her cases have included an engaged couple who demanded an
interpreter at their Newark City Hall wedding and hospital patients
who insisted on an interpreter when hospital staff offered only to
write instructions.
</P>
<P>
   There are still employers, restaurant owners, public officials
and others who resist full compliance with the law, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the ADA has been very successful in opening up doors.
However, we have a long way to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Soden, 39, of Long Branch, is a service coordinator for
an independent living center.
</P>
<P>
   He can relate to his disabled clients, for he has cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Soden agreed with Smit that some nondisabled people just don't
understand. For instance, a few years ago, Soden called for a taxi
to take him to work on a rainy day. He explained to the dispatcher
that he was not a ''patient,'' but a commuter with extra baggage, a
roughly 20-pound foldable wheelchair. The taxi company still
refused to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got so mad I called the Department of Justice,'' he said.
''But all I wanted was for the owner to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ''I eventually got what I was looking for,'' Soden said. ''An
apology and an acknowledgment that I was just an individual looking
for a ride to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing is also difficult for disabled residents to find, Soden
said. There is a one- to five-year waiting list for accessible
housing that is affordable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm one of the very fortunate ones,'' he said of his secure
job and nearby housing.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Ellis, executive director of the New Jersey Developmental
Disabilities Council, also has cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, whose agency is a watchdog over state social services
program, said New Jersey state government is one of the worst
violators of the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Community Affairs has a handicapped parking
spot in front of their building, but it's a 15-minute drop off. Did
you ever hear of a 15-minute meeting in state government?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, ''In the private sector, it's done wonders,'' he
said of the law.
</P>
<P>
   More young disabled people are employed, more shopping malls and
theaters are accessible, and more car rentals offer vehicles with
hand controls, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Denies NC Smugglers Link  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah denied Saturday it had anything
to do with 18 people arrested in North Carolina and charged by U.S.
authorities with smuggling cigarettes to raise money for the
guerrilla group in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Beirut, the militant Shiite Muslim
group reiterated it had no affiliates outside Lebanon, ''not in
America and not anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The manner in which the report has been published and the
charges brought against (the 18) clearly points at suspicious
intentions and political goals that the American administration
aims at achieving,'' Hezbollah said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were arrested early Friday in raids of houses and
businesses in and around Charlotte, N.C., and indicted on federal
charges including immigration violations, weapons offenses, money
laundering and cigarette trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The ring allegedly bought cigarettes in North Carolina, which
has relatively low cigarette taxes of five cents a pack, and
unloaded them in Michigan, where prices are higher because of
75-cent-a-pack taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The profits were allegedly used since 1996 to smuggle money to
Hezbollah in Lebanon. An FBI affidavit did not specify how much
money the alleged scheme has funneled to the Iran-backed group.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which fought Israeli occupation troops in south
Lebanon for years before they withdrew on May 24, is on the U.S.
State Department's list of terrorist organizations.

<HEADLINE> In Wildwood, $70 million arena rising up from beach  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - To barefoot bathers, it is the Sahara by
the sea: an expanse of sand separating the ocean from the
Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of a mile wide in some places, the beaches here are
the envy of sand-starved shore towns up and down the New Jersey
coast. Shrinking space for your beach towel isn't the problem.
Getting your 2-year-old to walk all the way to the water is.
</P>
<P>
   It's so big, it has played host to beach events unthinkable
elsewhere in New Jersey. There have been rodeos, golf tournaments
and Boy Scout jamborees, not to mention permanent fixtures like
monster truck rides, amusement piers and water parks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state is building a $70 million convention center on
the beach. Not overlooking the beach. On it.
</P>
<P>
   Many locals see the 72,000-square-foot exhibition hall, now
being built by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, as a
kind of economic savior.
</P>
<P>
   With ballrooms, meeting areas and retail outlets, it will play
host to trade shows, civic events, concerts and sports when it
opens in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority officials and civic leaders say its location
will be the biggest selling point to conventioneers and meeting
planners.
</P>
<P>
   They, and project architects, say the building will be able to
withstand whatever Mother Nature throws at it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks it's such a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''With what we know today about beaches and their mobility, to
willingly go out and build more things on the beach is not the
brightest move,'' said Stewart Farrell, a beach erosion expert at
the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. ''They're rolling the
dice with public money.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds D.W. Bennett, executive director of the American Littoral
Society: ''I wouldn't predict a long life for this structure. It's
in harm's way - period.''
</P>
<P>
   The plans, which have been approved by the state Department of
Environmental Protection, call for the structure to be built on the
architectural equivalent of stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began last October.
</P>
<P>
   Already, more than 2,900 chemically-fortified wood pilings have
been driven 35 feet deep into the beach. Capped with concrete, the
pilings were then topped with 10-foot tall concrete columns. The
columns, which are each 2 feet square, will support the floor of
the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Sykes of Atlantic City, who was hired as the local
architect by Seattle designers LMN Architects, said the convention
center's design will allow it to withstand wind, waves and whatever
else comes its way.
</P>
<P>
   The Boardwalk entrance to the building - and the floor of the
hall itself - will be flush with the Boardwalk, about 16 feet above
the beach, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   That way, even in a hurricane or Nor'easter, ocean water that
reaches the building will flow underneath, hitting only the
concrete columns, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, dunes and snow fences have been erected on three of
the site's four sides. The dunes, reinforced with dune grass, will
grow naturally over time, helping to minimize the velocity of
waves, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   Built to standards set by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, or FEMA, the building's lowest horizontal structure will be
14 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Its sides will be made of high-strength tensile fabric suspended
from five giant steel girders that form the vaulted roof of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes won't guarantee that the building is invincible, but he's
confident it will stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beach is getting bigger, it satisfies all the FEMA
requirements, it's consistent with the pier development philosophy,
it fronts on the busiest, most popular street in town - the
Boardwalk - it has uninterrupted services from the street and it's
surrounded by dunes,'' he said Wednesday, while giving a tour of
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could have two feet of water in the streets of Wildwood,
and this building will still be dry,'' Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Duane Sloan says that in the event of a catastrophic
storm, Wildwood will have bigger problems than a wet convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the concern is a storm, and the water were to get to the
height of the Boardwalk, the entire island would be underwater.
It'd be a disaster area anyway. I've never known the water to get
as high as the planking. If it's only under the Boardwalk, it's
only going to be under the convention center.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Totah, a marine biologist who lives near the convention
center site, says it should have been built downtown, to spur
development in rundown parts of Wildwood.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic access and limited public parking around the site will
hamper its effectiveness, Totah said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, the convention center will stand as a monument to how
the system failed, to government stupidity. Certain people thought
it would look good on the beach. It's not helping the town and it
goes against everything we should be doing on our beaches,'' Totah
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Hall, a professor of marine and geological sciences at
Rider University, calls the plan ridiculous.

years, but we might get a major storm before that. In that case,
the water will wash the sand right out from under it and you'll

   ''We're using that as the major selling point for conferences

duplicate the fact that you can walk outside and be right on the
beach. That's what's selling the building.''

<HEADLINE> China Falun Gong Arrests Continue  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Hustling peaceful protesters into vans, Chinese
police cracked down Saturday on Falun Gong members who marked the
first anniversary of the banning of their meditation group with
banners and brief displays of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   One plainclothes policeman dragged away a woman by the ankles as
an officer in a green uniform gripped a clump of her hair in
crowded Tiananmen Square, one of China's most famous tourist sites
and a popular venue for Falun Gong protests.
</P>
<P>
   In past demonstrations, the group has been able to mobilize
large numbers of protesters, and there was anticipation that the
sect would orchestrate a big turnout Saturday to defiantly mark the
one-year ban.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the scattered protests Saturday involved individuals
or small groups unfurling banners or sitting down in the square
cross-legged in the lotus posture. About 100 people were rounded up
during the morning, the most popular time for the group to protest.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group involved about 25 people who successfully
blocked police from immediately seizing their banner. Police
eventually broke up the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Founded eight years ago, Falun Gong attracted millions of
followers, drawn by its blend of slow-motion exercises and ideas
drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and the group's exiled leader, Li
Hongzhi, a former government grain clerk. Followers say practice
promotes health, moral living and, in experts, supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has called Falun Gong an unprecedented threat
to communist rule. It has accused Falun Gong of cheating followers
and causing 1,500 deaths, mostly of followers who it said refused
medical treatment according to what it claims are the group's
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with binoculars and walkie-talkies, legions of police
patrolling Tiananmen Square often swoop down on protesters seconds
after they whip out a banner or begin meditating. Within minutes,
protesters are stuffed into police vans stationed on the margins of
the square.
</P>
<P>
   Blistering hot weather made the job difficult for the police
Saturday because their views were obstructed by hundreds of
visitors carrying umbrellas, which Chinese use to block the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they managed aggressively to nab the protesters and
disperse crowds of tourists who stopped to gawk.
</P>
<P>
   After plainclothes police grabbed one man who was sitting
cross-legged, they took a camera away from a foreign tourist who
was taking pictures in the area. They took the film out of the
camera and exposed it to daylight, ruining the photos. The police
then walked away, ignoring the tourist's protests.
</P>
<P>
   On the northwest corner of the square, a pair of women held up a
yellow banner with one of the sect's names, ''Falun Dafa,'' in red
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
   The banner was up for about 20 seconds -- an eternity compared to
most protests -- before police grabbed the women by their arms and
snatched away the banner.
</P>
<P>
   One middle-aged woman walking by with her family spotted the
banner and yelled ''Arrest them!''
</P>
<P>
   Since the government banned the sect one year ago, police have
been detaining members and state-run media have been denouncing the
group in a fierce smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers on Saturday ran a commentary by the official
Xinhua News Agency that said Falun Gong is a ''poisonous torrent''
that is ''anti-humanity'' and ''anarchistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua said Li, the exiled leader, has encouraged followers to
break the law and demonstrate, resulting in a recent increase in
illegal gatherings at Tiananmen Square.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Summit Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- Torturous topics like debt relief were on
the agenda, but a Group of Eight working lunch Saturday was
dominated by decidedly less -- or make that more -- weighty fare:
sumo wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Watching gargantuan wrestlers in loincloths was a luncheon treat
for French President Jacques Chirac, a well-known aficionado of the
ancient Japanese sport. Before arriving at the summit for leaders
of the world's richest nations, Chirac attended a sumo wrestling
tournament in Nagoya, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch, the G-8 leaders discussed the ''finer points'' of
sumo to educate those unfamiliar with the ritual of the sport, said
a European Union official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
rest of the time, they talked but reached no consensus about issues
regarding religion and cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am told there is nothing in terms of a conclusion to be
reported,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The summit leaders earned some extra pocket money for their work
at the G-8 summit this year.
</P>
<P>
   While dining on pig's ears and eel omelets at Okinawa's Shuri
Castle, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori presented each leader
with a freshly minted edition of Japan's new currency: the 2,000
yen note, worth about $18.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which went into circulation on Wednesday, was created
to commemorate the summit and the new millennium. It shows the
Shureimon gate of the castle on the front and a scene from the epic
11th century Japanese novel Tale of Genji on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally paid for the bills, which I bought from the Bank
of Japan,'' Mori told his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The first letter of the serial number on the bills matched the
first letter of each leader's country -- just in case the notes got
mixed up during dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   After enchanting millions of Japanese teenie-boppers with her
silky voice and bouncy dancing, Okinawan pop sensation Namie Amuro
tested her charms on a more decorous crowd: the G-8 heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   At a welcome ceremony hosted by local summit organizers, Amuro
pranced and crooned her way through the strains of ''Never End,''
the official summit theme song commissioned by the late Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   The song, created by Japan's hottest music producer, Tetsuya
Komuro, had traditional Okinawan instruments mixed in with the
relentless euro-pop beat.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders appeared bemused as the pop star sang: ''I must have
made a vow of love long ago so I could meet you.'' But they
probably won't join her elite club of groupies. Membership requires
wearing tattoo armbands and platform shoes.
------
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin had little chance to show off
the karate credentials he received at his first G-8 summit in
Okinawa, the birthplace of the martial art.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception for the leaders before a lavish banquet at Shuri
Castle, Okinawan karate masters demonstrated chops and kicks as the
heads of state cringed in mock terror.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president made no move to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before, Putin had been bestowed the ultimate karate
honor: a ninth-degree black belt from the master of one of the
major styles of the martial art. Putin is an accomplished judo
practitioner, but acknowledged he is no expert in karate, which
farmers initially used to defend themselves against Japanese
soldiers and tax collectors.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Approach 13-Day Standard  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- When the first Middle East summit at Camp
David took place almost 22 years ago, it took 13 days of marathon
negotiations to achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   That landmark is being passed Sunday in the Israeli-Palestinian
summit at Camp David, and it is no surprise to some analysts that
if a breakthrough is to occur, it will in all likelihood take
longer this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camp David I was a real estate deal,'' said David Schenker of
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''That was an easy
one.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat were joined by President Carter at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   On the 13th day, they came down from the mountaintop retreat to
announce a deal under which Egypt recovered the Sinai Peninsula
from Israel in exchange for Egyptian recognition of Israel. The two
sides signed a peace treaty six months later, changing forever the
political landscape of the region.
</P>
<P>
   As Schenker and other analysts point out, the current
negotiation involving Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is far more complicated. As an example,
the debate over Sinai lacked the Muslim vs. Jewish divide at the
center of the negotiations over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Schenker sees little room for optimism even if the negotiators
go well beyond the 13-day standard established at Camp David I.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a constituency on both sides which can't live with
compromise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Kipper, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said she
sees room for hope but only if President Clinton takes the
initiative when he returns Sunday night from the economic summit
meeting in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best negotiator is the president himself,'' she said.
''His team has been primarily tactical. Now it is time for a
strategic vision. ... This is the president of the United States.
His persuasive powers are limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations slowed Saturday because of the Jewish Sabbath.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was meeting with Arafat, and
there were informal discussions of core issues. The lack of a set
agenda was in keeping with the parties' religious obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper said it mattered little that the two sides failed to
agree during marathon negotiations before Clinton's departure for
Japan last week.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was nothing substantive to require the talks to
end. The decision to continue the talks has enabled the parties to
''flesh out the issues and know each other's limitations,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Djerejian, a former ambassador to Israel and Syria, sees
a potentially catastrophic outcome if the negotiations collapse and
are followed by ''action and reaction'' by the two rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Djerejian, director of the Baker Institute for Public Policy at
Rice University in Houston, said such that could happen if Arafat
were to keep his promise to declare a Palestinian state in
September and Israel responded by annexing Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could be a formula for possible violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the parties divide up East Jerusalem into something
resembling the ''borough'' system in New York City, under which
administrative authority is apportioned among five separate
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper also found merit in the concept but used the term
''pockets of sovereignty'' to describe areas the Palestinians would
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, two Israeli officials said Friday the United
States was promoting an Israeli-initiated proposal to recognize
Palestinian administrative control over Arab neighborhoods of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, Washington representative of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, dismissed the idea. ''Short of total
Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem,'' he said, ''there is
not a ground for an agreement.'' He would not say whether such a
proposal had been put on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Djerejian pointed out that Barak faces difficulties at home,
with his political base shrinking. And Arafat, he noted, has to
please not only his own constituency but also Arab leaders
everywhere, all eager to reclaim the Arab sector of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a situation that requires creativity and strong
political will,'' Djerejian said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Egyptian President Sadat was able to retrieve
the Sinai from Egypt in 1978, and this year Arafat's Arab peers
want a bigger prize -- Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's under pressure to deliver,'' Djerejian said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Sell Egypt Defense Systems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon plans to sell Egypt $882 million
in military equipment and support services to upgrade its air
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes improvements to 35 of Egypt's Apache attack
helicopters, equipment to distinguish friendly and enemy aircraft,
radar systems and support and training personnel, Defense
Department officials confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Pentagon said the proposed sale will give
Egypt better capability to attack armored vehicles, defend vital
installations and provide better close-air support for its ground
forces. It said the deal wouldn't affect the region's basic
military balance.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon agreed to sell Israel 24 AH-64 Apache
attack helicopters converted to the latest model, called the Apache
Longbow, equipped with more sophisticated targeting and radar
systems.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth school board member charged with sex assault on teen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A member of the city's Board of Education
faces sexual assault charges for allegedly having intercourse with
a teen-age girl for four years, beginning when she was 10 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   David Lewis, 33, was arrested Thursday and charged with three
counts of aggravated sexual assault on a minor. He was being held
in the Union County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Daniel Saulnier said the Lewis did not know the girl through
his position on the school board, or his position as a youth
minister at the Shiloh Baptist Church in Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to a three-year term on the board in April.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Robert Ungvary, said Lewis was falsely accused by
the girl, who is now 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand there is no physical evidence of any abuse,'' he
said. ''He vehemently denies any abuse, and there is no third party
who witnessed the abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ungvary said the girl told police the most recent assault took
place about two weeks ago. He also said Lewis has no plans to
resign from the board.

<HEADLINE> Jersey City parking officer accused of bribery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - A city parking violations officer is
accused of soliciting bribes from motorists in exchange for not
issuing summonses.
</P>
<P>
   Akema Campbell, 20, was arrested Friday and charged with bribery
and official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Police said she offered not to write tickets to violators if
they paid her the fines on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   She was suspended after her arrest and released on her own
recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only allegations, but something like this could not be
expected,'' said Parking Authority Executive Director Carmine
Venezia. ''I'm extremely disappointed, and I feel bad for the
public because it's a public trust issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Campbell patrols the city's downtown section,
looking for parking violations.
</P>
<P>
   Her arrest came about a year after another city parking officer
was charged with writing more than 400 phony tickets.

<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state closed a Waldwick home for the
elderly Friday, a day after its owners were indicted for the
alleged neglect of a senior citizen in their Rockland County, N.Y.,
boarding home.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services removed
the final three residents from the Shannon House Rest Home on
Friday, citing a lack of supervision because the owners were in the
Rockland County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Montvale couple, Maureen and Michael Culhane, were charged
Thursday with locking an 87-year-old woman in a room in their Pearl
River, N.Y., boarding home.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, New Jersey investigators shut down another of
their boarding homes for the elderly, the Hillas Vale Guest Lodge
in Montvale, because of allegedly unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Culhanes, who have pleaded not guilty to the New York
charges, were still being held Saturday on $25,000 bail each.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the 18-bed Waldwick home, where new admissions
had been banned by the state for months while it was under state
investigation, was in better condition than the Hillas Vale.
</P>
<P>
   The Culhanes could face state penalties in the Waldwick case.
They also face $10,000 fine from the state Department of Community
Affairs for refusing to allow inspectors in enter the Montvale
boarding home.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen County Prosecutor's Office has said it will
investigate possible charges stemming from the conditions in
Montvale.

<HEADLINE> One week after slur flap, first lady visits LI synagogue  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTHAMPTON BEACH, N.Y. (AP) - Seeking to calm jittery Jewish
voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared Saturday at an Orthodox
synagogue to denounce terrorism against Israel and support its
right to be free from violence.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke before an overflow crowd of about 350
people just one week after her campaign was rocked by an allegation
that she made an anti-Semitic remark in 1974. She has angrily
denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this has been a very difficult and trying week for
you,'' said Rabbi Marc Schneier, who invited and introduced
Clinton. ''It's time for us to move on. Hillary has always been a
friend of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about the ongoing Camp David peace talks, telling
her audience that ''the challenges the president and prime minister
are facing are rooted in whether or not others will give up their
hatred and their sense of violence ... in return for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have been meeting at Camp David in
efforts to reach a new Middle East peace agreement. The president,
who was in Japan for an economic summit, is due back at the talks
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke at the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton
Beach, an exclusive Long Island summer resort. Though nominally
Orthodox, the synagogue attracts a cross-section of Jewish
worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP Senate candidate, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, was scheduled to
speak at the synagogue next Saturday. Both candidates are courting
the Jewish voters who make up 12 percent of the New York
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, as dictated by religious custom, Mrs.
Clinton sat on the side of the synagogue reserved for women. She
was accompanied by a female Secret Service agent and Schneier's
wife, Toby.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit came one week after the first published
reports regarding her alleged use of an anti-Semitic remark toward
an Arkansas campaign worker in 1974. The charge appeared in ''State
of a Union,'' a new book by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry
Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, in an emotional news conference, emphatically
denied the allegation. Traditional wisdom says Mrs. Clinton needs
to win 60 percent of the Jewish vote for a November victory; she is
currently polling between 50 and 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During her appearance at the synagogue, Mrs. Clinton never
mentioned Arafat or the PLO. Instead, she focused on Barak and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, she said, have a right ''to keep their children
safe from violence and terrorism. We know in our hearts that God
has deemed their cause just ... I believe we have to support their
efforts, and particularly support what the prime minister is going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She later told the audience, ''We should rededicate ourselves to
standing against bigotry, prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism.''
But some in the audience remained unconvinced about Mrs. Clinton's
commitment to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone likes her very much,'' said temple treasurer Seymour
Siegel. ''They're just disturbed about her passion with the PLO and
her history with those causes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently referring to the first lady's embrace of
Arafat's wife, Soha, after she had made a speech accusing Israeli
troops of using poison gas on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipper Amy Gross disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she was wonderful,'' Gross said. ''I thought she's
truly hoping for the same peace we all are.''

<P>
   Clinton spoke about the ongoing Camp David peace talks, telling
her audience that ''the challenges the president and prime minister
are facing are rooted in whether or not others will give up their
hatred and their sense of violence ... in return for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have been meeting at Camp David in
efforts to reach a new Middle East peace agreement. The president,
who was in Japan for an economic summit, is due back at the talks
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke at the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton
Beach, an exclusive Long Island summer resort. Though nominally
Orthodox, the synagogue attracts a cross-section of Jewish
worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP Senate candidate, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, was scheduled to
speak at the synagogue next Saturday. Both candidates are courting
the Jewish voters who make up 12 percent of the New York
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, as dictated by religious custom, Mrs.
Clinton sat on the side of the synagogue reserved for women. She
was accompanied by a female Secret Service agent and Schneier's
wife, Toby.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit came one week after the first published
reports regarding her alleged use of an anti-Semitic remark toward
an Arkansas campaign worker in 1974. The charge appeared in ''State
of a Union,'' a new book by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry
Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, in an emotional news conference, emphatically
denied the allegation. Traditional wisdom says Mrs. Clinton needs
to win 60 percent of the Jewish vote for a November victory; she is
currently polling between 50 and 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During her appearance at the synagogue, Mrs. Clinton never
mentioned Arafat or the PLO. Instead, she focused on Barak and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, she said, have a right ''to keep their children
safe from violence and terrorism. We know in our hearts that God
has deemed their cause just ... I believe we have to support their
efforts, and particularly support what the prime minister is going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She later told the audience, ''We should rededicate ourselves to
standing against bigotry, prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism.''
But some in the audience remained unconvinced about Mrs. Clinton's
commitment to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone likes her very much,'' said temple treasurer Seymour
Siegel. ''They're just disturbed about her passion with the PLO and
her history with those causes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently referring to the first lady's embrace of
Arafat's wife, Soha, after she had made a speech accusing Israeli
troops of using poison gas on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipper Amy Gross disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she was wonderful,'' Gross said. ''I thought she's
truly hoping for the same peace we all are.''

<HEADLINE> Kuby carves niche in radio, radical lawyer biz  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Ron Kuby knows about death threats.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a radical lawyer spewing incendiary sound bites,
when you represent cop-shooters and drug-dealing gangstas, when
your mentor was eternal leftist William Kunstler - hey, the postman
knocks often. And then runs away, quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest threat - the one delivered by Sammy ''The Bull''
Gravano, Mafia killer of 19 - blindsided the ponytailed lawyer.
Kuby, representing the families of 12 Gravano victims, had sued for
a piece of the underboss' take from a best-selling book.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, unwilling to share, wanted to whack Kuby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the threats are crackpots - guys at pay phones,
messages on the answering machine,'' Kuby says, his familiar voice
proof that the Bull's plot fizzled. ''This guy is a killing
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   While the hit was uncovered by the FBI, word first filtered to
Kuby through an Arizona reporter. Kuby, dubbed a national security
risk in 1996 over his legal work, was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ''My friends in the federal government,'' he says with a smirk,
''never took the time to call.''
</P>
<P>
   It's vintage Kuby, his sense of humor intact in the face of a
mob killer. At 43, his politics and personal style still smack more
of a late night at the Fillmore East than a morning in front of the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   He's a former tugboat hand and grill cook, the spiritual
successor to the late Kunstler, a Bolshevik employed as a talk
radio host by the capitalists at Disney - sort of the eighth dwarf,
Commie.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say, 'How can you be a communist, and yet be a bought
and paid-for shill of The Disney Corporation?''' Kuby says of the
owners at WABC-AM. ''They have a point. I don't presuppose to
resolve the contradictions; I just don't try to hide them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby, fresh from his morning drive time program opposite
Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, appears quite unlawyerly in
greeting a guest to his Manhattan office: collarless flannel shirt,
faded jeans, graying hair flowing down his back.
</P>
<P>
   Life - death threats excepted - is terrific, Kuby says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of my business is the same business I've always had: the
dispossessed, the dissidents, the spit-on, the crazies, the
damaged,'' Kuby says. ''That's my clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   Other things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Kuby moved to his Broadway office after a 1996 falling out with
Kunstler's widow, who lived above his old digs. His hopes of
carrying on beneath the banner of Kunstler &AMP; Kuby, as Kunstler
himself wanted, were crushed in a court fight.
</P>
<P>
   The office is cramped, the walls lined with mementos of his
legal career: A signed picture from Kunstler, a framed picture (and
summons) from Kuby's arrest at an Amadou Diallo protest, a
courtroom artist's rendition of Kuby in action. There's other
artwork, too - a metal cabinet covered with drawings by his
daughter, Emma.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change is Kuby's lucrative new radio career on
50,000-watt WABC, which provides the freedom to take cases on merit
rather than for profit.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer suing the city to stage nude outdoor photos? Kuby
won the case, which reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Twenty-six
Lower East Side residents fighting the city over their community
garden? Kuby's in. May Day protesters busted under an arcane 1845
law for wearing masks?
</P>
<P>
   These are his people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally have the practice that Bill and I always dreamt of
having: a practice that doesn't rely on fees to do legal work,''
Kuby says.
</P>
<P>
   It's courtesy of Kuby's unlikely radio career, launched in 1996.
He and Sliwa shifted into morning drive this May and immediately
improved ratings. The weekday show features Kuby on the left and
Sliwa on the right, debating anything from the mayor's mobbed-up
dad to a baseball subway series.
</P>
<P>
   A recent discussion of gays in the Boy Scouts featured Sliwa
inviting a conservative politician aboard, introducing him as ''the
heart of Queens, the soul of Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest bragged about his five grandchildren before Kuby
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's great,'' he said brightly. ''If you have enough
children and grandchildren, the chances are one of them should be
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby has won admirers for his work both in and of court,
including ex-Mayor Edward Koch and New York Civil Liberties Union
head Norman Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a real New York character,'' says Siegel, who first met
Kuby following a 1988 riot in Tompkins Square Park. ''His ability
to present the liberal position with strength and wit is a huge
plus for the civil liberties movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In court, ''Ron is very quick on his feet,'' Siegel continues.
''He's a champion of the underdog, of controversial people and
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom has long been Kuby's milieu, but the studio was a
new challenge. Kuby, already as fluent in Arbitron numbers as with
case law, settled right in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney pays me a prodigious amount of money for doing what
people usually tell me to stop doing - talking,'' Kuby says. ''My
whole life, people have been telling me, 'Just shut up!'''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby never listened. In junior high school, he was nearly
expelled for publishing an underground newspaper. Administrators at
Kansas University once branded him condescending and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   The insults inspired Kuby to enroll at the Cornell University
law school, where he graduated third in his class and joined
Kunstler in 1982 - ''my partner and alter ego,'' Kunstler called
him in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   They became Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid with yellow legal
pads, representing clients from Malcolm X's daughter to Marlon
Brando's son to Gambino family godfather John Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   No client seemed too extreme: there were also Arab terrorists
and Long Island Rail Road killer Colin Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Kuby proved as comfortable before a camera as his mentor,
although it only took a notebook and pen to get either going.
Kunstler's 1995 death ended their run, and left Kuby scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   The pair's inattention to finance left the firm deeply in debt
($150,000 by Kuby's estimation). An ugly spat followed with
Kunstler's widow, Margaret Ratner; the resulting court fight ended
with Kuby's bid to continue as Kunstler &AMP; Kuby rejected and Ratner
winning control of the firm's files.
</P>
<P>
   Kuby and Ratner still don't speak.
</P>
<P>
   Kuby bounced back with his April 1996 civil suit victory against
Bernhard Goetz, winning a mostly symbolic $43 million judgment for
a paralyzed victim of the subway gunman. (Goetz couldn't pay, and
Kuby never expected to collect much.)
</P>
<P>
   Kuby's surgical questioning of an unrepentant Goetz exposed the
gunman's chilling attitude toward the December 1984 shootings,
helping turn the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''You made the decision to kill when you saw Troy Canty's
shining eyes?'' Kuby asked pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   ''And his smile,'' came Goetz's damning reply.
</P>
<P>
   Kuby's work on more profitable cases soon returned the firm to
solvency. After his courtroom success, the radio offered Kuby an
opportunity to reinvent his public persona.
</P>
<P>
   The left-wing lawyer soon became more interested in speaking
with the right than spitting at it: ''We on the left have spent
years talking to ourselves, to no discernible effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Kuby found the station's conservative audience was
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a left-wing nut-job, Kuby says with a laugh,
listeners now view him as ''Uncle Ron - the unreconstructed
Bolshevik at the table, a valued but quirky member of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Defense Organization has blasted Kuby as ''a
bootlicking traitor'' for representing some of the World Trade
Center bombers. The NYPD was outraged by his successful defense
last year of a cop-shooter, and by his repeated condemnations of
the four police officers - later acquitted - in the Amadou Diallo
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I question the claim that he's a civil libertarian,'' says Pat
Lynch, head of the city Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. ''In
every incident, he pre-judges New York City cops. Aren't they
entitled to the same civil rights as the people he defends?''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby shrugs off such rips, but it's not as easy for him to
transcend the lingering specter of Kunstler. The younger man still
grows a little misty speaking about his late partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think, 'What would Bill do?''' Kuby says. ''But I
learned a tremendous amount about the law and about life during our
time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby now has his own proteges, taking on a pair of associates at
his firm. ''I'm comfortable with that,'' says Kuby, who takes a
low-key approach to the role.
</P>
<P>
   When Kuby misidentifies a law book, associate Daniel Perez
smilingly cracks, ''You can see who practices law in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby laughs, but turns serious when saying his radio career
won't interfere with his caseload. The legal work, while not a
financial necessity, remains a passion - one that keeps him going
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great fun,'' says Kuby, a true believer still. ''You have
to make sure the work that you're doing genuinely brings joy to
your life. You have to like waking up in the morning and getting to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if you don't like that,'' he concludes, ''you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sammy Gravano, Ron Kuby lives.

<HEADLINE> Contest Winner Parodies Faulkner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- ''You hear the master behind the levity,''
the organizer of the 11th annual Faux Faulkner writealike contest
says of this year's winner.
</P>
<P>
   But Catherine Dupree, 27, who won top honors, says if master
storyteller William Faulkner were alive he'd probably be appalled
by those parodying his writing style.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree's winning entry was about a deep-fried Dixie diet that
proliferates ''clumps of cellulite and folds of fat.'' The satire
is about a character in a fast food drive-thru line considering
whether to add french fries to her order.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the piece, Dupree said, wasn't Faulker, but
''Southern obsession with fried food.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupree, who will attend graduate school in journalism this fall
in her home state of Massachusetts, will read her entry Sunday at a
ceremony on the front lawn of Faulkner's home in Oxford.

<HEADLINE> Bonnie Raitt Hopes To Inspire Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bonnie Raitt was 14 when somebody handed her
a copy of the recording ''Blues at Newport 1963,'' all but
instantly transforming her from '60s folk-rock aficionado to blues
fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was catapulted into a level of fandom that I've never
recovered from,'' the Grammy-winning guitarist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, Raitt, 50, is hoping to work the same
kind of epiphany on 200 other impressionable young minds. Only this
time she'll be the teacher when she plays host to a world
music-blues workshop for inner-city students from the Hollywood
Bowl on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't enough to infuse students with an appreciation of
the music Raitt calls ''the most important cultural contribution
America's ever made,'' she hopes a star-studded concert will be.
The students will be invited to stick around afterward to hear
Raitt, Alvin Youngblood Hart, KoKo Taylor and others perform.

<HEADLINE> Hedy Lamarr Adopted Son Fights Will  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- The estranged adopted son of Hedy Lamarr
has challenged the actress' will, which left him nothing.
</P>
<P>
   James Lamarr Loder, 61, of Omaha, wants the screen siren's will
thrown out so he can be put in charge of her $3 million estate.
</P>
<P>
   Loder alleged that Lamarr was ''of unsound mind'' when she
signed her last will Nov. 3. He also claimed the will was the
result of ''fraud, duress, coercion or undue influence'' by those
named in the will.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney who drafted the will said Lamarr was alert and knew
exactly what she was doing when she signed the will three months
before her death at age 85 in January.
</P>
<P>
   The will leaves about $1.8 million to Lamarr's son, Anthony
Loder, and $1.2 million to her daughter, Denise Loder-DeLuca. Four
friends received about $83,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   How Lamarr and Loder became estranged is unclear and whether
they reconciled before her death is uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Hartford minister facing prostitution charges was banned from jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A minister and prominent police critic,
now accused of promoting prostitution, had been banned from
visiting state prisons after a female inmate accused him of
inappropriate behavior, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Henry L. Price has been banned from the state's jails
since November, Department of Correction spokeswoman Christina
Polce said Friday. Polce said the prisoner accused Price of
''inappropriate behavior and activities'' during a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of that allegation, which led to a four-month
investigation by correction officials, was not available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Price had a contract to counsel inmates with the correction
department because of his job as manager of the family
reunification program of Community Partners in Action.
</P>
<P>
   But prison officials never called him back to do work, Polce
said. The state investigation of Price concluded in March, and his
status as a volunteer and the contract provider for Community
Partners in Action was revoked, Polce said.
</P>
<P>
   Polce said the correction department's investigation had nothing
to do with the Hartford Police Department's probe of allegations
that Price was working as a pimp.
</P>
<P>
   Price surrendered to police on Wednesday and was charged with
one count of promoting prostitution, one count of second-degree
prostitution and one count of third-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant was immediately sealed by a Hartford Superior
Court judge, meaning the state's case against Price is closed to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Price is due in court Aug. 2. He is free on $150,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Courant, citing police sources, reported that women
who were counseled in prison by Price have accused him of setting
them up in apartments, renting them cars and getting them jobs as
prostitutes after their release.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his help, the women allegedly told police, they
had to pay him 75 percent of the money they made as hookers.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorney, Price denies being a pimp, and he alleges
through his friends and allies that the police may have set him up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Price being banned from the prisons, Price's
attorney, Salvatore Bonanno said, ''His volunteer privileges were
suspended when he and his wife went to a prison on a personal
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspension is only connected to abusing a volunteer
pass,'' he said. ''It's my understanding it is not connected to the
prostitution charges against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno declined to describe exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Price, a former president of the Greater Hartford African
American Alliance who turned his life around after a murder
conviction, was among the leaders of a group that picketed weekly
outside the police department for months after Officer Robert C.
Allan shot and killed Aquan Salmon, a 14-year-old robbery suspect,
in April 1999.

<HEADLINE> Precautions for mosquitoes, spraying  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The state Department of Environmental Protection
offers the
following precautions to minimize the risk of exposure to the West
Nile-like strain of the encephalitis virus:
<TEXT>
<P>
   - Minimize time outdoors between dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes
are most active.
</P>
<P>
   - Be sure door and window screens are tight-fitting and in good
repair.
</P>
<P>
   - Wear shoes, socks, long pants and a long-sleeved shirt when
outdoors for long periods of time or when mosquitoes are most
active. Clothing should be light-colored and made of tightly woven
materials.
</P>
<P>
   - Use mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in an
unscreened structure and to protect small babies when outside.
</P>
<P>
   -Eliminate any standing water, including in unattended swimming
pools, where mosquitoes breed.
</P>
<P>
   -Use mosquito repellant with DEET.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   For residents of areas where spraying will take place, the DEP
advises:
</P>
<P>
   - Remain indoors with the windows closed and air conditioning
turned off during spraying and for three to four hours after,
whenever possible. It is safe to go outside for short periods of
time immediately after spraying.
</P>
<P>
   - If you must remain outside, avoid eye contact with the spray.
Rinse immediately with water or eye drops if contact is made.
</P>
<P>
   - Do not allow children to play in areas still wet from
spraying.
</P>
<P>
   - Wash exposed skin with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   - If driving during spraying, close your car windows and vents.
</P>
<P>
   - Bring pets inside.
</P>
<P>
   -Bring laundry and toys inside before spraying and wash them
with soap and water if exposed to pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   - Cover outdoor tables and play equipment or rinse them with
water after spraying.
</P>
<P>
   - Cover swimming pools when possible.
</P>
<P>
   - Wash any exposed fruits or vegetables with water before using.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Kin Impersonator Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Jonathan Taylor Spielberg, who enrolled in a
Catholic high school pretending to be a nephew of the famous
filmmaker, has been sentenced to two years' probation for forgery.
</P>
<P>
   He got an 11-month suspended jail sentence on Friday and was
ordered to receive mental health counseling, perform 100 hours of
community service and avoid contact with anyone under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg is about 27 years old, although his attorney said
Spielberg's exact date of birth is uncertain. He was born
Anoushirvan D. Fakhran in Iran, but changed his name 2&AMP;frac12; years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, he attended high school classes in
Fairfax, claiming to be a 14-year-old freshman.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a BMW with ''SPLBERG'' license plates that he parked in
the principal's spot. The school received a fictitious transcript
from the ''Beverly Hills Private School for Actors,'' listing
stellar grades.
</P>
<P>
   School officials discovered the ruse when they tried to contact
Steven Spielberg about Jonathan's absenteeism. The call was routed
to Steven Spielberg's security consultants in Los Angeles, who
alerted Fairfax City police.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has said he enrolled in high school ''just for the
fun, to get the experience I never had.''

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- America's favorite redhead will be
showing up in mailboxes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A stamp honoring Lucille Ball was unveiled Friday at the

<HEADLINE> Novelist John le Carre Donates Land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Novelist John le Carre has given a stretch of
Cornish coastline to the National Trust to keep it ''out of the
reach of human predators.''
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old author, whose real name is David Cornwell,
bought a cottage on rugged cliffs in southwest England 30 years ago
with the proceeds of his book ''The Spy Who Came in from the
Cold,'' an early best seller in a string of hit spy novels.
</P>
<P>
   Below the isolated cottage is half a mile of coastline that le
Carre is turning over to the trust, a charity that cares for
historic buildings and areas of natural beauty around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope many more landowners will join me in putting precious
coast land for all time out of the reach of human predators,'' le
Carre said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary value of land was not made known, but the National
Trust described it as ''a generous donation.''

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - In the aftermath of World War II, a team
of 11 architects from around the world came together to build a
''Workshop for Peace'' - a home for the newly created United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, their architectural gem that has helped
define the New York City skyline is in disrepair. Asbestos tiles
violate building codes. Electrical wiring is antiquated.
Inefficient windows drive up heating bills. Sprinklers to guard
against fire don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the United Nations plans to announce ambitious
proposals to overhaul its global headquarters on Manhattan's East
River - although funding for a project that could reach $1 billion
at the cash-strapped organization has yet to be secured, diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which hosts the United Nations and its
missions in New York, is expected to be asked to pay a significant
chunk of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. ambassadors were briefed last week on the ''Capital Master
Plan,'' which proposes various deadlines and price-tags for an
overhaul of the complex's main Secretariat office tower, curved
General Assembly hall, Dag Hammarskjold Library and other smaller
buildings on the U.N. site.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. administrators are believed to favor a six-year renovation
estimated at about $964 billion, said the diplomats, who were
briefed on the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals include building new office space or even adding
extra floors onto the existing library or main office tower -
although the latter is not being recommended, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General for Management Joseph Connor, who has
spearheaded the U.N. renovation project, estimates that the
organization would have to spend $1.6 billion including energy
costs over 25 years if the United Nations continues with its
current, inefficient ways and slowly replaces equipment as it wears
out, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which is already $1.6 billion in debt to the United
Nations, is a tough sell on new U.N. costs. The deputy U.S.
ambassador in charge of U.N. management issues, Donald Hays, said
Friday that approval of the renovation plans was not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that many factors indicate that it's time to
be overhauled,'' Hays said in an interview. But he stressed that
Congress, the incoming administration and the General Accounting
Office would need more time and study before the United States
could commit to any plan.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were fundamental to financing and building the United
Nations. The Rockefeller family provided the site and Wallace K.
Harrison headed the team of architects in constructing its imposing
glass-encased tower and graceful curved side assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the complex, which features Leger murals and a Norman
Rockwell mosaic, hasn't had a top-to-bottom renovation since
Harrison and then-Secretary-General Trygve Lie laid the U.N.
cornerstone on Oct. 24, 1949 - and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, who is expected to make the proposals public Tuesday,
has asked the U.N. membership to endorse the six-year renovation
plan in principle and authorize an initial $8 million for a more
detailed schematic design, the diplomats said. Connor was out of
the office and unavailable for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Pentagon building in Washington, which was
completed in 1943, announced plans last year for a $1.2 billion
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Hays, the deputy American ambassador, said possible payment
options for the U.N. renovation included interest-free loans,
increasing the budget allotment over time for U.N. member states or
securing a bond from private firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will want to do the right thing,'' he said,
noting that the renovation was part of the U.S. campaign to
streamline and reform the United Nations' bureaucracy. ''It's part
of the reform process.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A $5,000 arrest warrant has been issued for a
woman convicted of trespassing at the Hollywood Hills home of actor
Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant for Athena M. Rolando was activated after she twice
failed to appear for a court hearing on her progress in undergoing
counseling, the city attorney's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando climbed into Pitt's home through a rear window last year
while the actor was away. A caretaker found her wearing Pitt's

<HEADLINE> Powers becomes GOP's attack dog against Hillary Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Marine Corps veteran who pulled New York's
Republican Party up by its bootstraps a decade ago, William Powers
has become the GOP's attack dog in the battle against Hillary
Rodham Clinton's run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Powers, the only first lady to ever run for public
office is ''cold-blooded and hotheaded'' and ''a shrill and
scheming person'' who is ''opportunistic, hypocritical and
egotistical.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that she is ''polarizing and power hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is just from one letter he has sent out to potential
donors.
</P>
<P>
   A second fund-raising letter that surfaced Thursday said she was
''an angry woman'' driven by ''blind political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter went on to call Clinton an ''ambitious, ruthless,
scheming, calculating, manipulating woman'' who was really one of
''the outsiders who mock our New York values and scoff at our
commonsense conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Powers said he wasn't calling the
first lady names or being a male chauvinist, just pointing out what
he feels are the facts about her. And, he promised, there was
plenty more where that came from. Powers said he had three more
such letters ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, said Powers, are helping him raise record amounts
of money for the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen a response to direct mail like we're getting
from her,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are also serving to get out attacks on the first
lady that her new Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, does not
want to personally utter. The congressman from Long Island, with
his wife and two young daughters often in tow, is seeking to
project an image as a clean-cut, earnest, honest family man. He
does not want to be viewed as a street-fighting, take-no-prisoners
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Powers has no such qualms. He, in fact, seems to relish the
attention the attacks are bringing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of like it. I talk about myself. She talks about me.
Other people talk about me. That's good for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he is also unconcerned about the letters might
backfire and create the impression that Clinton is a victim. When
that happened during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal involving
President Clinton, the first lady's favorable poll numbers took a
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about motivating your base,'' Powers said. ''My letters
are going to our base.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Powers is of the belief that Clinton is such a
polarizing figure that Republicans and conservatives will come out
in record numbers in New York this year just to vote against her.
That, he said, will not only help Lazio, but could benefit Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign in New York and other
Republican candidates across the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Powers, it marks the latest in a series of political battles
he has been waging for well over a decade. A top aide to then-Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, Powers got himself elected state chairman in the
wake of the party's disastrous showing in the 1990 election for
governor when GOP candidate Pierre Rinfret collected just 22
percent of the vote and Democrat Mario Cuomo coasted to a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Powers inherited a party deep in debt and demoralized. He got in
his car and began traveling the state, attending local party
functions and raising money. He would stop home for clean clothes
and hit the road again. He did little else for the first year as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he helped D'Amato narrowly escape defeat at the hands
of then-state Attorney General Robert Abrams. In 1993, Powers
played a key role in helping elect Republican Rudolph Giuliani as
mayor of New York City. The big payoff came in 1994 when, with a
big assist from D'Amato, Powers helped a little-known Republican
state senator, George Pataki, topple Cuomo in the governor's race.
A former federal prosecutor from Buffalo, Republican Dennis Vacco,
was also elected attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not been quite as rosy for Powers since then. In
1998, Pataki won a second term, but both D'Amato and Vacco went
down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been speculation that Powers may step down from
the state chairmanship, he seems intent on at least one last battle
against a major opponent worthy of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect her,'' Powers said.

<HEADLINE> Fanwood bike thief 'trades up'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FANWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Someone is stealing bicycles here and
leaving old ones in their place.
</P>
<P>
   Police say at least four times in the past month - and three
times last year - a thief has made off with a shiny new bike, and
left a beat-up old one in its place.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he didn't ride it, he pushed it,'' said Detective Eugene
Chin.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen bikes ranged in price from $150 to $380. The ones
left in their place were worth maybe $50, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in other towns say they've also seen this trick.
</P>
<P>
   ''They use an old bike for transportation,'' said Roselle Park
Sgt. Paul Morrison. ''When they get here, they get a better bike.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of the Fanwood thefts, bicycles were taken from outside
houses or from unlocked garages.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Beua Lia had his new bike swiped from outside his
house. He saved for months to be able to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in his life, he decided to spring for
something that was a major purchase with his own money,'' the boy's
father, Peter Lia, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's
editions. ''He's only had the bike four or five weeks. He really
feels terrible about the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He might feel even worse about the bike the thief left behind
for him: a baby-blue girl's bike, with white handlebars.

<HEADLINE> Pessimism Over Ending Sri Lanka War  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Minority Tamil and Muslim parties in
Sri Lanka said Saturday they no longer have any hope that the
government and opposition will agree to constitutional changes
aimed at ending the island nation's 17-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tiger insurgents, charging discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority, have been fighting since 1983 in an effort to
carve out a Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern portions of
the country. The fighting has killed 62,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the main
opposition United National Party have been trying to reach an
accord on clauses to give more autonomy to provinces in a bid to
end the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has already been rejected by the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam rebels, who say they will settle for nothing less than
a homeland. But even if the Tamil rebels change their minds, the
plan would be a nonstarter if the opposition party rejects the
government proposals aimed at ending the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Four months of dialogue suffered a setback Friday when
opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe stormed out of a meeting
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Wickremesinghe accused the government of carrying out a smear
campaign against him trying to link him with the Tamil rebels, and
he told Kumaratunga he would boycott future discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we will virtually have to bid goodbye to bipartisan
talks,'' said Rauf Hakeem, secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim
Congress party.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem said only the minority Tamil and Muslim parties can put
the talks back on track by acting as conduit between the government
and opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wickremesinghe's threatened boycott is a big, big setback,''
said Dharmalingam Sidharthan, leader of the People's Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam, a former rebel group that renounced
violence and joined the political mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the present context, everything seems to be going for a
six,'' agreed Veerasingham Anandasangaree, vice president of the
mainstream Tamil political party, the Tamil United Liberation
Front, using a cricket term for everything going haywire.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga's hope to end the war with Tamil Tiger rebels hit
another snag Friday when Sri Lanka's powerful Buddhist monks said
they oppose the government's proposed constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the country's Buddhist clergy generally preach
nonviolence, they have urged the government to carry on its war
against Tamil militants. They say the country's minority Tamils,
who are mostly Hindus, should not be given any special privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The monks said Friday they would oppose the government's
proposed draft constitution because it makes too many concessions
to the Tamils. The government's proposed amendments would grant
wide powers to regional authorities, apparently in an attempt to
influence the 3.2 million Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   The government initially hoped to submit the draft constitution
to parliament before the session ends Aug. 24, but this is now
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tamil Tiger rebels continued sporadic attacks in the
country's north, wounding three soldiers, government spokesman
Ariya Rubasinghe said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the soldiers were wounded Friday by rebel mortar fire in
Nargarkovil and Meesalai-South northeast of Jaffna city, the
rebels' former stronghold which they are trying to recapture.
</P>
<P>
   Rubasinghe said two rebels were killed Friday by soldiers at
Ariyalai in the Jaffna peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Sharif Gets 14 Years  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATTOCK FORT, Pakistan (AP) -- Already serving two life terms,
deposed Premier Nawaz Sharif was sentenced again Saturday -- this
time to 14 years in prison for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty, which included being barred from politics for 21
years, was handed down by a special anti-corruption court set up by
the military rulers who toppled Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who received life sentences for convictions in hijacking
and terrorism cases, has maintained his innocence of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who was ousted in October in a military coup led by Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, is appealing his two life convictions. But if
he's successful, he would still face jail on the tax conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's conviction of Sharif -- for failing to declare a
helicopter on his tax forms -- was seen as carrying out Musharraf's
promise to punish corruption at every level.
</P>
<P>
   The special anti-corruption courts were set up by Pakistan's
military rulers, who threw out Sharif's government in a bloodless
coup, charging unbridled corruption and economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was expecting the verdict,'' said a defiant Sharif after the
sentencing Saturday. ''It is because of a personal vendetta that
such a great injustice is being done to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Pakistan's military leader Musharraf of crafting laws
to keep him out of politics and in jail and of waging a witch hunt
against him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every law has been made to get rid of me,'' he said. ''This
shows that Musharraf wants to single me out.''
</P>
<P>
   He has sharply criticized the military government's National
Accountability Bureau and law under which he was tried.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's prosecutor-general and author of the law
Farooq Adam said Sharif's trial was ''free and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The military takeover in October was widely accepted in Pakistan
because of the army's promise to root out corruption and revive the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since then scores of politicians, bureaucrats and leading
businessmen have been arrested. Some have been charged and others
are in jail while investigations into allegations of wrongdoing are
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption has been endemic in the nation of 140 million people
where the average income is about $400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, who both dominated the last decade of
Pakistani politics, have now both been implicated in corruption
cases.

<HEADLINE> India To Set Up Population Fund  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Seeking to curb India's high birth rate,
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee pledged Saturday to set up a
special fund to promote family planning programs across the world's
second most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The government also will set up a group to prepare programs for
specific areas, particularly the northern states, which account for
half of India's population, Vajpayee told the National Commission
on Population in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   India's 1 billion population is larger than any nation except
China. Experts fear that if India's rate of population growth does
not slow, it will become the world's most populated country in 45
years.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee urged companies, voluntary agencies and individuals to
contribute to the National Population Stabilization Fund, which
would direct the money to family planning programs. He gave very
few details of the programs, but said he hoped the population would
stabilize within two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Achieving this is a challenge. But once we overcome the
challenge, we can truly develop our national human resource into a
formidable force ... for all-around prosperity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Planning Commission will provide $22.5 million for
the fund, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged states to make good use of health, education and
related development programs and provide better access to
information on contraception and child care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, India adopted a national family planning program, the
first country in the world to do so. The aim was to ''reduce the
birth rate to the extent necessary to stabilize the population at a
level consistent with the requirement of the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Indians, especially women, were without basic health
care, or the literacy skills to understand family planning.
</P>
<P>
   ''A reality check ... reveals rather disturbing facts,''
Vajpayee said. Nearly one in 10 children dies before the age of
five, he said. Half of the children under the age of four are
undernourished; 30 percent of the newborns are underweight and 60
percent of women are anemic.
</P>

   Vajpayee said India must reduce infant and maternal mortality
and meet the demand for contraception. Condoms are available, but
the condom campaign is aimed mostly at preventing sexually
transmitted diseases. In a country where millions are at or below
the poverty level and live in rural areas, spending money on
condoms is not a consideration.

<HEADLINE> Five Russians Freed in Calcutta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Five Russians convicted of providing
weapons to rebels in eastern India were released Saturday following
pressure from the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police surrounded the five, crew members of a Latvian
plane, as they were escorted from a Calcutta jail to the Russian
consulate.
</P>
<P>
   India's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that their
sentences had been commuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian leadership has repeatedly raised the issue of
pardon for the Russians. Their family members have also appealed to
the president of India seeking mercy,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed thanks for the
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gesture without any doubt will contribute to further
successful development of relations between our countries,'' Putin
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   They were convicted in 1995 of airdropping crates of weapons to
the Ananda Marg sect in West Bengal. But they said they were forced
at gunpoint by the plane's owner, and Russian government officials,
clergy and human rights activists had lobbied for them.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Kills Guatemalan Babies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUETZALTENANGO, Guatemala (AP) -- An outbreak of meningitis at a
hospital in Guatemala's second largest city has left 13 newborns
dead and five others seriously ill, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The infants died over the past week after officials detected the
outbreak in the maternity ward at Quetzaltenango's largest public
hospital. The five others were being treated with antibiotics and
were expected to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis attacks the spine and brain. The germ enters the
bloodstream through contact with the nose or throat discharges of
an infected person. It can kill a person within a few weeks if left
untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Officials think the disease was brought in by one of the mothers
in the ward in early July, the hospital's director of internal
medicine, Rene Aceituno, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff moved all the newborns to a new area and believe
the outbreak now is under control. Workers, wearing masks, removed
sheets, clothing, furniture and ceiling tiles from the infected
area Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has caused a panic in this largely Indian community
some 125 miles southwest of Guatemala City. Local newspapers
reported overcrowding in a half dozen other Quetzaltenango-area
hospitals in the wake of the outbreak.

<HEADLINE> 6 Die in Pakistan Market Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful bomb ripped through a
congested market in southwestern Pakistan late Saturday, killing at
least six people and injuring 22 others, ambulance officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb exploded outside a hotel in the central Jinnah market
of Quetta, the provincial capital of Pakistan's southwestern
Baluchistan province. The force of the explosion shattered glass in
nearby buildings and sent people running for cover.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb, the third in
Quetta on Saturday. The earlier explosions were small and didn't
cause any injuries or damage. Police were investigating all three
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   A series of bombs have rocked Quetta in recent months. Police
officials fear they may be retaliatory bombings by disgruntled
tribesmen belonging to the Mari tribe. The tribesmen have strongly
criticized the arrest of one of their leaders in connection with
the murder of a judge.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hostages May Be Let Go  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Three Malaysians and two Filipinos
kidnapped by guerillas from a diving resort three months ago are
likely to be released soon, government negotiators said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The five have been held by Abu Sayyaf rebels on Jolo island
since being abducted in a group of 21 people from Malaysia's
Sipadan resort.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Malaysians and one German woman in the group have been
freed.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said rebel leaders were apparently debating how to
divide hundreds of thousands of dollars in ransom. Their release is
now ''in the works,'' chief negotiator Robert Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the five would leave nine still in captivity:
seven Europeans and two South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   The same rebel band has kidnapped dozens of others, usually
holding the victims for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the rebel band abducted 50 teachers and students from
two schools on nearby Basilan island.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado earlier presented two teachers released Friday by the
rebels -- the last of the 50 to be freed.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, Erlinda Manuel and Teresita Academia, wept when
they saw their families. ''It was a bitter experience,'' Manuel
said of their captivity.
</P>
<P>
   They survived a military assault on the main Abu Sayyaf
stronghold and weeks of flight through the jungle with the rebels
to escape pursuing troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't say anything about the rebels,'' said Academia's
husband, Romeo, also a teacher. ''The important thing is my wife is
back.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time Academia wrote her husband asking him to raise
$5,600 for her release, her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's impossible to raise that on a teacher's salary, so I
decided to wait and see what happened with the government
negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf consists of several hundred heavily armed rebels
divided into several bands led by at least five commanders. The
group has been accused of banditry, kidnappings and numerous
attacks on Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Sipadan diving resort abduction, the Abu Sayyaf has
also abducted several other people.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the remaining hostages consist of six French, three
Germans, two Finns, two South Africans, 15 Filipinos and three
Malaysians.

<HEADLINE> One week after flap, first lady visits synagogue  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTHAMPTON BEACH, N.Y. (AP) - Seeking to calm jittery Jewish
voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared Saturday at an Orthodox
synagogue to denounce terrorism against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke before an overflow crowd of about 350
people just one week after her campaign was rocked by an allegation
that she made an anti-Semitic remark about an Arkansas campaign
worker in 1974. She has angrily denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this has been a very difficult and trying week for
you,'' said Rabbi Marc Schneier, who invited and introduced
Clinton. ''It's time for us to move on. Hillary has always been a
friend of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about the ongoing Camp David peace talks, telling
her audience that ''the challenges the president and prime minister
are facing are rooted in whether or not others will give up their
hatred and their sense of violence in return for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have been meeting at Camp David in
efforts to reach a new Middle East peace agreement. The president,
who was in Japan for an economic summit, is due back at the talks
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   During her talk, Mrs. Clinton never mentioned Arafat or the PLO.
Instead, she focused on Barak and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, she said, have a right ''to keep their children
safe from violence and terrorism. We know in our hearts that God
has deemed their cause just. I believe we have to support their
efforts, and particularly support what the prime minister is going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP Senate candidate, Rep. Rick Lazio, is scheduled to speak
at the synagogue next Saturday. Both candidates are courting the
Jewish vote, which makes up 12 percent of the state's electorate.

<HEADLINE> Hunters' Families Win Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEACE RIVER, Alberta (AP) -- The families of two Americans
accidentally shot and killed while moose hunting in Alberta five
years ago have won a $730,000 settlement from the shooter and
outfitting company.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jorgenson and Ray Jorgenson, two brothers, died Sept. 14,
1995, when shot in the back with a single bullet as they sat parked
behind a bush in an all-terrain vehicle. One brother was sitting in
front of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Kastner was originally charged with manslaughter, but the
charge was reduced to dangerous hunting under Alberta's Wildlife
Act.
</P>
<P>
   A judge acquitted him after a trial in May 1996. The judge said
Kastner honestly believed he was shooting at a moose and had no way
of knowing the brothers were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Jorgenson brothers were hunting with two guides from the
outfitting company NorthAlta.Ventures in remote woods near Peace
River almost 480 miles northwest of Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Jorgenson families sued Kastner, the guides and
NorthAlta.Ventures. Alan Jorgenson's wife, Alynne, of Richmond
Hill, Ga., had claimed millions in her lawsuit, as had Ray
Jorgenson's widow, Dolores, of Grand Forks, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides spent 2&AMP;frac12; years litigating the case. The
settlement, which included legal costs, was finalized last month.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive wanted for 1991 Tarrytown shooting caught in Panama  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - A man who had been a fugitive since his 1991
indictment for fatally shooting his estranged wife in New York was
caught in Central America and brought back to the United States on
Saturday, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Grullon was caught in Panama at about 6 p.m. EDT Friday
by U.S. Marshals, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and
Panamanian Fugitive Squad and has been brought to Miami, said
Deputy U.S. Marshal John D. Amat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on leads provided by the Dominican National Police, he
was tracked to Panama,'' Amat said.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon was turned over to the Miami-Dade Police warrant squad,
Amat said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Police did not immediately return an Associated Press
phone call Saturday, but Amat said it was likely that Grullon would
appear in court in Miami, possibly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon was flown to Miami because there was not a direct flight
to New York, Amat said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's here now, he's on our soil,'' said Detective Sgt. Gene
Buonanno of the Tarrytown Police Department, the agency leading the
New York investigation. ''Now he's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Grullon was indicted by a grand jury in Westchester County in
December 1991 on charges he killed his estranged wife, Yolina
Camacho. Police say Grullon shot Camacho in front of several
witnesses, including the couple's two young children in the
basement of the Hilton. Camacho worked there as a housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon fled to the Dominican Republic. He was arrested and
spent several months in jail there before being released on bail
and disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been spitting in my face for many years,'' said Buonanno,
who described the international legal process of the last years as
''nothing but a fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Buonanno enlisted the help of U.S. Rep. Benjamin Gilman to put
pressure on the Dominican Republic to extradite Grullon and another
man, Pablo Almonte, who is wanted for the 1988 slaying of a New
York City cop. Almonte is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, a Republican from Middletown who is the head of the
International Relations Committee in the House of Representatives,
barred the transfer of millions of dollars in aid money and
equipment to pressure the country.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Apply for 'The Sopranos'  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.J. (AP) -- OK, we're lookin' for a body. Maybe a
coupla bodies. Dey ain't gotta be pretty, just good.
</P>
<P>
   People got da point even if the producers of ''The Sopranos''
didn't use those exact words in issuing a casting call for the
popular HBO series about a fictional New Jersey mob family.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 13,000 Soprano wannabes turned out Saturday at Harrison
High School, dreaming of becoming the next Salvatore ''Big Pussy''
Bompensiero, the snitch who got whacked last season and ended up in
a watery grave. (The name, by the way, evokes the real Anthony
''Little Pussy'' Russo, assassinated at Long Branch's Harbor Island
Spa, who was named for his fondness for a pet cat.)
</P>
<P>
   And yeah, you could say it was a mob scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lines stretched for blocks, so many people that the casting call
was shut down after just 30 minutes. People left out were told to
mail their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Police had to call in reinforcements to handle the crowds and
highway entrances to Harrison were closed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Saladino came all the way from Coral Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we came through the (turnpike) toll booths, we were
wondering how many Italians there were in Jersey,'' he said. ''We
just found out.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants had to be over 16. Most importantly, they had to be
''Italian-American looking,'' and many added a movie version of mob
costuming.
</P>
<P>
   Saladino, who said he sometimes gets bit parts in gangster
flicks shot in Florida, wore a black pin-stripe suit, black shirt
and black tie, accessorized with a gold chain and cross and what he
claimed was a real Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Soprano was a dream -- like the best cannoli and pasta e
fagioli he ever had all rolled into one. He gladly offered an
impromptu sidewalk audition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in da parts business,'' he said. ''We do da shins, da
knees, and for special holidays, like, uh, Valentine's Day, we send
hearts to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen year-old John Vasta of Central Valley, N.Y., hoped his
high school acting experience, attitude and spiel would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to a class; they told me, you know, how to breathe and
stuff,'' he said. ''I played an Italian guy in a play once, or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   His vision of a gangster get-up was a black polyester shirt
unbuttoned to just above the navel; two gold chains, one bearing a
cross and the other spelling out his name in diamonds; two gold
bracelets, and three gold rings.
</P>
<P>
   And with his name and upbringing in the region, Robert Anzelone
of Bayside, N.Y., figured he was a shoo-in despite his lack of
acting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you grow up with these people, it's not acting,'' he
said. ''I'd be playing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO had stressed there was no guarantee that any of Saturday's
hopefuls would appear anytime soon alongside Anthony Soprano, Uncle
''Junior'' Soprano or Paulie Walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, you never know. With ''Big Pussy'' and Richie Aprile
permanently out of the picture, so to speak, along with a coupla
younger hoods, a young wiseguy with the right juice might move up,
ya know?
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to see what happens,'' HBO publicist Natalie
Sarraf said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The show received 18 Emmy nominations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has angered many Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One New Jersey group last month awarded a ''Pasta-tute'' award
for negative media portrayals of Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alfano of Bloomfield, whose Italian-American One Voice
Committee handed out that award, took special umbrage at the
requirement that Saturday's applicants be ''Italian-American
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Does that mean that anyone who fits the stereotype of a
buffoon, bum, bigot or bimbo?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Any way you spell it, Scrabble rules remain -- for now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - M-A-J-O-R-I-T-Y.
</P>
<P>
   Eight letters on the Scrabble board. Worth 110 points if you
play it on a triple word score (60 for the word plus 50 for using
all seven tiles).
</P>
<P>
   In Scrabble circles, that's a darned good score for a single
turn.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the word the National Scrabble Association used to lay
to rest the issue of which dictionary to use for the popular word
game.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of nearly 2-1, the nation's club and tournament
players have rejected the idea of combining the North American
Official Scrabble Players Dictionary with the British Official
Scrabble Words dictionary. And so, SOWPODS - as the proposed combo
was affectionately or derisively termed by supporters and
detractors - is dead.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   On its website, the National Scrabble Association said the tally
isn't final but it looks like, for the next five years anyway,
players in the United States, Canada and Israel will continue to
use their dictionary (OSPD) and the United Kingdom and the rest of
the Scrabble-playing world will use theirs (OSW).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to put aside the acrimonious discussions,
finger-pointing and name calling,'' said John D. Williams,
executive director of the association. ''Wherever you stand on this
issue, you'd have to agree that this has been for better or worse a
historic event for the NSA. The NSA and the NSA Board have tried to
handle this issue in the most responsive, democratic way possible.
It is, in fact, the first-ever referendum held for our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial results show 1,351 members (nearly 65 percent)
opposed ''SOWPODS,'' as the combined dictionary was called. Of
those members who returned ballots, 696 (about 34 percent) favored
it. There are about 10,000 tournament Scrabble players and 200
clubs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the OSW to the OSPD would have meant expert players in
North America would have to add some 40,000 additional words to
their vocabularies.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argued that the entire English-speaking world should
have the same word source and that adding words to the lexicon
would make for a higher scoring, more wide-open game.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the change would benefit only those few dozen
players who qualify for the biennial world championships and would
be a hardship on casual club players who would have to use a word
list without definitions. Adding words like ''QI'' and ''ZO'' would
make it almost impossible to strand opponents with high-scoring
letters at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The NSA wrangled over possible compromises, including using just
two or three letter words at first then gradually phasing in the
entire British dictionary. Another called for using each system at
different tournaments and events but Williams worried that would
create an ''in-your-face'' atmosphere of ''us versus them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two factions will certainly renew the debate when they meet
Aug. 5 in Providence, R.I., for the North American Scrabble
Championships.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rebels Claim Wins on Eve of Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels and rival rightist
militias claimed victories in clashes Saturday, in an apparent
propaganda battle on the eve of a new round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of civilians who fled the fighting in the northern
San Lucas mountains spoke of high death tolls, but there was no
official confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Switzerland where talks were scheduled to begin
Monday, a senior commander of the rebel National Liberation Army,
or ELN, claimed his forces had killed 14 paramilitary fighters in
battles since Friday outside San Pablo, a town east of the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Just two leftist guerrillas died in clashes that continued
Saturday, ELN chief Antonio Garcia told Colombia's Radionet Radio.
He claimed rightist paramilitary units were strafing rebels from
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's report conflicted with that of national paramilitary
chief Carlos Castano, whose forces have wrested large amounts of
territory from the ELN near San Pablo. Castano claimed Friday that
his fighters were on the verge of ousting the group from one of its
last mountain strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' ''only option is to negotiate outside the country or
see their forces disappear,'' the militia chief said, apparently
trying to portray the rebels as weak going into the Geneva talks.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts agree that the ELN is negotiating partly due to
pressure from the paramilitary groups, which are supported by
wealthy landowners and ultra-rightist elements in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Talks will focus on a tentative government plan to cede San
Pablo and two other towns to the ELN -- creating a no-fire zone
where the rebels can breathe more easily while peace negotiations
go forward. The proposal is fiercely opposed by the rightist
militias and area residents.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting near San Pablo followed separate clashes on
Thursday between Castano's forces and a larger leftist insurgency,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which
reportedly left 22 dead, including one rebel, two civilians and 19
paramilitary fighters.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Pack Service for Coverdell  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Political leaders from around the nation and
Georgia packed a church Saturday to say goodbye to Paul Coverdell,
the second-term senator who died of a brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Some fought to choke back tears, including Gov. Roy Barnes, who
had difficulty saying ''Goodbye, old friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, who died Tuesday, was remembered as a gentle man
and as a politician who preferred to work behind the scenes rather
than hog the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Georgia's congressional delegation, mourners from
Washington included dozens of Coverdell's Senate and House
colleagues, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Sen. Ted Kennedy
of Massachusetts and Sen. Fred Dalton Thompson of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was represented by Defense Secretary William
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush had no role in
the service at Peachtree Road United Methodist Church, but he sat
with Coverdell's widow, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   One of several eulogies read at the service was written by
Bush's father, former President George Bush, who said Coverdell
''told us that quiet is good, caring about the other guy matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Coverdell became his mentor when he was first
elected to the state Senate even though they were of different
parties. Barnes is a Democrat and Coverdell was a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their political differences, they became close friends
and at one point counseled each other on their political plans,
Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, how we need more of him,'' Barnes lamented. ''It would
take away some of the acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas drew chuckles and smiles with his
remembrance of Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't soon forget that squeaky voice, that disheveled hair,
those flailing arms,'' Gramm said. At the same time, he said,
Coverdell's friends and admirers also would remember his ''lion
heart, iron will and loving ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was ''the kind of man your mama wanted you to grow up
to be,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Clyde Rodbell also fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many ways, he was simply an ordinary man with special
qualities and huge talents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending were former Democratic Gov. Zell Miller, said to
be Barnes' top choice for the appointment to fill Coverdell's seat;
former Gov. Lester Maddox, and former House Speaker Newt Ginrich.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell lived a life that we can all be proud of and
look up to,'' Gingrich said following the service.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Faces Constitution Vote  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- In a region plagued by coups and
civil wars, this West African nation was always the holdout, the
bastion of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast now has a military government, an angry soldier
corps that has staged two mutinies since its Christmas Eve coup and
an economy hobbled by low prices for cocoa and coffee, the
country's two main exports.
</P>
<P>
   The latest standoff -- what people here called ''the battle of
the conjunctions'' -- was waged ahead of Sunday's referendum to
approve a new constitution. The fight was over just one word, but
at stake was the Ivorian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, military leader Gen. Robert Guei decreed that
the tentative constitution would state that a presidential
candidate's mother ''and'' father should both be Ivorian.
</P>
<P>
   The modification of the seemingly innocuous clause -- which had
previously required that a candidate's mother ''or'' father be
Ivorian -- has heightened ethnic and political tension in this
country, which has a population made up of about 40 percent
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Ivorian government declared a state of emergency
to ensure that Sunday's vote goes smoothly, increasing security at
key installations. The state of emergency was to run until early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of armed soldiers patrolled the streets of Abidjan's
more populous neighborhoods ahead of a 10 p.m. curfew on Saturday.
During the day, shops were open, the few people turned out in the
normally busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's referendum is seen as a crucial test of the
government's willingness to follow through on its promise to return
Ivory Coast to democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular with Ivorians,
many have since become disillusioned with the new regime. Junta
leader Gen. Robert Guei, a former army chief, has promised
presidential elections for Sept. 17 but has not said whether he
will run.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador George Mu told journalists at a recent news
conference that the United States would look unfavorably at Guei's
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a member of the coup, he has a very strong voice and
therefore should not stand for elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Guei's last-minute change to the proposed
constitution is aimed at excluding the leader of the country's main
opposition party, the Rally of the Republicans, from running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The party's chief, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, a former prime
minister and top official with the International Monetary Fund, was
at the center of a controversy over similar eligibility conditions
under the country's former president, Henri Konan Bedie, who was
ousted by Guei's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie accused Ouattara, who comes from the north of the country,
of not being eligible for the presidency because his parents are
from neighboring Burkina Faso. Ouattara says his parents are native
Ivorians.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie's ethnically divisive policies were a major reason Guei
gave for his takeover. Now many Ivorians see Guei's modification to
the proposed constitution as fueling the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast's Blood for Blood association, which represents 4
million Ivorians of mixed origin, has strongly condemned the change
and called on people to vote ''no'' in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, however, has encouraged his party members to vote
''yes.'' He maintains he is unaffected by the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But his supporters, mostly from the Muslim-dominated north, view
the change as an attempt to sideline him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed constitution contains elements destined to oppose
children of this country as well as to frustrate millions of others
who know no other homeland than this country. It will divide
Ivorians,'' the National Islamic Council said in a statement
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Until December last year, the notion of a coup d'etat seemed
impossible in this former French colony, which had enjoyed 40 years
of stable government since independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within seven months, a coup and two mutinies, the last at
the beginning of this month, have ruined Ivory Coast's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   July's uprising was particularly disturbing to many residents.
Soldiers, many drunk and firing guns into the air, seized cars from
passers-by and looted stores and banks.
</P>
<P>
   The mutineers demanded $9,000 in perks they said they were
promised to support the December coup. They eventually stopped
their mutiny after settling for payments of $1,600 each to help
them buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether that money has been paid, but it is
difficult to see how the cash-strapped government, one of Africa's
most indebted, will find the funds.
</P>
<P>
   The mutiny raised fears of another coup and left many wondering
who really is in charge of Ivory Coast's 9,000-strong army.
Thirty-five mutineers arrested a week after the uprising have still
not been tried.

<HEADLINE> Reality TV Rewarding for CBS  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- CBS executives on Saturday defended
''Big Brother,'' the network's exercise in voyeurism, while
acknowledging the unpredictability of putting private lives on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would I do it again? In a second,'' Leslie Moonves, CBS
Television president and chief executive officer, said of the
program that has sequestered 10 strangers in a camera-filled house
for three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' and the hit ''Survivor'' reflect CBS' effort to
remove the ''closed for the summer sign'' and offer viewers more
than ''Diagnosis Murder'' reruns, Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' reward has been a bigger audience, particularly among the
younger viewers advertisers pay more to reach, and the excitement
of having ''water-cooler'' shows that get people talking, Moonves
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30-second commercial spots on the ''Survivor'' finale in
August will fetch as much as $600,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Television Critics Association, Moonves was
peppered with questions about the ethics and ramifications of using
real people for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Politics unexpectedly entered the ''Big Brother'' house with
William Collins, reported to be a follower of former Nation of
Islam leader Khalid Abdul Muhammad. Muhammad was ousted from the
Nation of Islam for calling Jews ''bloodsuckers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Collins became the first contestant ousted by
fellow house members and viewers. He said during a follow-up
interview on the show that he had been a member of the New Black
Panther Party for Self-Defense, of which Muhammad is national
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very tough finding out everything in everybody's
background,'' Moonves said. ''I would have done a lot more
investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   The network spent $100,000 on background checks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves declined to say if Collins would have been allowed on
the show if he remained an active party member. Moonves and CBS
Entertainment President Nancy Tellem said Collins espoused no hate
or political messages during his time on ''Big Brother'' and that
none would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS executives also were questioned about the wisdom of
allowing ''Big Brother'' contestant Karen to use TV -- with her
children probably watching -- to criticize her husband and marriage.
The network withheld contestant's full names.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it didn't happen on the air'' her marital problems likely
would have emerged anyway, Moonves said, adding that he did share
others' concerns about how Karen's children might be affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the contestants signed up voluntarily and were made fully
aware of the scrutiny they would face, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing to apologize for,'' he said of CBS' reality
programs.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a sequel planned for ''Survivor,'' which
stranded 16 contestants on an island for a $1 million prize, and
CBS plans a big kick-off for the new show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor II: The Australian Outback'' will debut immediately
after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28. The current ''Survivor'' will go
out with a bang Aug. 23: The two-hour finale will be followed by a
live ''town hall'' meeting with the contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Internet leaks, CBS will wait to post the names of
ousted ''Survivor'' contestants until after the weekly show airs.
Moonves declined to comment on Web sites claiming to know the
winner's identity.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Decry Italy Teen's Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy (AP) -- Angry mourners filled a Naples cathedral
Saturday for the funeral of a teen-age scooter driver who was shot
and killed for running a police checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Castellano, 17, ran the checkpoint because he wasn't
wearing a helmet and didn't want to be ticketed. He had been
ticketed repeatedly before Thursday's shooting for flouting a March
law that mandates helmets for Italy's 9 million scooter and
motorcycle drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager reportedly loathed helmets because they flattened
his gel-held hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   Mario's aunt stood before his casket Saturday in front of 1,500
mourners to urge an end to a protest boycott on helmet-wearing by
Naples' young.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who wants to show respect for Mario instead should put
on their helmets, and they should do it for him,'' said the aunt,
identified only as Edda. ''They should put them on and keep them on
even more than before.''
</P>
<P>
   The nights since the killing have been marked by vigils and
scattered riots, with young people both placing flowers and
smashing car windows and overturning police vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Enzo Bianco called the shooting unjustifiable
and promised to bring the circumstances of the case to light.
</P>
<P>
   Naples Police Chief Nicola Izza expressed regret but said gang
wars had made the city's police particularly ''tense'' lately, and
police complained that Neapolitans increasingly were ignoring the
helmet law despite increased checks and public-awareness campaigns.

<HEADLINE> 3 Serb Men Shot in Kosovo Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Gunmen shot and wounded three Serb
men during a late-night attack in the sector of Kosovo under
control of American peacekeepers, the U.S. military reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The three Serbs were shot about 10:30 p.m. Friday near a
cemetery in Kosovska Kamenica, an ethnically mixed town jointly
patrolled by Russian and American troops, a U.S. statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The three were evacuated to the U.S. military hospital at Camp
Bondsteel where they were reported in serious but stable condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Several ethnic Albanians were questioned as witnesses but were
released, according to NATO spokesman Maj. Scott Slaten. No further
details were released.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks by ethnic Albanians against Serbs have continued despite
the presence of NATO-led troops and U.N. police, who took control
of the Serb province in June 1999 from Yugoslav forces withdrawing
after the 78-day NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, about 150 Serbs held a memorial service to mark the
deaths of 14 villagers slain in a wheat field a year ago, among the
bloodiest ethnic attacks since NATO moved into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of the massacre were found by a British patrol July
23, 1999 after automatic weapons fire was heard near the town of
Gracko, some 10 miles south of the capital, Pristina. Thirteen
people were found lying in a circle next to their harvester while
another man was slumped over his tractor 150 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs blamed ethnic Albanian militants for the attack and
accused peacekeepers of failing to heed their pleas for protection
during the harvest season. The massacre also dashed early hopes
that the peacekeeping mission would be able to impose ethnic
tolerance in the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's service was closely watched by Finnish and Norwegian
peacekeepers, the private Beta news agency said. Serbs attending
expressed bitterness that NATO and U.N. authorities in the province
had failed to find those responsible for the attack, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the publisher of an Albanian-language newspaper said
he would refuse to pay a fine for violating regulations on
publishing personal information on alleged war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Belul Beqaj declared that his newspaper, Dita, would ignore an
order to pay a fine of $11,900 by Tuesday and suggested the paper
would not change its policy of publishing names of those they
believe were involved in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As long as those people are free, Beqaj said, ''the freedom and
stability of Kosovo will be endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe fined
Dita for repeatedly violating a U.N. regulation against accusing
individuals who have not been charged with a crime of being war
criminals or publishing other information that could make them
targets of retribution.

<HEADLINE> Four more birds test positive for West Nile virus in Westchester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - Four more birds have tested positive
for the West Nile virus in Westchester County, the county health
department said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The birds included three Blue Jays found in Somers, Rye and
Scarsdale and a crow found in Purchase, the health department said.
</P>
<P>
   The department announced plans to begin spraying for mosquitoes
in the communities surrounding the areas where the birds were
found.
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for spraying to tentatively begin on Tuesday in
areas surrounding Yonkers, Greenburgh, Ardsley, White Plains, Rye,
Harrison, Mamaroneck, North Salem, and Somers.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks will spray the pesticide Anvil, the health department
said.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus first appeared in the Western Hemisphere
last summer, killing seven people in the New York area and
infecting 62 others. The outbreak prompted a massive campaign of
aerial and ground spraying.

<HEADLINE> Burlington County GOP leader seeks cranberry bog permit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Burlington County Republican leader who
used 22 acres of protected wetland in the Pinelands to expand
harvesting operations may soon be off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield DeMarco, former Burlington County GOP chairman and a
generous contributor to state Republican causes, has applied for a
newly created state permit that would give the expansion
after-the-fact state approval.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the
acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before
undertaking the expansion. The state Department of Environmental
Protection sent a letter in October 1998 to DeMarco, alerting him
of the violation.
</P>
<P>
   Fines for the illegal destruction of wetlands can be as high as
$10,000 per day. At that rate, the potential penalty now exceeds $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco's attorney, Anthony Drollas, said DEP officials have
given no indication that they plan to impose anywhere near the
maximum potential penalty against the cranberry grower.
</P>
<P>
   DEP spokesman Peter Page said the department is negotiating with
DeMarco over how much to assess in penalties, but he said DeMarco
could have been eligible for a state permit had he sought one.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with DeMarco's possible settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say DeMarco is a well-connected political figure in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   DEP Commissioner Robert C. Shinn is a Burlington County native
and a political protege of DeMarco's. Page said Shinn has excused
himself from the case, citing appearance of a potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Paulsen, chairman of the Burlington County GOP, is manager
of the Trenton office of Capehart &AMP; Scatchard, the law firm
representing DeMarco's application.
</P>
<P>
   State records show DeMarco and the legal and engineering firms
involved in his permit application gave GOP campaigns more than
$200,000 last year. Since 1995, the firms have given New Jersey
Republicans $517,000 - including $196,000 from DeMarco between 1995
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I think this is special-interest money and
special-interest regulatory privilege,'' Bill Neil, director of the
conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions. ''This is a sorry
chapter in New Jersey policy history.''
</P>
<P>
   Drollas said DeMarco's political ties have nothing to do with
the application.
</P>
<P>
   Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in
the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective
maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed
to be off limits to development because of their value as a
wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
</P>
<P>
   Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10
acres in any year. That means DeMarco's 22-acre expansion will have
to be phased in under permits issued over the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Webb Pulling Away at Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- With every birdie putt she made, Karrie Webb
gave a small, hard pump of her fist.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing obnoxious, of course, it's still Saturday. But the
world's No. 1 golfer is pulling away from the field at the U.S.
Women's Open and moving closer to the title she wants more than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   Webb birdied four of her first seven holes and finished with a
4-under-par 68. Her 7-under 209 gives her a four-stroke lead over
Meg Mallon, the leader after the first two rounds, but no other
player is within seven strokes of her.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon gave chase with birdies on the 15th and 16th holes to get
within two strokes of Webb. But she fell off with a double-bogey on
17 and finished with a 1-over 73 for 213.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy King, who started the day tied with Webb at 3 under, fell
out of contention with a 10-over 82 after hurting a muscle in her
lower back on the second hole. She got treatment, but was in
obvious pain the rest of the round as she made six straight bogeys
at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'll be able to play tomorrow or not,'' King
said.
</P>
<P>
   She had tears in her eyes as she walked up the 18th fairway, and
Mallon, her playing partner, patted her on the back.
</P>
<P>
   With its slippery greens, strong, shifting winds and thick,
tangly rough, the Merit Club has been brutal on players all week.
Saturday was no different as only six players managed to shoot
better than par. Webb and Mallon are the only players under par for
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Tiger Woods had little trouble with Pebble Beach at
the men's U.S. Open last month, Webb is cruising through the Merit
Course. She missed only two of the first nine fairways, and missed
only two greens. She never three-putted, and had only two bogeys
her entire round.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting she's turning in a Woods-like performance at the
Women's Open. While Woods has been almost untouchable on the PGA
Tour, Webb has been his equal on the LPGA Tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   She won four of the first five tournaments she played, and
finished second in the other. Throw in victories on the Australian
and Japanese tours, and she's already won six times this year.
Woods has won five times.
</P>
<P>
   She won her second major in record-setting fashion, lapping the
field at the Nabisco Championship by 10 strokes in March. It was
the largest winning margin in the tournament's history. Woods won
the U.S. Open by 15 strokes, the largest margin EVER at a major.
</P>
<P>
   And if she and Woods both win on Sunday -- Woods has a six-stroke
lead at the British Open -- they'll each have won three of their
tour's last four major championships. Webb won the du Maurier
Classic last year for her first major title.
</P>
<P>
   Webb has endured a little bit of a drought, going since March
without a victory. But she's only finished out of the top 10 twice,
and her worst finish was a tie for 18th last week at the Big Apple
Classic.

<HEADLINE> Faxon, Toledo Lead B.C. Open  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENDICOTT, N.Y. (AP) -- Defending champion Brad Faxon shot a
4-under-par 68 on Saturday to tie Esteban Toledo for the
third-round lead in the B.C. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon, trying to become the first player to win the tournament
twice in a row, sank a curving 15-foot putt for birdie on No. 18 to
finish at 202, 14 under par. Toledo, who began the day with a
three-shot lead, made a great save for par on the final hole to
finish with a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kelly was alone in second, two shots off the lead after a
67, and Canada's Glen Hnatiuk was another stroke back at 205. Joe
Ogilvie and Grant Waite were tied for fifth at 206, and Dave
Stockton Jr. led a group of six players at 207.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Mast, whose scintillating 64 on Friday had vaulted him to 9
under to start the day, had a double-bogey 6 on the second hole and
two other bogeys and finished with a 74.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McCarron, who began the day at 10 under, watched his round
disintegrate to a 73 when his second shot on the treacherous No. 15
found the water hazard guarding the elevated green. He had to
settle for a double bogey-6.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a boxer-turned-golfer from Mexico, has never won in five
full years on the PGA Tour. After shooting rounds of 64 and 67, he
began the third day cautiously, parring the first eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy downpour slammed the course at mid-afternoon on Friday,
long after Toledo had finished his round, and he said he had
trouble adjusting to the slower greens.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the same threesome, Faxon put pressure on early with
a birdie on the first hole, but then his tee shots began drifting
awry. He hit into the left rough under a red maple tree on No. 3
but scrambled for par.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth hole, a 565-yard par-5, Faxon again drove into the
left rough under some trees. His second shot hit another tree, and
when his third shot landed in the rough to the right of the green,
he had his only bogey of the round.
</P>
<P>
   While Faxon was struggling with his driver, Toledo couldn't get
his putter going on the front nine. Then his normally accurate
driver -- he's 36th in driving accuracy on the PGA Tour -- deserted
him on No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's tee shot on the par-4, 407-yard hole sailed into the
trees along the right side, and when his second shot clipped
another tree he had to settle for bogey and fell into a three-way
tie for the lead with Faxon and Kelly at 12 under.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last long. Faxon, who had rallied with birdies on
Nos. 6 and 8, briefly took the lead with 50-foot birdie putt at 10.
But Toledo matched that, setting up a short putt with a pretty sand
shot from a greenside bunker to within 2 feet of the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who had eight birdies on the front nine and finished with
a second-round 63 to move high up the leaderboard, looked like he
would be the man to beat on the sunny, somewhat breezy day. Kelly
reeled off five more birdies on his first seven holes Saturday, but
then cooled off and finished the round with 12 straight pars.
</P>
<P>
   Hnatiuk couldn't find the touch that had produced a pair of 67s
the first two days. He started the day at 10 under but had bogey on
two of the first four holes before rallying with three straight
birdies to start the back nine. Another bogey on the par-3,
185-yard No. 17 dropped him a shot behind Kelly.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks in Low Gear  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Middle East summit is in low gear in
deference to the Jewish Sabbath, but negotiations are going on,
quietly and informally, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders await
President Clinton's return.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Jews devote Saturday to prayer and rest; secular
Israelis normally do neither. But it could be politically unwise
for an Israeli official to conduct normal business on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, discussions were apt to be quiet at the Camp David
presidential retreat as the summit passed through a slow period
until sundown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, attending an economic summit in Japan, trimmed his
schedule so he could return to the Camp David talks by Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president was
briefed on the status of the talks while en route to a meeting
Saturday morning (Friday night EDT) with Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori, and ''his intention is to get back to Camp David as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have continued their discussions, but there are some
things the leaders have to do among themselves,'' Lockhart said.
''I expect him to get right back to work when he gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is acting as host in
Clinton's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view, the parties are making serious efforts,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday, before the onset
of the Sabbath. ''But nonetheless, it is hard going.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations remained shrouded in the secrecy that has marked
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher provided scant information before a ''lid'' was clamped
on public statements until Sunday morning. He said some news
reports of summit proceedings have been accurate, but most were
not.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, two Israeli officials disclosed Friday that the
United States was promoting an Israeli-initiated proposal to
recognize Palestinian administrative control over Arab
neighborhoods of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to clear the most stubborn obstacle to a Camp David
peace agreement, deep differences on Jerusalem's future.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Melchior, a rabbi who is a member of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's cabinet, said the proposal conveyed the
''characteristic'' of Palestinian sovereignty in the eastern area
of the contested city, a long-cherished Palestinian goal.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting coolly to the ideas, Hassan Abdel Rahman, Washington
representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said:
''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, there
is not a ground for an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman told The Associated Press by telephone he could not
verify that such a proposal had been put on the table at secluded
Camp David, where the summit was in its 11th day.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is demanding sovereignty over
East Jerusalem, the city's older area that Israel captured from
Jordanian troops in the 1967 Six-Day War. He envisions it as the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to keep Jerusalem a united city.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has refused to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's
capital, although Clinton promised that recognition in his campaign
for the White House eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Palestinians
in 1991 that Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem was invalid,
Rahman recalled, ''and I have not heard the United States had
changed its position.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current plan, Palestinian areas outside the city also
would be placed under Palestinian administrative control.
</P>
<P>
   ''These villages are not really ours,'' Israeli Justice Minister
Yossi Beilin told Israel army radio. ''We must not allow this
mirage to become an obstruction to Ehud Barak to arrive at the
dream of peace with the Palestinians, now so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Melchior said the plan would give the Palestinians some
''symbols of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   He said later through an aide that this characterization was his
own and did not emerge from the talks at Camp David.

<HEADLINE> Court: Spain Owns Sunken Warships  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Spain owns the remains of two warships that
sank off the Virginia coast two centuries ago, a federal appeals
court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judge's ruling
last year granting Spain title to the Juno, which disappeared off
the Eastern Shore in 1802 with about 435 passengers aboard.
According to some accounts, the ship was laden with as much as $500
million in coins and precious metals.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also reversed a judge's ruling on a second
ship, La Galga. The judge had ruled that the ship, which sank in
1750 a few miles north of what is believed to be the Juno site,
belonged to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Spain appealed the decision and now owns both shipwrecks, even
though they are well within the three-mile limit that Congress
established as territorial waters for coastal states.
</P>
<P>
   The court based its decision on a 1902 treaty between Spain and
the United States, saying the pact is ''essential to protecting
United States shipwrecks and military gravesites'' in other parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company Sea Hunt had salvage rights to the ships. Ben
Benson, president of the company, said he has spent about $2
million on the project -- much of it on legal fees. Benson said he
and state officials will discuss whether to appeal Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's claims of ownership of the ships are the first the
country has made in hundreds of years of losing ships in nearby
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, it looks like we have Spanish enclaves dotting our
shore,'' said Anthony F. Troy, a former Virginia attorney general
who represented Benson.

<HEADLINE> State officials urge calm after virus discovery  </HEADLINE>
syfonsstmho
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - State officials on Saturday urged people
not to panic as they made plans to spray against an outbreak of the
West Nile-like strain of the encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   Infected mosquitoes have been discovered in Stamford, the first
sign of the virus this year in Connecticut. As a result, the state
Department of Environmental Protection will spray in the towns of
Stamford, Darien and New Canaan Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the spraying, combined with routine precautions
against mosquitoes, should minimize the risk any humans will
contract the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipated finding the virus because it's been found all
around the region,'' DEP spokeswoman Michele Sullivan said
Saturday. Mosquitoes and birds have tested positive for the virus
in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spraying is just to reduce the mosquito population and try
to reduce the ramifications of the virus,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stamford mosquitoes, trapped at Sleepy Hollow Park in the
Springdale section July 11, primarily bite birds but have been
known to bite humans, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases of the virus have ever been confirmed in
Connecticut. Last year, the virus sickened 62 New Yorkers, killing
seven but it has not been detected in humans this year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is most dangerous for children under 5, the elderly
and people with weakened immune systems. Otherwise, it causes
flu-like symptoms in healthy adults.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP will spray the pesticide Resmethrin from canisters
mounted on trucks - the same method used last year after the
outbreak in lower Fairfield County. The spraying will begin around
sunset and take up to six hours to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying will take place in the eastern half of Stamford,
between the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95; the western half of
Darien from I-95 to the New Canaan line; and the southwestern
portion of New Canaan from the Darien/Stamford lines to the Merritt
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   The area comprises a two-mile radius from Sleepy Hollow Park. If
it rains, the spraying will have to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   A group calling themselves ''Connecticut Safe,'' held a meeting
in Stamford Saturday to express opposition to the spraying. Rivka
Lieber said they consider the risk of becoming ill from the
pesticide to be greater than the risk of contracting the virus from
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want safer solutions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford Health Director Anthony Iton said such concerns are
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm no fan of pesticides,'' he said. ''I think in general
they're used without appropriate discretion and they are not used
in a targeted manner. This particular application is a targeted,
rational and prudent use of these pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, who was critical of the state's
response to the virus last year, said officials were doing a better
job this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes have been trapped weekly at 73 sites around the state
since June 1, tested for both West Nile and Eastern Equine
Encephalitis. More than 90 dead birds have been tested for the
virus. The state has distributed $500,000 to aid municipalities'
anti-mosquito programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all prevention efforts, however, Malloy said the virus
shows no signs of disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect we're going to be dealing with this disease for at
least a few years,'' Malloy said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Positions Under Chechen Fire  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Independence fighters mounted a series of
hit-and run attacks on Russian troops in Chechnya, lobbing shells
on Russian posts in the capital of Grozny and detonating a mine
under a truck carrying soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The truck struck the mine on Saturday near Noviye Atagi, about
six miles south of Grozny, military officials said. The Interior
Ministry press center said that there were casualties, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   No casualties were reported after guerillas shelled Russian
positions in Chechnya 10 times in 24 hours starting Friday night,
including eight attacks in Grozny, the Russian military command
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials estimate that about 500 rebels remain in
Grozny, despite the taking of the city by federal forces in
February when most of the guerrillas fled the city.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has insisted for months that the rebels are on the verge
of defeat, but the separatists have turned to sniping, car bombs
and remote-control land mines to show they can still inflict harm
on Russian positions in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, four Interior Ministry soldiers were killed and three
others injured when their truck was blown up by a mine in the Shali
region south of Grozny, the news agency Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces also tried to keep up the pressure on the rebels
on Saturday, sending Su-25 attack planes and helicopter gunships on
sorties against the Argun gorge, a key rebel refuge and supply
route in the mountainous southern part of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops scoured forests for rebels near the
settlements of Samashki and Zakan Yurt west of Grozny, the military
command said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian units on the border with the neighboring region of
Dagestan have been put on alert because of the upsurge in rebel
attacks, officials said. The past several days have seen a spate of
ambushes in which at least 10 Russian soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say that the rebels have stepped up their
attacks to embarrass Russian President Vladimir Putin during the
Group of Eight summit in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
independence fighters, and Moscow lost control of the region.
Troops returned in September after militants based in Chechnya
attacked villages in Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Reds Expect Larkin To Reject Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin is getting tugged on from all
sides as he makes the biggest decision of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds fans urged him to stay Saturday, giving the
All-Star shortstop an emotion-stirring ovation. The Mets lobbied
him by phone to accept a trade to New York to strengthen them for a
playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the commotion, Reds general manager Jim Bowden
predicted Larkin will reject a trade to the Mets and finish the
season in Cincinnati. Bowden urged his team captain to make up his
mind fast.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Larkin, who will decide whether to approve the
trade to New York for three players, whose identity has not been
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an emotional roller coaster,'' Larkin said following a
7-3 victory over Arizona. ''I actually thought I might not be here
today, but I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office gave the Mets permission to negotiate
with Larkin during a 72-hour window that started at 10 a.m.
Saturday. It probably won't take that long.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets want Larkin to fill in for shortstop Rey Ordonez, out
the rest of the season with a broken arm. Larkin has indicated he's
not interested going to a team for a half-season, preferring a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin was noncommittal before learning about the Mets' plans
first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's something my agent (Eric Goldschmidt) and I have to
talk about, my family as well,'' Larkin said. ''It's not cast in
stone. We have to wait and see what's on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips spoke with Goldschmidt
several times during the game. Phillips expects to have a good idea
of whether the trade will go through by midday Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would take whatever Barry is willing to give us the last two
months,'' Phillips said. ''I understand that he's from Cincinnati
and it would be tough to live out of a suitcase for two months. In
the end, it comes down to whether he gets a contract extension or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Reds general manager is convinced Larkin will
veto the trade. Bowden urged the two sides to reach a decision
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds arranged the trade after rejecting Larkin's request for
a three-year, $27.9 million extension. Larkin can become a free
agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of now, the Mets have told me they are not willing to sign
him for $27.9 million,'' Bowden said. ''Barry and his agent have
informed us if they don't sign him for $27.9 million, then he's
going to reject the trade. So based on what I'm hearing, I think at
some point it gets rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   If the trade is rejected, Larkin will finish the season in
Cincinnati, Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he rejects the deal, there will be no other deals,'' Bowden
said. ''This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin is holding out hope that he can work out an extension
with the Reds that will allow him to finish his career in
Cincinnati. His hometown let him know how it feels about him
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous pro-Larkin banners in the stadium and he got
a 20-second standing ovation before his first at-bat. Larkin backed
out of the box, waved to the fans, then lowered his head and stood
motionless while the cheers washed over him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to step out. I was very appreciative,'' Larkin said.
''It's an emotional time for me. I think you could see it in the
mistakes I made out there today.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin went 1-for-5, struck out twice, hit into a double play
and grounded into a forceout with the bases loaded, lowering his
average to .322.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets considered flying a contingent of team officials,
manager Bobby Valentine and players Lenny Harris and John Franco to
Cincinnati following their game Saturday afternoon in Atlanta, but
couldn't get arrangements worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to get an audience with Barry and see if we could
convince him this is the place to play,'' Phillips said. ''We hope
he wants to come, make a run at the playoffs, make a run at the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin will be a free agent after this season, when he makes
$5.3 million. He was coming off a National League MVP season when
he agreed to an extension in 1996 that was well below market value,
but wants a better contract this time.
</P>
<P>
   If Larkin ends up leaving, he'll be the second player claimed by
the club's midseason slump, joining Denny Neagle, who was traded to
the Yankees for prospects a day after the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't come, I'll understand,'' said Franco, who spoke
to Larkin by phone. ''It's a tough situation for him and his
family. He's been there his whole career. We'll sit back and wait
for his decision. Hopefully, it will be the right decision for
him.''

<HEADLINE> Probe Continues in Torricelli Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have begun questioning
aides to Sen. Robert Torricelli after obtaining guilty pleas from
people who made illegal contributions to his 1996 Senate campaign,
according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Stern, an executive assistant to Torricelli, took the
Fifth Amendment when she was subpoenaed to testify on June 2 in
Newark before a grand jury investigating political donor David
Chang, according to Saturday's editions of The New York Times. amd
The Record of Hackensack and
</P>
<P>
   People close to the senator told The New York Times that several
other aides have also been questioned by prosecutors and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with the Times, Torricelli said he
believed the federal investigation into his campaign fund raising
had ended when Chang, who lives in Cresskill, pleaded guilty to
campaign finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys familiar with the case told both newspapers that
the investigation has been continuing since Chang decided to
cooperate with authorities in exchange for a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is among 25 people charged by the Campaign Financing Task
Force and among seven who have admitted wrongdoing in connection
with Torricelli fund-raising efforts. None of the seven has
implicated the New Jersey Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli isn't accused of any wrongdoing. He has maintained he
was unaware of the improper donations and has said all such money
is donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli raised $9.2 million to defeat Rep. Richard A. Zimmer
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Republicans nominate Waterbury mayor for U.S. Senate  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano,
acknowledging he has a tough race to run, accepted the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano spent much of his acceptance speech at the state
Republican convention attacking the record of his opponent,
two-term U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed Lieberman for Connecticut's high federal tax burden
and for the loss of defense jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other senators around the country are doing justice to their
states, but our senator, Joe Lieberman, is not doing justice to our
state,'' Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein defended the senator's record.
He said even Republican leaders - including state party Chairman
Chris DePino - have called Lieberman the ''conscious of the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman plans to run a vigorous campaign, Gerstein added, and
will continue let people know what he has done for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Waterbury mayor said, if elected, he would
support Republican tax plans, like the elimination of the marriage
penalty and the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano also pledged to support a Constitutional amendment
against burning the American flag, and he said he would vote to ban
the late-term abortion procedure known as ''partial-birth
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano admitted it would be a difficult campaign against
Lieberman, who enjoyed a 5-to-1 vote of support in a Quinnipiac
University poll this week.
</P>
<P>
   He likened his campaign to U.S. forces during the Battle of the
Bulge, who refused to surrender and eventually defeated Germany.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 of the state's 1,400 delegates came to the
convention at Sacred Heart University to support Giordano and to
vote for the party's eight members of the electoral college.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters waved purple and white Giordano signs and paraded to
rock music by Kiss and Van Halen as Giordano took the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano began his speech with welcomes in English, Italian and
Spanish, reflecting his Italian ethnicity and his childhood in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ''And who says the Republican party is not the party of
inclusion?'' he asked the crowd, who answered with applause.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano came to Waterbury when he was 5 years old, graduated
from parochial schools and served in the U.S. Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   After his military service, he earned a law degree and became an
assistant in the city's legal office.
</P>
<P>
   His political career began in 1995 with election to the state
House of Representatives. Later that year, he was elected mayor,
and he has been re-elected twice since.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano cited his accomplishments as mayor: no tax increase in
three years, a drop in crime he attributed to community policing
and innovative public school ideas, such as mandatory uniforms and
summer school.
</P>
<P>
   His leadership in Waterbury has not been without controversy,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities investigated
hiring practices in the public schools after the Waterbury
Republican-American reported widespread patronage within the school
department.
</P>
<P>
   Reports also said affirmative action policies were ignored,
leaving Waterbury schools with the lowest ratio of minority
teachers out of the state's five largest school districts.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after the convention, Giordano attributed
the CHRO investigation to the complaint of a ''local radical.'' He
said the investigation has been going on for 1&AMP;frac12; years, without
action from the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has had well-publicized financial troubles brought
on by the bankruptcy of a firm hired to collect its taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano laid off 170 city employees earlier this year after the
city's 11 unions rejected his request to take four furlough days
before the end of the fiscal year. Giordano said he had no choice
but to lay off workers or raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The unions eventually agreed to concessions and most of the
laid-off workers got their jobs back.

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jonathan Kiser, the leading steeplechase rider
in the country with 16 victories in 55 mounts, died Friday from
severe head injuries after an accident at his sister's home. He was
22.
</P>
<P>
   Kiser won his first race in 1994 and won two riding
championships in the last three seasons. He had been expected to
ride several horses for prominent steeplechase trainer Tommy Voss
during the upcoming Saratoga meeting.
Roberto Suarez Gomez:

<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Roberto Suarez Gomez, a drug trafficker
who called himself the ''King of Cocaine'' and claimed to be the
model for a character in the movie ''Scarface,'' died Thursday from
a heart attack, his family said. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez played a major role in the expansion of cocaine
trafficking in Bolivia, and gained notoriety in 1983 when he
offered to pay the country's foreign debt of $3 billion with
proceeds from cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a main financial supporter of a military regime that
held power from 1980 to 1982.

<P>
   Suarez Gomez's downfall came in 1988 when he was sentenced to 15
years for drug crimes. He was released early, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By his death, most of his vast fortune had dissipated and the
one-time drug lord said he was repentant.

<HEADLINE> Woman To Lead Moderate Baptists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship,
formed 10 years ago as a moderate alternative to the Southern
Baptist Convention, has appointed another woman to its top
leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Forrester is the first ordained woman and fifth woman
named to lead the 1,800-church fellowship. She has been the
minister of pastoral care and counseling at Greenville First
Baptist Church since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester, 50, was elected moderator at the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship's convention in Orlando earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship sends out its own
missionaries and supports moderate seminaries. Churches can be
members of the fellowship and the 41,000-church Southern Baptist
Convention at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville First Baptist was an early contributor of the
fellowship, and Forrester was an early moderator on the state
level.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has drive and energy and initiative, but she would not
have sought this position,'' said Fred Andrea, moderator of the
state fellowship. ''This position sought her.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester was first woman on her church's pastoral staff. She
paid her way through seminary while working as a full-time
psychiatric nurse. As she completed her doctorate, she practiced in
an alcohol and drug treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   As a preacher's daughter growing up in Columbia, the church she
attended had no female deacons. But ''from a very early age, I was
taught by women and was told, 'You listen to God and be whatever
God wants you to be,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Spain Socialist Party Picks Leader  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain's Socialist Party on Saturday chose
as its new leader a 39-year-old lawmaker who promised to rejuvenate
the party and end internal squabbling that has hurt it at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, a congressman from the northern
Leon region who has been with the party since he was 19, must now
form a leadership group, which will face a vote of approval from
the party congress on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Zapatero now faces the task of bolstering the
fragmented Socialist Party -- an all the more difficult job since
the overwhelming March 12 election victory of center-right Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar and his Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's vote, Rodriguez Zapatero defeated his three
opponents by a narrow margin, dealing a surprise upset to Jose
Bono, a 49-year-old criminal lawyer who was the favorite after 17
years as the president of the Castilla-La Mancha regional
government.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the vote, Rodriguez Zapatero, who benefited from
the vote of younger party members, pleaded for party unity and said
he would seek to restore the party by a return to its ideals. He
promised to reach out to small businessmen and the self-employed
and work to increase the number of women in Spain's work force.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party
ruled for nearly 14 years starting in 1982, and for many Spaniards,
it is synonymous with their country's successful transition to
democracy after decades of dictatorship under Gen. Francisco
Franco, who died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But the party was voted out of office in 1996, in large part due
to corruption scandals. Its popularity continued to crumble as the
party leadership appeared more interested in political infighting
than revamping the party's image or coming up with new policies.
</P>
<P>
   The defeats at the polls drove Socialist leader and candidate
Joaquin Almunia to resign, paving the way for this vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Whodunit?
</P>
<P>
   That'll be up to all you would-be writers out there.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain wrote, ''A Murder, a Mystery, and a Marriage,'' in
1876 but never published it. It was the same year the author born
Samuel Clemens started - and devoted most of his time to - a little
thing called ''Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, an effort that touches both coasts will digitally publish
the short-story about a modest Midwest family, a romance, a
mysterious count and, as the title implies, a rather notorious
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is, readers will be left dangling, unable to
taste one of Twain's famously twisting finales. The Buffalo &AMP; Erie
County Public Library, with permission from the Mark Twain Project
in Berkeley, Calif., is asking readers to finish the story, for a
shot at $25,000 in prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story is really a perfect choice for the contest,''
University at Buffalo English professor Victor Doyno tells the
Buffalo Evening News in its Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Doyno, who edited the 1996 Random House edition of ''Huckleberry
Finn,'' which included previously unpublished parts of the novel,
said Twain wrote an outline of ''A Murder ...'' as a sort of test
for himself and the friends - like William Dean Howells - he shared
it with.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's version of the story is the only one that survives, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twain had a way of writing himself into a situation where only
he knew the way out,'' Doyno said. ''Midway through this one, even
as a Twain scholar, I was thinking, ''How's he going to get out of
this one?' I think he liked creating the situation ... then he was
devious enough to find his way out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The story's certainly not a great critical success by Mark
Twain ... it's more of a running high jump,'' said Dr. Robert H.
Hirst, head of the Mark Twain Project, a group based in Berkeley,
Calif., that holds print rights to Twain's work but has transferred
the digital rights to the Buffalo library. ''It's a challenge: How
much of a genius can you be?''
</P>
<P>
   And Twain's ending?
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people didn't cotton to it very well, that's for sure,''
said Hirst. ''It's extremely complicated ... but that's part of the
fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the digital release also included the Mark
Twain Foundation in New York City. The digital publication of the
story will tie in with a carnival of Mark Twain activities and
events in Buffalo next year, including release of a ''Huckleberry
Finn'' CD-ROM.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Posts Secret CIA Papers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private Web site has published a secret CIA
overview of the U.S. intelligence community prepared for Japanese
intelligence officials who visited the agency's headquarters in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing containing information on the CIA's budgets and
personnel trends was posted by John Young, 64, a New York City
architect whose Web site has displayed government documents on
intelligence and encryption issues since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Young published an unedited version of a secret
history of the 1953 CIA-mastered coup in Iran that was originally
published on The New York Times Web site with portions blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he received the 1998 CIA briefing by e-mail from an
anonymous source in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a standing invitation for anyone who wants to have
something published that governments don't want published,'' Young
said Saturday in an interview, noting that he does not verify the
authenticity of what he publishes. ''We put it up and let people
tell us if it's a spoof or if it's genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow wouldn't comment on the documents, but
an unnamed senior intelligence official quoted in The Washington
Post's Sunday editions said official visitors from the Japanese
agency were authorized to receive the secret briefing at CIA
headquarters in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public disclosure of that information is troubling,'' the
official said. ''In terms of the information (in the briefing), it
is not insignificant. We're always concerned when classified
information is disclosed publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA briefing materials, described as presented by Charles E.
Allen, the assistant director of central intelligence for
collection, say that the number of people working for the National
Foreign Intelligence Program, encompassing all civilian and
military foreign intelligence activity, fell by more than 20
percent -- 20,559 employees -- between 1991 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's calling card, including his home telephone number, is
part of the materials. Allen could not be reached immediately for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Young has also posted a file obtained from the same source that
shows the names, birth dates and titles of hundreds of employees of
Japan's equivalent of the FBI, the Public Security Investigation
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was contacted Thursday by two FBI agents from the
New York field office who passed along a request from the Japanese
Ministry of Justice that he remove the lists of agents from his
site. Young said he refused the request and was told to expect
direct contact from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   FBI headquarters spokeswoman Julie Miller said she wasn't
familiar with Young or his Web site. James Margolin, FBI spokesman
for the New York office, was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Shinjo, head of the General Affairs Department of Japan's
Public Security Investigation Agency, was quoted by the Post as
saying the Japanese government believes the source of the materials
is an agency employee who resigned under pressure in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Catholics Called To Pay Slave Labor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Lawmakers from across the political spectrum are
calling on the Roman Catholic Church to pay into a fund to
compensate Nazi-era slave and forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Lambsdorff, the German government's chief envoy on the Nazi
labor issue, said the church shares in the universal responsibility
that Germany has for Nazi labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last years of the war, one couldn't have run an
organization without forced laborers because all the other people
able to the do the work were in the Wehrmacht,'' said Lambsdorff in
an interview with Bild am Sonntag newspaper to be published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports in the last week have said that the Catholic
Church used forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   A church in Bavaria used 16 Russian and four Polish forced
laborers, along with 19 French prisoners of war, according to the
German Bishops Conference. Records show the laborers were paid for
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials in Berlin are also investigating whether forced
laborers worked in cemeteries. The officials told the Berliner
Morgenpost newspaper they would not make a decision on paying into
the fund until they made a determination, which they expect by the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Catholic church has said it had no plans to make a
general contribution to the fund, though it has not ruled out
contributions by local churches.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives involved in talks on resolving one of the last
unaddressed evils of the Nazi regime signed a historic agreement
this week on a $5 billion fund to compensate surviving laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The fund includes money for slave laborers -- intended to
literally be worked to death in concentration camps -- and also
forced laborers deported from their homes in eastern Europe to keep
the German war machine running.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 German businesses have pledged $1.5 billion so
far to the $5 billion fund, which is to be financed 50-50 by
industry and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers calling on the church to pay include Max
Stadler, a Free Democrat parliament member, who pointed out that
the Evangelical Church has already pledged to contribute $5 million
to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would wish for such a gesture independent of whether the
church participated in the forced labor system,'' the head of
parliament's internal affairs committee, Ute Vogt, a Social
Democrat, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview to be
published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million former laborers are expected to be eligible
for payments, which Germany hopes to begin this year.

<HEADLINE> Gore Plans Symbolic Baton Passing  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has set a
schedule for his nominating convention that features a ''symbolic
passing of the baton'' from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles convention, beginning Aug. 14, will be important
to Gore's effort to refine his image and spell out a message that's
different from Clinton's without breaking with the administration.
That's traditionally a tricky task for a vice president trying to
succeed to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flew to Tennessee on Saturday but had no public events
there.
</P>
<P>
   With attention increasingly focused on then upcoming GOP
convention, Gore was focusing on raising money for Democrats on
Sunday, speaking at Democratic National Committee fund-raising
events in New Jersey and New York, before heading to the key
battleground state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides, meanwhile, disclosed plans for a convention with
daily themes echoing the message that Gore will make in campaign
stops as he works his way across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Gore won the endorsement of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members believe that a vote for Gore is the best way to
protect our families from pollution and safeguard our nation's
landscapes for future generations to enjoy,'' Robert Cox, president
of the 600,000-member environmental group, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accepted an endorsement in May from the League of
Conservation Voters, a political umbrella group representing 9
million members of various environmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all environmentalists support the vice president. In fact,
Sierra Club board member Michael Dorsey, in an internal e-mail sent
eight months ago and released in May by the Republican National
Committee, criticized Gore's environmental record. He also urged
his colleagues to endorse Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, who
has risen in the national polls in recent weeks, presumably cutting
into Gore's support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was spending a quiet Saturday in Nashville, Tenn., is
to arrive at the convention on Aug. 16. Aides offered a unique
twist for his crucial acceptance speech Aug. 17: He will be
introduced by his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   The convention opens Aug. 14 with a theme of ''Prosperity and
Progress.'' Speakers, including Clinton, will laud the strong
economy that Clinton administration leaves after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Other first night speakers will be women Senate candidates,
among them the Democrats' candidate in New York, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Convention officials said the night also will
feature ordinary women who have gained from the economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The theme on Aug. 15 is ''You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet'' and
builds on Gore's proposals. Speakers include Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, former Gore rival Bill Bradley and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore comes to southern California on Aug. 15 to meet with
Clinton outside Los Angeles for what a campaign aide said will be a
''symbolic passing of the baton.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will be similar to former President Ronald Reagan's
handing over the torch to his vice president, George Bush, in 1988.
Campaign aides said unlike the Reagan-Bush event, the Gore exchange
will be at a function where policy proposals will be made. ''It
will be a substantive event,'' an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   By coupling campaign events across the country with convention
themes, aides hope to increase attention to the campaign in an era
where television coverage of conventions is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The theme on Aug. 16 is ''Al Gore: The Principled Fighter,''
telling what convention officials said was Gore's history of taking
on special interests. It will feature Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore
Schiff, a campaign adviser who has emphasized enlisting young
people into the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes Gore's big night on Aug. 17, in which he will deliver
an acceptance speech intended to define his campaign. Aides said
having Mrs. Gore introduce her husband is unique, meant to stress a
partnership between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Gore moves from the convention into a boat trip through the
politically crucial Midwest, which Gore's campaign advisers expect
to be the election's biggest battleground.
</P>
<P>
   The boat trip will be on the Mississippi River and the Great
Lakes.

<HEADLINE> Danish Police: Concert Security OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Police have ruled that the deaths of
nine people in a crush at a rock festival featuring the band Pearl
Jam was a freak accident and safety precautions were sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Eight young men died at the scene and another died of his
injuries a few days later as fans crowded in to hear the American
band June 30 at the Roskilde Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were from Denmark, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-week investigation, police decided the festival's
organizers were not responsible for their deaths, Police Chief
Constable Uffe Kornerup said Monday. The final report was delivered
to the Justice and Culture ministries this week, as is standard
procedure, and no further action was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Slippery mud due to heavy rains worsened the situation at the
outdoor festival in Roskilde, 25 miles west of Copenhagen, Kornerup
said. About 74,000 tickets had been sold for the day's
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Security measures included physical barriers designed to prevent
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's normal that young people push and squeeze at rock
concerts, but here it sadly developed in a catastrophic way,''
Kornerup said .
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major accident at the four-day festival, which
was first held in 1971 and was inspired by the 1969 Woodstock
Festival in upstate New York.

<HEADLINE> Moulds Charged Up for Bills Season  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- It hasn't taken Eric Moulds long to find
his graceful stride and soft hands.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up from where he left off last year, Moulds is already
making remarkable catches, electrifying the crowd and making
defenders shake their heads in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills receiver is feeling so well that he was
considering pulling back the reins Saturday. Heck, it's only two
days into training camp, and he is looking ahead to a big season.
</P>
<P>
   Why waste it now?
</P>
<P>
   ''(Defensive coordinator) Ted Cottrell came up to me at lunch
and told me that he was going to start doubling me if I keep doing
those types of things,'' Moulds said. ''So I had better slow down a
little bit because I want to try to get some one-on-one coverage,
and get some work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulds will get plenty of work this year. With Andre Reed's
departure, Moulds officially attains the status as the Bills' go-to
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, Moulds has been the man since his breakout season
in 1998 when he broke Reed's franchise record and led the AFC with
1,368 yards in receptions. Despite a nagging hamstring injury last
season, Moulds still led the Bills with 994 yards and seven
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Fully recovered, Moulds said he feels ''more explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can do a lot better than that,'' he said, referring
to his 1998 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Helping motivate Moulds is this being the final year of his
contract. He can't help but consider the multimillion-dollar prize
that could be awaiting him next winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're a competitor, and you see all these guys getting these
big contracts and, of course, you would like to be in that
situation,'' Moulds said. ''But you still have to go out this year
and have a good showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Having kept track of the team's offseason moves to clear room
under the salary cap, Moulds hoped some of that was being saved for
him because he wants to remain a Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be here and I'm pretty sure it'll get done,'' he
said. ''But I just go out there and approach it that if I play well
then I figure they'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   How well Moulds does depends on how well Peerless Price handles
the responsibility of taking over the No. 2 wide receiver job.
Coming off a promising rookie season, Price will have to prove
himself a consistent threat in order to take the pressure off of
Moulds.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I'm looking for,'' Price said. ''I know he's the
go-to guy. He's pushing me and telling me to take some of the
pressure off of him. That's what I'm looking to do and, in the
process, have a great season myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Price finished with 359 yards and three touchdowns, while
starting in four games last season. This winter, he hired a
personal trainer to make sure he was prepared for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Price has looked strong in camp, but it is Moulds who has been
most impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see Eric Moulds is ready to play,'' coach Wade Phillips
said. ''The defensive coaches just shake their heads when it's him
making the play, because the defensive back was in good position
and (Moulds) still made the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Antoine Winfield had a running battle with Moulds
during Saturday morning's session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competing against Eric Moulds, a Pro Bowler, only can get
myself better,'' Winfield said. ''He was good. He's in great shape.
... I think he's one of the top receivers in the league right
now.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Town Amazed at Water Help  </HEADLINE>
By PAM EASTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   THROCKMORTON, Texas (AP) -- Some people are hoping divine
intervention will end the worst drought in this cactus-covered,
west Texas town since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But an army of volunteers from nearby rain-blessed areas isn't
taking any chances. It has spent the past week in 100-degree-plus
temperatures digging a 4-foot-deep trench into the parched
landscape. Eventually, that trench will carry a pipeline -- and
water -- to a treatment plant 21 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Without rain, and without the pipeline, the drinking water will
be gone in less than 60 days, says Mayor John Kunkel. No relief was
in sight this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Throckmorton is one of 159 Texas towns and cities with water
restrictions. In February, the state declared Throckmorton County
and 94 others drought disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   Even big cities such as Houston are starting to feel the
drought's effects. Last week, Houston Mayor Lee Brown asked
residents to voluntarily conserve water. On the same day, Galveston
residents and businesses were told to cut their water usage. Austin
also has enacted strict watering restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Don Peck, 68, is one of the many volunteers who have come
forward to help Throckmorton with its water problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a chance to help other people when you know they really
need it,'' said Peck, a retired chemical engineer who drove 260
miles from Longview to lend his expertise to the project. ''Without
water, you can't do much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who live in Throckmorton know that well. Many residents
began buying water from other sources and hauling it to their homes
months ago. Others have had to sell off or keep moving their cattle
because there just isn't enough water or green pasture to keep the
livestock healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the city turn on their faucet and the water works
and they take it for granted,'' resident Byron Parrott said. ''We
have families out here using the same water to take baths in.''
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline project began this week, days after Throckmorton
reached an agreement with nearby Graham for an emergency backup
water supply. Since then, about 100 volunteers have showed up daily
to help the town connect with Graham's water treatment plant in
Elbert. The first seven miles of the line have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   An $800,000 state grant is being used to pay for the pipeline,
which Kunkel hopes to complete in the next three weeks. What the
grant doesn't pay for is the manpower to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkel says that's what has made the volunteers so vital to
Throckmorton's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all been overwhelming,'' he said. ''We're working out
here in 105 and 106 degree temperatures and it's not easy, but all
of us feel real good about what we're doing. As a town, it's
renewed our faith in people and that when you're in trouble, people
are going to come help out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's anybody in this county who could have
predicted how bad this West Texas drought has been,'' Kunkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
said if a line was drawn vertically down the state slightly west of
Fort Worth, everyone west of that line is on the wrong side of the
drought line.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service records show that Graham, which sits in
Young County, received about 6 inches of rain each month compared
to about an inch or two of rain in neighboring Throckmorton County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had above normal temperatures and below average
rainfall, and it is really beginning to show in these small and
rural systems without much backup,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Since late last week, four water systems have reported they are
in dire situations to get water. Pumps have gone out and wells have
dried up, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blistering heat, new volunteers keep turning up each
day to lend a hand to Throckmorton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just knew I had to come,'' said Russ Lane, who shut down his
plumbing business and drove 220 miles from Austin. ''There's no
rational reason why. It's hot out here. But you always carry a lot
more out of experiences like this than you carry in.''

<HEADLINE> Missing since 1944, remains of New York airman returned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Pvt. Vincent J. Netherwood has finally come
home, his body returned to his family after laying hidden atop a
Chinese mountain for nearly six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Netherwood was 20 in 1944. He was engaged to be married after
World War II ended.
</P>
<P>
   For him and nine other U.S. airmen, the war ended in 1944 when
their plane crashed into a mountainside in China. For 56 years, his
family - including six brothers and sisters - wondered if they
would ever be able to bury their kin in his hometown of Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were found in a rugged ravine on Mao'er Mountain in
Guangxi province. All 10 airmen died when their B-24 bomber crashed
during a return flight to Guangxi after bombing Japanese ships near
Taiwan on Aug. 31, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. military records, the crew members in addition
to tail gunner Netherwood were pilot 2nd Lt. George H. Pierpont;
co-pilot 2nd Lt. Franklin A. Tomenendale; navigator 2nd Lt. Robert
L. Deming; bombardier 2nd Lt. George A. Ward; engineer Staff Sgt.
Anthony W. DeLucia; radio operator Sgt. Ellsworth V. Kelley; radar
observer Pfc. Fred P. Buckley; and gunners Staff Sgt. William A.
Drager, Sgt. Robert L. Kearsey.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense did not provide the men's hometowns.
They were members of the 375th Bomber Squadron.
</P>
<P>
   The bomber crash site lay undisturbed for 52 years until two
Chinese farmers hunting for wild herbs found it on Oct. 2, 1996.
The discovery was made public in November 1996 when Chinese
President Jiang Zemin turned over photographs of five dog tags
taken from the aircraft, as well as a videotape of the crash site,
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The United States poured aid and bomber crews into China during
World War II to fight the Japanese, who had invaded much of the
country. About 1,000 U.S. planes went down over China during the
war, and about 100 remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Netherwood's body was returned to his family on Saturday,
arriving at Albany International Airport into the waiting hands of
family members who took the body home to be buried next to his
parents. The New York State Police escorted the body down the
Thruway and the Kingston police picked up the escort at the city
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our family never gave up hope,'' said John Leirey, one of
Netherwood's nephews. ''When they found the plane, they found my
uncle's dog tags which told us that that was his final resting
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Leirey said the dog tags and a ring were returned to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really been a blessing for us,'' Leirey said.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 10, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Ben Grieve hit a grand slam and Barry
Zito won his major league debut, escaping a fifth-inning jam in
impressive fashion, as the Oakland Athletics defeated the Anaheim
Angels 10-3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve's slam was his second of the season and the ninth for the
A's this year, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Zito (1-0) allowed one run on two hits in five innings to join
Mark Mulder as the second A's pitcher to win his major league debut
this season, and the eighth since the A's moved to Oakland in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Zito struck out six, walked six and hit a batter. He walked
Darin Erstad on four pitches to start the game, and gave up an RBI
single to Edgard Clemente in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad singled in the fifth, and Zito walked Adam Kennedy and
Benji Gil to load the bases with no outs. Zito then struck out Mo
Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson in succession to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad recorded his major league-leading 53rd multi-hit game and
continues to remain on pace to set the all-time season mark for
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long drove in three runs for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cooper (4-4) allowed a season-high seven runs and 10 hits
in 3 1-3 innings, his shortest outing of the year. He threw a
complete-game, three-hit shutout against the Athletics in Anaheim
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs doubled home Randy Velarde in the first to give the
A's a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve's grand slam, his 19th home run of the season,
highlighted a six-run burst in the fourth that put Oakland in front
7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez singled to open the inning. After
a sacrifice by Ramon Hernandez, Long singled home both runners.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde singled and Jason Giambi walked ahead of Grieve, who hit
a 1-2 pitch over the left-center field fence to end Cooper's day.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada hit his 18th homer of the year and Long added an RBI
single in the fifth. Chavez, who had three hits, had a sacrifice
fly in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus hit his 29th homer, tying his career high, off T.J.
Mathews in the Angels sixth. Vaughn had an RBI single in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Zito was recalled from Sacramento of the Pacific Coast
League to make the start. RHP Scott Service was outrighted to
Sacramento to make room for Zito. ... The A's hit eight grand slams
in 1932 and 1999. ... Tejada has 52 career homers, which ties him
witch Bert Campaneris for most career homers by an Oakland
shortstop. ... The Angels became the first team in the majors this
season with three players (Glaus, Anderson, Vaughn) with 25 or more
home runs. ... Erstad has 160 hits through 98 games. George Sisler
holds the mark with 257 in 1920. ... The Angels have homered in a
season-high 13 consecutive games.

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Dodgers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Livan Hernandez pitched eight strong innings
in his 100th career start and the San Francisco Giants got home
runs from Rich Aurilia, Bobby Estalella and Armando Rios as they
beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (9-7) retired 13 consecutive batters during one
stretch before giving up a leadoff single in the eighth to Adrian
Beltre and a one-out homer to Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed five hits, struck out six and walked one. The
MVP of the 1997 NLCS and World Series with the Florida Marlins is
9-3 in his last 15 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen worked the ninth for his 22nd save. The Giants won for
the 15th time in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia, Estalella and Rios homered to give San Francisco a 5-0
lead after four innings against rookie Eric Gagne (1-6).
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia hit his 10th homer with two outs in the second. Rios
followed with a double and scored on Estalella's 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Rios connected in the fourth after a two-out walk to Aurilia.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella, who has hit four of his home runs this year in games
Hernandez has pitched, also threw out two potential base stealers.
He nailed Todd Hollandsworth at second base after a second-inning
walk, and later completed a strikeout-double play by getting Shawn
Green at third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Neither Gary Sheffield nor Barry Bonds homered in their
head-to-head duel for the major league lead. Sheffield, whose
fourth-inning bid was caught on the warning track, still leads
Bonds 33-32. Bonds went 0-for-4 and struck out twice. ... J.T.
Snow's next two RBIs will increase his career total to 600. He is
one of only five switch-hitters to drive in 100 runs in a season in
both the NL and AL, along with Ted Simmons, Ken Singleton, Eddie
Murray and Bobby Bonilla. ... Hernandez, who singled in the fifth,
has hit safely in 22 of his last 35 starts and is 25-for-89 during
that span.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lawyers Freed on Bail  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Officials released on bail Saturday two
pro-reform lawyers jailed in connection with a videotape that
alleged links between hard-line politicians and Islamic vigilante
attacks, according to a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Rahami, a university professor and cleric, and Shirin
Ebadi, a pro-democracy and women's rights activist, were arrested
late last month because of allegations against some officials made
in the tape recording.
</P>
<P>
   Ebadi's husband, Javad Tavassolian, told The Associated Press
that the two had been released on $3,300 bail Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said his wife had denied the charges against her, and that
she and Rahami were to appear Sunday at the third hearing of their
closed-door trial. Tavassolian refused to give any other details.
</P>
<P>
   The widely circulated videotape featured Amir Farshad Ebrahimi,
a member of an Islamic vigilante group, who identifies several
senior hard-liners in the government who he claims used his group
to attack reformist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilantes frequently have struck reformist meetings and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ebrahimi, according to the state-run media, has recanted his
confessions, claiming the lawyers pressured him to make the
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Five more people, all believed to be reformists, were arrested
earlier this month on the same allegations. There were no reports
on whether they had been freed.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the videotape comes amid a power struggle
between reformists, led by President Mohammad Khatami, and
hard-liners, who dominate many parts of the government and look for
support to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary has become the hard-liners' most powerful tool. In
the past two months, the judiciary has closed many reformist
newspapers and ordered the detention of several pro-democracy
journalists and activists. Courts have overlooked violence
committed by hard-line vigilantes against reformists.

<HEADLINE> 9 Die in Pakistan Market Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful explosion ripped through a
congested market in southwestern Pakistan late Saturday, killing
nine soldiers and injuring 28 people, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred outside an area where military personnel
congregate in Jinnah market in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan
province. The force of the explosion shattered glass in nearby
buildings and sent residents running for cover.
</P>
<P>
   There were contradictory reports about the type of explosion.
Deputy Commissioner Akhtar Hussain Sayal said the explosion was
caused by a bomb attached to a bicycle, while an official at a
military-run hospital said it was caused by a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Police have sealed off the area. All roads in and out of the
city have been closed, said Sayal.
</P>
<P>
   At the military hospital, a doctor reached by telephone said
that three wards in the hospital were packed with the wounded. He
refused to give his name, but said, ''it is like all hell has
broken loose on us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the civilian hospital in Quetta, Dr. Shamim Gul said only one
of the injured was brought there for treatment. It appeared that
most of the wounded were army personnel, who would be treated at
the military hospital, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasirullah, the lone injured person at the civilian hospital,
said he was sipping tea in a nearby hotel when a mighty explosion
threw him off his chair. The last thing he said he remembered was
something falling on his head.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb, the third in
Quetta on Saturday. The earlier explosions occurred behind separate
police stations and didn't cause any injuries or damage. Police
were investigating all three blasts.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the military, which rules
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the explosion Baluchistan's Inspector General of
Police, Abdul Hai Qadar, was suspended along with two other senior
police officials, said the state-run news agency, The Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The men were suspended ''because of their failure to apprehend
the culprits behind a series of bomb blasts in Quetta,'' said The
APP.
</P>
<P>
   A series of explosions have rocked Quetta in recent months.
Police officials fear they may be retaliatory bombings by
disgruntled tribesmen of the Mari tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The tribesmen have strongly criticized the arrest of one of
their leaders in connection with the slaying of a judge.

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox left-hander Jeff Fassero, cruising along
against the Chicago White Sox, left the game before the seventh
inning Saturday because of a cramp in his left calf.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who held the White Sox scoreless with just two hits
through the first six innings, walked out to take the mound in the
seventh, but manager Jimy Williams, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan and
trainer Jim Rowe quickly went out.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Williams and Kerrigan, Fassero walked off and
was replaced by Rich Garces.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, winless in his last five starts -- 0-2 with a 9.35 ERA --
had failed to make it through five innings in his five prior
starts.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left

<P>
   ''When we came through the toll booths, we were wondering how
many Italians there were in Jersey,'' he said. ''We just found
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Saladino, resplendent in a black pinstripe suit, black shirt,
black tie and shoes, accessorized nicely with a gold chain and
cross and what he claimed was a real Rolex, said he sometimes gets
bit parts in local gangster flicks shot in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But being a Soprano was a dream - like the best cannoli and
pasta e fagioli he ever had, rolled into one. He was only too glad
to offer an impromptu sidewalk audition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in da parts business,'' he said. ''We do da shins, da
knees, and for special holidays, like, uh, Valentine's Day, we send
hearts to people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen year-old John Vasta of Central Valley, N.Y., hoped his
high school acting experience would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to a class; they told me, you know, how to breathe and
stuff,'' he said. 'I played an Italian guy in a play once, or
something. I talk like them, I got a schnoz on me, and I wear
jewelry.'' And he pronounces it with three syllables.
</P>
<P>
   He looked the part: black polyester shirt unbuttoned to just
above the navel, two gold chains, one bearing a cross and the other
spelling out his name in diamonds; two gold bracelets and three
gold rings.
</P>
<P>
   Lora Oliveri of Fort Lee grew up loving Mafia movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figure this is the closest I'll ever get to the mob,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Anzelone of Bayside, N.Y., figured he was a shoo-in
despite his lack of acting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you grow up with these people, it's not acting,'' he
said. ''I'd be playing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So many people showed up that the casting call was shut down
after just 30 minutes. HBO staff members told people in the lines,
which stretched for blocks, to mail their applications. Police had
to call reinforcements from neighboring towns to help disperse the
crowds, and highway entrances to Harrison were closed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Before the event even started, HBO stressed there was no
guarantee that a walk-on in Harrison would be appearing anytime
soon on cable alongside Anthony Soprano and the rest of his crew.
But hey, you never know. Salvatore ''Big Pussy'' Bompensiero got
whacked at the end of last season, so a young wiseguy with the
right juice might move up, make a name for himself, ya know?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more of an open call,'' said HBO publicist Natalie Sarraf
in an interview Thursday. ''They're going to see what happens. It
could be they're looking for new blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants had to be over 16 and bring along a photograph of
themselves. Or as ''Sopranos'' staff put it, ''a head shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, they had to be ''Italian-American looking.''
Roles that might be offered include speaking and non-speaking
parts, Sarraf said.
</P>
<P>
   The show received 18 Emmy nominations on Thursday. In addition
to garnering legions of fans (one Trenton beauty parlor came up
with ''Sopranos''-like nicknames for all its customers), it also
has angered many Italian-Americans. One New Jersey group last month
awarded its producer the ''Pasta-tute'' award for negative media
portrayals of Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alfano of Bloomfield, whose Italian-American One Voice
Committee handed out the award, took special umbrage at the
requirement that applicants be ''Italian-American looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Does that mean that anyone who fits the stereotype of a
buffoon, bum, bigot or bimbo?'' he asked. ''By the way, is it true
that HBO is paying 30 pieces of silver to any Italian-American to
sell out his or her Italian heritage?''
</P>
<P>
   And an Ocean County man named Anthony Soprano asked HBO to kill
the show before it even debuted, anticipating all the agita he'd
get from having a fictional mobster share his moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sopranos'' is Jersey to the bone. It regularly films
scenes here, including shots in Elizabeth, Newark, North Arlington
and Asbury Park. It deals with the exploits of Tony Soprano, an
enterprising mob capo in Essex County, his wife Carmela, and
various junior wiseguys, mooks and mo-mos carrying out the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bompensiero's nickname smacks of authentic Jersey mob. The
name ''Big Pussy'' evokes Anthony ''Little Pussy'' Russo, whom met
with an unfortunate end at Long Branch's Harbor Island Spa in 1979.
He earned his nickname for his fondness for a small pet cat.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's casting call was just the first step; no parts were
expected to be handed out on the spot. Auditions may or may not be
held later for those the producers liked.
</P>
<P>
   You got a problem with that? One woman apparently did. As police
announced that the event was being cut short, she wailed, ''I
missed a freakin' hair appointment for this!''

<HEADLINE> Web site publishes secret CIA briefing papers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A private Web site has published a secret CIA
overview of the U.S. intelligence community prepared for Japanese
intelligence officials who visited the agency's headquarters in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing containing information on the CIA's budgets and
personnel trends was posted by John Young, 64, a New York City
architect whose Web site has displayed government documents on
intelligence and encryption issues since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Young published an unedited version of a secret
history of the 1953 CIA-mastered coup in Iran that was originally
published on The New York Times Web site with portions blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he received the 1998 CIA briefing by e-mail from an
anonymous source in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a standing invitation for anyone who wants to have
something published that governments don't want published,'' Young
said Saturday in an interview, noting that he does not verify the
authenticity of what he publishes. ''We put it up and let people
tell us if it's a spoof or if it's genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow wouldn't comment on the documents, but
an unnamed senior intelligence official quoted in The Washington
Post's Sunday editions said official visitors from the Japanese
agency were authorized to receive the secret briefing at CIA
headquarters in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public disclosure of that information is troubling,'' the
official said. ''In terms of the information (in the briefing), it
is not insignificant. We're always concerned when classified
information is disclosed publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA briefing materials, described as presented by Charles E.
Allen, the assistant director of central intelligence for
collection, say that the number of people working for the National
Foreign Intelligence Program, encompassing all civilian and
military foreign intelligence activity, fell by more than 20
percent - 20,559 employees - between 1991 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's calling card, including his home telephone number, is
part of the materials. Allen could not be reached immediately for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Young has also posted a file obtained from the same source that
shows the names, birth dates and titles of hundreds of employees of
Japan's equivalent of the FBI, the Public Security Investigation
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was contacted Thursday by two FBI agents from the
New York field office who passed along a request from the Japanese
Ministry of Justice that he remove the lists of agents from his
site. Young said he refused the request and was told to expect
direct contact from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   FBI headquarters spokeswoman Julie Miller said she wasn't
familiar with Young or his Web site. James Margolin, FBI spokesman
for the New York office, was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Shinjo, head of the General Affairs Department of Japan's
Public Security Investigation Agency, was quoted by the Post as
saying the Japanese government believes the source of the materials
is an agency employee who resigned under pressure in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cubans To Protest US Trade Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba will begin national celebrations to mark the
start of the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power 41 years
ago with a large demonstration in Havana to protest the U.S. trade
embargo, an official newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party daily Granma said that participants will
march down the Malecon coastal highway on Wednesday morning to the
U.S. Interests Section to ''express to the world their profound and
indignant rejection against the monstrous genocidal policy applied
against our people.''
</P>
<P>
   It called the embargo, imposed shortly after Castro's rise to
power, ''the most prolonged blockade that has existed in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will show the world that the Cuban people, far from tiring,
will increase their struggle in the coming months and years to end
the grotesque imperialist aggressions!'' Granma said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes amid growing moves in the U.S. Congress
to ease the trade sanctions, as well as travel restrictions on
Americans, which were imposed 38 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 301-116 Thursday to stop enforcing provisions
that ban U.S. food exports and limit sales of American medicine to
Cuba and four other nations -- Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill the same day to permit food and medical
sales to the five countries. The Senate measure also prevents a
president from blocking such shipments without congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have not commented on the latest votes, saying
they need more time to study the moves before making a public
statement. But in the past they have insisted upon a complete
lifting of all economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wednesday march, separate national celebrations will
be held in two other cities, one in the central provincial capital
of Santa Clara on July 29 and the other in the western provincial
capital of Pinar del Rio on Aug. 5, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, just one city is chosen as the site for the
celebration, which almost always includes a speech by Castro that
is considered one of his most important of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The yearly ceremony commemorates the disastrous July 26, 1953,
attack by Castro and his comrades on the Moncada army barracks in
the eastern city of Santiago. The attack launched the revolution
against the dictatorship of then-President Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attackers were all either killed or jailed, the
movement later regained strength and triumphed on New Year's Day
1959 after Batista fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   This year's celebration comes a month after a major victory for
the Cuban government -- the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
the island.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's administration converted the fight for Elian's return
from the United States into a national campaign, with marches,
rallies, television programs and other events held almost daily to
demand the boy's return.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys, Boulder Cops To Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- John and Patsy Ramsey have agreed on a
date next month to meet with Boulder police about the 1996 slaying
of their daughter JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would reveal the date. Boulder Police Chief Mark
Beckner would say only that the meeting will be after Aug. 18
because of scheduling conflicts with his officers.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Wood, the Ramseys' Atlanta attorney, said the meeting will
occur before the end of August, ''but I will not disclose specific
days because I don't want to see my office turned into a campground
for the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple were to meet with police this weekend in Atlanta,
where the Ramseys now live, but had to reschedule because of
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would be the first between the Ramseys and police
since June 1998. Earlier meeting proposals fell through because of
differing conditions from each side.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old JonBenet was found dead in the family's Boulder
home Dec. 26, 1996. No one has been arrested, but Boulder police
have said the Ramseys remain under suspicion. The Ramseys have
denied any involvement.

<HEADLINE> King Plays On Despite Strained Back  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- Betsy King walked up the 18th fairway in
tears, the pain in her back almost too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time I got to the third tee, I could barely swing,''
King said. ''I didn't make one shot out there without pain.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 44, a two-time U.S. Women's Open winner and honorary Merit
Club member, began the day in good shape, tied with Karrie Webb at
3 under and just one stroke behind leader Meg Mallon. But as she
teed off on the second hole, she felt something pop.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious even before she called for an LPGA Tour trainer
on the third hole that she was in pain. She kneaded her lower back
to try and loosen up the muscle, and tried to stretch it out as she
stood over her ball.
</P>
<P>
   But when she went to put her tee into the ground on the fourth
hole, she couldn't even bend over and had to crouch down.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was any other tournament or if I was in another
position, I don't know if I would have continued,'' said King, who
was diagnosed later with a strained back.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief conversation with U.S. Golf Association officials,
she was allowed to get treatment between the fifth and six holes. A
trainer massaged her back, applied some therapeutic balm and gave
her some Advil.
</P>
<P>
   The pain wouldn't go away, though, and it affected her game.
Starting with the fifth hole, she had six straight bogeys. She
finally made par on the par-3 No. 11, then followed it with another
two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   She finished with a 10-over 82, dropping her 14 strokes back and
out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked up the 18th fairway, King fought back tears.
Mallon, her playing partner, patted her on the back and gave her a
hug.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sick for Betsy,'' Mallon said. ''It was one of the
bravest rounds I've ever seen anybody play. ... She said it felt
like it was a knife coming through her back every time she swung. I
felt terrible for her.''
</P>
<P>
   King went for more treatment after her round and hopes to play
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NO CONSOLATION PRIZE: Forget that Laura Davies is among the
statistical leaders in the U.S. Women's Open. It's the leaderboard
that counts.
</P>
<P>
   Davies ranks second in greens in regulation, making 80 percent
of them. She's tied for fourth in fairways hit at 81 percent. But
she's seven shots back from Karrie Webb at even-par 216.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I could be seven, eight or nine under the way I
played,'' said Davies, who shot a 72 Saturday. ''I'm not there and
(Webb) is, so she must be playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to play better yourself,'' Davies added. ''You can't
expect Karrie to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE SHORTCUT: Meg Mallon ran into a few potholes on her
detour.
</P>
<P>
   With the wind blowing and the pin on the par-4 14th on the back,
left side, Mallon again took her shortcut through the 13th fairway
Saturday. But her tee shot landed too far left, putting her behind
the big oak tree on the alleyway to the green.
</P>
<P>
   She chipped onto the green, landing about 25 feet past the pin,
and then two-putted for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the smartest play for me, the way the wind was blowing
and where the pin was,'' Mallon said. ''The only thing was, I just
hit it a little too far left. So I had to hit one shorter club, but
I had plenty to get it over the tree and make it over the green. I
don't think I got a very good break by the way it bounced.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   EAGLE EYE: Sophie Gustafson was the only player with an eagle
Saturday. The Swede eagled the par-5 18th hole.

<HEADLINE> Janikowski Arrives at Raiders Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- Kicker Sebastian Janikowski was unwilling to
talk about his brushes with the law or the terms of his
multimillion dollar contract Saturday as the Oakland Raiders opened
training camp with their first-round draft pick in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Janikowski signed a five-year contract worth $6.05
million, including a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, and was on the field for
the team's first practice later in the morning. He made five of
seven attempts, although his first try caromed off the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State star was subdued as he spoke after practice,
and wouldn't discuss his recent arrest in Florida for possession of
the so-called ''date-rape'' drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to talk about that,'' Janikowski said. ''People
make mistakes off the field. I will try to do better. I know there
will be pressure on me, but I like being under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski's contract also includes a clause that will force him
to pay back about $25,000 for every game he misses due to
suspension. The clause was added because of the kicker's run-ins
with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski is free on bond and awaiting arraignment in
Tallahassee on charges of possession of the drug GHB. Until the
arraignment, he is allowed to travel out of state for work.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the issue is that Janikowski is a citizen of Poland,
and could face deportation if he has further scrapes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Janikowski was acquitted of trying to bribe a
Florida police officer.
</P>
<P>
   His contract also includes a clause that guarantees his salary
for three seasons if he scores 114 or more points this season and
stays out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty good deal,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.
''It's between my agent and my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bryant, a second-year defensive end for the Raiders, who
also came out of Florida State, said he's been talking to
Janikowski regularly since he was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a young guy who just got caught up with the wrong crowd
by going back there (to Florida after the June minicamp),'' Bryant
said. ''He has to leave this behind him and grow up and realize
this is his job now. He can't risk throwing it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders coach Jon Gruden reiterated the Raiders will stand
behind Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident the young man will learn from this and that
everything will be resolved. ... I'd like to let him move on,''
Gruden said.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski made 66 of 83 field goals in three years at Florida
State and became the third-leading scorer in Seminoles history.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders could use him. They finished last in the AFC in
field-goal percentage last season. Janikowski was the first kicker
selected in the first round since 1979.

<HEADLINE> Murphy Shoots 65 To Share Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Bob Murphy matched the course record with
a 7-under-par 65 on Saturday for a share of the second-round lead
in the Senior PGA Tour's Instinet Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had an 11-under 133 on the TPC at Jasna Polana to match
Gil Morgan and defending champion Tom Jenkins. Morgan shot a 66,
and Jenkins had a 68.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy bogeyed the first hole to drop to 3 under but, starting
at No. 4, birdied eight of the next 11 to reach 11 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm putting as well as I can remember, as well as I ever have
in my career,'' said Murphy, seeking his first victory since 1997.
''I started horribly today but kept telling myself 'You're doing
too many things right to get off track.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who set the course record Friday, entered the round
with a two-stroke lead at 7 under, but lost his advantage by
bogeying No. 16. It was just his second bogey of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied three of the first four holes on a slightly breezy
day, and had nine straight pars before making a birdie on No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I might pull a Tiger on them for a minute,'' said
Jenkins, referring to Tiger Woods' dominating performances. ''I
birdied 1, 2 and 4, and felt very comfortable. Midway through the
round, the putter kind of cooled off, I missed some makable putts
and kind of lost track, but then got back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who entered the day in a three-way tie for second at 4
under, had seven birdies and just one bogey. He lost his chance for
the lead when he missed a 10-foot eagle putt on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had four eagle putts, which doesn't happen very often, and I
didn't make any of them,'' Morgan said. ''But all in all, I'm in
pretty decent shape. I'll just try to go out Sunday and hit it
close to the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dent, who won the Super Seniors Competition by three strokes
over Jim Albus, was tied for fourth with Jerry McGee at 8 under.
Dent had a 68, and McGee shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer, playing in his 1,000th official PGA Tour-PGA
Seniors Tour event, shot a 76 for a 3-over 147 total.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving birdie putts inches short on No. 6 and 7, Palmer
triple-bogeyed the par-3 8th and bogeyed the par-4 9th for a
front-nine 42. He rallied for a 34 on the back nine, marking the
second straight day the 70-year-old Palmer shot 2 under on the
final nine.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lendzion recorded the fourth hole-in-one in tournament
history when he used an 8-iron on the 152-yard, par-3 2nd.
Lendzion, 1 under after shooting a 74, also had a hole-in-one in
the Bruno's Memorial Classic on April 30.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Tour Copter Crashes, 7 Die  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- Rescue crews began the grim and dangerous
task Saturday of retrieving the bodies of seven people killed when
a tour helicopter crashed on a steep mountain hillside.
</P>
<P>
   A ten-man crew was set to rappel down from the helicopter to a
ridge and then set new lines to rappel to the site at the
2,700-foot level.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no place a helicopter can land, so the men are
rappelling down,'' said Lt. John Morioka, a spokesman for the Maui
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The crash Friday of the Blue Hawaiian Helicopters twin-engine
AS355 occurred in a remote area of Iao Valley on Maui. Photos of
the scene show the tail section intact but the rest of the
helicopter disintegrated into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site has a deep slope of about 30 degrees, and is a
wet and slick area, making it difficult for crews to gain access.
Among the recovery team are a master rappeller and crews who take
part in eradicating marijuana from remote areas.

<P>
   Identities of the victims won't be released until the bodies are
positively identified by the Maui County medical examiner's office,
Morioka said. Families of six of the victims, said to be tourists,
have been notified and some are already on the island, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sword, a Maui psychologist handling disaster stress
control for the families of victims, told local media the
passengers included two teen-age girls from Texas and a father and
his three children.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery operation likely will extend to Sunday. ''It's
going to take a while because of the terrain,'' Morioka said.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board is
on Maui to look into the crash, which occurred during a 35-minute
sightseeing tour of the West Maui mountains. The investigator,
George Petterson, said he expects to issue a preliminary report in
about five days.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was a Vietnam veteran with more than 11,000 hours of
flight time and had been with the company more than a year, said
Patti Chevalier, co-owner of the company with her husband, Dave, a
former Vietnam scout pilot.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first accident involving a Blue Hawaiian tour
helicopter since the company began operations in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hawaii's third notable aircraft crash in 11 months. On
Sept. 25, a tour plane crashed on the slopes of Mauna Loa on the
Big Island, killing all 10 people on board. On May 10, a private
jet slammed into a hillside while approaching an airport on
Molokai, killing all six people on board.

Danforth Emerges in Bush Veepstakes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush said he would decide on a running mate by
tomorrow, as former Missouri Sen. John Danforth emerged today as another
potential candidate. Bush must decide between former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, described as the leading candidate, and a secret list of other potential
running mates. Danforth, his wife Sally, and Cheney -- who also heads Bush's
search team -- met secretly with Bush in a Chicago hotel suite Tuesday. He is
said to be under consideration, though two highly placed Republican officials
said yesterday that Cheney was the leading candidate.

Kenya Suffers Massive Power Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Power went off across Kenya on Saturday and the nation
of 29 million people will be largely without electricity for the next two days
because of technical problems, the electric company said. Electricity went off
about 6:30 p.m. throughout the capital, Nairobi, and in most other parts of the
country. In a statement on national radio, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company
said a ''major fault'' had occurred in transmission of power from neighboring
Uganda. It said the problem would take two days to fix.

Clinton Denounces GOP Tax Breaks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton contended today that tax cuts sought by
the Republican-led Congress over the past two years are so enormous they would
''completely erase'' the projected budget surplus and disproportionately benefit
the wealthy. In the GOP's response, Sen. Rod Grams laid out a case for Clinton
to reconsider his threat to veto recent bills intended to ease the income tax
marriage penalty and repeal inheritance taxes. Clinton cited a White House
analysis released today that estimates the 10-year cost of major tax cuts passed
or moving in the Republican-led Congress at $712 billion.

Fla. Murder Suspect Holds Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A man suspected of killing a store clerk was holding up
to six people hostage in a house Saturday, including two juveniles, authorities
said. The suspect, Jamie Petron, reportedly shot the homeowner's son, who was
released around 2:30 p.m. and taken to a hospital with injuries that weren't
believed to be life-threatening. Petron, 41, fled to the house after ramming a
deputy sheriff's vehicle and shooting the deputy in the leg, authorities said.
Orange County Sheriff's Department SWAT officials surrounded the house where
Petron fled.

Mideast Peace Talks in Low Gear
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Middle East summit is in low gear in deference to
the Jewish Sabbath, but negotiations are going on, quietly and informally, as
Israeli and Palestinian leaders await President Clinton's return. Traditional
Jews devote Saturday to prayer and rest; secular Israelis normally do neither.
But it could be politically unwise for an Israeli official to conduct normal
business on that day. Clinton, attending an economic summit in Japan, trimmed
his schedule so he could return to the Camp David talks by Sunday evening.

18 in N.C. Accused of Hezbollah Aid

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Federal authorities arrested 18 suspects in raids of
houses and businesses, saying at least some of them were members of a
cigarette-smuggling ring that was raising money for the Islamic militant group
Hezbollah. Seventeen of the suspects were arrested in and around Charlotte, and
one person was nabbed in Michigan. All were indicted on federal charges
including immigration violations, weapons offenses, money laundering and
cigarette trafficking, U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway said.

Massachusetts colleagues say they have found a 17th moon orbiting Jupiter. If
confirmed, the 3-mile-diameter moon would be the smallest known satellite of a
major planet and the first Jovian moon discovered in 21 years. ''When you
realize that you were the first person to lay eyes on something that had not
been seen before, that's kind of a good feeling,'' University of Arizona

Athletics Crush Angels 10-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Ben Grieve hit a grand slam and Barry Zito won his
major league debut, escaping a fifth-inning jam in impressive fashion, as the
Oakland Athletics defeated the Anaheim Angels 10-3 today. Grieve's slam was his
second of the season and the ninth for the A's this year, a franchise record.
Zito (1-0) allowed one run on two hits in five innings.

<HEADLINE> Former Bears Player Wins Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) -- Merril Hoge's attorney said a Lake County
jury's $1.55 million award to the former Chicago Bears fullback
sends a message to NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   Hoge contends he was cleared to play by the team doctor too soon
after suffering a concussion, forcing his retirement from the NFL
in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''The importance is that the jury rejected the idea of the way
that football players and other athletes are treated for
concussions,'' Hoge attorney Robert Fogel said of Friday's verdict.
''They sent a message to coaches at all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoge, now 35 and an ESPN commentator living in Pittsburgh,
contended that former team doctor John Munsell returned him to play
too soon, risking re-injury, and had not warned him of the dangers
of continuing concussions. He said he still suffers from headaches
and sensitivity to light.
</P>
<P>
   The civil jury awarded Hoge $1,450,000 for economic losses and
$100,000 for pain and suffering, but nothing for permanent
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Munsell's attorney, William Rogers, said the award will be
appealed. He said Hoge has already received $1 million from a
personal injury insurance policy, $250,000 from a Workmen's
Compensation claim against the Bears and additional money from an
NFL injury settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hoge suffered 12 concussions over 19 years of football in school
and the NFL. He played seven seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers
and one with the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is successful with ESPN and he is living with his
disabilities,'' Fogel said.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 13, Rangers 5  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Joe Oliver hit a grand slam shortly after
Seattle's first rain delay in 31 seasons as the Mariners beat the
Texas Rangers 13-5 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The game was halted for 54 minutes after the third inning when a
rainstorm drenched fans at Safeco Field and the $517.6 million
stadium's retractable roof would not shut because of a computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   When the roof finally began closing about 20 minutes later, the
fans gave it an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The last rain delay in Seattle was Sept. 12, 1969, when the
Pilots played the California Angels at Sicks Stadium. The Mariners
played 22&AMP;frac12; seasons in the Kingdome, which never had a rain delay
but had an earthquake-suspended game May 2, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After play resumed in the fourth with the score tied at 2,
Oliver doubled with two out, Mark McLemore doubled him in and Stan
Javier homered.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the the fifth, Mike Cameron singled, John Mabry
was hit by a pitch and David Bell was walked to load the bases for
Seattle. Oliver hit his fifth career grand slam, connecting off
Ryan Glynn (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   John Halama (9-5) pitched five innings as Seattle beat the
Rangers for the fourth time in a row, during which the Mariners
have outscored them 42-15. Halama gave up three runs on six hits
and no walks.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez, given Friday night off, hit his 27th homer in
the Texas first.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Edgar Martinez had his 24th homer in the third. He
drove in three runs and leads the majors with 93 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners moved from the Kingdome into Safeco Field on
July 15, 1999. ... Seattle is a season-high 18 games over .500. ...
Rangers LF Rusty Greer, in an 0-for-14 slump, was given the day off
by manager Johnny Oates. ... All-Star SS Alex Rodriguez took
batting practice and worked on his lateral movement before the
game. The Seattle star is on the DL with a sprained right knee. The
Mariners said Saturday they expect him to be activated Monday or
Tuesday. ... Rafael Palmeiro became the 70th major league player to
reach 1,300 RBIs with a sacrifice fly in the Texas first. ...
Rangers RF Scarborough Green drew an appreciative ovation when he
made a diving catch of a line drive by McLemore with Texas behind
11-5 in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Said To Be Bush's VP Pick  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. John Danforth resurfaced Saturday
night as a Republican vice presidential candidate, joining former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on George W. Bush's short list.
Cheney is the leading candidate, a highly placed Republican
official said as the Texas governor neared his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, his wife Sally, and Cheney -- who also heads Bush's
search team -- met secretly with Bush for a get-to-know-you session
in a Chicago hotel suite Tuesday, setting aside his oft-stated
opposition to serving as vice president. Republican officials had
assumed Danforth's reluctance disqualified him from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will make his decision this weekend and announce it
this week, well in advance of the July 31 opening of the Republican
convention in Philadelphia. Highly placed Republican officials said
Saturday that Bush had not made a final decision, although he
appeared to be leaning toward Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cheney and Danforth would give the ticket stature and the
Washington experience that Bush lacks. Solid conservatives, either
candidate would help Bush shore up his base. Danforth has the
advantage of living in a key battleground state, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Those mentioned as possible candidates include Govs. Frank
Keating of Oklahoma, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of
New York; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; and Sens. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska and Bill Frist and Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's name surfaced as Arizona Sen. John McCain's chances
appeared to fade. Two Republican sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the House Republicans who wrote the Bush campaign
to urge McCain's nomination had been told in advance that it was
too late for such an effort. The word was relayed from Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for McCain and Bush had long since suspected the Arizona
senator had little chance of getting the job, though McCain told a
mutual friend last week that he would be willing to serve.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth meeting, first reported by ABC News, was notable
because Bush is known to have had few such sessions with
candidates. Danforth's wife has expressed reservations about the
job, leading the former lawmaker to say in the past that he didn't
want to be vice president. Party officials say Mrs. Danforth is now
more open to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Chicago meeting began, Cheney left the room to
allow Bush to meet alone with the Danforths. Bush was said to be
impressed with the couple, though he has not known them long.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many candidates Bush was considering,
though one official familiar with Bush's thinking said it appeared
that the Texan had more than two options remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, who retired from the Senate in 1995 after nine
years in office, was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno in
September to oversee investigation of the federal government's
actions during the siege on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,
Texas, in 1993. He issued a report Friday that cleared Reno and all
government agents of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Danforth was the chief advocate of Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings. After
leaving the Senate, he returned home to practice law in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a former state auditor and attorney general, is a
graduate of Princeton University and Yale's law and divinity
schools. An heir to the Ralston-Purina fortune, he is an ordained
Episcopal priest.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former Wyoming lawmaker and White House chief of
staff, emerged as the leading candidate Friday after changing his
registration from Texas to Wyoming to avoid a Constitutional hurdle
if Bush were to pick him.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's emergence quieted speculation that McCain wanted a spot
on the ticket. The timing left Republicans wondering whether Bush
was using Cheney to divert attention from his vanquished rival.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has a history of heart trouble, and as a former member of
President Bush's Cabinet, might undermine the younger Bush's
efforts to stand apart from his father and be viewed as a
fresh-faced Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that Cheney is in play this late in the process shows
that Bush is looking for somebody with national stature,'' said
Republican consultant Scott Reed. ''The question he is wrestling
with is: 'Do I go national, or do I look for a regional or state
candidate?'''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 12, Yankees 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even a new look and the last-place Tampa Bay
Devil Rays couldn't help David Cone get his first win in nearly
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Cone lost his career-high seventh straight decision despite
making his strongest start in a month, allowing a home run to Greg
Vaughn as Tampa Bay snapped a four-game skid with a 12-4 win over
the New York Yankees on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, known for his imaginative pitches, arm angles and windups,
tried yet another new approach: the modified El Duque. Cone wore
his socks high and used a high leg kick similar to Orlando
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   While the results were better, it wasn't good enough to stop the
longest dry spell of his career. Cone (1-9) is winless in 13 starts
since April 28, and the Yankees have lost the last 11 times he has
started, a team record.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander allowed three runs and six hits in six innings,
the fewest runs he's allowed since giving up one June 16 to
Chicago. He fell to 3-14 with a 5.81 ERA in 31 starts since
pitching a perfect game against Montreal last July 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen collapsed after Cone left, allowing nine
runs with help from shoddy fielding, costing Cone a chance at a
no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Rupe (2-4), who entered the game with a 9.39 ERA, shut down
the Yankees after they scored 11 runs in the series opener. He
allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings in his first career
appearance against the World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his first four decisions this year, Rupe has beaten
pennant winners Atlanta and New York in his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored 10 runs and batted .203 during their
four-game skid. When Cone struck out the first two batters he
faced, it looked like he might have found an opponent he could
beat.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn then drove a 3-1 pitch to left-center for his 16th homer.
Jose Canseco drew a leadoff walk in the second and scored on Miguel
Cairo's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied it on an RBI single by Chris Turner in the
second and a solo homer by Chuck Knoblauch in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Cone retired 12 of 13 hitters before Fred McGriff singled with
two outs in the sixth and stole his first base since April 18,
1999. After a walk to Canseco, McGriff scored on a single by Steve
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-run single in the seventh by Russ Johnson made it
5-2, the Yankees drew within one on RBI singles by Derek Jeter and
Paul O'Neill. Mark Guthrie struck out Bernie Williams with two
runners on to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams argued with home plate umpire Terry Craft that the foul
tip hit the dirt and Guthrie jawed at Williams as he walked off.
Williams started after the left-hander before Craft and first-base
coach Lee Mazzilli pulled him back.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays iced it with seven in the eighth, highlighted by
a rare three-run single by McGriff. With a full count and two outs,
McGriff grounded a single to center. When Williams was slow getting
the ball back into the infield, Johnson scored from first ahead of
Knoblauch's relay.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Devil Rays lost 17 of their first 18 meetings with the
Yankees, but are 7-7 since. ... Knoblauch, who hasn't made an error
since June 28, nearly threw a ball away in the fourth. His lob to
first pulled Tino Martinez off the bag, but Martinez scrambled to
touch first before Cox. ... Cairo went 3-for-4 with two RBIs for
his first multihit game since June 9. ... The Yankees have homered
in nine straight games, tying a season high.

degree in education and government and a law degree, all from
Harvard. Deputy assistant to President Nixon for consumer affairs.
Member of the Federal Trade Commission. Married to Bob Dole, former

   First-term senator from Tennessee. Heart and lung transplant
surgeon who saved the life of a tourist who had a heart attack in a
hallway near Frist's Senate office. Graduate of Princeton
University and Harvard Medical School. Only senator who is a
medical doctor. Father, also a doctor, started one of the nation's

of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, who died last week and
whom Frist called his mentor. Republican point man in Senate on
health issues. Opposes abortion rights and the proposed patients'
bill of rights; supports partial privatization of Social Security.
A dark horse who could help Bush carry the home state of Democrat
rival Al Gore.
Chuck Hagel, 53:
</P>
<P>
   First-term senator from Nebraska. Vietnam veteran, wounded twice
and awarded two Purple Hearts. Newcomer to the national political
stage. During the Republican primaries, served as campaign
co-chairman of Arizona Sen. John McCain's bid for the nomination.
Quickly came out for Bush when McCain dropped out in March. Son of
a lumber worker. Made a fortune as an investment banker, primarily
in the cellular telephone industry. A conservative, who believes
abortions should be allowed only in cases where the mother's life
is at risk. Serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<P>
   Chairman of the House Budget Committee. Member of Congress for
18 years. Ran last year for the 2000 presidential nomination, but
his campaign never took off. Dropped out and quickly endorsed Bush.

allies fretted his candidacy was slipping away even before Cheney
emerged as a serious prospect.
John McCain, 64:
</P>
<P>
   Third-term senator from Arizona. Bush's toughest rival in GOP
presidential primaries. Son, grandson of Naval admirals, McCain
spent 5&AMP;frac12; years in a Vietnamese prison camp after being shot down as
a Navy pilot. In Senate and as a presidential candidate, focused on
changing the campaign-finance system. Support of campaign-finance
change has made him unpopular with some Republican leaders, as has
his sometimes quick temper and sharp tongue. Since quitting the
race, has started his own political action committee, Straight Talk
America, to continue his fight for reform. Also has campaigned for
GOP congressional candidates across the country since. In May,
McCain formally endorsed Bush. A prime-time speaker at the party's
convention. Has hinted that he would vice presidential nomination.
Bush aides would be shocked if he offered it, although operatives
in both parties say his cross-party appeal would make for a
formidable ticket.

supports abortion rights. Unlike Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
Pataki has had good relations with church hierarchy in his state
despite his stance on abortion. Considered a moderate conservative,
has a strong environmental record. Proven fund-raiser, spent more
than $20 million on his 1998 re-election race and about $14.5
million beating Cuomo. Has been criticized for New York's debt,
which has grown during his tenure. Would help Bush with moderates,
particularly in the Northeast, but conservatives would have a
problem with his position on abortion.
Tom Ridge, 54:
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania governor, former six-term congressman. Vietnam
veteran, winner of a Bronze Star for valor. One of George W. Bush's
strongest supporters during the campaign. A Catholic, supports
abortion rights, has feuded with state's Catholic hierarchy over
his abortion position. As governor, has expedited Pennsylvania's
capital punishment mechanism enough to trigger three executions
since he took office. Push for school vouchers defeated by
lawmakers. In Congress, represented district with a strong
Democratic presence. Veered from party line on abortion, certain
defense issues. Voted to provide abortion services to military
personnel and dependents overseas and to allow federal funding of
abortion in cases of rape or incest. Opposed barring the District
of Columbia from using government money to pay for abortions. Would
be a risky but bold choice who could help Bush court moderates and
nail down Pennsylvania, a key state.
Fred Thompson, 57:

<P>
   Second-term senator from Tennessee. Formerly a character actor
in the movies, has appeared in films including ''In The Line of
Fire'' with Clint Eastwood and ''Days of Thunder'' with Tom Cruise.

<HEADLINE> British Tabloid Names Pedophiles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP ) -- A British tabloid on Sunday began publishing the
photos and identifications of thousands of people it says are child
sex offenders, and announced a Web site that can be used to
determine if a pedophile lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly News of the World published 49 photos on a single
page and carried identifying details and locations -- if available --
but not addresses. But it did not say where it acquired either the
information or the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid dedicated its campaign against pedophiles to
8-year-old Sarah Payne, who disappeared July 1 in West Sussex,
southern England, and whose naked body was found two weeks later in
a field 15 miles from where she had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also includes the names and photos and features a
map of England on which readers can click on their region to see a
list of people the newspaper says are pedophiles living there.
</P>
<P>
   The News of the World said there were 110,000 proven pedophiles
in the United Kingdom and that it would not stop its campaign until
they had all been named.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the move was aimed at alerting and warning
the public about those named and was ''absolutely not a charter for
vigilantes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chief executive of the children's charity Childline said
the newspaper's actions held risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is concerning when laws and provisions put in place to deal
with this situation are by-passed or risk people taking the law
into their own hands,'' said Valerie Howarth. ''You risk innocent
members of the public being wrongly identified and targeted, and
you risk driving pedophiles to move from place to place, possibly
becoming more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper denied that its action would encourage vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, the newspaper said, ''We do NOT want any
vigilante action or violence against these people. Knowledge is the
only weapon the community needs. We do NOT want our readers to take
any action. We do NOT want them to break the law.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, White Sox 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Jeff Fassero pitched his best game in over two
months and Scott Hatteberg hit a three-run homer as the Boston Red
Sox beat the Chicago White Sox 8-6 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was just the second in eight games and 13th in 43 for
the White Sox, who started the day with an 11 1/2 game lead over
Cleveland in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary went 3-for-4 and drove in a run for Boston, which
has won seven of 10 games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra was 2-for-4 with an RBI, raising his major
league-leading average to .395.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (7-3), winless in his previous five starts (0-2 with a
9.35 ERA), kept the highest-scoring team in the majors off the
board with only two hits in six scoreless innings. Fassero, who
walked one and struck out five, left with a cramp in his left calf
before the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored three runs off reliever Rich Garces in the
seventh. Derek Lowe, who pitched the final two innings, ran into
trouble in the ninth, giving up three runs on RBI doubles by
Herbert Perry and Ray Durham, and Brook Fordyce's run-scoring
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago starter Jon Garland, at 20 the youngest player in the
majors, was making his third career start. He coasted through the
first three innings before the Red Sox scored three runs in both
the fourth and fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Garland (1-2) allowed six runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in
4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston moved ahead 3-0 in the fourth when Hatteberg homered into
the Red Sox bullpen after O'Leary singled and Jason Varitek walked.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Jose Offerman tripled leading off and scored on
Carl Everett's sacrifice fly. O'Leary added an RBI single, and
Garciaparra scored on the hit when center fielder Jeff Abbott threw
the ball into the White Sox's dugout for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee had a two-run double and Abbott an RBI single,
cutting it to 6-3 in the seventh. Garciaparra's RBI double and
Varitek's run-scoring grounder made it 8-3 in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled the White Sox's bid for their best start in
club history, which they matched with Friday's 8-5 win in the
series opener. Chicago's 1917 team started 61-35 before losing its
97th game.
</P>
<P>
   Boston right fielder Darren Lewis helped Fassero with a pair of
nice sliding catches. The first came off Lee's line drive, ending
the second, and the other was on Perry's liner for the final out in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was Fassero's second-best start. His best was seven
innings of four-hit shutout ball on May 19 against Detroit. ...
Durham was back in the starting lineup hitting leadoff and playing
2B, after having Friday night off. ... Boston 2B Jeff Frye, who
left the first game of Thursday's doubleheader in Baltimore with
back spasms, worked out during batting practice, but did not play.
... Red Sox 1B-DH Mike Stanley, on the DL with a strained right
shoulder, was eligible to come off Tuesday, but remains inactive.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse police say artist's mural carries gang label  </HEADLINE>
By Luis Perez
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The first police officer who pulled up to
the Sunshine Market wanted to know what Oliver Fox was doing.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old artist explained that the store manager had
hired him to spray paint a mural on his building after seeing his
work for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Then a state police cruiser stopped at the market at Delaware
and Grace streets in Syracuse. The trooper went through the same
routine.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes later, four police cars stopped, including Sgt.
Dave Pauldine, who represents the Syracuse Police Department on the
Syracuse &AMP; Onondaga County Graffiti Busters Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's offense: His tag - ESAN - the stylized graffiti signature
he likes to use, is gang related, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was not only forced to paint over his tag, but he lost his
most lucrative client, Coca-Cola, after city officials complained
about his work. Coca-Cola sponsors a nationwide ''Art in Harmony''
program that pays artists to paint promotional murals for Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Brockman, Coca-Cola's Art of Harmony coordinator, said she
received a phone call from Mayor Roy Bernardi's office this week
about Fox. The phone call was enough for her not to work with him
again and the first criticism she's heard of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Fox found out Friday that Coca-Cola wouldn't work with him
again. ''I'm upset,'' he said. ''I don't think City Hall has any
right to do that. I think this is harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who plans to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan,
caused a stir last year when the Graffiti Busters Coalition
targeted some of his work. Even though local business owners paid
Fox to spray paint elaborate murals, some think his work is a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Horace Jones Jr., who owns Markee Cuts, was forced
to defend one of Fox's mural on the side of his business. In the
end, officials let the mural of Chuckie, a horror movie character,
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola commissioned Fox to paint murals on two Sunshine
Market walls, paying him $1,400 for the job. One mural, in shades
of blue, purple and red, is of Eskimos holding Coca-Cola bottles
under a star-filled night with a half moon. The other is a night
scene of a lighthouse with a red beam of light flashing over the
water. The Coke logo appears at the center of the beam.
</P>
<P>
   Store manager Ray Aziz liked the job and asked Fox to do the
whole wall to help clean up the neighborhood. Fox chose to spray
paint scenes from Aesop's Fables combined with a fantasy theme. The
characters Fox painted include a giant monkey dressed in a king's
robe; an owl, glasses perched low on its nose as it watches a mouse
gnawing at its tree; and a fairy playing the flute.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the offending tag of ''ESAN.'' Police say the
tag, chosen because Fox likes the way the letters go together,
represent a street gang in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. David Sackett, a Syracuse police spokesman, had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 3, Brewers 2, 13 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit an RBI single with one out in the
13th inning Saturday to lift the Chicago Cubs to a 3-2 win over the
Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez drew a one-out walk against Steve Woodard (1-7)
in the 13th and took second on a single by Mark Grace. Sosa hit a
3-2 pitch to left field for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Heredia (5-2) pitched two hitless innings for the victory.
The Cubs won for the ninth time in their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee starter Jason Bere retired 14 consecutive batters
before Damon Buford hit his 14th home run with two outs in the
seventh to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young led off the Cubs first by reaching on an error by
right fielder Jeromy Burnitz, who dropped a fly ball. Gutierrez
walked and one out later, Sosa was intentionally walked to load the
bases for Henry Rodriguez, who singled home Young.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz tied the game with his 20th home run leading off the
fourth against Scott Downs.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Geoff Jenkins was hit by a pitch, Henry Blanco
walked and Bere singled to load the bases. Ron Belliard hit a
sacrifice fly to put the Brewers ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Downs gave up two runs on eight hits and three walks over 5 1-3
innings, striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Bere gave up two runs -- one earned -- on three hits and two walks
over seven innings, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bere has a 2.43 ERA at Wrigley Field, giving up nine runs
in 33 1-3 innings. ... Sosa singled in the 11th, extending his
hitting streak to 15 games. ... The four Racing Sausages, who have
performed exclusively at County Stadium, made their first road trip
and raced after the fifth inning at Wrigley Field. The Italian
Sausage and the Bratwurst finished in a tie.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Two Holdouts  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Stephen Davis didn't get his long-term
contract, so he's waiting on Lloyd's of London. LaVar Arrington
didn't quite match Courtney Brown's deal and doesn't consider
himself a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Amid such complex behind-the-scenes dealings, the Washington
Redskins signed their last two holdouts Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Davis agreed to a one-year, $3.532 million contract, a letdown
considering he felt he had earned a big, multiyear deal. No. 2
overall draft pick Arrington accepted what is essentially a
six-year deal with a base salary between $35 million and $36
million, according to one of his agents, Kevin Poston.
</P>
<P>
   That is just short of the six-year, $36 million base No. 1
overall pick Brown got from the Cleveland Browns. Arrington also
received a $10.75 million signing bonus, while Brown received a $10
million signing bonus and $849,000 reporting bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to put up or shut up,'' Arrington said. ''I don't
feel like I held out. It's a process a lot of guys go through. A
lot of guys are out a lot longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington's contract also includes a voidable seventh year. If
he meets all of his incentives, he could earn more than $50 million
over six years, which means the ''overall package is more than
Courtney's,'' according to Poston.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Redskins, if they had the No. 1 pick, they would have
taken LaVar Arrington,'' said Poston, explaining the rationale for
paying the No. 2 pick more than the No. 1. ''So we just had to make
sure it was a fair market deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a patient backup for three years, wanted a multiyear
contract as a reward for setting a franchise rushing record with an
NFC-high 1,405 yards last year. But the negotiations turned sour,
so Davis called agent Steve Weinberg and told him to work out a
one-year contract so he could get to camp, which began Thursday for
the full roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting at home one day and talking to my wife,'' Davis
said. ''And I did something, and she said, 'You're getting on my
nerves, you need to go to work.' She's pregnant right now, so
anything I do right now will put her over the edge. ... I know a
lot of people were worried, as I was, about getting this thing
done. Hopefully we can get a long-term deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg clarified director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato's
statement Friday regarding a key provision of the contract: Under
the deal, the Redskins will be able to name Davis as their
franchise player again next year -- but only if he fails to meet
nine easy-to-achieve incentives.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis meets any of those benchmarks -- and if a multiyear deal
isn't reached -- he could be named a transition player, which would
give him much more negotiating power. The Redskins could demand two
first-round draft picks for a franchise player, while they would
only have the right to match an offer given a transition player.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if Davis achieves any number of incentives -- such as
getting one touchdown reception -- he would earn a bonus that would
put the contract's value over $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because Davis didn't get a long-term deal, his agents aren't
letting him practice in full pads until they beef up Davis'
insurance policy to $10 million in case he gets injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on when Lloyd's of London offices are open,''
said David Canter, Weinberg's partner.
</P>
<P>
   Because the players are off Monday, Davis won't don his pads
until Tuesday. Davis only took part in no-contact, low-intensity
drills Saturday while the rest of the team was in full pads.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said his ankle, which was severely sprained late last
season, was ''doing great.'' The ankle had been cited as the reason
Davis did not take part in spring minicamp drills, but coach Norv
Turner said Saturday that Davis was healthy enough to play in June
and that the uncertain contract status kept him off the field.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis will immediately reassume his starting position,
Arrington will be placed among the backups when he begins practice
Sunday. Camp for the rookies began Monday, so he's missed six days
of practice -- in addition to a week of spring minicamp he skipped
after the birth of his first child.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. John Danforth resurfaced tonight as a
Republican vice presidential candidate, joining former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney on George W. Bush's short list. Cheney is the leading candidate, a highly

Danforth, his wife Sally, and Cheney -- who also heads Bush's search team -- met
secretly with Bush in a Chicago hotel suite Tuesday, setting aside his
oft-stated opposition to serving as vice president. Bush said he will make his
decision this weekend and announce it this week.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba will begin national celebrations to mark the start of the
revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power 41 years ago with a large
demonstration in Havana to protest the U.S. trade embargo, an official newspaper
said today. The Communist Party daily Granma said that participants will march
down the Malecon coastal highway on Wednesday morning to the U.S. Interests
Section to ''express to the world their profound and indignant rejection against
the monstrous genocidal policy applied against our people.'' It called the
embargo, imposed shortly after Castro's rise to power, ''the most prolonged

Clinton Denounces GOP Tax Breaks

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton contended today that tax cuts sought by

the wealthy. In the GOP's response, Sen. Rod Grams laid out a case for Clinton
to reconsider his threat to veto recent bills intended to ease the income tax
marriage penalty and repeal inheritance taxes. Clinton cited a White House
analysis released today that estimates the 10-year cost of major tax cuts passed

   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Tiger Woods proved he was human Saturday,
making his first bogey in 64 holes of major championship golf, but still managed
to double his lead at the British Open. Woods shot a 67 in the third round to
open up a six-stroke lead over David Duval and Thomas Bjorn. Unless the
24-year-old Woods suffers the greatest collapse in the history of golf's oldest
championship, he will become the youngest player to win the Grand Slam.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone lost his career-high seventh straight decision
despite making his strongest start in a month, allowing a home run to Greg
Vaughn as Tampa Bay snapped a four-game skid with a 12-4 win over the New York
Yankees today. The right-hander (1-9) allowed three runs and six hits in six
innings.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nursing Homes Need Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Many nursing homes are so understaffed they may
be endangering the welfare of their patients, according to a new
report by federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which will be presented to Congress later this
month, recommends stricter guidelines that would require thousands
of nursing homes to hire more nurses and nurses' aides, The New
York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of research, health officials concluded that
understaffing has contributed to increased incidences of severe
bedsores, malnutrition, and abnormal weight loss among nursing home
patients.
</P>
<P>
   A high number of those patients end up developing
life-threatening infections, dehydration and other problems that
could have been prevented had the homes been staffed adequately,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends new
federal standards to guarantee that patients receive a minimum of
two hours of care each day from nurses aides, among other things.
The study says that 54 percent of nursing homes currently fall
below the proposed minimum standard.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends that patients receive at least 12
minutes a day of care from registered nurses. Currently, 31 percent
of nursing homes do not meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes said it was impossible for the government to
propose minimum staffing guidelines when it was providing
inadequate subsidies under Medicare and Medicaid, the Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Many nursing home officials said it was also difficult to
attract and retain good workers due to the boom-time economy of
recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mery Andrade scored 13 points and three other
Cleveland players scored in double figures Saturday night in the
Rockers' easy 76-47 victory over the Miami Sol.
</P>
<P>
   Rushia Brown and Suzie McConnell Serio each scored 11 points and
Merlakia Jones added 10 for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers (13-9) maintained a lead of more than 20 points for
the entire second half and won for the fifth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers moved within one game of the first-place Orlando
Miracle in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-15) had a two-game winning streak stopped. The Sol were
led by Katrina Colleton, who scored a team-high of just eight
points. Colleton shot only 3-for-12 as Miami made only 30 percent
of its shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol fell two games behind Detroit in the race for the fourth
and final playoff berth in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland broke away from a 7-7 tie with a 16-0 run over a 5:25
span.
</P>
<P>
   Brown began the flurry with two driving layups. Jones scored the
final five points of the run on two more layups and a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers shot 60 percent from the field in the first half and
held a 41-20 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Sol won the first two meetings, both at home.
</P>
<P>
   With reserves playing during most of the second half, all 12
players on both teams scored.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Makes Debut as Pacers Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Isiah Thomas coached his first game at any level
Saturday, directing a team of Indiana rookies and free agents in a
75-74 loss to San Antonio in the Shaw's Pro Am Summer League.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fun,'' said Thomas, hired Thursday to replace Larry
Bird as coach of the Pacers. ''The biggest thing that I have to do
is teach these guys to trust each other, share the ball and screen
for each other. I enjoyed myself. I had fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got here yesterday but I didn't know the personnel. So I was
ending up putting guys in and telling them you've got two minutes
to show me what you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take him long to figure things out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you figure out the player's abilities, then I could
manage the game and get guys into positions where they could make a
contribution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas reportedly signed a four-year, $20 million contract, but
terms of the deal have not been released.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Could Lose Billions in Revenue  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq stands to lose more than $1.5 billion
in oil revenues this year as Saudi Arabia raises production to try
to bring down world fuel prices, Iraq's oil minister said in
remarks published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi decision to pump more oil has ''caused huge financial
losses for the Iraqi people, which may exceed $1.5 billion this
year,'' Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid was quoted as saying in
the government newspaper al-Jumhouriya.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, announced
earlier this month that it will try to drive down prices by as much
as $5 per barrel from then-current levels of $30 per barrel by
adding 500,000 barrels a day to its output.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's announcement drew harsh criticism from Iraq,
which accuses the Saudis of neglecting the interests of their own
people and of other partners in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting countries to appease Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other OPEC members also criticized the unilateral decision,
saying it was made under pressure from the United States, which is
seeking relief for consumers as gas prices surge above $2 per
gallon in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait that led to the Gulf War, is allowed unlimited oil sales
under a United Nations-approved program. Proceeds, however, go to a
U.N. fund to be used only to buy food, medicine and other essential
goods. Some of the revenues may also go to modernize Iraq's oil
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid said Iraq intended to export more than 400 million
barrels during the current six-month phase of the U.N. program. He
said Iraqi exports should average 2.5 million barrels a day. If
prices hold, Iraq should earn up to $18 billion this year.

<HEADLINE> 2 Cubans With Sports Team Defect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Two Cubans visiting Costa Rica for a
sports competition have defected and plan to seek political asylum
to stay in this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
   Alieth Garcia, a player on Cuba's futsal -- or indoor soccer --
team, and the team's doctor, Gustavo Gonzalez, defected Friday.
Both said they want to live in Costa Rica. The two emphasized that
they do not plan to try to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have not provided any comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban team was in Costa Rica to compete ahead of the futsal
World Cup to be held Nov. 18-Dec. 3, 2000 in Guatemala City. The
draw is scheduled for August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Futsal, or five-a-side soccer, was born on the beaches of Brazil
in the 1920s and has slowly spread around the world. It is now
played indoors on an international level. Though still not an
Olympic sport, futsal has had three World Cups, in 1989, 1992 and
1996, all won by Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 2, Phillies 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bronson Arroyo held Philadelphia to two
singles in seven shutout innings for his first major league win as
the Pittsburgh Pirates edged the Phillies 2-1 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo (1-3) walked three and struck out three in his sixth
major league start. The right-hander is up from the minors and in
the rotation because Francisco Cordova is on the disabled list with
elbow tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benjamin, who had three RBIs in Friday's 9-2 win, had a
run-scoring triple in the seventh off Robert Person (5-3).
</P>
<P>
   Emil Brown drew a one-out walk and stole second. Benjamin lined
a ball past shortstop Desi Relaford to score Brown, and was able to
reach third when the ball got under left fielder Ron Gant's glove
and rolled to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Ed Vosberg loaded the bases in the ninth on
Warren Morris' single and two walks. Chris Brock relieved and
walked Brown to force in a run and make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Christiansen pitched a perfect eighth and Mike Williams
got three outs for his 14th save in 16 chances, despite allowing
Bobby Abreu's leadoff homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Person came off the disabled list after missing 15 days with a
shoulder strain. He allowed four hits in seven innings with two
walks and four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have won four of five since ending a season-worst
six-game losing streak. The Phillies have lost four of five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Phillies end their longest road trip of the season
Sunday. They've played 11 games in four cities since the All-Star
break ended. ... Curt Schilling, Sunday's starter, has a 9-4 record
against Pittsburgh, including a win on July 2. He is 4-1 in nine
games at Three Rivers Stadium. ... Pirates first baseman Kevin
Young remains at home in Arizona because of a family medical
emergency. He is not expected back until Tuesday. ... Benjamin is
filling at shortstop for Pat Meares, who missed his second
consecutive game. Meares is in Kansas, awaiting the birth of his
second child.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Wanted Since '91 Caught  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A man who had been a fugitive since he was charged
with killing his estranged wife in New York in 1991 was caught in
Central America and brought back to the United States on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Grullon was captured Friday evening in Panama by U.S. and
Panamanian authorities and was brought to Miami, said Deputy U.S.
Marshal John D. Amat.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon was turned over to the Miami-Dade Police Department,
which did not immediately return a phone call left Saturday.
Grullon was flown to Miami because there was not a direct flight to
New York, Amat said.
</P>
<P>
   Amat said Grullon's first court appearance would likely be in
Miami, possibly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's here now, he's on our soil,'' said Detective Sgt. Gene
Buonanno of the Tarrytown, N.Y., Police Department. ''Now he's
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Grullon was indicted by a grand jury in Westchester County in
December 1991 on charges he killed his estranged wife, Yolina
Camacho.
</P>
<P>
   He fled to the Dominican Republic. He was arrested and spent
several months in jail there before being released on bail and
disappearing, authorities said.

<P>
	   GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) - The former record-keeper at the Orange
County Jail, who disappeared the day he was indicted, has admitted
stealing more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   William Stenson, 57, a former lieutenant with the Orange County
Sheriff's Department, pleaded guilty Friday to second-degree grand
larceny. He faces up to 12 years in state prison when he is
sentenced Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Stenson was indicted on Feb. 25, 1998 on charges that he
pocketed more than $50,000 in bail and checks from prisoners'
accounts between Jan. 1, 1996 and Feb. 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the indictment, he took off, disappearing for nearly
two years. In February of this year, he crossed the Mexican border
and surrendered to the FBI in Laredo, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Leaf: No Shoulder Pain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ryan Leaf reported no discomfort in his
surgically repaired right shoulder Saturday, one day after his most
extensive workout in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything feels great,'' the quarterback said. ''There was no
swelling or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers hope Leaf, who missed the 1999 season, can rebound
and challenge Jim Harbaugh for the top spot. Leaf, selected second
overall in the 1998 draft, began his rookie season as the starter,
before being benched after throwing two touchdown passes and 15
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's development wasn't the lone bright spot at the team's
second day of practices at UC San Diego. Tests showed fullback Fred
McCrary has a strained patella tendon in his left knee, and nothing
more serious, after getting hurt on the opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said please Lord, don't let it be the ACL,'' said McCrary,
the team's top special teams player last year. ''It was a loud pop
and it started burning. I was worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback DeRon Jenkins, a free-agent pickup from Baltimore,
didn't work after hurting a muscle in his foot. Jenkins, like wide
receiver Curtis Conway (hamstring) could return to practice on
Monday, according to coach Mike Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Eric Hill was absent after suffering a pinched
nerve on Friday. For Hill, a 12-year pro, it is a recurring injury,
and one that has Riley concerned.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Omar Vizquel misplayed a routine ground ball
in the fifth inning of Cleveland's game with the Minnesota Twins,
snapping his 95-game errorless streak.
</P>
<P>
   The error, his first since Sept. 25, 1999, occurred when he
couldn't handle a short-hop on a grounder by Matt Lawton and led to
two unearned runs for the Twins.

<P>
   Vizquel's streak was the second-longest in major league history
behind New York Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez's 101-game string set
from June 14, 1999-March 29, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, a seven-time Gold Glove winner, had been tied with Cal
Ripken for the longest streak in the American League at 95 games.
He handled 428 chances without a miscue during his streak.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Off-Duty Cop Killed  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A small-town police officer, despondent over
the suicide of his girlfriend, apparently caused his own death
Saturday when police officers shot him after he aimed a pistol at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Pittsboro reserve Officer Darian Gipson, 28,
may have wanted the officers to shoot him -- a situation known as
police-assisted suicide, or ''suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't leave a note or anything like that,'' Indianapolis
police Sgt. Paul Ciesielski said. ''But all indications would lead
us to believe that yes, this was a suicide by cop.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had every opportunity to put the weapon down.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis police pleaded with Gipson to drop his weapon,
after he held it to his head several times and fired several shots
into the air outside a nightclub on the city's west side about
12:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did at one point threaten the officers, saying he was going
to take them with him,'' Ciesielski said.
</P>
<P>
   Ciesielski said officers fired five shots, but it was unclear
how many had struck Gipson. Autopsy results were pending Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson had been a reserve officer in Pittsboro, a small town
about 20 miles west of Indianapolis, since November 1997, said his
chief, Christi Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   He become depressed and was put on leave after he discovered his
live-in girlfriend had used his gun to kill herself in the couple's
apartment on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a small town, so as a reserve officer, he didn't see
much,'' Patterson said. ''For him to walk in there and find her,
was probably the worst thing he's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities took Gipson's gun after that incident, but it was
returned to him Thursday, said Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gipson had been counseled by clergymen and doctors and
was taking an anti-depressant, and seemed to be feeling better
until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he told a lot of us what we wanted to hear -- that he
was fine, when in actuality he wasn't,'' Patterson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Where are the Brits at the British
Open? Everywhere but on the leaderboard, except for Darren Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood and Nick Faldo all slid meekly
out of contention at the Tiger Woods-dominated championship at the
Old Course on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Paul Lawrie of Scotland didn't even make the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, of Northern Ireland, shot a 68 to go 9 under and trail
Woods by seven strokes going into the final round Sunday. David
Toms and Loren Roberts also were 9 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you count this as being in contention?'' Clarke said after
a six-birdie, two-bogey round.
</P>
<P>
   ''The golf course can throw up some surprises so you never know
what's going to happen,'' he said. ''It depends how he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like the wind to blow a little bit more. I enjoy the
challenge when the wind is blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sunny, near windless conditions at St. Andrews,
Montgomerie, Westwood and Faldo failed to match the consistency of
Woods and the other leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, who had his best two-round start to an Open, failed
to improve on his 3 under and shot an even-par 72 for a total of
213 -- 13 off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what it is,'' he said. ''I just have to work it
out because it's not good enough, I'm afraid. If you don't see a
way out you'd give it up, but I am not giving this game up.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood (76) and Faldo (75) ended up at par, 16 behind Woods,
who looks set to break Faldo's 1990 Open record of 18 under in
relation to par. That, too, was at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on pin positions but he is going to cruise past
my 18 under sometime tomorrow afternoon,'' Faldo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to keep that. I managed to get a new record with the
most rounds under par, and with Jack Nicklaus retiring I've a good
chance of some more,'' the three-time Open and three-time Masters
champion said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to keep some of those records but they aren't going
to last long with Tiger. He's just going to go and blitz them
all.''
</P>

   GOSSETT TURNS PRO: David Gossett, the U.S. Amateur champion
who missed the cut at the British Open, has decided to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make his debut at the Qwest International in Castle Rock,
Colo., on Aug. 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old University of Texas star, who had the lowest
amateur score in the Masters in April, made his announcement after
missing the Open cut by five strokes with rounds of 71 and 78

   HOT STUFF: The players expecting cold wind and rain off the
North Sea didn't need all those sweaters and waterproofs, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, sunny St. Andrews has caught everyone by surprise and
helped keep scores low at the British Open. The dry weather and
light breezes have reminded players of California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing like last year at dark, windy Carnoustie, where the
Open finished in steady rain and not a single player under par.
</P>
<P>
   Any player who shot over an even-par 144 at St. Andrews missed
the cut Friday. The cut at Carnoustie was 12 over.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HART PULLS OUT: Dudley Hart, one of 28 Americans among the 74
players who made the cut, pulled out of the British Open on
Saturday because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hart went into the third round at 1 under but made a bogey 5 at
the first hole. After pars on Nos. 2 and 3 he withdrew because of
the pain. It was not immediately clear how he hurt himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Alexandre of France declined the use of a marker to act
as a playing partner and continued alone.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Weightlifting Spots Taken  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWEGO, La. (AP) -- The two biggest weightlifters provided the
two biggest moments in the U.S. Olympic trials Saturday. The
biggest surprise, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Haworth, the 300-pound queen of American barbells at age
17, had to do little more than show up to gain a chance to become
the first American in 40 years to win an Olympic weightlifting gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't predicted was 357-pound Shane Hamman, with virtually
no international experience, would overtake veterans Tom Gough and
Wes Barnett to join 20-year-old Oscar Chaplin III on the men's
team.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman, the last lifter of the day, broke American records in
the clean and jerk (507 pounds) and total lift (920&AMP;frac14; pounds) to
move from fourth to second past Gough and Barnett, both of whom
missed all three attempts in the snatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman gave himself a chance by lifting 413&AMP;frac14; pounds in the
snatch, in which the barbell is lifted over the head in a single
motion. He then broke his own record in the clean and jerk, in
which the barbell is raised to the chest and then overhead, by 16&AMP;frac12;
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking the record, he dropped to his knees and seemed to
kiss the mat. He also waved to the small crowd of less than 1,000
that gave him, by far, the loudest ovation of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman, 28, a former power lifter, had never lifted more than
501&AMP;frac12; pounds in practice before breaking the clean and jerk record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to take advantage of my one moment,'' Hamman said.
''This is the greatest thing that's happened to me in my life. It
was my one chance to go to the Olympics, and I wasn't going to let
it slip by.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew going up to the bar I was going to make it. I was going
to get it no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Haworth, who hoists the equivalent weight of a F-15 fighter
plane during daily 2&AMP;frac12;-hour workouts, took such a big lead into the
trials that she qualified for the first Olympic women's
weightlifting competition merely by signing her name.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting a combined weight of 572 pounds as effortlessly as she
would an iced tea at her Savannah, Ga., home, she did far more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite failing to win a gold medal at the junior world
championships earlier this month, Haworth is a threat to win the
230 pounds plus (75 kilograms plus) weight class in Sydney on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I'm going to go home and lift my booty off,'' Haworth
said. ''I feel pretty confident. A medal is definitely not out of
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not won an Olympic weightlifting medal
since 1984 or a gold medal since Charles Vinci in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth, a high school honors student who passed up an early
entry to college to try for Sydney, world champion Agat Wrobel of
Poland, Haworth and Meiyan Ding of China are considered the best
heavyweight lifters.
</P>
<P>
   While Haworth competes in weightlifting's biggest class -- she is
5-foot-8 and weighs 300 pounds -- 105-pound lightweight Tara Nott of
Stilwell, Kansas, secured her spot by impressively hitting all six
lifts.
</P>
<P>
   The top four women lifters going the finals all qualified:
Haworth, Nott, Robin Goad of Savannah and Cara Heads-Lane of Costa
Mesa, Calif. Heads-Lane missed all three attempts in the clean and
jerk but held onto the fourth spot.
</P>
<P>
   Goad, a 1994 world champion, hit only two of her six lifts and
finished a combined 22 pounds behind Nott, but held onto the third
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Goad began lifting in 1982 at age 12, a year
before Haworth was born. She is married to fellow lifter Dean Goad,
who did not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just feels right,'' said Goad, who named her daughter
Sydney in honor of the 2000 Games. ''I was bad today, but I had a
good day before when I needed to have a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   The trials in suburban New Orleans were the conclusion to 1&AMP;frac12;
years of qualifying. Before 1984, trials were the sole criteria.
But when 1984 Olympic medal favorite Curt White had a poor trials
and didn't make the team, the qualifying procedure was altered to
include the combined results of multiple world-class competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Nott set American records at 106 pounds (48kg) by lifting 181&AMP;frac12;
pounds (82.5 kilograms) in the snatch and a combined weight of 407
pounds (185kg) in the snatch and clean and jerk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those days where everything goes right,'' said
the 28-year-old Nott, an age-group star in gymnastics and soccer
before switching to weightlifting in 1995. ''This is what you train
for. I've always been a competitive person, and I've never been one
to be pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they compete at the same weight, either Nott or Goad may
move up to 117 pounds (53 kg)at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin, also of Savannah, set a U.S. record of 346&AMP;frac12; pounds
(157.5 kg) in the snatch, but missed twice at 412&AMP;frac12; pounds (187.5
kg) in the clean and jerk. He hit that weight earlier this month in
Prague while overshadowing Haworth to become the first American
gold medalist in the junior world championships. Haworth won two
silver medals and a bronze in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Gough and Barnett still could reach Sydney if the United States
is awarded two more spots before the Games begin. Barnett has
nearly lost the sight in one eye since developing cancer in 1998,
yet has continued to lift.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Okinawa Marine Base  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP FOSTER, Okinawa (AP) -- President Clinton told U.S. troops
Saturday that they ''need to be good neighbors'' to the people of
Okinawa, weary with the massive American military presence on this
slender island and angry about instances of unruly conduct and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of us has a personal obligation to do everything that we
can to strengthen our friendship and to do nothing to harm it,''
Clinton instructed thousands of Marines, soldiers, sailors and
airmen who waited past 11 p.m. to see the president speak at a
grassy field alongside a row of barracks.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the base with his daughter, Chelsea, after a banquet
at the summit of industrialized powers.
</P>
<P>
   The president combined his gently worded admonishment with a
heavy dose of praise for the military's sacrifices and community
service. His message was well received.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was real uplifting,'' said Marine Lance Cpl. Mike Farrow,
18, of Orlando, Fla. ''We haven't had much to smile about around
here lately. But now there are smiles on a lot of people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Cpl. Ramiro Barrera, 22, from Brownsville, Texas, said,
''A lot of people will take notice about being good neighbors
because this is the commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been scheduled to address the troops Sunday just
before leaving Okinawa but he moved up his appearance so he could
depart a little earlier to rejoin the Mideast peace talks at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   His visit came amid new tensions over a 19-year-old Marine who
was arrested early this month for allegedly entering a private
home, crawling into a 14-year-old girl's bed and fondling her in
her sleep. Tens of thousands of Japanese demonstrators formed a
human chain around Kadena Air Force Base on Thursday, the eve of
Clinton's arrival, to demand a reduction of bases and U.S.
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa, the 90-mile long island synonymous with the last major
land battle of World War II, is home for 26,000 of the 47,000 U.S.
forces stationed throughout Japan. The United States established
its presence here after the war, using Okinawa's bases as firewall
against trouble in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. forces help keep the peace, the misbehavior of some
troops has spawned waves of anti-American resentment. Five years
ago, tens of thousands of Okinawans marched in outrage over the
rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen. As a result,
the United States pledged to reduce its footprint on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori,
expressed regret about misconduct by U.S. forces, a U.S. official
said. A Japanese official construed Clinton's remarks as an apology
for the incident early this month. The Japanese spokesman quoted
Clinton as telling Mori, ''Most of the troops have been good
neighbors, but the incident hurt me in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later during a joint appearance with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Clinton said the United States will not
withdraw its forces, ''because we still have security needs here.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address to troops, Clinton said, ''We know our hosts in
Okinawa have borne a heavy burden, hosting half our forces in Japan
on less than on percent of its land. They, too, have paid a price
to preserve the peace and that is why we need to be good neighbors
to them in addition to being good allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing his remarks, Clinton told the troops that ''you should
be very, very proud'' of their service.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will never know how many wars you have deterred, how many
deaths you have prevented,'' the president said. ''But you know the
numbers of wars that have been fought in these waters since the
United States' forces have been stationed here. That number is
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the military units, name by name, to commend them for
volunteer activities, teaching English to children, replacing a
footpath bridge, preparing for the summit and other similar
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''These acts of kindness give a whole new meaning to the old
words, 'Send in the Marines,''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with Mori, the president and prime minister
agreed that Japan would slightly reduce the $5 billion Tokyo pays
for U.S. bases on Okinawa, U.S. and Japanese officials said. The
reduction would be about $30 million. They also agreed to extend
for a fourth year trade talks on a broad range of business sectors,
from telecommunications to financial services and pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Murder Suspect Holds Hostages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- An armed man who allegedly killed a store
clerk was holding five people hostage in a home Saturday in a
standoff with sheriff's deputies, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Dean Petron, 41, shot a Broward County sheriff's deputy in
the leg in a grocery store parking lot before fleeing to the nearby
home, authorities said. He apparently did not know the occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages being held were a woman in her 40s, a 16-year-old
girl, an 11-month-old boy and a girl either 9 or 10 months old,
said Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons.
</P>
<P>
   He said Petron had made demands for food and ''other things,''
but did not release further details.
</P>
<P>
   Petron shot a 28-year-old man in the home, authorities said. The
bullet grazed his head and he escaped around 2:30 p.m. He was
listed in good condition at a hospital Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Another adult escaped uninjured from the home immediately after
Petron entered, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Sheriff's Department SWAT officials were
surrounding the home, located in the middle-class Meadow Woods
subdivision south of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's office was receiving assistance from Petron's son,
a Broward County Sheriff's employee, who traveled to Orlando in an
attempt to convince his father to end the hostage situation, which
began shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
   Petron is a suspect in the Friday slaying of Jorge Trillos, 22,
during a convenience store robbery in Pompano Beach. Trillos' boss,
Samir Hantash, 48, was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies located Petron at 12:15 p.m. at a grocery store. As
Petron left the parking lot, he rammed a sheriff's vehicle and shot
26-year-old Deputy Scott Winters in the leg, authorities said.
Winters was in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Petron was sentenced to 20 years in prison in
1986 for attempted first-degree murder, forgery and battery on a
law enforcement officer. He was released from prison on Dec. 10,
1995.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 2, Galaxy 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Trittschuh and Mamadou Diallo scored
late goals as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the undermanned Los Angeles
Galaxy 2-0 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Valderrama set an MLS record with his 20th assist on
Diallo's league-leading 18th goal in the 87th minute. Trittschuh
opened the scoring in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles (10-7-7) played without six starters because of
national team commitments. The absent players included Cobi Jones,
Luis Hernandez, Greg Vanney and Mauricio Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   Starting goalkeeper Kevin Hartman also missed the contest after
spraining his left knee in practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy lost two more starters during the game. Zak Ibsen
(pulled hamstring) and Simon Elliott (flu) both departed before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Mutiny (12-9-2) took over sole possession
of first place in the Central Division. Tampa Bay has a three-point
advantage over the Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny continued a season long trend of misfiring on penalty
kicks when Steve Ralston was stopped by goalkeeper Matt Reis in the
74th minute. Tampa Bay has converted just two of seven attempts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo picked up a yellow card in the first half and will serve
a mandatory one-game suspension for exceeding yellow card point
limits when the Mutiny face Chicago on Aug. 2.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Indians 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ron Coomer had four hits and David Ortiz
added three, giving him 13 hits in 17 at-bats, as the Minnesota
Twins beat Cleveland 10-6 Saturday night, the Indians' fourth
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is hitting .765 in the last four games and has reached
base safely in 14 of 18 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had an RBI single in a four-run first inning, another
single in the second and a double in the fourth. He also scored
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer had two doubles, two singles and drove in two runs for
the Twins, who collected a season-high 18 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson's grand slam off Twins starter Mike Lincoln in the
fourth inning erased a 5-2 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Minnesota scored three runs in the bottom of the
fourth, then added two unearned runs in the fifth, thanks to a rare
error by shortstop Omar Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel failed to handle a short hop on a routine grounder by
Matt Lawton, snapping a 95-game errorless streak, second longest in
major league history. Vizquel's last error came on Sept. 25, 1999,
at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez of the New York Mets owns the major league record at
101 games (June 14, 1999-March 29, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, a seven-time Gold Glove winner, was tied with Cal
Ripken (1990) for the longest streak in American League history.
Vizquel's streak covered 428 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez hit a two-run homer in the first inning, his 20th
of the year and second in two nights. Ramirez has seven homers and
15 RBIs in nine games since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   His homer gave the Indians a 2-0 lead, but Minnesota sent 10 men
to the plate in the bottom of the first to score four runs against
starter Tim Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer, Ortiz and Jacque Jones all had run-scoring hits and Chad
Allen added a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota made it 5-2 in the third on back-to-back singles by
Allen and Jones, and Cristian Guzman's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie and Allen had run-scoring singles in the fourth,
and another scored on a balk by reliever Kane Davis (0-3) as the
Twins went back on top 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel's error in the fifth allowed Jones to score from third
with two outs, and Coomer followed with his second double of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Johan Santana (2-2) picked up the victory with 2 1-3
innings of one-hit relief. Bob Wells pitched 1 1-3 hitless innings
for his seventh save in 11 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Sexson was in a 14-for-70 (.200) slump prior to his 16th
homer. ... Drew lasted just three innings, giving up 10 hits and
five runs. ... Coomer's four-hit game was the sixth of his career.
... Jones had three singles as Guzman was the only starter to go
hitless. ... Manager Tom Kelly was back in the Metrodome, but not
on the bench for the second straight game. After missing nine games
due to his father's heart surgery in Florida, Kelly decided to take
another day off. ... Interim manager Ron Gardenhire is 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Expos 17, Marlins 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Andy Tracy hit a grand slam and drove in seven runs
and the Montreal Expos benefitted from a franchise-high three balks
by Florida pitchers to beat the Marlins 17-7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, who entered with a .164 batting average and six RBIs for
the season, finished 3-for-4 with a walk and was hit by a pitch.
Since taking over the first base and cleanup jobs Friday night,
Tracy is 5-for-9.
</P>
<P>
   His seven RBIs tied Rondell White for the most by an Expos
rookie. White drove in seven runs against the Dodgers on July 24,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Florida starter Reid Cornelius was charged with two balks in the
second inning, his first since 1995 with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager John Boles was ejected for the first time this
season in the third inning after arguing a balk call against
reliever Ricky Bones by first base umpire Bill Welke with Montreal
ahead 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius (3-4) lasted only 2 1-3 innings, his shortest outing
in 11 starts this year. He gave up six runs on four hits and four
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's first career grand slam snapped a 1-1 tie in the third
inning and helped the Expos to their third straight win.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins have lost six of eight games to drop below .500
(48-49) for the first time since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell and Alex Gonzalez each hit solo homers in the sixth
for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Johnson (5-4) allowed four runs and six hits in six innings
for his third win in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 1-1 in the third, the Expos loaded the bases
on singles by Milton Bradley and Peter Bergeron and a walk to
Fernando Seguignol.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's blast to right was the first grand slam this season by
Montreal, and the sixth allowed by Florida, making it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Blum's single chased Cornelius, but Bones ran into
immediate trouble, issuing a balk while facing Chris Widger.
</P>
<P>
   Widger singled and Blum scored the fifth run of the inning on
Tomas De La Rosa's double.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored six more in the fifth against Bones to break
the game open. Tracy and Johnson each had two-run singles as
Montreal collected six hits and sent 10 batters to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins led 1-0 in the first on Preston Wilson's ground-rule
double.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos tied the game in the second as Cornelius issued a pair
of balks and walks.
</P>
<P>
   Blum added a three-run homer off Armando Almanza in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos finished with a season-high 19 hits and the 17 runs
tied a season high.
</P>
<P>
Notes: There were two great catches in the first inning, one by a
fan in right field. The fan reached over the fence, giving Wilson
his ground-rule double. Not to be outdone, Montreal center fielder
Bradley denied Derrek Lee of extra bases, leaping high for a catch
in front of the scoreboard with two men aboard. ... Vladimir
Guerrero didn't start for the third straight game because of a
strained right hip flexor. The All-Star right fielder started 120
straight games before being scratched Thursday. ... The Expos have
14 players (10 pitchers) on the disabled list following Friday's
sidelining of RHP Yovanny Lara (triceps strain). ... The Marlins
added another stolen base, increasing their major league-leading
total to 108. ... Florida 2B Luis Castillo extended his hitting
streak to 14 games. ... Half of Lee's 20 home runs came after the
sixth inning.

<HEADLINE> Royals, Tigers Split Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Jose Macias hit a grand slam for his first homer
of the season and the Detroit Tigers rallied past the Kansas City
Royals 10-6 Saturday for a split of their day-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Gregg Zaun drove in three runs as the Royals won
8-5 for their fifth straight victory
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers trailed twice in the nightcap, including 6-5 after
Johnny Damon hit a sacrifice fly in the top of the seventh. But
Detroit scored five times with two outs in the home half.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Becker hit a tying, pinch-hit single off Doug Bochtler
(0-2), then pinch-hitter Brad Ausmus drew a walk off Tim Byrdak
that loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Macias, 2-for-4 with five RBIs, sent a drive into the left-field
seats for the Tigers' second grand slam of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Cruz (3-1) worked three innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz drove in two runs with three hits as the Tigers won
for only the second time in their last six games. It was their
first win in five tries against the Royals at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Backup catcher Hector Ortiz, called up Thursday when Jorge
Fabregas went on the disabled list, scored after each of his first
three major league hits for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals blew a 5-1 lead that started with three unearned runs
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz singled for his first major league hit and Jeff Reboulet
walked before Tigers starter Steve Sparks threw away Damon's bunt.
Ortiz and Reboulet scored and Damon took third before he came home
on a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's RBI double got one back for the Tigers in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz led off the fifth with a double and scored on Reboulet's
single, and Damon's RBI single put Kansas City up 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit tied it with a four-run fifth that knocked out Royals
starter Chad Durbin and featured Bobby Higginson's two-run single
and RBI hits from Cruz and Juan Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, the Royals trailed 3-2 when Joe Randa led off
the sixth with a single, Mark Quinn singled and Todd Dunwoody
walked to load the bases. That finished Tigers starter Dave Mlicki
(4-10).
</P>
<P>
   Zaun greeted Danny Patterson with a double that just eluded
Higginson in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ordaz drove in two more when he singled through a drawn-in
infield to give the Royals a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Witasick (3-8) got through seven innings, giving up six hits
and a season-high six walks. But he allowed only three runs to win
for the first time since June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer hit an RBI single in the ninth. Ricky Bottalico
relieved for the last two outs and got his seventh save in 13
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion was 3-for-4 and scored twice. Rookie Eric Munson,
making his first career start, had his first RBI with a run-scoring
groundout in the fourth.
Notes: The Tigers had planned to send Munson back to the minors
after the opener to make room for Sparks, who was recalled from
Triple-A Toledo. Instead, Patterson was placed on the 15-day
disabled list with a sore right elbow and Munson stayed. ... The
first game included the Tigers' annual Negro Leagues salute. The
Tigers wore replica uniforms of the Detroit Stars and the Royals
dressed as the Kansas City Monarchs. ... An emergency alarm briefly
interrupted the first game in the bottom of the ninth. A Tigers
official said it was a false alarm and play resumed after about two
minutes. It was the second time this season that the alarm has
stopped play at Comerica Park. It also happened May 14 against the
New York Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Sea lampreys make unwelcome return to Lake Champlain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - The end of a successful program to rid
Lake Champlain of parasitic sea lampreys means anglers are once
again hauling out fish that show obvious signs of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Vermont, with funding from the federal government
and help from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, used chemicals to
treat feeder streams in from 1989 to 1997 and recorded a high
number of lamprey deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers loved it, saying they were catching stronger, larger and
healthier fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government won't renew the $8 million in funding
until an environmental impact statement is completed and a future
lamprey management plan accepted, something that may take until
summer of 2001. Even then, it will take a number of years before
the treatment program becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
   New York has been funding an interim program and has treated
some of the rivers on its side of the lake but Vermont and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service have not had the funding to continue
treatments in Vermont streams.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, anglers will have to risk catching fish that
show the scars of lamprey attacks. Mature sea lampreys attach
themselves to game fish, feeding on the blood of lake trout, salmon
and other species.
</P>
<P>
   ''Weve certainly received plenty of calls from some very unhappy
fishermen,'' said Lawrence Nashett, senior aquatic biologist for
the Department of Environmental Conservation at Ray Brook.
</P>
<P>
   One angler called to report that an Atlantic salmon he had
caught looked like it had ''dreadlocks'' because two or three
lampreys were still clinging to its body, Nashett said.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton went 3-for-5 with a three-run homer
and Larry Walker added three RBIs as the Colorado Rockies ended a
three-game losing streak Saturday night with a 9-4 victory over the
San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Mayne and Neifi Perez had three hits each for the Rockies
who won for only the third time in 16 games. Gabe White (7-1)
worked 2 2-3 innings and struck out four to earn the win in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko had two hits and drove in three runs and Phil Nevin
added two hits, including his 19th home run, for the Padres who
lost for the third time in six games. Matt Clement (9-9) lasted
four innings and allowed eight runs and 11 hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the first inning. Eric Owens
slapped a single to right, moved to second on a groundout and
scored on Kelsko's double.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's 24th homer highlighted a four-run first. Brian Hunter
singled and Perez doubled to open the inning. Hunter came home on
Walker's groundout and after Jeff Cirillo walked, Helton hit an 0-2
fastball into the right field seats to score Perez and Cirillo.
</P>
<P>
   Walker singled off Clement's glove with two outs in the second
to score Hunter, extending the lead to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin hit a two-out solo homer in the third.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half, Mayne drove in a run with a single and then
scored when third baseman Nevin mishandled Hunter's grounder. An
inning later, Mayne's two-out RBI single made it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's two-run double in the fifth cut the lead to 8-4. The
Rockies escaped further damage when Klesko was thrown out at the
plate on a relay by second baseman Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's sacrifice fly in the seventh extended the lead to 9-4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: An MRI test taken Thursday on the right shoulder of RHP
Steve Montgomery revealed a partially torn rotator cuff. ... San
Diego first-base coach Alan Trammell will miss Sunday's game to
attend the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies of Sparky Anderson,
his manager with the Detroit Tigers. ... Clement tied a club record
for 16 wild pitches in a season held by Steve Arlin (1972) and
Sterling Hitchcock (1999). ... Rockies starter Kevin Jarvis, who
has allowed 21 homers this year, lasted just 4 2-3 innings and
failed to get his third win for the eighth straight start. ... San
Diego's Dave Mauer worked two innings of relief in his major league
debut.

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Daylong torrential rains caused floods
and landslides, killing eight people, injuring three and forcing
thousands to flee their homes, government officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 16 inches of rain fell Saturday, mostly in Seoul and
Kyonggi, a populous province surrounding the capital, Home Ministry

<P>
   Eight people were killed in landslides, drowning and other
related accidents. Almost 1,000 homes were submerged, forcing 2,200
people to evacuate to shelters.
</P>
<P>
   All major roads and flights have been operating normally and one
section of a major railroad was being repaired. But operations by

summit, the leaders cited ''unprecedented economic progress'' by many world
nations and agreed that more must be done to spread that prosperity to poorer
nations. ''The 21st century must be a century of prosperity for all,'' they

Report: Nursing Homes Need Stricter Rules
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Many nursing homes are so understaffed they may be
endangering the welfare of their patients, according to a new report by federal
health officials. The report, which will be presented to Congress later this
month, recommends stricter guidelines that would require thousands of nursing
homes to hire more nurses and nurses' aides, The New York Times reported Sunday.
After eight years of research, health officials concluded that understaffing has
contributed to increased incidences of severe bedsores, malnutrition, and
abnormal weight loss among nursing home patients. A high number of those
patients end up developing life-threatening infections, dehydration and other
problems that could have been prevented had the homes been staffed adequately,
the study said.
