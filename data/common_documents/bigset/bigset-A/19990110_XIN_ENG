<HEADLINE> Germans Top Medal Tally as World Cup Swimming Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Swimming superpower Germany
topped the medal tally by grabbing four gold medals in the
first-day competition of the World Cup short-course series Hong
Kong leg which opened in the Kowloon Park Indoor Pool here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China, represented here by some second-string swimmers, and
Denmark followed with three gold medals each. Both Canada and
Ukraine took two, followed by the United States, Britain, Brazil
and Costa Rica, each with one.
</P>
<P>
German Jens Kruppa and Canadian Kelly Stefanyshyn became the
Hong Kong leg's first two double gold medalists. Kruppa, bronze
medalist for men's 100 meters breaststroke event at last year's
world championships in Perth, took both 50 meters and 200 meters
breaststroke titles. The Canadian woman struck gold in both 50
and 200 meters backstroke events at the weekend meeting.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Tom Dolan from the United States had failed to
win any of his four races at the World Cup's Beijing leg. But he
compensated that loss Saturday evening with his triumph in the 400
meters individual medley in which he was clocked four minutes
19.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, who holds the long-course world record for men's 400
meters individual medley, said earlier that he would skip the
short-course world championships slated for April this year in
Hong Kong due to schedule clashes with the U.S. national
championships.
</P>
<P>
His other major event this year would be the Pan-Pacific
championships in August in Sydney, for which he had already
qualified.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's Claudia Poll, Olympic champion in women's 200
meters freestyle and holder of short-course world records for 200-
and 400-meter freestyle events, said she was happy with her
performance after her victory in the 800 meters freestyle Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The female star had targeted the short-course world
championships and the Pan-Pacific championships as her major
events for the year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Cabinet Approves Draft Ninth Five-year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian cabinet approved on
Saturday the draft ninth five-year plan (1997-2002) with a lower
economic growth target and a total expenditure of 8,590 rupees
(Approximately 202.117 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The draft revised the annual growth target to 6.5 percent from
the earlier projection of seven percent due to economic slowdown
in the country but kept unchanged the budgetary support at 3,740
billion rupees (approximately 88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It also lower the agriculture and allied sector growth target
to 3.9 percent from the original 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth targets for manufacturing, mining, electricity,
construction and trade have also been reduced, according to the
draft which has been delayed by two years due to change of
government in the country.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes an allocation of 223 billion rupees (5.247
billion U.S. dollars) for prime minister's Special Action Plan
focusing on social, infrastructure and development of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press soon after the two-hour cabinet meeting, S.
R. Hashim, a secretary of the Planning commission, said that the
government would reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.1 percent in the
last year of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting pressures on economy, the draft has marginally
lowered the saving rate to 26.1 percent for earlier 26.2 percent
and investment rate to 28.2 from 28.3 percent which was suggested
in the draft released by the previous government led by the United
Front.
</P>
<P>
Public savings are targeted to go down drastically by over 40
percent from 2,180 billion rupees (51.29 billion U.S. dollars) to
1, 270 rupees (29.88 billion U.S. dollars) and the shortfall is
sought to be made essentially from the household sectors.
</P>
<P>
With a share of 19.8 percent in the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), the household sector would contribute 15,220 (15,220)
billion rupees (358.117 billion U.S. dollars) for the revised
projections, up from 14,710 rupees (346.117 billion U.S. dollars),
or 18.9 percent in the previous draft.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit is kept unchanged at the level of
2.1 percent of GDP, even though export growth targets have been
reduced from 14.5 to 11.8 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the government would be able to achieve the average
6.5 percent growth rate during the plan period when GDP growth
rate was only five percent during 1997-98, Hashim said it was
possible.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the government had targeted six
percent growth in the current financial year from March 31, 1998,
to April 1, 1999, and the growth rate would be accelerated to
seven percent during the next three years of the plan period.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that even for the reduced growth target of 6.5
percent, the economy would have to grow by over seven percent in
the next three years to make up for lower than estimated
performance in 1997-98 and the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Hashim said that the government had accorded high priority
status in agriculture and hoped to double foodgrain production in
the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan will be immediately circulated among state
governments for discussions and the National Development Council
will hold a meeting in a month to approve the plan.

<HEADLINE> Vote for Nigerian State Governors Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians ended their voting for state
governors and House of Assembly members Saturday afternoon peacefully.
Most streets in Lagos are quiet with few cars and people as the Nigerian
government has introduced a strict traffic ban Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has deployed more
than half million electoral personnel for over 110,000 polling stations
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
About 108 governorship and 2,975 state house of assembly candidates from
three political parties took part in the contesting for 35 governors and
state assembly members.
</P>
<P>
The three political parties are the People's Democratic Party, the All
People's party and the Alliance for Democracy which were registered as a
result of their performance in the council polls held last December.
</P>
<P>
The state election which is the second of elections under a transitional
program will be followed by a national assembly and presidential election
in February.
</P>
<P>
Saturday elections took place in 35 of the 36 states in the West African
country as the INEC has declared a no-election situation in Bayelsa State
because of the spate of violence which has engulfed the state recently.
</P>
<P>
As part of the security arrangements, the Nigerian government has
ordered the closure of Nigeria's borders with neighboring countries
beginning from Friday to forestall foreigners sneaking into the country to
vote in the country.
</P>
<P>
To ensure transparency of the election, the INEC has invited some 1,100
foreign observers to monitor Saturday's election, who are from the United
Nations, the Commonwealth, the United States and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military government led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar has
repeatedly promised to hand over power to a civilian government on May 29
this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Honor Peace Deal with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has called on the international community to urge
Israel to carry out the Wye peace accord in the run-up to its May
17 elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a weekly cabinet meeting late
Friday, the PNA expressed concern that Israel might use the early
elections as an excuse to freeze the latest peace deal, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington-brokered peace agreement signed in
October, Israel should implement a three-phased troop
redeployment from 13 percent of the West Bank over a period of 12
weeks.
</P>
<P>
But soon after Israel carried out the first phase of the troop
withdrawals in November, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze
the implementation of the deal in an attempt to pull together his
cracking coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the early elections in Israel might further
delay the implementation of the deal, which should have been
finished by late January.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say the stalemate will make it more difficult
for the PNA to curb violence against Israel, which in return would
possibly drive a hard-line government to power.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Faces Daunting Task in Keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The world has been
shocked by frequent heart-breaking news coming from the
southwestern and western parts of Africa since the beginning of
this year, as war flares in the Great Lake region and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The tragic news posed a serious challenge to the 185-member
United Nations after its system devoted much time and resources to
seeking a peaceful solution to conflicts on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Two U.N. transport aircrafts have been shot down since
Christmas near the central highlands city of Huambo, around which
the Angolan Government troops are waging pitched battles with
long-time adversaries, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Thanks to hard talks and painstaking contacts, a U.N. rescue
team was allowed by Angola's warring parties on Friday to reach
the site of the first plane crash, some 10 days after the December
26 tragedy. But they failed to find out how many of the 14 people
aboard the crashed aircraft were killed and what brought the plane
down.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the wreckage of the second plane, which was shot
down in the same area eight days later, has yet to be located by
U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
In West Africa, the rebels in Sierra Leone have seized the
State House, seat of the elected government, in central Freetown,
capital of the West African country, prompting the relocation of
U.N. staff, including 17 military observers, from the war-ragged
country to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, a body designed to maintain the world peace
and security, found its troubled presence in Africa is in crisis
in the face of renewed warfare in both Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, U.N. monitoring operations are hindered by renewed
clashes in Angola, which has led to the withdrawal of U.N.
peacekeepers from the southwestern African country's central
highlands to the relatively safety of the capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
"The war has resumed, we have to be realists," Issa Diallo,
special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Angola, said
in the Angolan capital of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) has already cut its
personnel to 1,000 from 7,000 after a tentative 1994 peace accord
started to unravel, leading to speculation that the United Nations
was considering pulling out altogether.
</P>
<P>
Fighting continues in the diamond-rich country, and prospects
of a truce seem slim. The renewed conflict has all but dashed the
1994 agreement, known as the Lusaka Protocol which aimed to put an
end to more than two decades of civil war, sparked after a 14-year
struggle for independence from Portugal which ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies would continue to provide humanitarian relief to
Angolans even if, as analysts expect, MONUA is eventually reduced
to a skeleton presence.
</P>
<P>
While relief work goes on, the United Nations, which has
already spent up to one billion U.S. dollars on trying to hold
Angola together, will do what it can to keep some form of peace
initiative on track, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United Nations does not give up any hope
for a peaceful solution in Sierra Leone. "There can be no military
solution" to the conflict in the West African country, Annan said
earlier this week in a statement.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging in a report to the Security Council that
the future of the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone now appeared much
less clear than it did only a matter of weeks ago, Annan said he
believes that there was much that the mission can do and
recommended that the mandate be extended for a two-month period
until March 13,1999.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he intends to reduce the number of military
observers in Sierra Leone and retain in Conakry, capital of
Guinea, a small number who would return to Sierra Leone when
conditions permit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who presented a comprehensive analysis of the
African conflicts in April last year, has helped the world achieve
a consensus that there will be no peace in the world without peace
in Africa and there will be no prosperity in the globe without
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first black African to become the U.N.
Secretary-General, said he had a profound understanding of the
challenge in U.N. peacekeeping operations. "We will be facing a
double challenge of peace and security and the global economic and
financial crisis in the coming year," he said at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Even after these setbacks in Africa, he said that he would
continue to join hands with the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and other African regional groups to find a African solution
to African problems.

<HEADLINE> More Time for Cyprus Firms to Widen Capital Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Exchange on
Friday decided to allow nine list companies until September 30 to
broaden their capital base or face possible delisting, the Cyprus
Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The nine companies, include national carrier Cyprus Airways,
had in early 1996 been given a three-year grace period to sell
more shares to the public to conform with the bourse's regulations.
</P>
<P>
The grace periods were scheduled to expire next month or in
March.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in response to alarm among investors
triggered by the possibility that the nine companies may face
imminent delisting.
</P>
<P>
The nine companies, including the Universal Life Insurance,
the Cyprus Tourist Development Company, have a market
capitalization of about 160 million Cyprus pounds (320 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bourse has a total market capitalization of 1.3 billion
pounds (2.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has controlling stakes in two of the nine
companies - Cyprus Airways and the Cyprus Tourist Development
Company.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Borrowing Rises Less Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Board said consumer borrowing increased more slowly than expected
in November,rising by 3.9 billion U.S. dollars to a total of 1.301
trillion dollars, according to a report of the New York Times on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In its revised figures, the Federal Reserve reported that the
rate of new borrowing is down from October, when consumer
borrowing rose 11.9 billion dollars. Consumer borrowing was rising
at 3.6 percent annual rate during November, down from 11 percent
in the month before.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the unexpectedly low borrowing in November could
point to a decline in the rate of consumer spending from last
year. Borrowing could be declining because the strong economy,
with plentiful jobs and rising incomes, strengthened household
finances, they added.
</P>
<P>
But it is also possible that consumer borrowing may actually be
rising, the newspaper report says. With mortgage rates low,
consumers have been refinancing homes and taking out home equity
loans, which carry lower interest rates than credit card
borrowing.

<HEADLINE> Moussa to Meet French Counterpart on Regional Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Saturday that he would soon meet with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine for talks on a joint Mideast peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative "is still breathing," Moussa told reporters
after talks with Jean Claude Cousseran, director-general of the
North Africa and Mideast Department of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was referring to a proposal that an international
conference be convened in a bid to advance the Mideast peace
process, made by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac during Mubarak's visit to France last
May.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reservation of the United States over the
initiative, Moussa said Egypt and France have not contacted the
U.S. either in this regard or in light of the recent deadlock of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Egypt and France will hold dialog with the U.S. after
coordinating their stances.
</P>
<P>
Cousseran arrived here Friday for a two-day visit, which came
as part of continued consultations between the two countries on
regional and international issues of mutual concern, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a separate news conference after meeting with Moussa, the
French official described the consultations as "useful and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process came to a halt after
Israel shelved the Wye River agreement signed between the two
sides in Washington last October.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded the Palestinians meet more requirements outside
the Wye agreement, which has been have rejected by as an attempt
to create pretexts for freezing the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Lower Chamber Starts Debating 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's lower house of
parliament, the House of Representatives, on Saturday started its
debate on the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget of 2.16 billion Jordanian dinars (3.24 billion
U.S. dollars), presented to the House by Finance Minister Mishail
Marto last December, put the current expenditure at 1.68 billion
dinars (2.37 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The projected capital expenditure was 477 million dinars (667.8
millions dollars), which many House members and analysts
considered too low for a robust economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
A 7 percent budget deficit proposed by the government was in
line with the target set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for renewing its financial aid to the reform program of the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the IMF are expected to sign an agreement later this
month on a new three-year reform program following the kingdom's
failure to achieve sustainable economic growth in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
The government believed the 1999 budget would help spur the
sluggish economy which it blamed for instabilities in Iraq,
Israel, plunging oil prices and a decline in overseas remittances.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government feared measures to control
deficits would further push the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the budget also echoed such concerns. They believe
the government was unable to solve its twin dilemma of curbing
unemployment and poverty while putting a lid on public
expenditures, and keeping the deficit below 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the 7 percent deficit ceiling, the government can hardly
achieve a growth rate higher than 3 percent in 1999, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
They believed Jordan needed at least a 6 percent economic
growth to cope with the population growth rate of the country,
which stood at 3 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Slammed for Anti-Iraq Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's National Assembly, or
parliament on Saturday accused the U.N. Security Council of having
adopted a series of anti-Iraq resolutions under the influence of
the United States since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was made at an extraordinary session convened to
discuss the latest U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq and
review Iraq's stance to foil "hostile schemes" to split the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency INA quoted Assembly Speaker Sadoun
Hammadi as saying at the session that these anti-Iraq resolutions
are full of injustice and ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
They served to remind the world people, those in the Third
World in particular, of the danger that the Security Council is
facing threats against the spirit of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that Iraq's just and right sounds were not
heard until the aggression (against Iraq) occurred and situation
in the Security Council has become clear," said Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
These U.N. resolutions have taken the place of justice and
truth, he said, stressing that acts to kill Iraqi people through
starvation and diseases have totally violated the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi praised the stance adopted by the special meeting of
the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) held recently in Amman, Jordan
which condemned the U.S.-British aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some parliament members hailed the resolutions adopted at the
meeting of the APU as a victory for Iraq, calling for their
implementation for the interests of Arab nations.

BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Saturday met with military commanders of the air force and
air-defense force, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The commanders pledged to continue to fight the aggressors
until the final victory is achieved, INA reported.
</P>
<P>
After the December 16-19 U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq,
Iraq said it did not recognize the no-fly zones imposed by the
U.S. and Britain after the 1991 Gulf War to protect minority Kurds
in the north and Shiite Moslems in the south from "Baghdad's
oppression."
</P>
<P>
Since late last month, the Iraqi air-defense force exchanged
fire with U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly zones on
four occasions.
</P>
<P>
And earlier this month, Iraqi jets confronted the U.S. fighter
jets over the southern no-fly zone for the first time since the
1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Promises to Back S. Leone Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka
Anyaoku Saturday said that the Commonwealth was resolutely behind the
democratically elected government of President Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Nigerian capital of Abuja where he is currently conferring
with Nigerian leaders, Anyaoku expressed grave concern about the recent
developments in Sierra Leone and condemned the latest attempt to overthrow
the government of that country.
</P>
<P>
He described the latest action by the rebels in Sierra Leone as "
deplorable and unacceptable" to the Commonwealth and the international
community, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth leader expressed support to the reported seven-day
truce agreed between the government and the rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Commonwealth Office in London and faxed to NAN
Saturday quoted the secretary-general as saying that the organization would
continue to support efforts made by Kabbah and the West African peace-
keeping force ECOMOG to restore peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the on-going talks between President Kabbah
and the rebel leader Foday Sankoh would open the way to ending the agony of
the Sierra Leonean people.
</P>
<P>
Another leader of the rebels, San Bockarie said Friday that he had
rejected the seven-day cease-fire agreement reached by President Kabbah and
rebel leader Foday Sankoh, adding that the rebels had launched a general
offensive against the ECOMOG troops in capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the British Defence Ministry said Saturday that a Royal
Navy frigate HMS Norfolk is on its way toward the Sierra Leone region as
fighting continues in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ship would be monitoring events in the country and it
is a straightforward precautionary measure to the tense situation in that
part of the world.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Receive Non-returnable Credits From EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Romania will receive this
year, through the Phare-Credo Program, non-returnable credits of
1.02 million Euros, out of the 7.7 million Euros available for all
the eligible countries.
</P>
<P>
The credits go to 14 projects, chosen from 76 proposals
presented by 18 counties and they place Romania third among the 12
Central and East European countries in the focus of Phare,
governmental sources were quoted on Saturday by the Rompres news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Credo is supplying funds for infrastructure development
projects in Romanian border areas. The program, administered in
Romania by the Ministry of Public Works and Physical Planning
addresses 18 Romanian counties on the border with Hungary,
Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes that in 1999 it will be able to start
another two cross-border cooperation programs with Hungary and
Bulgaria, which will each benefit from 5 million Euros worth of
non-reimbursable credits.
</P>
<P>
The Credo credits are destined to non-profit private or public
legal organizations, such as local administrations, chambers of
commerce, education institutions and non-government organizations
in Romanian border areas.
</P>
<P>
The European Council made the move following a pilot program
initiated in 1997 and funded with 1.5 million ECU.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Enlarge Access in Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The National Education
Ministry of Romania issued a plan to enlarge access of young
people in higher education institutions, with a view to narrowing
the gap in this respect between Romania and the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Romania lags far behind the EU member or North American
countries in regard to people's access to and attendance in higher
education institutions, the national Rompres news agency reported
on Saturday citing statistics from the Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thus, in these countries, three to six young people out of ten
enter higher education institutions at the most favorable age
(18-25) for this kind of studies, while in Romania only one out of
ten young people decide to go to college or university.
</P>
<P>
In order to gradually reduce this distinction, the education
ministry issued a plan comprising several solutions, such as to
stimulate above 25-year olds' demand of higher education.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the ministry decided to keep 30,000 places for
the post-university education for the 1999-2000 school year (the
same as in 1998-1999) and offer 600,000 places for the
matriculation exam in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, Romanian students stand for 7.6 percent (against
12-18 percent in the EU member states) out of the school-going
population.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Youths Against Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 9 (Xinhua) - Tanzania warned Saturday its young
people against an ever-increasing drug trafficking, urging their parents to
check them from committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) of the Home Affairs
Ministry, Adadi Rajabu, said in a statement that his ministry will be more
strict with issuing passports to youths as more youths are engaged in
transporting drugs from abroad, mostly hidden in their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, four Tanzanian youths were arrested upon their
arrival from Iran at Uganda's Entebbe International Airport as police found
pellets of 1,480 grams of heroine in their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu urged the parents and guardians especially in the coastal regions
be more watchful of their children against the evil activity which has
brought shame on Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The DCI said that some young people managed to go abroad for an easy and
better life but ended up in forced drug trafficking, especially by keeping
the evil stuff in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs in certain countries particularly in the Far East are very cheap
and the poor youths who have failed to make what they thought buy the drugs
and try to ferry them to this end in order to sell them upon arrival home,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rabaju said that the number of Tanzania youths arrested and jailed
abroad increased from 22 in 1997 to 31 last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Defaulting on Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday denied media
reports that it has defaulted on some of its foreign debts and
allowed creditors to seize its accounts or property abroad.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after Wednesday reports in Moskovskaya Pravda
and Moskovsky Komsomolets that the Russian government had reached
agreement with foreign creditors that the debts would be paid by
way of arresting Russian property and the accounts of legal
entities and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"Such 'versions' are a pure invention from the beginning to the
end," the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry acknowledged that its dire financial standing had
prevented it from fully fulfilling all of its external obligations
on time.
</P>
<P>
"The draft budget for 1999 provides 9.5 billion U.S. dollars to
this end (servicing foreign debts), and part of this sum is
expected to be refinanced through the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank loans," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has taken a number of civilized steps to solve the most
complex debt issue confronting it. And there is no question of
announcing default which could be accompanied by the arrest of
Russia's accounts or property abroad," the ministry said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister has hailed
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni as a great leader and one of the few who
enjoy high prestige on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks when meeting with Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, under the leadership of President Museveni, has achieved
significant progress in its democracy restoration and economic development,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
When Museveni paid his first visit to China in 1989, former Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping noted that the system of the National Resistance
Movement is the suitable system Ugandans chose for themselves.
</P>
<P>
It has made great contributions to Uganda's development over recent
years, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the third leg of the Chinese minister's 12-day five-nation
African tour. He has visited Egypt and Kenya and will also go to Tanzania,
Zambia and France before heading home.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Beef Up Effort to Fight Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) President Thabo Mbeki said Saturday that the
government would take effective measures to deal with crimes in West Cape
Province and other part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally in Cape Town, held to celebrate the ANC's 87th
birthday, Mbeki, also deputy president of the country, said the time had
come to deal the serious problem of crime in West Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
He said "We must deal with the problem of gangsters that are terrorizing
the people, with the problem of gangsters who are distributing and selling
drugs in this province, even in the schools."
</P>
<P>
Cape Town is both legislative capital of South Africa and tourist city
in the country. It has been regarded a city where security and safety are
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
However, crimes and violent activities have sharply increased in the
past
two years.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded near a popular tourist destination in Cape Town on New
Year's Day, injuring at least one man and destroying two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki stressed that the government and police should lead the offensive
against crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was founded on January 8, 1912.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Revolutionary Dies at 81 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A key member of the Egyptian Free
Officers movement that toppled the monarchy in 1952 has died at
the age of 81, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Latif el-Baghdadi, a stout supporter of Egypt's late
President Gamal Abdel Nasser, was hospitalized Friday and died at
night of liver cancer, which has tormented him in the past two
years, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
El-Baghdadi was born in Dakahlia Governorate in September
1917. He graduated from Egypt's military academy in 1938 and later
was first in his class at the air force academy.
</P>
<P>
El-Baghdadi held several senior government posts after the
success of the revolution led by Nasser, who organized the Free
Officers Movement to overthrow King Farouk, an event which was
known as the 1952 Revolution of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
El-Baghdadi chaired in 1953 the court in charge of trying
politicians who were active before the revolution. He became
minister of war in 1953-1954 and was appointed vice president of
the 1958-1961 United Arab Republic, the union of Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He took the office of minister of planning and finance in
1961-1962 and worked as a member of the Presidency Council, an
executive body within the government in 1962-1964.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, policy disagreements with Nasser forced him to
leave his government posts.
</P>
<P>
El-Baghdadi's funeral is scheduled to be held on Sunday.

KUWAIT -- Kuwait's budget deficit is likely to hit 14.5 billion
U.S. dollars in 1999, while the revenues is to stand at 7.8
billion dollars, the Arabic daily AL-Haiyat reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been suffering from budget deficits since the Iraqi
invasion in 1990. The sharp drop in oil prices might clear away
the optimism of two years ago that the problem can be resolved by
2000.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Legislative body of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is to work out soon the final revision of the country's securities
and goods market law.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at checking speculation and manipulation
activities by some dealers.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's lower house of parliament, the House of
Representatives, on Saturday started its debate on the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget of 2.16 billion Jordanian dinars (3.24 billion
U.S. dollars), presented to the House by Finance Minister Mishail
Marto last December, put the current expenditure at 1.68 billion
dinars (2.37 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The projected capital expenditure was 477 million dinars (667.8
millions dollars), which many House members and analysts
considered too low for a robust economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
A 7 percent budget deficit proposed by the government was in
line with the target set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for renewing its financial aid to the reform program of the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Tourism Ministry and the tourism-oriented
private and state-run sectors have been trying over the past years
to open new markets and attract visitors to the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Egypt paid attention to tourists from
Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States. According to the International Tourism Agency, about 13
million Russians traveled abroad and spent about 10.7 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, despite the country's economic
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Sheep Clone Dolly to Be Preserved after Death: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Dolly the sheep, the world's
first mammal cloned from an adult cell, is to be stuffed and put
on display in a museum when she dies, a British newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, which created Dolly, has
already reached agreement with the National Museums of Scotland to
preserve her, although the sheep could live for another 15 years,
The Daily Telegraph said.
</P>
<P>
Since born in 1996 at the Roslin Institute, Dolly has triggered
a worldwide competition in the development of cloning technology.
After Dolly, scientists have successfully cloned cows and mice.
</P>
<P>
"If Dolly lives for another 20 years, cloning may have become
commonplace but she will always be special because she was the
first", Mark Shaw, keeper of geology and zoology at the museum,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He described Dolly as a "20th century icon".

In a statement issued after a weekly cabinet meeting late

elections as an excuse to freeze the latest peace deal, Israel

Observers here say the stalemate will make it more difficult
for the PNA to curb violence against Israel, which in return would

<HEADLINE> Efforts Being Made for Meeting of S.Leone Rebel Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone government is trying to
arrange a meeting between the main leader Foday Sankoh of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) and RUF commander in the field Sam Bockarie, a senior
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance and Economic Planning James Jonah said Saturday in
capital Freetown that he had asked Guinean President Lansana Conte if
Guinea could host the meeting, according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that the purpose of the proposed meeting would
be to persuade the field commander to accept the cease-fire agreement
reached by President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Field commander Bockarie insists that he will continue his offensive
against the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG until Sankoh is
released from detention while the government says that Sankoh could be
freed if a cease-fire is established.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sporadic fighting continued Saturday in and near Freetown
with the center of the fighting being at Congo Town near the Wilberforce
Barracks.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers patrolled the streets of Freetown's west end while artillery
rounds crashed into rebel positions in the hills to the south.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie has pledged to press his offensive against the Lungi
International Airport complex where President Kabbah and senior government
officials have taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are threatening to launch a renewed attack on the capital's
west end within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and the Nigerian-led ECOMOG force worked through the
night carrying in supplies and evacuating refugees from the threatened
districts on the city's west end.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean and foreign civilians are continuing to flee the capital,
some to the relative safety of the ECOMOG-held Lungi airport where civilian
charter planes are ferrying them to neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Boost U.S. Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday that U.S. prosperity depends upon the world's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, he outlined a 108 million U.S.
dollars plan to boost U.S. exports and buttress its manufacturers
against reverberations from economic crises overseas.
</P>
<P>
He said his fiscal 2000 budget would propose 40 million
dollars in new foreign aid to help developing countries improve labor
standards.
</P>
<P>
"With millions of American jobs depending on foreign exports,
we must help manufacturers find new markets and attract new
customers for our goods overseas," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton recorded the address on Friday at United Auto Workers
headquarters in Detroit after a speech to the Economic Club of
Detroit, announcing that the nation's economic expansion is now the
longest sustained peacetime growth in history.
</P>
<P>
The president forecasted that his 108 million dollars plan would spur
nearly 2 billion dollars of additional U.S. exports, which would sustain
or create 16,000 high-wage American manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be part of his proposed budget for the fiscal year
beginning October 1. Clinton is due to submit his budget to Congress
in early February.
</P>
<P>
The president described a three-pronged approach:
</P>
<P>
firstly, to begin by boosting support for the Import-Export
Bank, the federal agency that provides loans and loan guarantees
to help U.S. companies sell abroad. Clinton said the bank, which
currently finances 10 percent of all U.S. exports of capital
equipment, can use expanded credit to foster billions of dollars
in exports _ for such items as U.S.-built airplanes _ that might
otherwise have been canceled or delayed due to the financial
turmoil in Asia. He proposed adding 81 million dollars to the
bank's 815 million budget.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to expand the Commerce Department's efforts to help
small U.S. exporters sell their goods in emerging markets such as
China, Latin America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
And finally, through the Commerce Department to help
developing countries establish a legal and regulatory infrastructure that
would make it easier for U.S. companies to sell there.
</P>
<P>
In ending his address, Clinton said "We will harness the
power of our new global economy to build a bright future for all
our people in the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports have been hurt particularly by the financial crisis
that struck East Asia in 1997 and persisted through last year _ a
crunch that has caused Japan and other major U.S. markets to reduce
imports of American goods and to increase their exports to the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Medalist Chen Lu Absent of National Winter Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 10 (Xinhua) -- When the
Ninth National Winter Games is to be in full swing on Monday, the
absence of Olympic bronze medallist Chen Lu hit the competition
as the big loss of the winter sports festival.
</P>
<P>
Rumors spread before the competition that Chen, former world
champion and Nagano Olympic bronze medallist in the women's
figure skating singles, was expected to join the Changchun's
delegation, her hometown, for her first competitive activity
after she retired last year following her triumph in Nagano,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who danced China's traditional lyric Liangzhu to finish
behind American Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan in Nagano, ran
regular training for the national competition before her family
announced her absence.
</P>
<P>
She did not compete in the entry tournament for the national
winter games and also could not get back on time from the United
States where she is living, leaving the women figure skating
competition less attractive as no big names emerged after her quit
.
</P>
<P>
Ha'erbin will be the undisputable dominator of the figure
skating competition as its Olympic ice dancing fifth-placed pairs
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, and Olympic men's singles eighth
finisher Guo Zhengxin will carry on the gold hopes.
</P>
<P>
Changchun is to be another medals collector, who is the
powerhouse in short track speed skating as it boasts of Olympic
silver medals winners, including Li Jiajun, also World Cup series
overall champion, Yang Yang and Wang Chunlu.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delegation Gets First-Hand Look At China's Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the U.S.'s
Carter Center, led by Charles Costello, director of its Democracy
Program, got a chance to witness the election of local
legislators in Rongchang County in Chongqing Municipality today.
</P>
<P>
Costello told Xinhua that he was experiencing a historical
moment as the head of a foreign delegation watching the direct
election of People's Congress deputies at the township level, and
a demonstration of China's progress in promoting democracy.
</P>
<P>
Today was the election day for the residents in Rongchang.
Some 800 people voted for two people's deputies out of three
candidates. They ran the gamut from an old-man in his 90s to a
college student just back from school. They gathered at a primary
school playground in the morning to wait for the start of the
election. Deng Fuxiang, a 94-year-old villager, told the U.S.
visitors that what concerned him most was finding capable
deputies for people.
</P>
<P>
The Americans watched the whole process, from presentations by
candidates to the announcement of the final results. "We are here
like students to observe the elections, and earnestly tried to
learn something useful," Costello told Xinhua. He said that the
local people here were like American farmers in their question
for candidates about building village roads, the public exposure
of village finances and scientific farming.
</P>
<P>
The election lasted two and a half hours, with 793 ballots
dispatched and 780 returned. Wang Fujiang and Liu Dajin won the
election. "I will make every effort to meet the expectations of
villagers. I will take a lead in learning about laws, observing
the law, and helping our people get a better life," Wang told his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
After the elections, Costello told Xinhua that he had got a
better understanding of China's elections, but still found it
difficult to reach a conclusion at time. He did, however, say
that he had seen a good exercise and said that it was a good way
for China to build up democracy and its legal system.
</P>
<P>
According to a National People's Congress election specialist,
elections of deputies at the township and county level will be
held among 800 million voters nationwide and will become an
important event in the political life of the Chinese people and
grassroots government and an important indication of China's
democratic and legal development.

<HEADLINE> Another Two Extrasolar Planets Detected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronomers detected
two more planets formed outside the solar system, said the
Washington Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new planets cannot be seen, but they can be inferred by
the gravitational pull they exert on the stars they circle.
</P>
<P>
Stars with big planets around them have a distinctive wobble
detectable from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
U.S. astronomers said at a news conference during an American
Astronomical Society meeting that one of the newly discovered
planets is 3.5 times the mass of Jupiter, and the other has 1.3
times Jupiter's mass.
</P>
<P>
The find brings the total of known extrasolar planets to at
least 17.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's FM Leaves for GCC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's First Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah left
for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Sunday to attend a brief meeting of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) foreign ministers on current
Arab issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, due later Sunday, is aimed at formulating a
unified Gulf stand towards the present Arab situation before the
extraordinary meeting of the Arab foreign ministers opens in Cairo
on January 24, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a similar meeting in Riyadh on December 29, the GCC
foreign ministers had tried to coordinate their stances before the
gathering of all Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
There have been some new developments in the Arab arena
following the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in
mid-December, which have affected the Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
According to Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary general of the
Arab League, the Arab foreign ministers' meeting had originally be
slated for December 30, but was postponed at the request of the
GCC states.
</P>
<P>
Should the meeting have taken place, the ministers would have
discussed possibilities of holding an Arab summit to review the
new developments since the U.S.-British bombings.
</P>
<P>
The last GCC summit held in United Arab Emirates earlier
December stressed the need to enhance Arab relations and exert
more efforts in a bid to restore Arab solidarity on solid basis
of principles and rules of the joint Arab action.

<HEADLINE> Funeral Held for Veteran Egyptian Revolutionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A military funeral was held
Sunday for Egypt's veteran revolutionary Abdel-Latif el-Baghdadi,
who died of liver cancer Friday at the age of 81.
</P>
<P>
El-baghdadi was one of the key members of the Free Officers
Movement that toppled the monarchy in l952.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak attended the funeral ceremony,
held in the neighborhood of Madinat Nas near the Memorial of the
Unknown Soldiers in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri, senior government
officials and other members of the 1952 Revolution Command
Council, which el-Baghdadi once served, also were present at the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement issued on Saturday praised el-Baghdadi
as "a glowing example of dedication and selflessness," saying "he
served his country with all devotion and sincerity."
</P>
<P>
El-Baghdadi was born in Dakahlia Governorate in September
1917. He graduated from Egypt's military academy in 1938 and later
from the air force academy.
</P>
<P>
A stout supporter of Egypt's late President Gamal Abdel Nasser,
el-Baghdadi held several top posts after the revolution led by
Nasser, who organized the Free Officers Movement to overthrow King
Farouk, an event known as the 1952 Revolution of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He served as the speaker of Egypt's first parliament in 1957
and was named vice president of the 1958-1961 United Arab
Republic, the union of Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He worked as a member of the Presidency Council, an executive
body within the government in 1962-1964.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, policy disagreement with Nasser forced
el-Baghdadi to leave his government posts. But a rapprochement
was restored between the two men before Nasser died in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon's Reform Drives Spark Outcry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The new government of Lebanon
has triggered an outcry from opposition forces as its
just-announced reform measures led to the dismissal or suspension
of about 20 senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The opposition forces were mainly led by former Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and his political ally, the Progressive Socialist
Party headed by Druze leader Walid Jumblat.
</P>
<P>
With many of those targeted by the first wave of the reform
drives loyal to or appointed by the former Hariri-led government,
the former premier accused the new government, which was installed
two weeks ago, of seeking "political revenge."
</P>
<P>
He said the move is politically motivated and is a
"manifestation of political grudges."
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a construction tycoon, was removed from office as
premier after serving a six-year term and was succeeded by his
long-time political rival Salim Hoss at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, 69, a veteran economist and politician, served as prime
minister in three governments during the country's 1975-1990 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement addressed to the Parliament, he vowed
to set up a clean government made up of honest ministers and save
the country from the economic crisis and political instability he
inherited from Hariri through a dramatic administrative and
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In the largest administrative shake-up ever in Lebanon, his
cabinet decided Thursday to sack six senior officials and removed
13 others from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the move was a necessary step toward purging the
ailing administration, not targetting officials linked to Hariri.
</P>
<P>
"We were facing a situation in which we might have to take
painful and unpopular stands," he said. But he didn't give the
reason why those 19 officials were removed.
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 fired, 10 are Christians and nine Muslims. The
majority of them were aides to Hariri and former President Elias
Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Jisr, Chairman of the Council for Development and
Reconstruction (CDR), which is in charge of the country's mass
post-war reconstruction drive launched by Hariri after the end of
the civil war, was among those removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Beirut Governor Nicolas Saba and Mount Lebanon Governor Suhai
Yamout and Joseph Helou, President of Elissar, the country's
another key reconstruction body, were also dismissed.
</P>
<P>
In the cabinet session, the ministers, most of them are fresh
faces and technocrats, also decided to review the function and
authority of CDR, merge the Council for Executing Construction
Projects and the Council for Executing Grand Projects in Beirut
into one body and abolish the public telephone company Ogero as
part of a broader plan to restructure the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry.
</P>
<P>
They approved of merging the country's 22 water authorities
into five bodies and enforcing the principle of rotation for top
administrators.
</P>
<P>
Jumblat, former Minister of the Displaced in Hariri's
government, stood steadfast with his former boss and launched a
scathing attack on the new government's measures.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement, his party criticized the
measures, describing them as "political order of the day,"
implying they had been inspired by President Emile Lahoud, who
was commander of the army before he was elected head of state
last October.
</P>
<P>
Jumblat has been traditionally apprehensive of presidents with
military backgrounds. He has formed a strong opposition alliance
with Hariri.

<HEADLINE> Euro Success in Britain's Interest: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Sunday that it was in Britain's interest for the euro
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say publicly in favor of joining the European
single currency.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for Britain that the euro succeeds," Blair
told the BBC program.
</P>
<P>
Britain "must do everything we can to make the euro succeed,"
he said, adding at the same time that "what we cannot to do is
stand aside as a matter of principle."
</P>
<P>
"If the euro fails, Britain, even out of it, will feel the
backwash of that. Any idea that we can remain immune from what
happens in continental Europe is absurd," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that Britain must wait and see
whether joining the Euro is in its national economic interest and
whether the benefit of joining the euro is "clear and
unambiguous."
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Britain adopting the euro were hoping its
successful launch by 11 countries on January 1 would nudge the
government into putting forward a firm timetable for joining.
</P>
<P>
Britain has ruled out adopting the euro at least until 2002,
and any decision to join would need to win approval in a
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Holds Kuwait, Saudi Arabia for Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) held the Kuwaiti and Saudi authorities responsible
for the material and human losses resulted from the recent
U.S.-British air strikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly stressed in a resolution adopted Sunday
at the conclusion of its extraordinary session that Iraq would
preserve its rights for compensation for the damages.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the victim of Iraq's 1980 invasion and had thus been
willing to see President Saddam Hussein being bombed. Saudi
Arabia, which has a defense pact with the U.S., allowed its
territory to be used for attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also unanimously decided to discuss and study what
it called "unjust" U.N. resolutions and measures which preceded
and followed the recent U.S.-British aggression against Iraq,
reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament lauded the genuine national stands of the
Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) during its extraordinary meeting in
Amman on December 27 last year.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member APU, with the conspicuous absence of Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Mauritania, adopted a resolution
condemning the U.S.-British attack against Iraq and calling for
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The assembly called upon the Iraqi political leadership to urge
the Arab governments to abide by the resolutions of the APU and to
put them into force.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary session of the Iraqi parliament was convened
on Saturday morning to discuss the U.S.-British air strikes on
Iraq and the Arab position toward it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain air-raided Iraq on December 16-19 in
Operation Desert Fox to "punish Iraq's failure to cooperate fully
in U.N. weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> aaa011017fff Summit on Congo (K) Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A regional summit to end the war
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will be held in Zambia
next week where parties to the conflict are expected to sign a
cease-fire agreement, visiting Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is in Zimbabwe to discuss with his Zimbabwean
counterpart Robert Mugabe about the efforts to end the war in the
central african country, said that the long-expected summit would
start either on January 16 or 17, preceded by a meeting of defense
and foreign affairs ministers.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the summit meeting would be attended by
Angola, Gabon, Kenya, South Africa, Botswana, Chad, Rwanda,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the DRC and the rebels trying to topple
DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda are allegedly backing the rebels while
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent their troops to
support Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said there was a possibility that the rebels might
participate directly in the talks after President Kabila expressed
his willingness to meet them face to face.
</P>
<P>
In previous meetings, the rebels have participated on the
proximity basis.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who had refused to meet the rebels face to face since
the breakout of the war, surprised his foes last Wednesday with an
offer to meet them directly but only in his capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the modalities of a cease-fire agreement were the
exchange of prisoners of war, withdrawal of foreign troops and
ensuring security in countries bordering the DRC and in the vast
central African country itself.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying very, very hard to make this meeting work. All
countries associated with this conflict will be there," Chiluba
told reporters after his two-hour meeting with Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president said that there was commitment on the
parties involved in the war to find a peaceful solution to the
five-month-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
"President Mugabe said 'let us advance on this matter and allow
the people of Congo to proceed with development'," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He added that Rwanda also agreed during his recent visit that
there should be no more delays to the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of commitment, everybody wants this matter to
come to a close," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has been shuttling in the region consulting heads of
state and government on preparations for the peace summit
following a third postponement of the Lusaka summit which should
have been held on December 28 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president is expected to return home later Sunday.

<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Bayi
Rockets overpowered the visiting Jinan Army Pegasus 122-88 in the
fifth round of the Chinese first division basketball league in
Ningbo, Zhejiang Province on Sunday to keep their unbeaten record
intact.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who have swept all the four league champions
since 1995, kept their starters in the bench for most of the time
in the lopsided match as their bench players showed the
potentials and raced to a 27-11 lead soon after the start.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets built a 39-16 advantage in the first quarter, and
led the Pegasus to the second half 73-28.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who have several national players including Wang
Zhizhi, Zhang Jinsong and Li Nan, increased leading margin to 50
points in the second half and only slowed down their pace in the
final stage after the win had been sealed.
</P>
<P>
In other match, Shandong Flaming Bulls snapped Liaoning
Hunters' winning streak of four matches, beating the visitors in
Jinan 94-85 for its second win.
</P>
<P>
The Flaming Bulls, led by captain of national team Gong
Xiaobin, counted on the errors of the Hunters to take an
advantage of 53-51 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The hosts showed their consistency in the second half,
enlarging the lead to 74-63 after the third quarter and
maintaining the momentum in the fourth for the win.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Zhejiang Cyclone edged Jiangsu Dragons 98-96,
Guangdong Tigers outplayed Beijing Aoshen 99-82, Sichuan Pandas
routed Shanghai Sharks 109-101 and Jilin Tigers defeated Beijing

<HEADLINE> Preparations for Bangladesh's Municipal Election Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission (EC) of
Bangladesh Sunday reviewed the preparations for holding the
upcoming municipal elections to be held for the first time under a
code of conduct, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The EC is expected to announce the schedule of the non-party
elections to the country's 141 municipalities on January 14.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Local Government, Rural Development and
Cooperatives Ministry has announced an 11-point code of conduct
for the municipal polls barring candidates from using name of any
political party during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The code of conduct, published in the gazette earlier, was
framed under the Pourashava (Municipality) Ordinance of 1977.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal election is non-political party-based. The use
of the name of any political party, party symbols or photographs
and the names of any political personality will be forbidden,"
said the code.
</P>
<P>
Any commitment by candidates to provide financial assistance to
any institution either in public or in private will be considered
to be a violation of the code.
</P>
<P>
The code restricts erection of gates, hanging banners,
illuminations, wall writings, use of motor cycles, trucks, buses
and other vehicles and torches for election processions.
</P>
<P>
Under the code, one candidate will be allowed to use only one
loud speaker at a time but its use would be limited between 2:30
PM to 8:00 PM.
</P>
<P>
Posters to be printed by candidates will not be more than 23x18
inches in size and one color (black and white) and only local
papers could be used to publish the election posters.
</P>
<P>
Violation of any provisions under the code will be punishable
under the existing election rules.
</P>
<P>
The municipal elections will be held on February 23, 24, 25.

<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Yemen has promised not to use
force to rescue a kidnapped oil worker, a British official said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yemen confirmed that a British oil worker, hired by a U.S.
firm, was kidnapped in Yemen on Saturday, only two weeks after
four hostages were killed in an attempted rescue.
</P>
<P>
The four, three Britons and one Australian, were killed during
a shoot-out between militant Muslems and Yemeni troops.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the abduction of the oil worker is part of
a tribal dispute. We have been assured that no force will be used
in a rescue," the British official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robin Cook, secretary of state for foreign and
commonwealth affairs of Britain, demanded on Saturday access to
the five British citizens who have been under detention in Yemen
since late last month on charges of sabotage.

<HEADLINE> Oman Welcomes Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The euro, which was launched
with much fanfare last week, has made a smooth and positive entry
into Oman's market, according to a Gulf News report on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new currency has made trading easy and will help
strengthen Oman's economy, said Hamoud Bin Sanghour Bin Hashim,
Executive President of Central Bank of Oman.
</P>
<P>
He said one Omani rial would be worth 2.2 euros.
</P>
<P>
The business community, he pointed out, would no longer face
currency fluctuations in Europe. Also, the euro would provide new
opportunities for establishments, banks and individuals to
diversify their investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
This was the official Omani comment on the new currency, which
fell to its lowest level on Friday, dipping below $1.16 since its
historic launch.
</P>
<P>
The Omani rial is currently linked to the dollar. Monetary
experts are not making any predictions on whether there could be
a change in the currency peg.
</P>
<P>
"The euro will get a major boost when Britain also joins the
family," said a financial analyst.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians not Allowed to Declare Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated here on Sunday that Israel will
not allow the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to declare an
independent state in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told a weekly cabinet meeting that the Israeli
government intents to implement its decision concerning Israel's
response to an unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood or
the division of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat said in the past that PNA has
the right to declare an independent state in May this year
with Jerusalem as its capital when the five-year interim period
of the Oslo Accord expires. Netanyahu said in response that
Israel will annex the part of the West Bank now under Israeli
control if the PNA does that.
</P>
<P>
"Israel reserves the right to extend Israeli law to the
territories under its control if Arafat and the Palestinians
violate the agreements they have signed and unilaterally declare
the establishment of Palestinian state," said a communique issued
after the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said this issue will be Israel's prime concern in
the near future, as it relates to the fate of the state of
Israel and future of Israel's coming generations.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow Arafat and the Palestinians to determine
the borders of our state and the future of our capital. We
will continue to adhere to our firm and clear policy, which
does not allow for the creation of a Palestinian state in
the heart of the land of Israel, and we will not allow
Jerusalem to be redivided," the communique quoted Netanyahu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The communique said Netanyahu also took notice of press
reports that Egypt has recommended Arafat not to declare a
Palestinian state, with its capital in Jerusalem, before the May
elections in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the ministers that these reports come against
the established backdrop of Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
Certain circles in Egypt know that such a declaration by
Arafat would be met with a firm response by the Israeli
government, and these circles may hope for a change of
government in Israel, on the assumption that Arafat will then
be able to create a Palestinian state and divide Jerusalem
without any serious Israeli opposition, he said, adding that it
is important for the Israeli public to be aware of these
intentions.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid Arrives in Famine-Hit Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 833 tons of food aid
Sunday arrived in the famine stricken regions in Somalia, a
spokesman for local communities said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali Meris Mohamed, the spokesman for the Rahanwein
 communities of Bay and Bakol regions in the South, the food
reached the towns of Rabdhurre, Wajid, Dinsor, Qansah Dhere,
Bardaleh and other villages near Baidoa, a southwestern Somali
town.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said that the local and traditional authorities in
those areas have already begun distributing the food aid to their
people.
</P>
<P>
Over 208,700 people will benefit from this round of food aid
which mainly consists of yellow and white maize donated by the
United Nations World Food Program (WFP) . The food aid also
consists of 100 tons of the nutritious porridge known as Unimax
donated by the United Nations Children' s Fund (UNICEF), for the
children in those areas as supplementary food relief.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 Somalis who are suffering from serious food
shortages in the famine stricken regions of Bay, Bakol, Middle
and Lower Jubba regions are yet to have successive food aid
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The convoy of the food aid took eleven days to reach Rabdhurre
town (close to the border with Ethiopia) where famine and lack of
potable water had forced people to flee to neighboring towns and
villages and even across the border to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The food convoy heavily guarded by militiamen took its road
from capital Mogadishu to Bur Hakaba, then turned left from the
tarmac road to avoid the densely mined roads between Baidoa and
Huddor.
</P>
<P>
Rival militiamen from the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and
those of Hussein Mohamed Aidid still continue fighting for control
of those two regions, thus creating havoc for the smooth flow of
the humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Now the local contractors of the food aid delivery operations
have to pay each lorry over 15 million Somali Shillings (nearly
2,000 U.S. Dollars), whereas each lorry would cost them less than
1,000 Dollars if the road had been straight and trouble-free.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, all these difficulties are further making those
remote areas suffer more and more to the point where some people
in those towns have already been showing the symptoms of
malnutrition, swelling in the legs and abdomen, resulting in
subsequent deaths.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the spokesman said, in the town of Randhurre,
five people including two children and a woman died three days ago
and dozens others are on the brink of death due to famine and lack
of potable water.

<HEADLINE> Japan Notifies Moscow of Denials of Reported Interim Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Sunday that Japan
has notified it through official channels that reports on an
interim accord that provides for the transfer of two of the four
Kuril islands to Japan were "without ground."
</P>
<P>
Japan had declared a Yomiuri Shimbun report last Wednesday as
"pure speculation," said Vasili Saplin, a high-ranking official
with the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese Foreign Ministry official asked Moscow to ignore
reports of such kind in the future that are not supported by
official statements of representatives of the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun Wednesday "quoted official sources"
as saying that Tokyo was ready to propose to Moscow a new version
of its plan for the settlement of the decades-old territorial
dispute before the year 2000 by signing an interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
The report said the document would officially acknowledge the
clause of the Joint Soviet-Japanese Declaration of 1956, in which
Moscow promised to transfer to Japan the islands of Habomai and
Shikotan after the signing of a peace treaty between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side has also categorically denied the reported
interim accord over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"All sorts of inventions concerning the territorial problem
which is highly sensitive and far from simple for both parties
are doing no good to bilateral relations," Saplin said.
</P>
<P>
He urged publications to "avoid groundless references to
government agencies, because it disorients official organizations
and creates confusion in their work."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin summoned Japanese Ambassador Takehiro Togo to the
ministry Friday for "a conversation about the status and prosp
ects for Russo-Japanese relations," the Itar-Tass reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed the necessity to regulate problems by
way of gradual improvement of mutual understanding and
agreement.

BEIJING, january 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
recent visit to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, cited the
region's numerous scenic spots and historical sites, and asked it
to expand its tourism industry and to handle overseas Chinese
affairs better.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi needs to increase input in new tourist spots, improve
service, and make an effort to make the region a model in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi also needs to place agriculture high on its economic
development agenda, he said, and to stabilize the Chinese
Communist Party policy on rural work and intensify rural reforms.
It also needs more overseas investment, technical personnel and
technology from other areas and countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi should increase economic, scientific and cultural
contacts with Taiwan and open more channels of investment from
Taiwan, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Trade with Latin America (1) China Increasing Trade With Latin America (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up trade
and investment consultation centers in Brazil and Argentina to
boost trade with Latin America, Wang Zhiquan, who is in charge of
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation's
Sino-Latin American trade affairs, told Xinhua Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The centers are expected to start operating later this year to
link the two huge potential markets and help increase cooperation
with Latin American enterprises, he said. The Chinese government
will encourage enterprises to increase import and export and
investment in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Wang says there is great trade and economic cooperation
potential between China and Latin America since the two sides
complement each other in natural resources, technology and market
demand and have maintained sound political and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Chinese and Latin American enterprises
have tried various forms of cooperation and have gained some exper
ience that could prove useful for future cooperation, he said.

However, he points out that trade with China accounts for less
than 2 percent of Latin America's total foreign trade of some 570
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that because of the Asian financial crisis,
Latin American economies will continue their slow growth this
year and that will certainly have a negative effect on market
demand and investment in China.
</P>
<P>
The level of Chinese investment in Latin America is still very
low and needs to be increased. And, the problem of criticizing
China of dumping goods has not been completely resolved, and to
make matters worse, some Latin American countries have
strengthened their restrictions, all of which hinder the
development of bilateral economic and trade ties, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
He suggests China and Latin America increase trade contacts
and mutual understanding and resolve problems through
consultation to create a favorable environment for cooperation
and that they should explore new forms of economic and trade coop
eration like assembly work and processing.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Takes Guangdong-Hong Kong Soccer Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) - Guangdong were held by Hong
Kong to a 1-1 draw here on Sunday before emerging with a 2-1
victory on aggregate over the two legs to keep the Guangdong-Hong
Kong Soccer Cup six times in a row.
</P>
<P>
Like the first leg, Hong Kong outshot Guangdong 18-10 but they
could not overturn the table.
</P>
<P>
"We got more winning chances than our rival. But my players
missed them because of lack of confidence and teamwork," said
Sebastiao Araujo, head coach from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Host Hong Kong, who were beaten by Guangdong 1-0 a week ago in
the first leg in Guangzhou, got a good start when they were keen
on attacking but their efforts were whitewashed by Guangdong's
magical goalkeeper Gao Jianbin.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw both sides starting more aggressively and
Li Zhifei beat host's goalie Michael C. Leonard easily to put
Guangdong 1-0 ahead in the 10th minute after pacing pass three
defenders and receiving a delicate long pass from teammate Zhao
Changhong.
</P>
<P>
Making two substitutions and more efforts on attacking, the
host totally dominated the rest of the game and finally got a
penalty after fighting forward Hilton A. Assis Geronimo was
tackled down in the box. Defender Martin Kuhl converted the ball
to level the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
The host then created three more winning chances but again were
blocked by stunning Gao Jianbin.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's head coach Zheng Liangyao confessed that the trophy
was not easily gotten, saying the two legs were "fifty-to-fifty
matches."
</P>
<P>
Guangdong were crowned 16 times while Hong Kong captured the
trophy only five in the two-side traditional contest in the past
21 years.

<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Wang Daohan, the president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
reiterated today the importance of conducting procedural
dialogues on political negotiations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities consider holding such a dialogue
difficult for the present, Wang said in an article on the 20th
anniversary of the release of the "Message to Compatriots in
Taiwan", then Taiwan and the mainland should discuss matters that
are beneficial to peaceful reunification and cross-Straits
relations, including through political dialogues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that that the Association will increase
dialogues with its Taiwan counterpart, improve conditions for
procedural political negotiations and promote the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century is approaching and the entire Chinese people
have every reason to believe the Taiwan issue will be solved at
an early date, he said, and urged the Taiwan authorities consider
the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, face the appeals
of people across the Taiwan Straits squarely, and contribute to
the development of cross-straits relations and the reunification
of China.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Realignment Goes on in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The past year saw the realignment
of Middle East countries, based on their strategic considerations,
and in pursuit of their national interests.
</P>
<P>
Most eye-catching was the fast growing political and military
rapport between Israel, Turkey and Jordan, despite the opposition
of most of the Islamic countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, Israel and Turkey, together with the United
States, staged a naval exercise in the Mediterranean Sea, to test
in their words the ability of "search and rescue." This was a
drastic move since the Israel and Turkey clinched a couple of
deals on military cooperation about a year before.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the coalescence, the regional countries mainly
blamed the predominantly Muslim, but politically secular Turkey
for betraying and harming the interests of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Despite their outcry, Jordan, which sit next to Israel and had
been versed in adjusting itself to the changing climate over the
past years, had no hesitation in going ahead with sending its navy
commander as an observer to the drill.
</P>
<P>
This incident underlined the ongoing process of realignment in
the region that had been dreamed for by Israel for years.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state, concerned about its security in the midst of
Arab neighbors, had been pondering whether it can win another
Middle East war without aid from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel has military superiority in the region, its
strategists found the answer to the question was negative. The
small country needed to break the Arab isolation as much as it
desired to have a couple of strategic friends in an otherwise
hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
Turkey proved to be an ideal pal. It was a member of the
Western military bloc; it had loose ties with the Arabs and
strained relations with Iran and Syria, both are Israel's enemies;
and it had a very powerful pro-U.S. military that guarded against
Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, on the other hand, also expected benefit from the
closeness with Israel. Its relations with some European Union
nations marred over a series of disputes, Turkey was eager to be
on better terms with the U.S., as was the case during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Ankara understood that an alliance with Israel was in fact a
coalition with the U.S.. Not only was Turkey assured of Israeli
assistance in improving its military equipment, it now could look
to the U.S. for modern and advanced weapons and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also threw its weight behind a proposed pipeline that
cut across Turkey to bring Central Asian oil and gas to world
markets, although this would prove to be an economically unwise
option compared with routes through Russia or Georgia. This
pipeline could give Turkey less expensive energy, more revenues
and most importantly, a louder say in Central Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Turkey needed U.S. help in solving its problem of
Kurds, who had been fighting for an independent homeland in
southeastern Turkey for more than a decade. There were fears that
U.S. support for the autonomy of Iraqi Kurds would embolden
Turkish Kurds to reaffirm their cause.
</P>
<P>
To Washington, an Israeli-Turkish synergy added a welcome
factor in containing its avowed enemies, such as Iran and Iraq,
and ensuring its interests in the region. Jordan, regarded by the
U.S. as a mild Arab country, was also helpful.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. upped its annual economic aid to Jordan to 225 million

U.S. dollars in 1998 and praised its role in the Mideast peace
process, now being halted again by Israel's hardline prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Most sensitive to the Israel-Turkey-Jordan alliance were their
close neighbors - Iran, Iraq and Syria, who viewed it as being
directed against themselves and a threat to regional security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The alliance would further tip the balance of power in the
region to Israel's favor, they believed. The three countries,
though bitterly at odds with each other over a number of issues,
had tried to patch up sort of common front as a counter-weight.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, who fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in
which about 1 million people on both sides were killed or wounded,
were trying to bury their past. They exchanged prisoners of war
and swapped remained of dead soldiers for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Iran had showed sympathy toward the sanction-stricken Iraq,
opposing U.S. military actions against it and attempts to
disintegrate it.
</P>
<P>
There was a breakthrough in relations between Iraq and Syria,
who sided with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, and the two stopped
trading accusation, shut down radio stations of each other's
oppositions, resumed trade links and economic ties and exchange
high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
Syria said it was willing to reopen an oil pipeline closed
nearly two decades ago to transport Iraqi oil to the Mediterranean,
and prepared to work with Iraq on a new pipeline with a shipping
capacity of 1.4 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Seizing the opportunity to cash in on the new situation, Tehran
had been more active in drumming up support from regional
countries. Its new president, Mohammed Khatami, a moderate cleric,
strived to improve relations with Gulf Arabs, and put this as a
priority of his foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, toured all six member
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council that supported Iraq during
its war with Iran, and eased tensions with them.
</P>
<P>
Its former President Hashemi Rafsanjani visited Saudi Arabia,
the heavy-weight in the region, to restore political relations and
develop economic cooperation. A number of deals were inked, and
the two sides agreed to coordinate in keeping oil prices from
falling, which was unthinkable even a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Iran also tried to mend fences with Egypt, a
prominent figure in the Arab world. Their foreign ministers
exchanged visits and a possible upgrading of diplomatic ties was
in the air.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was too early to say of what the Iran-Iraq-Syria
front would exactly be up to in the future, but surely it
represented a desire and an attempt to make up for the strategic
unequilibrium in the region. Other countries, like Lebanon, Libya
and Sudan, could be supporters of this effort.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East had long been a place of shifting alliance and
recurring conflicts. But the realignment that is in the making
indeed merits due attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry
confirmed Sunday that Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will meet his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa in Tel Aviv on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said Sharon will meet Moussa on Monday in
Tel Aviv, the first between the two in recent years, as planned
and discuss the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is coming to Israel on Monday to participate in a
meeting of the Peres Peace Center board of governors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Moussa did not want to meet Sharon due to
Israel's freeze in the implementation of the Wye peace
accords. Sharon's office issued a statement Saturday, saying and
it was Moussa who has asked for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting of the board of governors of the Peres
Peace Center, slated for Monday in Tel Aviv, will be attended by
former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev, South African
Archibishop Desmond Tutu, former United States Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
The center was set up by former Israeli prime minister Shimon
Peres last year with an aim of enhancing peace in the region
through economic development and cooperation at the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will review the activities of the Center during
its first year of operations and discuss new projects in
technical, agricultural, educational and cultural fields to be
implemented in the future.
</P>
<P>
Peres said last week that the Center has raised about 60
million U.S. dollars in 1998 and the money will be well used in
promoting peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Shahak Busy Campaigning for Israel's Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, new
centrist candidate for the coming early elections of Israel,
Sunday urged the Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to join his
party in a campaign for premiership.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Shahak said that if
Mordechai decided to join his party, he would consider quitting
the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Shahak, former chief of staff of the Israeli military, said
that if Mordechai has a better chance to win the elections
scheduled on May, he would let Mordechai to be the No. 1
slot on the list of the centrist party.
</P>
<P>
Shahak announced his candidacy for prime minister last
Wednesday. And he considered Mordechai an asset to any party
in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Mordechai is an important figure in the ruling
Likud Party and is at odds with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai still does not decide whether to leave the
Likud or not. Sources close to him said that Mordechai is in
no hurry to decide his political future and will probably say
nothing until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shahak Sunday reiterating his stance against
Netanyahu, saying that Netanyahu is dangerous for Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Netanyahu has divided the nation in order
to survive politically.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset (parliament) has passed the third reading of a
motion calling for the dissolution of the Knesset and early
elections last week and the general elections will be held in

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The French Embassy in Zimbabwe
Sunday denied allegations that it is financially supporting
Zimbabwe`s military operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
"France is in no way involved in the events currently taking
place in the DRC and the Great Lakes region, " First Secretary
Sebastien Surun told the Zimbabwe News Agency. "France does not
help in financing the war effort of any of the countries involved
in the conflict in the DRC and renews its calls for a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The French diplomat said that France supports the on-going
efforts of Zambian President Frederick Chiluba to convene a summit
in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
France would be ready to contribute to the establishment of
security guarantees in the Great Lakes region as French President
Jacques Chirac confirmed in his address to the Diplomatic Corps in
Paris on January 7, he added.
</P>
<P>
These comments came in the wake of allegations published on
several occasions in the Zimbabwe's press and in some
international media that the French government was financially
supporting Zimbabwe's military efforts in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Trade with Latin America (2) China Trade With Latin America (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China considers Latin America a major trading partner with its
diversified market strategy, he said. China has 190 enterprises
in Latin America, with an investment of 337 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Sino-Latin American trade ties went through some
great difficulties, he said, and economic growth in Latin
American slowed because of the negative effect of the Asian
financial crisis and falling raw material prices on the
international market, while China's exports felt the pressure of
the Asian financial crisis and the decision not to devalue the
rmb.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Customs, from January to November last
year, trade between China and Latin America was worth 7.53
billion U.S. dollars, a slight drop from the same period of 1997.
Chinese exports increased a bit to 4.83 billion U.S. dollars and
imports were down a fifth to some 2.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wang says that the shrinking imports are the result of
changing demand for Latin American goods, but that economic and
trade relations with Latin America have on the whole maintained a
good development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese economic and trade committees had talks
with Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba and Uruguay and
with the South American Common Market. China also signed
cooperation agreements for trade, transportation, quarantine and
technology with a number of Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> Signs of Fighting intensifying in S. Leone's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Witnesses saw helicopters ferry
scores of wounded soldiers Saturday from Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown to the Lungi International Airport, signalling
intensified fighting in the city, according to reports reaching
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One witness was quoted as saying,"I saw 60 or 70 wounded ECOMOG
(the west African peace-keeping force) men evacuated. They looked
like fresh injuries."
</P>
<P>
Aid workers also reported that counter-attacking ECOMOG troops
moving from their strongholds in the west of the capital city had
taken back some rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that the Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops had
entered the suburb of Brookfields beyond a key bridge which they
had not been able to pass a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Alpha Jet warplanes took off from Lungi Saturday to
pound rebel- held areas.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts estimated that ECOMOG's strength has swollen
to at least 15,000 men after reinforcements were rushed in.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the peace-keeping force backing Sierra
Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah are from the most populous
African country of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer told BBC
radio Saturday that "reinforcements have already started
arriving... fresh troops have arrived in and we have mobilizing
Sierra Leoneans who are prepared to fight against the rebels."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is determined to eject the rebels, said the minister.
But he added that the Sierra Leone government had a dual-track
approach -- dialog allied to military force.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister James Jonah disclosed Saturday that President
Kabbah was ready to meet a key rebel demand by arranging a
face-to-face meeting on neutral terrain between the jailed rebel
leader Foday Sankoh and the field commander of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) Sam Bockarie.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister Amara Essy said Saturday he had
tried to convince Bockarie to accept the seven-day cease-fire
agreement reached between President Kabbah and rebel leader Sankoh
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least four west African governments are now closely involved
in mediation efforts to end the conflict in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped by fighting
in Freetown with electricity and phone lines cut to the outside,
food and water fast running out since early Friday.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed, 7 Injured in Building Collapse in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and seven
others injured in a building collapse early Sunday in Egypt's Giza
Governorate.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead was a 13-year-old boy, police said, without
giving the identities of the other victims. Rescue workers were
trying to reach at least 15 people feared trapped in the rubble,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported two families were
living in the six-story apartment building in Cairo's western Giza
Governorate. But the news agency did not say how many people were
inside the building at the time.
</P>
<P>
The apartment building fell down at about 2:00 am local time
(2400 GMT) due to what witnesses said the apparent damage of its
foundation caused by the ongoing construction of an adjacent
building.
</P>
<P>
Workers have dug some five meters into the earth to lay the
foundation for the new building, they said.
</P>
<P>
The walls of two nearby buildings were damaged by the collapsed
building and their residents have been were evacuated, police said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Al-Akhbar daily said Sunday the police have taken the
construction foreman into custody and are seeking for the owner of
the building.
</P>
<P>
Building collapses are not uncommon in Egypt, where poor
materials and shoddy construction techniques result in weak
structures. Extra floors often are added without proper government
permits.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Meets With Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said Sunday that Uganda treasures the friendly relations
with China and is ready to strengthen cooperation with it in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president made the remarks while meeting with
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan at Entebbe International
Airport, 45 kilometers south of capital Kampala, Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who disrupted his ongoing pilgrimage to former
guerrilla war areas to meet the Chinese minister one hour before
the plane took off, praised China's current foreign policies and
expressed deep admiration for the significant achievements China
has made in economic reforms and social stability.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed heart-felt gratitude to China for the various
kinds of assistance it has provided to his country over the years.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is willing to strengthen its cooperation with China in
all possible fields because it is in the interests of both
nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the bilateral relations between China and Uganda had
entered a new stage with the coming to power of Uganda's National
Resistance Movement and stressed that both sides enjoy more and
more cooperation and mutual support on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
To promote and strengthen relations with developing countries
including African states is a major component of China's foreign
policy, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said China holds that every
country has the right to choose its own direction of development
and political system. Uganda has proved to be one of the
successful stories here.
</P>
<P>
Tang made his two-day maiden visit to Uganda at the invitation
of his Ugandan counterpart Eriya Kategaya. This 12-day
five-nation African tour takes the foreign minister to Egypt,
Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Enqvist Captures Australian Men's Hardcourt Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Thomas Enqvist beat
Australian Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday's final of the Australian
Men's Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist defeated the defending champion Hewitt 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Following his loss of the first set, Enqvist, the second seed,
fought back to easily overrun the 17-year-old in a dream start to
the year after he was sidelined for three months last year after
surgery on his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hewitt, at 16, became the second youngest and
lowest-ranked singles winner in ATP Tour history by climbing over
Scott Draper, Mark Woodforde, Vincent Spadea, Andre Agassi and
Stoltenberg to win the Australian hardcourt championship.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, who will play in the Colonial Classic in Melbourne
this week, said neither he nor Hewitt played their best tennis on
Sunday in the hot, windy condition in Adelaide, but he was
pleased with his more aggressive shot-making in the final two
sets.
</P>
<P>
He said Hewitt, whose next match is against world No.4 Patrick
Rafter in the opening round of this week's Adidas International
in Sydney, had a good future after playing so impressively at
such a young age.
</P>
<P>
The teenager said he was disappointed to have lost the match
after winning the first set, but admitted he tired towards the
end and was awed by Enqvist's serve.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I just wasn't as confident going for my shots
today after the first set, I just went a little bit back in my
shell," said Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
"I think he was serving too well the whole day. I rarely did
get too many easy points off his service game ... and I think
that was the big difference."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon May Be Source of Tension, Says Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel has told the U.S. and
others that Lebanon holds the potential for deterioration of
situations which could impact on the entire region, Israeli defense
minister's spokesman Avi Benayahu said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the local paper Ha'aretz, the spokesman added that
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai does not want escalation, but
all sides must act with caution and Israel cannot tolerate the
recent conduct of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States is worried about a possible
escalation of tensions in Lebanon if Israel launches attacks
against Syrain targets in Lebanon in case Hezbollah, or Party of
God, fire rockets at norther Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross raised the
issue with Israel Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon during their
meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister has also received messages on the
issue from Ross, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker and
U.S. State Department Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs
Martin Indyk, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the U.S. is concerned with how Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will deal with situations in the
region as his government is eager to regain political momentum it
has fallen behind in the polls in face of the possible May 17
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government launched Operation of Grapes of Wrath
against Lebanon on the eve of the 1996 elections.

After a spate of inner cabinet meetings, the Israeli cabinet
issued a statement two weeks ago that it will hit any target in

<HEADLINE> Estrada Reaffirms Peaceful Means With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has assured his country's Muslim leaders of all peaceful
means in dealing with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to a presidential palace statement Sunday, Estrada
made the assurance when Muslim leaders paid a courtesy call on him
here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
While he will not allow any move to divide the country's
territory, Estrada said, he remains committed to pursuing peace
negotiations with the MILF, which is fighting for an independent
Islamic state in Mindanao, the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"As your president, as I have said, I will exhaust all remedies
to have this peace process push through with the MILF, but it's my
sworn duty to protect the constitution and our territorial
integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said that he would not give in to the MILF's
demand for the establishment of an independent Islamic state in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Our constitution and territorial integrity cannot be
compromised to anyone. I hope our brothers from the MILF would
understand this; they should not pursue putting up another state,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF is one of two groups presently holding
peace talks with the Estrada administration. The other is the
National Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF are scheduled to resume formal
peace negotiations in the first week of February.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Intelligence Minister Decides Not to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Intelligence Minister
Qobanali Dorri Najafabadi has reversed his decision to resign
after Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed
foreigners for being behind the serial murders in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister came to the decision after revelations surfaced
that some of his ministry staff members were involved in the
recent murders of Iranian dissidents, Tehran Times on Sunday
quoted an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Najafabadi changed his mind after Khamenei on Friday openly
joined the conservatives' chorus of blaming foreigners for the
murders while praising the Intelligence Ministry for its "brave"
move in exploring the cases.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times said a director general of the Intelligence
Ministry was among those who had been arrested for being involved
in the killings of an opposition leader and several dissident
intellectuals late last year.
</P>
<P>
The source said Khamenei attributed such revelations to
Najafabadi and ordered the findings to be made public immediately.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei pointed the finger at foreigners for being behind the
recent murders even though the Intelligence Ministry on Tuesday
admitted the involvement of its own agents in the killings.
</P>
<P>
Although no sound proof could be produced, the hardline
chieftain told the Friday prayers congregation on the campus of
Tehran University that "I cannot accept that these murders took
place without a foreign scenario behind them."
</P>
<P>
Such comments from the supreme leader provided a strong backing
to Najafabadi at a time when moderate President Mohammad Khatami
had vowed after the revelations to sack him if he did not resign.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Producers Face Overseas Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The competition at home between Chinese rubber producers and
their overseas rivals is expected to heat up this year, while
demand in the Chinese market is unlikely to expand, it said.
</P>
<P>
The expert predicted that rubber imports will top one million
tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Despite the large-scale governmental investment in
infrastructure construction, domestic demand for rubber is still
expected to show weakened growth this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the major rubber consumers, such as motorcycle,
bicycle and car manufacturers, are going through hard times.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's motorcycle and bicycle output tumbled,
while the production of automobiles grew at a low rate.
</P>
<P>
The expert said this year will not bring better prospects for
these industries.
</P>
<P>
High stockpiles have left China's rubber manufacturers
cash-strapped and are expected to further restrain development of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources also told the newspaper that some rubber
manufacturers will have to cut production this year due to the
lackluster demand.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the output volume for synthetic rubber
will reach 600,000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the expert said it was hard to limit the production
of natural rubber. "If the weather is normal, this year's natural
rubber output will exceed last year's level."

<HEADLINE> More Than Six Million Americans Use Internet for Travel Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 6.7 million
American adults have used the Internet for an online service to
make travel reservations in the past year, according to a new
report released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In other words, said the Travel Industry Association of
America in its national travel survey, nine percent of current
Internet users in the country have done that. Travel reservations
include the actual booking and paying for an airline ticket,
hotel room, rental car or package tour.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a telephone survey of 1,200 U.S. adults,
also said that use of the Internet has grown dramatically in the
past two years. The number of travelers who used the Internet for
travel-related and other purposes jumped from 29 million in 1996
to 70 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one-half of all online travelers consulted the
Internet to get information on destinations or to check prices
and schedules.
</P>
<P>
"Americans who enjoy travel seem to love the flexibility and
convenience of the Internet," the association said. "The Internet
is open 24 hours a day and it is right in our homes. It is fast,
interactive and global."
</P>
<P>
If the recent increase in traveler usage is any indication,
the association added, the Internet and online services are "the
travel planning medium of the future."
</P>
<P>
Among the new travel technologies listed in the survey,
travelers mentioned their awareness of satellite navigation
systems in cars used to give directions and maps, electronic
airline tickets, and computer kiosks at airports or hotels.
Electronic passports ranked the lowest in awareness and use,
according to the association.

<HEADLINE> Arabs to Seek Ways of Closing Ranks: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has said that consultations would be conducted among Arab leaders
in the days ahead to look into ways of closing Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
On his way back home Friday night after a brief visit to Syria,
Mubarak told Egyptian reporters the upcoming Arab foreign
ministers meeting would be "a key contribution" to seeking Arab
solidarity, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak paid a lightening visit to Damascus Friday, during
which he conferred with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the
Iraqi crisis, the stalled Middle East peace process and bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has not objected to an Arab ministerial meeting to
discuss the latest development in the Iraqi issue, the Egyptian
leader said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, initially scheduled for December 28, is to deal
with the possibility to convene an Arab summit after a four-day
missile attack on Iraq by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Requested by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, the
meeting was put off to January 24. Iraq has accused Egypt of force
the postponement on behalf of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, sparking a
war of words between Baghdad and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be frank with ourselves. Though (there is) all hope for
a successful summit that helps heal the rift, realities are that
there are lot of differences and wounds that have yet to be
healed," Mubarak stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and threat to attack Saudi
Arabia dealt a fatal blow to the Arab unity. Until now, Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia have not forgiven the Iraqi government and President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
However, Mubarak reiterated Egypt's opposition to military
strikes against Iraq. The U.S. and Britain launched the air raid
on December 16 in what the U.S. said a retaliation for Baghdad's
defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
He further called for Iraq's compliance with the U.N. Security
Council resolutions and a solution to the economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security Council after its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors are responsible for overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a must for the
U.N. Security Council to lift the crippling sanctions.

<HEADLINE> MKO Not Behind Assassination Attempt, Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's outlawed Mujahideen Khalq
Organization (MKO) is not behind an abortive attempt on the life
of head of Tehran province's justice department Ali Razini, Tehran
Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that it is not members of the MKO,
but some "misguided and unbelieving elements inside the country"
, that carried out the abortive attempt.
</P>
<P>
Razini was attacked by two motorcyclists Tuesday afternoon
when he was driving home in downtown Tehran. A 30-year-old
passer-by was killed and five others, including Razini, were
injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the MKO had claimed responsibility for
the failed assassination.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a famous political group which fought against
the Iranian Shah regime before the Islamic revolution in 1979,
but it was outlawed in 1982 due to their political differences
with the mullah regime.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, based in Iraq, launched a series of military
attacks on Iranian interests inside and outside the country
during the past decades.

AMMAN -- Japan called on the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Saturday evening to refrain from unilaterally declaring an
independent state on May 4 as PNA leader Yasser Arafat had
indicated on various occasions.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Masaki Okada said at a

principle, including the right to declare an independent state,
but "it's not wise and is counter-productive to unilaterally use
that right."
</P>
<P>
 Okada also said Japan will ask Israel to stick to all
agreements it signed with the Palestinians, including the
land-for-security Wye River accord, but Japan will also urged the
PNA to "proceed with patience" on the path of peace.

<HEADLINE> Manila Promises Repayment of Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Estrada administration
promised Sunday that it will continue to honor the foreign debts
incurred by its predecessors to maintain the confidence of foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the presidential palace, Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that the government needs to
borrow funds as its still has to go on deficit spending this year
to pump-prime the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Even if our debts were inherited, we have to honor them lest
foreign creditors lose faith in us," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
While the government will spend most of the proceeds of the
loans on pump-priming efforts for the economy, part of them will
go servicing short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the Philippines' foreign debts
amounted to 46 billion U.S. dollars by 1998, about 73 percent of
the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that a 1 billion dollar loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) is coming in next week.
</P>
<P>
Part of the IMF package will go to paying short-term foreign
borrowings to help ease the country's debt burden, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will pay those obligations that are near maturity," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 11 Gunmen Arrested in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police arrested 11
gunmen here Saturday in two operations in which one gunman was
shot and wounded by police when he was trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
In the operations the police recovered two AK-47 rifles, a.375
rifle, two vehicles and more than 50 rounds of ammunition,
according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka province police chief Bernard Mayonda said the wounded
suspect has since been hospitalized in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
He said the suspect was in the company of six other armed men
who were arrested after police raided their hide-out in Chawama on
a tip off from the public.
</P>
<P>
Mayonda said in other incident four gangsters armed with an
Ak-47 file snatched a vehicle from a resident at gun-point at
about 13.00 hours.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen grabbed the vehicle after purporting to have booked
the owner. But on the way they challenged the owner and drove off
in the car.
</P>
<P>
Police, acting from the report, launched a manhunt for the
suspects whom they managed to corner at 15:30 hours near
Zani-Muone Motel, said Mayonda.
</P>
<P>
All the 11 gunmen are being held for further investigation,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Last month the government said it has taken steps to curb
escalating crimes in the country and called on all Zambians to
fully cooperate with the government efforts.
</P>
<P>
There are about 68,000 private guns in this African country
with a comparatively small population of 9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been experiencing in the past months more and more
aggravated robberies, murders, and other serious crimes.

<HEADLINE> 5 Million-Year-Old Fossil Found in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Two reputed anthropolical
researchers said they have disclosed 5 million-year-old fossils of
Homo Sapiens in the Middle Awash of Ethiopia at a place known as
Aldya, government English newspaper "the Ethiopian Herald"
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered on the findings of the 1988 Middle Awash
Palaentopological research at the National Museum of Ethiopia
Friday, Prof. Tim White, an integrative biologist at the
University of California Berkeley, said the discovery was
"extraordinary" and that Ethiopia is blessed to have "such
incredible legacy".
</P>
<P>
Professor White, as research team leader, has worked in
different parts of Africa, including Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi and
Ethiopia since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Birhane Asfaw, a top researcher who has done field works at
sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia for the last 17 years, said
on the occasion that the outcome of last year's research was very
successful and the discovery quite clearly demonstrates Africa is
the true origin of "modern humans".
</P>
<P>
Dr. Birhane pointed out, "in addition to this superb discovery,
another human skull of 2.5 million years old that indicates the
existence of different species of human beings could be
discovered. This is believed to solve long-standing disagreements
among researchers about the stone tools that were discovered
earlier. The final outcome will be issued after two or three
months of further investigation."
</P>
<P>
It was mentioned on the occasion that the last discovery of the
oldest human species was 4.4 million years old. This fossil, named
Ardipithecus Ramides, was also discovered in the Middle Awash of
Afar State.
</P>
<P>
The research which has been conducted for the last 18 years in
this part of the country involved individuals from 12 or 13
countries.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Face Huge Revenue Shortfall in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is most likely to
post a net revenue collection of only 305 billion rupees (6.6
billion U.S. dollars) during 1998-99 fiscal year (July 1 -June
30), facing a huge shortfall in revenue target.
</P>
<P>
The expected revenue is almost 50 billion rupees (1.08 billion
dollars) less than the original budgetary estimate of 354.6
billion rupees (7.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It also indicates a shortfall of nearly 28 billion rupees (543
million dollars) from the agreed benchmark of 333 billion rupees
(7.2 billion dollars) with the International Monetary Fund, the
major English daily, The News, reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the current fiscal year, the Central
Board of Revenue (CBR) had been able to collect 132 billion rupees
(2.9 billion dollars). The revenue performance from July to
December 1998 is short by 1.5 percent as compared to the same
period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As the revenue collection in January and February usually
remains dull, local economists estimate that CBR can manage to
collect only 120 billion rupees (2.6 billion dollars) in the last
four months of 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that slowdown in industrial growth, reduction in
foreign direct investment, containment of annual development
budget and squeeze on public sector spending to contain budget
deficits have contributed further to revenue shortfall.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Tennis Authorities Seek World Rankings Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Improvement in the world
rankings tops the new year agenda for Indonesian tennis,
secretary general of the Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti)
Sugeng Sarjadi revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Pelti would hold 16 senior and 16
junior tournaments to give national talents a chance to boost
their rankings.
</P>
<P>
"Staging competitions at home will not only allow us to save
money, but to reach our goal of boosting the players' world
rankings," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pelti, under new chairman Tanri Abeng, who is also State
Minister for the Empowerment of State Enterprises, is looking for
sponsors for the events, Sugent said.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged economic recession has prevented Pelti from sending
the nation's best players to many international events for almost
a year.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Pelti's promotion and competition affairs Subronto
Laras said the association would bring satellite and challenger
tournaments back to the country after missing out for two years.
</P>
<P>
He said four men's and four women's satellite tournaments and
two challenger events in the men's and women's categories would
be on show this year. A satellite tournament offers 15,000 U.S.
dollars in purse, while a challenger 25,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>

Sugeng, also a renowned businessman, said the association
intended to put 10 males and 10 females in the world's top 100.
Rated 57 on the WTA computer, woman singles player Yayuk Basuki

Things are worse on the men's side, with only Andrian
Raturandang maintaining his ranking in the 800s. His peers have
already been excluded from the top 1,000 due to lack of c

that right."

agreements it signed with the Palestinians, including the
land-for-security Wye River accord, but Japan will also urged the
PNA to "proceed with patience" on the path of peace.

Saturday for a two-day official visit to Jordan as part of his
Middle East tour to bolster Japan's role in the region's peace

Regent Hassan Ibn Talal, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, Foreign
Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib on bilateral ties and the latest
developments in the Middle East process.

He signed with Jordanian Planning Minister Nabeel Ammari an
agreement to extend a soft loan of 63 million U.S. dollars as

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Drug syndicates are engaged in
making Chittagong, the largest seaport of Bangladesh, the main
corridor for drug smuggling, The Independent daily newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Narcotics Control Department (NCD) and the Chittagong
Metropolitan Police (CMP) in their separate reports reportedly
focused on the increase in the number of drug addicts and drug
trafficking terming it "a serious condition," the report said.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 points in the city including hostels and slums,
from where the drug trade was being run, have been identified, the
CMP was quoted as saying in its report to higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
Drug traders were apparently trying to establish new bases in
other parts of the country by changing routes, a senior CMP
official said, adding that the police had seized contraband
medicines used as drugs being brought through courier service.
</P>
<P>
Some political leaders, businessmen, fashion models and film
actors were reportedly involved in the drug trade at the upper
level while hundreds of other people were also involved in the
trade in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over 450 cases were filed and 145 persons were arrested in
connection with drug trafficking in the city last year, disclosed
Assistant Commissioner of the Detective Branch Mia Lutfur Rahman
Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
Drugs entered the city through the seaport, airport and by road
from neighboring countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the slum areas, hotels, restaurants, small shops and
hostels were being mainly used to stock the drugs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The local NCD had filed over 400 cases and nabbed about 300
people in connection with drug trafficking last year.

SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The air traffic volume in the
east China municipality of Shanghai grew by 11.34 percent in 1998

COLOMBO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will stage the first
garment suppliers' exhibition with India, Bangladesh and Pakistan
in October this year to promote South Asia as a regional bloc of
apparel export.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka called on South Asian apparel export companies to
pool in their resources to create a powerful manufacturing sector
and to be better equipped to enter a large regional bloc, said an
official with the Industrial Development Ministry on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official said Sri Lanka will bring in 50 to 60 top apparel
buyers from the developed countries, paying their airfares and
hotel expenses for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the Sri Lankan apparel export industry
need two types of buyers: one, prestigious buyers who purchase
up-market output, intended for expensive supermarkets in the
United States, Europe and Japan; the other, stock lot buyers who
buy mass-produced garments.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters' Institution Prof.
Lakdas Fernando said recently that the South Asian nations have a
great chance of hosting an annual apparel suppliers' exhibition,
which could grow in global importance.
</P>
<P>
A committee headed by Dr. Gamini Corea, former Secretary
General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
had come out with a report on what measures the Sri Lanka apparel
export industry should adopt towards meeting the challenges when
in the year 2005, the Multi Fibre Arrangement is scrapped, and
exports will be on the basis of merit.

prey to various intestinal diseases due to consumption of
adulterated spices which are sold in powdered form in Narsingdi
district, 36 kilometers northeast of Dhaka, said a report reaching

These spices, available in colorful and attractive packets, do

<P>
Nowadays demand for powdered spices, which save the labor of
grinding, has gone up considerably, and the unscrupulous traders
and businessmen have taken full advantage of this preference to
prepare and process these spices in dirty and unhealthy places and
mix them up with all sorts of adulterants and coloring materials
which are not only inedible but also pose as health hazard, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
Local people buy those spices because of low prices, compared

YANGON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A cornerstone has been laid to
build one more resort club hotel on an island in Myanmar's
southern Kawthoung in Tanintharyi division bordering Thailand to
promote the country's hotels and tourism services.
</P>
<P>
The Victorial Entertainment Resort Club Hotel on Yadanakyun
Island, the second one of its kind, will be jointly built by the
Merlion Inter-Trade Co Ltd of Thailand and the Tet Nay Co Ltd of
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The 250-room hotel project will be completed within 30 months,
Myanmar Minister of Hotels and Tourism Major-General Saw Lwin said

<P>
The first 250-room Andaman Club Resort Hotel on Thahtaykyun
Island in Kawthoung was built and opened in 1993 by the Andaman
Club Co Ltd of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Kawthoung is one of Myanmar's four border points with Thailand
to admit tourists into the country and it will also be designated
as a point through which world tourists can travel inland far up
to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The three other entry points are Tachilek, Myawaddy and Phaya
Thonzu.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar initiated an accord with Thailand on cooperation in
tourism last July and later sponsored a travel show in Bangkok in
September, aimed at attracting more tourists from Thailand which
plays a key role in supplying tourists to the country among its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of foreign
tourists visiting Myanmar reached 567,458 in 1997-98 fiscal year,
of which 302,336 entered through border points including those
with Thailand.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The machine building industry
is expected to initiate a package of strategic adjustments to
tackle the sector's deep-rooted problems.
</P>
<P>
The sector is stuck in a dilemma made of high stockpiles and
large-scale imports.
</P>
<P>
A slump in the domestic market has left more than half of the
sector's companies with heavy losses in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"We have no time to wait and see; we must promptly implement
market-oriented restructuring," today's China Daily quoted Zhang
Xiaoyu, deputy director of the State Machine Building Industry
Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the sector would enjoy preferential policies in
terms of loans, taxation and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry will focus on the production of large
and medium-sized buses, heavy-duty special trucks and car
components in the next two years, according to the bureau's
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The country's ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) designates 500
auto-related projects with total investment of 109.1 billion yuan
(13 billion US dollars). Sixty-two of these have gained initial
approval and investment of 73 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, industry experts said that the sluggish auto sales
and weak demand are likely to delay the implementation of some
designated projects.

<P>
IALAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani and Indian officials
held talks Saturday in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, to
finalize modalities for the proposed bus service between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed various matters including fares,
booking of the passengers, night stay for the bus staff,
establishment of booking desks in Lahore and Delhi and protocol
facilities at border, the News Network International reported.
</P>
<P>
A 30-seater air-conditioned bus carrying Indian officials
reached Lahore Friday evening, completing the first phase of the
trial run of the proposed Delhi-Lahore bus service.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bus service between the two South Asian nations
is expected to start later this month though the two governments
have yet to announce the date.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a bus service has been introduced
between India and Pakistan since 1947.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India signed an agreement on the introduction of
the Lahore-Delhi bus service on December 3 as part of
confidence-building measures started last year between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
People from both countries had been visiting each other by air
or through a rail link, which operates once a week.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a Pakistani bus would drop passengers at
New Delhi. The bus would cross the international border at Wahga,
about 22 kilometers from Lahore. Each journey of 494 kilometers
takes about 15 hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) member was arrested Saturday and is being questioned
intensively by police on suspicion of having provoked rioting and
looting in Karawang, West Java, on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senior sergeant BH was seized by police and believed to be the
mastermind of rioting in the West Java town, West Java police
spokesman Lt. Col. Istanto told reporters in Bandung, capital of
West Java province, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"BH claims to be the chief of the veterans administration
section at an ABRI office in Subang (near Karawang) and is now
under tight guard," Istanto was quoted by Antara News Agency
Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two died in gunfire while scores of others were wounded in the
rioting in which hundreds of shops and other buildings were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Istanto said police were detaining about 70 civilians who had
been caught red-handed damaging and looting shops and attacking a
police station.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty of them were tried immediately but the 40 others are
still under intensive examination", he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the situation in Karawang was peaceful on
Saturday but many people were still reluctant to go out. Schools
in the city were still closed. No shops were open on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The unrest, triggered by false rumors about the maltreatment of
a motorcycle-taxi driver by a policeman, also left automotive
showrooms and several cars damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
Security forces were forced to open fire several times to stop
the mass destruction and disperse the mobs.

WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Scottie Pippen, who had a
bad relationship with the Bulls' front office, is willing to
re-sign with the three-time defending champions Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
"Scottie Pippen will be theirs to lose at this points," his

and so if we can work a deal out that works for Scottie, I think
he would like to stay there."
</P>
<P>
Pippen had a back surgery last summer but now he was reported
in good form.
</P>
<P>
"For the last six weeks, he's been playing in Chicago, playing
full-court, full-speed and has been cleared by the doctors to
play," Sexton said. "So he's ready to play a game tonight if he
has to."
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan's agnent David Falk said the best basketball
player still remains out of the country with his family.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Michael makes a decision he's comfortable with."
</P>
<P>
The lockout will not officially end until the agreement
reached Wednesday is put into writing, and training camps are not
expected to open until January 18. All trades and free agent
signings are on hold until then.
</P>
<P>
However, the league agreed Friday to permit teams to negotiate
with player agents immediately.

<HEADLINE> Article Urges More Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A signed article on Sunday's
Business Weekly urged the Government to enhance supervision over
foreign financial sectors in China but lower restrictions on the
entry of overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
Mu Yibin, holder of doctorate from the Graduate School of the
People's Bank of China, said in the article that China should
enhance supervision over the financial sector in the light of the
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the total
assets, outstanding loans and capital inflows of foreign banking
organizations located in China declined in 1998 for the first
time since the country opened its door to foreign banks in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the fallout from the crisis requires Chin
a's financial supervision authorities to keep a closer eye on the
risks lurking in these foreign banking organizations, especially
those from the worst-affected countries.
</P>
<P>
Some wholly-owned foreign banks and joint-venture banks should
be urged to improve their internal management systems since they
are at greater risk due to their small size and limited capital
resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the article said that China should accelerate the
financial opening-up drive and continue to foster an upbeat
environment for foreign investors in 1999, and that the central
bank could consider canceling the restrictions on the location of
foreign banks' outlets in China.
</P>
<P>
The article also suggested the central bank consider lowering
the threshold for the entry of foreign banks' representative
offices, since most countries place few restrictions on the entry
of representative offices of overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better to concentrate on stricter supervision
rather than tough entry requirements," said the article.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a total of 23 cities and one province are open to
foreign banks. By June 1997, there were 540 foreign financial
institutions in China, including banks, insurance companies,
branches of banks, finance companies and investment banks.

<HEADLINE> Pak Exports Decline 12.4 Pc in First Half of 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports declined by
12.4 percent during the first half of 1998-99 fiscal year (July
1-June 30) and the trade deficit witnessed a major decline of 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports is a result of the sanctions imposed by
some western nations after Pakistan's nuclear test in May last
year and the fall in the unit value in the world's open market, an
official source, who requested not to be named, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, however, is surely achieving the target of taking the
trade deficit at zero level by the end of the current fiscal year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Pakistan's exports in the first half
of 1998-99 fiscal year stood at 3.80 billion U.S. dollars as
compared 4.34 billion dollars during the same period in 1997-98
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced its
trade policy in May last year with an aggressive objective to
enhance the exports and to take the trade deficit at zero level.
</P>
<P>
The imports in the first six months of 1998-99 fiscal year also
reduced by almost 20 percent as compared to the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the country's imports stood at
4.39 billion dollars in the first half of the current fiscal year
as against 5.47 billion dollars in the same period in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government decided to reduce imports after the
sanctions to save its foreign reserves and the same policy is
expected to be followed in future to meet the target to take trade
deficit at zero, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade deficit during the first half of 1998-99
declined by 47 percent as it stood at 594 million dollars compared
to 1.13 billion dollars during the same period in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident to enhance the country's exports during the
remaining six months of the current fiscal year at one billion
dollars to take the trade deficit at zero," the source added.

<HEADLINE> Liu Beats Waldner for Chinese Clean Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang outplayed world champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden in
the semi-finals of ITTF Pro-Tour finals here on Saturday for a
Chinese clean sweep of the 1-2 places in the all four events.
</P>
<P>
Liu's 21-16, 21-12, 18-21, 21-19 victory over Waldner, the
only non-Chinese survivor till the current stage of the
tournament, came after another Chinese triumph which saw Li
Ju/Wang Nan clinching the women's doubles title from their
teammate Cheng Hongxia/Wang Hui.
</P>
<P>
Liu will vie against his compatriot Wang Liqin, who dismissed
former world champion Kong Linghui--yet another Chinese--21-6,
21-17, 21-14, for the men's singles final, while the women's
singles final will be an all-Chinese affair between Asian Games
gold medallist Wang Nan and her teammate Lin Ling.
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles gold is also in the Chinese pocket, with Ma
Lin/Qin Zhijian playing Sunday's final with their teammates Wang
Liqin/Yan Sen.
</P>
<P>
Liu celebrates his 23rd birthday on Sunday in a best possible
way by snatching his fifth victory out of five encounters against
Waldner, the game's legend who is the only player in the world to
complete all major titles in table tennis, including world
championship, Olympics and world cup.
</P>
<P>
The Swede recovered to take the third set after handing out
the first two and was leading 19-16 before Liu won the next five
points on Waldner's service to kill his hopes of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
"I am on the same level with Waldner and I think I was a
little bit more in-form than he in today's match," Liu said
afterwards.
