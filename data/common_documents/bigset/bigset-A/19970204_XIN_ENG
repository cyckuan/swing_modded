<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- King Juan Carlos of Spain will
visit Egypt on February 17-18 in a bid to enhance the ever closer
trade ties between the two countries, the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish monarch, to be accompanied by a big business team,
will hold talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the promotion of
economic, investment and trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They will also probe the developments of the Mideast peace
process and the European role in pushing ahead the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish king will attend an economic symposium on prospects
for the expansion of trade exchange and joint investments in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the idea of setting up a joint council that
groups business people in Egypt and Spain can be floated.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have signed several agreements to organize
economic, technical and industrial cooperation and encourage and
protect investments.
</P>
<P>
Essam Farrag, first undersecretary at the Egyptian Ministry of
Trade, said the two countries signed an agreement on economic and
industrial cooperation in March 1991, agreement on investment
protection in November 1992 and an agreement to avoid dual
taxation.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade exchange between the two countries reached
796 million Egyptian pounds (about 234 million U.S. dollars) in
1993, it rose to 988.9 million pounds (290.8 million dollars) in
1994 and took another leap to hit 1.16 billion (341 million
dollars) in 1995, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 533 million pounds (157 million dollars) of
commodities to Spain against 626 million pounds (184 million
dollars) of imports in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main exports to Spain include oil and textiles, while the
imports are basically tires, spare parts, meat, filters and
telephone wires, he noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Final Constitution Puts into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's final
Constitution, which marked the end of apartheid era in law, is
due to come into effect at midnight today.
</P>
<P>
The latest constitution replaced the interim one under which
South Africa had been governed since the inception of the first
democratically elected parliament in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
The new document, which reaffirmed South africa as a
constitutional and republican state, was drawn up by the
Constitutional Assembly, consisting of parliament members and
senators.
</P>
<P>
The constitution's approval by the constitutional Court last
December marked the end of negotiations which started in earnest
after Nelson Mandela's release from 27-year political
imprisonment on February 11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
All parliamentary parties participated fully in the
constitution-making work, except the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP),
which walked out Half-way when promises of international
mediation were not met.
</P>
<P>
The IFP, a leading political organization in Kwazulu Natal
Province, is the sole major party besides the ruling African
National Congress to hold posts in the Government of National
Unity.
</P>
<P>
The first major event under the new constitution will be the
inauguration on Thursday of the National Council of Provinces
(COP), which replaces the Senate.
</P>
<P>
COP is designed to provide representatives from nine provinces
throughout the country with more opportunities to express their
suggestions and opinions at parliament level.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela is reportedly to open
the first parliamentary session under the new constitution at a
joint sitting of the National Assembly and COP on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Interest Rates May Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The government-owned Zimbabwe
Financial Holdings Limited (ZIMBANK) today warned interest rates
which had started to soften might rise again due to anticipated
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
ZIMBANK Chairman Albert Nhau said the major threat to efforts to
contain interest rates is the government's inability to reduce
spending, a perennial problem since market reforms were launched six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nhau said in a statement reviewing the bank's performance the
market expected inflationary pressures to remain, and that interest
rates would start to rise soon.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation rate reached nearly 14 percent
last December, compared with over 28 percent in 1995, while nominal
interest rates exceed 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government pledges to pursue a restrictive monetary
stance to reduce monthly inflation to 17 percent by mid-year, local
economists said the objective would remain elusive as long as
recurrent expenditure remains high.
</P>
<P>
the government, which is facing a serious cash crisis,
intends to cut the budget deficit to 8.5 percent of GDP in the year
to June 1997, but with last year's civil servants' salary increases
and payment of bonuses, the deficit is expected to soar to over 11
percent, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum Launches Global Visual Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic
Forum (WEF) launched here today its new global visual network,
WELCOM (World Electronic Community).
</P>
<P>
"WELCOM was designed to vastly extend the WEF's mission to
facilitate high-level, personalized, high-value-added interaction
among global leaders," WEF President Klaus Schwab said at a
ceremony to unveil the first commercial visual network in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The central theme this year at Davos is `Building the Network
Society', and WELCOM is a direct reflection of the forum's
commitment to help enable its members to positively shape the
direction and influence the impact of this rapidly emerging
society on a global basis," Schwab said.
</P>
<P>
The WEF set up its own development center, Advanced Video
Communications, in late August, 1995 in Burlington, Massachusetts
of the United States. With a fund of five million U.S. dollars and
help from several WEF partner companies like Dell Computer
(desktop computers), Intel (videoconferencing) and Shiva
(terminals and routers), WEF succeeded in developing the brand-new
global visual network.
</P>
<P>
The WEF will provide for the first time its community of global
leaders from business, government and academia with a "secure,
private, high-level and reliable" global visual communications
network, according to a WEF press release.
</P>
<P>
The electronic community will be formed basically by the WEF's
1000 companies worldwide and the WEF hopes to expand it.
</P>
<P>
"WELCOM transcends the barriers of space and time and allows
members to hold visual and interactive sessions at any time during
the year from wherever they are in the world," said Schwab.
</P>
<P>
The new system is said to enable WEF members to open up new
business opportunities, facilitate expanded commerce, joint
ventures and strategic alliances, and enhance global business and
government understanding.
</P>
<P>
The system uses the same protocol that Internet uses, but the
audio and video files are fragmented over fast digital ISDN
telephone lines. Only registered users within its Intranet can
have access to the files. Common Internet users cannot have access
to the Intranet while WELCOM users are still able to login
Internet servers.
</P>
<P>
Some of the services WELCOM offers are multi-point
video-conferencing both with WELCOM and non-WELCOM members, a
24-hour multilingual concierge service, crisis management support,
direct face-to-face counseling with world experts and
organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Under pressure from Republicans in Congress and in their
ranks, leaders of the National Governors' Association called for a
restoration of public assistance for elderly and disabled
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- An international arbitration decision due withing days on
whether Brcko, a key city of north Bosnian, will remain in Serb
hands or revert to Muslim control, or end up in some other hybrid
arrangement has stirred threats of renewed war from ethnic group
leaders and prompted U.S. military forces to gird for the worst.
</P>
<P>
-- As President Clinton prepared to unveil his proposed 1998
budget, administration officials began promoting plans for a $98
billion tax cut over five years, targeted primarily at families
raising children and students going to college.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign companies invested 71.8 billion dollars in U.S.
operations during the first nine months of 1996. When the fourth

billion dollars posted in 1995.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Says Economy Will Grow Steadily This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinhua, minister in charge
of China's State Planning Commission, said that the country's
economy will maintain its rapid and steady development trend this
year, but there will be changes that will improve the quality and
efficiency of that growth.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed to China's marked achievements in its
macro-economic policy in the past few years, that led to rapid
economic growth and the effective checking of inflation.
</P>
<P>
He urged all related departments to take advantage of the
favorable economy by stepping up reforms of state-owned
enterprises and restructuring the economy, both of which are
important tasks this year.
</P>
<P>
The fairly tight financial and monetary policies will remain
intact this year to consolidate and build on the achievements made
over the past three years in bringing down the high inflation
rate, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen went on to say that public hearings will be held on prices
for goods and projects that are closely associated with the
people, and he urged government departments to make a greater
effort to check up on price increases, which should be lower than
the inflationary rate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To solve existing problems in the economy, Chen proposed the
following for 1997:
</P>
<P>
1. Examining and approving new projects in a stricter way, and
not approving projects that will lead to surpluses.
</P>
<P>
2. Strengthening and improving administration of investment
planning, publicizing the "Investment Law" at an early date, and
standardizing investment behavior to make it accord with laws.
</P>
<P>
3. Improving state indutrial policies, and developing promising
industries and special economies.
</P>
<P>
4. Supporting development of a number of enterprise groups that
are competitive on the world market, and annexing or shutting down
backward enterprises.
</P>
<P>
5. Giving priority to information work in order to reduce
blindsided investment policy-making.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approval of New Projects Near 1 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- New investment projects worth
about 950 million U.S. Dollars were approved in 1996, the
Zimbabwe Investment Center (ZIC) said today.
</P>

to revive a stagnant economy were launched in the country.
</P>
<P>
ZIC Director Nicholas Ncube said the increase in investment
approvals during 1996, with over 90 percent of them being new
projects, reflected the success of promotion activities
undertaken during the year, during which numerous domestic and
foreign road shows were held.
</P>
<P>
According to ZIC, last year it approved a total of 415
projects, the bulk of whom are in the mining and tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
The projects approved are expected to generate foreign
exchange earnings of 226 million U.S. Dollars annually, ZIC said.
</P>
<P>
On aggregate, Britain had the largest number of projects
approved in all the main sectors, followed by South Africa,
German and the Netherlands. Nut Australia had the single largest
investment, which was in the mining sector, and was valued at
about 326 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Lobbies for Regional Trans-shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
intensified its efforts to lobby the World Bank to choose it,
instead of Cote d'Ivoire, as the projected trans-shipment center
for the west and central African region.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said the World Bank had in 1996 raised a
team of maritime and financial experts to study the maritime
environments of both countries before making the decision.
</P>
<P>
The selected country will receive all vessels bound for
countries in west and central Africa from where cargoes will be
ferried by smaller vessels to their final destinations.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said compared with Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria
could be a more natural choice as it has larger volume of
maritime activities, vast expanse of coastal areas, enormous and
sophisticated port facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, critics said the government's neglect of the maritime
industry could lead to the failure of its bid.
</P>
<P>
They also lamented the "decadent state" of the infrastructure
and equipment in Nigeria's ports.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Pak 1997 Elections Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 general elections in
Pakistan proceeded largely in a peaceful manner except for
scattered incidents of violence.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Interior Ministry said tonight that barring a
few incidents, including three casualties, Pakistan witnessed
peaceful elections under the tight security umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has deployed more than half a million
security personnel, including armed forces, police and
para-military forces, across the country for the maintenance of
law and order situation on the day of polling for both national
and four provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel manned around 36,000 polling stations across
the country to see the nine-hour polling process sail through
smoothly. The polling which started at 7 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m.
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive areas remained a focal point of security
arrangements and special efforts were made at such points to avert
any untoward incident.
</P>
<P>
During the whole polling process, one casualty was reported
from the southern port city of Karachi where an activist from the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement was killed in a clash. Two more casualties
were reported in the North West Frontier Province as a result of
scuffles between the rival groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, vote counting which started after the close of
polling at 4 p.m. is still underway and the announcement of
preliminary results is expected at midnight.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Election Commission Fakhre Alam told the media
after witnessing polls in the four provincial capitals that the
Election Commission has fulfilled its task of holding free,
impartial and transparent elections.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign of rigging in today's polling," the chief
election commissioner said, adding that "the creditability of the
elections is beyond any doubt."
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said partial results of the votes show that
the Pakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif is leading in the
elections, and Nawaz Sharif is expected to be the next prime
minister of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said after casting vote in his constituency in Lahore
that, if elected, he would concentrate on revitalizing the
national economy which, he believes, is in a bad shape.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, the deposed prime minister and chairperson of
the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), cast her vote in her ancestral
constituency Naudero in Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
Benazir expressed her apprehensions that the voter turnout
would be low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Altaf Hussain, the exiled leader of powerful Mohajir
Qaumi Movement (MQM), has indicated in his message from London
that his party might join the future government if an agreement is
reached between MQM and the party emerging victorious in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) this time fielded the highest number of candidates
both for the national and provincial assemblies followed by the
PPP and the Pakistan Tereek-e-Inssaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan,
former captain of the national cricket team.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) put up a total of 178 candidates for the National
Assembly, while the PPP and PTI fielded 163 and 132 candidates
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The MQM, which dominates the political scene in urban Sindh,
has a total of 138 nominees including 51 for the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the 1997 general elections are 53 political
parties and 902 independents. The elections are the fourth since
the lifting of martial law at the end of 1985.
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant aspects of the elections is that
adult residents from the tribal areas, officially known as the
Federal-Administered Tribal Areas, have been given franchise for
the first time since the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that elections for the national and
provincial assemblies are held on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pakistani women have shown unprecedented enthusiasm
in the elections this time. They are trying their luck in the
direct contest, throwing gauntlet in as many as 36 constituencies
on general seats.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari has said that the power of transfer
will be within days in a smooth way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid has
urged the political parties to accept the results of the election
in the spirit of democracy and as a mandate from the people.

<HEADLINE> More UK Children with Working Mothers Fail at School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Children with full-time working
mothers in Britain are twice as likely to fail examinations as
those whose mothers work part-time, according to a research
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study of 600 families in east London by North London
University shows that children with both parents working full-time
perform worse at school than their peers, despite the benefits of
a dual income.
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent of children with mothers in part-time work left
school without passing any exams and with no certificates.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure more than doubled to 25 percent among
children whose mothers had full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
Professor Margaret O'Brien, who carried out the research,
described the results as "disturbing", and identified a "critical
time" immediately after school when children return home and want
to talk through their day.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no body to talk to, they become uninterested in
school and this results in lower performance," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, some children's groups disagreed with the findings and
its methodology, saying that "there may be other factors involved"
as there was a very strong link between poverty and poor
performance.
</P>
<P>
They said that if children did not have the conditions at home
to study, they may do badly.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says Direct Negotiations on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- There is little hope for
direct negotiations on the Cyprus issue between leaders of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island, a government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides made the remarks after a second meeting
held here on the Cyprus issue between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and U.N. Secretary-General's special representative for
Cyprus, Han Sung Joo.
</P>
<P>
"We are not anywhere near a direct meeting between President
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, which would
create hope for success," Cassoulides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arriving here last Wednesday to shuttle between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities on the divided island for a direct
negotiation, Han had held a meeting with Denktash, and is expected
to have a third and final meeting with Clerides before leaving
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said during the meeting with the Cypriot president,
Han did not convey Denktash's views to the president. "Therefore I
cannot say that there is any progress at this stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "interesting," Cassoulides said no
new U.N. proposals were put forward.
</P>
<P>
Han said after today's meeting that the U.N. is concentrating
on an overall settlement on the Cyprus issue, and the next step
will be for the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to invite the
two communities' leaders for direct talks.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the U.N. is currently conducting proximity
talks," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted that President Clerides had pointed out to
Han that there could be no common ground between the positions of
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides if the Turkish side insisted
on the views expressed in a joint declaration singed last month by
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Turkish Cypriot leader
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The declaration reportedly aims at improving ties between
Turkey and the self-claimed "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus",
and threatens the southern Greek Cyprus with military and
political measures.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
The Turkish Cypriots then established the republic, which only
gained recognition by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Rejects Idea of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today turned down an idea of Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied "security zone" in south Lebanon,
according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai argued that a unilateral withdrawal will bring the
Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah and terrorism to the border
fence and disrupt the normal life of northern Israeli residents.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks when he was addressing a Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session. He
criticized some cabinet ministers, Minister of Public Security
Avigdor Kahalani in particular, for making statements in favor
of an Israeli pullout from the "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, who is also an army general, was quoted in the
Hebrew daily Ma'ariv today as calling for a universal Israeli
withdrawal because too many soldiers have been killed in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the Israeli troops have turned into moving
targets for Hezbollah. Kahalani was reacting to the latest
Hezbollah attack in which three Israeli soldiers from a elite
unit were killed last week. Dozens of Israeli soldiers were
killed in south Lebanon last year.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said that the army should pull out and let an
international force take over the area.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, Labor Member of Knesset, also called for a
universal Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told reporters after the Knesset session that "I
don't think there are any international forces that can come to
southern Lebanon and to do the mission of the Israeli forces
and the South Lebanon Army."
</P>
<P>
"It is our responsibility. We have our troops and our mission
and we will continue to carry on our national mission to secure
our population in the northern area as well as in other parts of
Israel," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a large-scale invasion into Lebanon in June
1982 and it established an 850-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 under the pretext of safeguarding the
Galilee area, north Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has repeatedly demanded that Israel
withdraw from the occupied territory in accordance with the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek police said today that a
well-known international criminal and wanted Russian mafia gang
leader was found dead in Greece.
</P>
<P>
His body, showing signs of strangulation, was found in the
Athens suburb of Variboby on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to police, 35-year-old Alesandr Solonik was planning
to go to Italy in the next few days to carry out the contract
killing of a prominent businessman.
</P>
<P>
Citing information received from colleagues in Russia, the
police added that Solonik was a professional hit man who performed
contract killings for enormous sums of money in various countries.
</P>
<P>
They also revealed that six Russian officers had been working
with the police here to arrest Solonik, after Interpol alerted the
authorities to the fact that the Russian fugitive was in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Solonik, reportedly escaped from a Moscow prison in 1995, was
wanted in his home country in connection with the killings of four
police officers and the wounding of a fifth.
</P>
<P>
The police also revealed that they had found the body after
receiving an anonymous tip-off.

NEW YORK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- CD-based Apple Computer INC.,
one of the largest companies for personal computers worldwide, is
planning substantial layoffs due to its depressed market, the New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although the struggling company has not indicated how much it

<P>
Under the restructuring plan expected to be disclosed this

For the quarter ended December 31, the company reported a loss
of 120 million U.S. dollars, compared with a loss of 69 million U.S.
dollars in the period a year earlier. Revenue was down 32 percent,

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Agree to Set Up Stability Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France have agreed
to establish a powerful economic institution to protect the coming
European single currency Euro due to be launched on January 1
1999, according to a report in today's Independent newspaper.
</P>
<P>
After months of secret negotiations, France and Germany have
hammered out agreement on a "stability council" to govern the
Euro-zone, senior German government officials told The
Independent.
</P>
<P>
Under the Franco-German agreement, both sides have pledged that
no formal announcement on the shape of the council will be made
until near the launch of the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Only countries who join the EMU will be qualified to be members
of the stability council, which seems certain to become the most
powerful economic club in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Britain would probably be excluded from the council and
therefore deprived of influence over key EU economic decisions if
London stays outside the European single currency, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke
was reported as saying that he was "wary" of any plan for a

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
decided today to meet Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori over the
hostage crisis in the Peruvian capital of Lima.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the White House indicated that there might be no
meeting between the two presidents as Washington took a low-key
posture on the hostage issue.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman Mike McCurry said today that "some
diplomatic contacts" on Sunday persuaded the administration that a
low-key meeting between the presidents, which will occur today,
would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meeting scheduled for today between U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Fujimori was canceled.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived in Washington on Saturday to attend an
international gathering on small business loans after a meeting
with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Toronto on the
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, about 20 rebels seized the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima, where a cocktail party was
holding, and took more than 500 guests as hostages, demanding the
release of hundreds of their jailed comrades. The rebels are now
still holding 72 hostages.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM: Israel Could Resort to War Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz warned today that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu could resort to something like war against Lebanon and
Syria after signing the Hebron agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Milhem Karam, chairman of the Lebanese
Journalists Association, the foreign minister accused Netanyahu
of "believing in a partial and security peace" with Israel's Arab
neighbors rather than a just and comprehensive one.
</P>
<P>
Karam told reporters that Boueiz said Lebanon and Syria
constitute today a "decisive element" in the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli government and the Palestinian National
Authority signed the Hebron agreement on January 15, Lebanese
leaders have feared that the Jewish state would use the
agreement as a tool for exerting pressure on Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether Israel would launch a war
against Lebanon and Syria, the Lebanese foreign minister said
that the Israeli prime minister "could resort to something like
this" after the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described the atmosphere as "convulsive." He said that
by the escalation of hostilities against Lebanon and Syria,
Netanyahu would seek to "impose his positions and justify
proposals which can not be justified in other ways."
</P>
<P>
After taking power last June, Netanyahu, who is also the
leader of Israel's right-wing Likud party, put forward a
"Lebanon first" proposal, in an apparent attempt to lure Lebanon
into separate peace talks with the Jewish state without holding
together with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was categorically rejected by Lebanon, which
said that the proposal was aimed at "driving a wedge between
Lebanon and Syria."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu does not believe in the just and comprehensive
peace, but believes in a partial and security peace in Gaza,
Hebron and Lebanon," the foreign minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Netanyahu's mind, "the peace will expose Israel and
explode ethnic differences in that country, and the peace will
exempt the United States from providing assistances to Israel
and this is not wanted by Netanyahu," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon and (Syrian) President Hafez al-Assad constitute today
the decisive element in the Arab conflict with Israel," said the
Lebanese foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Turns Lagos Flights to Accra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Poor visibility caused by bad
weather in Nigeria's major city of Lagos has forced four airlines
to divert their flights to Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Egyptair, Swissair, Alitalia and Belview flew their passengers
planes whose destination were Lagos, to Accra, while some
infuriated passengers took the air crew hostage, according to a
report from the Ghana News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Hazy weather conditions across west Africa at this time of the
year make visibility very poor, which was reported to be partly
responsible for a plane crash in northern Nigeria last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, passengers aboard an Egyptair flight heading for
Lagos, could not understand why they were flown to Accra. As a
result, they held hostage of the 16 crew members including the
pilot for three hours in protest.
</P>
<P>
The passengers said they were angry because the pilot failed
to inform them that their flight, which had taken off from Cairo
and stopped in Kano, northern Nigeria, could not land in
Nigeria's southern city of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
They turned down the plea of the crew and the Egyptair Accra
manager to disembark and left the plane only after Ghana's
security officials finally persuaded them not to do so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Nigerians, worried over the bad weather, have
temporarily suspended their air trips to other cities or chose to
travel by land.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Launched in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day nationwide
strike was held in Swaziland today to demand the legitimacy of
political activities in the land-locked southern African country,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the strike was held amid a strong presence of
security force in Swaziland's capital of Mbabane and the
commercial center of Manzini.
</P>
<P>
The strike, organized by the Swaziland Federation of Trade
Unions (SFTU), was aimed at forcing the government to lift a
24-year-old ban on political parties in the mountain kingdom,
said the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The strike followed the weekend arrest of four SFTU leaders,
including its Secretary-General Jan Sithole.
</P>
<P>
The police and the security forces guarded important sites,
such as the National Television and Radio Stations, and power
stations in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business activities in the two cities and
production at three major sugar companies in the eastern part of
the kingdom also came to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties have been banned by a loyal decree in 1973.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the South African government expressed
its concern about the arrest of SFTU leaders and asked the Swazi
government to reconsider its decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Could Run
Out of Water within 20 or 30 years if the current level of
consumption continues unrestricted, Water Affairs and Forestry
Minister Kader Asmal warned today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein, Asmal said South
Africa's capacity for social and economic development would be
seriously affected by the prospect of water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said his ministry is therefore reviewing the country's
current legislations on water issues and would soon start to
develop a national water management strategy to deal with the
issue.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, a new water pricing policy is expected to be
in operation in the near future, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that irrigation sector of South Africa's
commercial farming in some provinces, especially the Free State
Province, would be affected by the new measures.
</P>
<P>
However, Asmal assured that the Free State would not be
deprived of its water resources if water is transferred from
Orange River to the Vaal Dam, a major water supplier of Gauteng
Province.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent study showed that there is more than enough
water available in the Orange River to meet the increasing demand
of all towns in the province, which are currently supplied from
this River.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa imposed temporary punitive water
tariff on residents in big cities such as Greater Johannesburg
owing to a short water supply of the Vaal Dam.

<HEADLINE> Colombia University Develops Video Camera Offering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at New York-based
Colombia University have developed a video camera system that can
produce a 360-degree view, according to a report of the New York
Times today.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of a miniature video camera that is aimed
at a parabolic mirror, a small inverted cup of polished metal
enclosed in a transparent hemisphere. Although the camera sees
multiple images all around it, every ray of light passes through a
single point to reach the camera lens. That means that, even
though the total picture that appears on screen is a distorted
sphere, the camera in fact has captured the information for a
linear, undistorted view of each segment.
</P>
<P>
The system makes it possible that every attendee in a
teleconference, whether a few feet or a thousand miles away, can
use a computer mouse to "move" around the main conference room,
stopping at each participant's face or zooming in on notes being
taken.
</P>
<P>
The university has applied for a patent on the camera and
software. And it currently takes in more than 40 million U.S.
dollars a year from some 250 licensing agreements for various
technologies.

TEHRAN -- Iran announced today that it has signed contracts
with Ukraine and Russia for manufacturing 240 Antonov-140
aircraft at a cost of 196 million U.S. dollars between 1997 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Roads and Transportation Akbar Torkan said Russia
and Ukraine each would buy 80 of these airplanes which will be
manufactured in Iran.

<P>
CAIRO -- The first batch of Egyptian exports of medicines to
Iraq will be delivered later this month in line with a
three-million-U.S.-dollar contract signed between the two
countries here in January.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported today that
several Iraqi trade delegations plan to visit Egypt shortly to
strike fresh deals with the Egyptian public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 countries and regions have offered to sell food
and medicine to Iraq suffering from six years of international
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq has struck 13 contracts with about 20 companies
for exporting oil under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, which allows
Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil over a span of six
months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will use 1.2 billion dollars to purchase food, medicine
and other daily necessities, which are much less than the 8 billion
dollars it used to buy food and medicine every year before the U.N.
sanctions imposed after its invasion upon Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Partitioning of Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today reaffirmed its
rejection of any partitioning of Sudan and urged Khartoum to
reexamine its relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that however severe
the differences are between Cairo and Khartoum, Egypt would not
side with any party against another in Sudan, the Egyptian MENA
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In statements in Davos, Switzerland, where he attended the
World Economic Forum, Moussa ruled out any help by Egypt to Sudan
in the present circumstances, but he said that Egypt is against
any measure that would aggravate the difficult living conditions
of the Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has repeatedly stressed this stance in the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, which Egypt has accused of involvement in the failed
assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak's life in Addis
Ababa in 1995, has poor relationship with Egypt, has recently
appealed to its northern neighbor for political support.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister called upon the Sudanese
government to "reconsider its policies vis-a-vis its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He said Khartoum was, from time to time, having disputes with
Tunisia, Algeria and Saudi Arabia and, today, it has differences
with Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused the last three neighbors of sponsoring
opposition attacks against the government along border areas in
the past three weeks. But these countries have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of Sudanese opposition forces began attacking
Sudanese army units along the eastern border of Sudan last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sudan said that it has never officially accepted any
peace initiative or invitation from any country to hold a dialogue
with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Taha said today that any
talk now about dialogue with the opposition is an out-of-place
effort because Khartoum's fight is against foreign countries that
have attacked Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Taha added that there is actually an open and continued
dialogue between the government and the opposition to seek a
formula of understanding to protect the country's interest.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Ng Fung Hong, the largest
food supplier in Hong Kong, is making every effort to ensure a
prosperous food market during the Lunar New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
As early as a month ago, the company was making preparations
for a good holiday supply for the 600 million Hong Kong residents,
 the general manager of Ng Fung Hong, Wang Wangheng, told Xinhua

</P>
<P>
Being the sole agent of mainland food in Hong Kong for several
decades, the company supplies 95 percent of fresh pork, all the
beef, 80 percent of poultry and 50 percent of vegetables of the
local market, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Three express trains transporting fresh food from the Chinese
mainland to Hong Kong are running normally and the timetable for
the arrival of a rich assortment of fresh food has been worked
out, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Daily local market supply is followed carefully by the company
so that it can decide on the volume of food supply for the
following day, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang added, a large number of pigs are being stocked
 in Shenzhen, the Chinese city bordering Hong Kong, ready to serve
 the local market at any time.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Shut Down Nuclear Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 4 (Xinhua)-- Sweden on Monday agreed to
begin pulling the plug next year on its 12 nuclear power plants
which currently supply nearly half the country's electricity.
</P>
<P>
The move comes nearly two decades after the passage of a
referendum demanding an end to atomic power, and after growing
pressure from environmentalists and neighboring Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The Danes, worried about a nuclear catastrophe, have been
lobbying for the closure of the plants.
</P>
<P>
According to press here today, the governing Social Democratic
Party, Center Party and the Left Party reached an agreement to
first shut down the privately-run reactor at the Barsebaeck power
station in Kavlinge, about 40 kilometers east of the Danish
capital Copenhagen, or the state-owned Ringhals reactor, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Another will be taken out of service by 2001, but plans for the
closure of the other 10 reactors are not yet known.
</P>
<P>
During a transitional period the loss of energy caused by the
closure of the reactors will be compensated for by the use of oil
and gas imports from Denmark. The cost of changing over to other
sources of energy is expected to amount to some 1.5 billion
Swedish kronor (328 million U.S. dollars) a year over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors are clustered into four power
stations, which produce nearly half the country's
electricity. Almost all of the remaining power comes from
hydroelectric plants.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats see the agreement as fulfilling a
long-deferred desire of the Swedish people, because in 1980 a
majority of voters supported the phasing out of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Minister of Industry Anders Sundstrom described the
three-party agreement as " a very responsible and good agreement."
</P>
<P>
But the agreement also brought sharp criticism from Sweden's
powerful timber industry lobby, which relies heavily on cheap
nuclear power, and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Percy Barnevik, chairman of the board of Swiss/Swedish
electrical engineering group ABB, said that the government plan is
"unfortunate and wrong."
</P>
<P>
Lars Tobisson, parliamentary leader of the conservative
Moderates, the largest opposition party, said "The decision is
economically and environmentally insane."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who is recovering from double pneumonia, and Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin held an hour-long working meeting today in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
reporters that the meeting was mainly over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chernomyrdin briefed the president on his
attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, then
the two leaders discussed Russia-NATO relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin gave orders to Chernomyrdin for Wednesday's trip to the
United States for the eighth meeting of the Russian-American
commission on economic and technological cooperation which is
co-chaired by the Russian premier and U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said the Russian delegation would offer the
meeting a cooperation program up to the year 2000, focused on
gearing up U.S. direct investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president reaffirmed his concern about Europe's new
security set-up and NATO's eastward expansion plan on the eve of
Chernomyrdin's trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two men also discussed domestic problems, including the
budget deficit and the need to pay back wages and
pensions. Yeltsin said the orders he had issued to the emergency
budget and tax commission last December remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The president said that pensions must be paid regularly from
February 1 and all government debt cleared by July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy: Distrust, Largest Obstacle of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos today said distrust is the largest
obstacle to the resumption of Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy here this afternoon, Moratinos said Syria will
return to peace talks if Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
embraces the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, Levy announced that the Jewish state
will accept U.N. resolution 242 containing the principle as the
basis for negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu himself has never made such a clear-cut
pronouncement. Instead, in a recent interview with a French
newspaper, he declared that the Golan Heights is vital for the
Jewish state in terms of strategy, economy and water resources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Moratinos held talks with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad. Back from the Syrian capital Damascus on Monday
night, he met with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Levy told reporters after the meeting that time has come for
the two sides to look for an accepted formula so that they can
resume talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report from Rabat, Morocco, Syrian
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, accompanied by Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara, held talks with Moroccan King Hassan on
Syria's position regarding the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Khaddam called on the United States to
put pressure on Israel to resume talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off a year ago. The new
Israeli rightwing government has repeatedly called for resumption
of talks without preconditions. But Syria has made it clear that
negotiation is only possible when Israel agrees to full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 war with
Arabs.

MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said today
that the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front
(NDF) have resumed peace talks in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said a government panel headed by former Ambassador
Howard Dee is now in Utrecht holding talks with NDF
representatives. He added that the resumption of the peace talks
is a "breakthrough" in the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to be finished on February 9, the same
day when the government opens another round of peace talks in
Mindanao with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a
12,000-member major rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government and the NDF held peace talks last year, but the
two sides failed to resolve their differences, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the president also announced a 30-day
extension of a unilateral cease-fire he declared last December
from February 4 to March 6.
</P>
<P>
He said the extended cease-fire is intended for all kinds of
rebels including the NDF and the MILF, a splinter faction of the
mainstream Moro National Liberation Front which signed a peace
agreement with the government last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Reprimands U.S. Consul in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon has reprimanded a U.S. consul for his
undiplomatic remarks over the visa applications to the United
States of a Filipino ambassador's family, the Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Robert Zuehlke, a consul of the U.S. Embassy in
Manila, not only refused to entertain the application papers of
the family of the newly-appointed Philippine ambassador to
Hungary, but also called them "hangers-on."
</P>
<P>
The incident infuriated Ambassador Solita Aguirre who promptly
decided to withdraw her family's visa applications, even as other
Foreign Department officials interceded to facilitate the
applications processing.
</P>
<P>
The incident, widely reported in local media, prompted Siazon
to summon Zuehlke to his office at the Department of Foreign
Affairs last Tuesday, where he reportedly lectured the U.S. consul
on basic diplomatic courtesy and language.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Department officials said it is customary for all
diplomatic services to entertain visa applications of members of
an ambassador's family.
</P>
<P>
The agency said subsequent media attempts to get Zuehlke's side
of the incident proved futile as he kept mum on the issue and his
office instead referred reporters to the public affairs office of
the U.S. Embassy, which, in turn, promised to issue a statement on
the matter. No such statement so far has come out.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Department officials said Zuehlke's diplomatic
discourtesy was unacceptable and the U.S. consul deserved what he
got from Siazon. They, however, said the incident is not likely to
stir further Philippine-U.S. diplomatic row.

initiate bold economic reforms for the rapid development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) government will continue the agenda prepared by the
caretaker government, Sharif told a news conference in Lahore,
capital of Punjab Province, where the PML(N) has won a landslide
victory in Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
He said his first priority would be to rationalize the tax
system, drastically cut down government expenditure, create an
investment climate for improving the national economy, provide
incentives in the form of tax holiday and further remove foreign
exchange restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about whether he would repeal the
controversial eighth amendment of the constitution, Nawaz said the
issue would be debated in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the magnitude of his victory, Sharif said he was
expecting a comfortable majority but got more than a majority.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy responsibilities now rest on our shoulders and we hope
we will be able to fulfill them," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the fact that Benazir Bhutto, leader
of the Pakistan People's Party, has not accepted the results, he
said, "This is what she says now but later she will have to accept
the results."
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the Council for Defense and National Security will
be given a fresh look by the parliament which will decide whether
to retain it or not.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) has won the elections held on Monday by having so
far secured 127 seats in the 217-seat National Assembly and it is
thus able to form a single majority government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League
led by Nawaz Sharif is just 22 seats short of a two-third majority
in the National Assembly with results of 34 seats still awaited
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) has won an overwhelming victory over its rivals by
having so far got 127 seats in the 217-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, 46, is set to become Pakistan's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) is now heading for a two-third majority in the
National Assembly with the support of its allies and others,
having secured an unexpected high number of the National Assembly
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan People's Party led by former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto has so far won 16 seats in the National Assembly
and secured only two seats in the provincial assembly of Punjab,
the PML(N)'s power base.
</P>
<P>
The PPP has won 27 seats in Sindh Province while the PML(N) has
made its inroad in Sindh by getting 12 seats in the Sindh
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The PPP is set to suffer its worst defeat in the elections. It
is expected that the PPP will get no more than 35 seats in the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unprecedented interest shown by Pakistani women
in the politics has sent five of them to the National Assembly in
the polls Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani women this time had come out in as many as 36
constituencies in the largely male-dominated hustings. Never
before had women contested the National Assembly elections for
general seats.
</P>
<P>
Benazir, chairperson of the PPP, has won the two National
Assembly seats she had contested.
</P>
<P>
Other major parties including the Haq Parast Group known as the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement and the Awami National Party have tallies
of 11 and eight National Assembly seats respectively while 13
independents have already been elected.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Kill 70,000 People in China Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents in China
resulted in the deaths of 73,655 people and 174,447 injuries, and
direct economic losses of 1.72 billion yuan, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There was a total of 287,685 traffic accidents last year, or
about 788 a day, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry's traffic control bureau said
today that a major cause of traffic accidents is driver
negligence. "Drivers with less than three years' driving
experience were the most likely to cause traffic accidents and
were responsible for 52 percent of the total traffic accidents,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the death rate, which has been on the increase in
recent years, slowed down in 1996 with the ministry's increased
efforts at improving driving safety.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the number of traffic accidents, as well
as fatalities and injuries in Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jiangsu,
and three other provinces was actually less than in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
He added however that the country is still faced with the
enormous task of making drivers and pedestrians more aware of
traffic rules, regulations and laws.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Aid to Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
proposed providing Armenia, Georgia and possibly Tajikistan with
exceptional aid of up to ECU 220 million (262 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The aid will be in the form of long-term loans of ECU 170
million (202 million dollars) combined with straight grants of ECU
50 million (60 million dollars), the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The present proposal to the European Union (EU) Council makes
it possible for the Commission to negotiate with the beneficiary
countries the terms and conditions attached to the new assistance
package.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be fixed "taking into account these countries"
effective financing needs consistent with their programs agreed
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Aid to Tajikistan is conditional on the adoption of an
IMF-approved one-year economic program, supported by a stand-by
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The loan component of the assistance will be funded via
Community market borrowing and will be repayable over up to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The grant component will be financed out of the general budget
and will be paid in five equal annual installments of ECU 10
million (12 million dollars) from 1997 onwards.

<HEADLINE> Polish Vice PM and Finance Minister Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Alexander
Kwasniewski today removed Grzegorz Kolodko from his post as vice
prime minister and finance minister at the suggestion of Prime
Minister Woldzimierz Cimoszewicz.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko was replaced by liberal economist Marek Belka, an
advisor to the president and a professor at the Polish Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski thanked Kolodko for the significant contribution he
had made to the development of the Polish economy during his
three-year service in the government.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko was seen as an important figure in Poland's economic
reforms and he led the country into the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial reports cited by the private radio
station Radio Zet, the 47-year-old minister submitted his
resignation about 10 days ago after clashing with cabinet members
over a decision to re-impose customs duties on cereals.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko insisted that the move, backed by the Polish Peasants
Party, would cause inflation.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by reports as saying that he was standing down
after three years because he had achieved what he had set out to
do and that Poland was firmly set on a course of economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Kolodko's replacement Marek Belka, 45, is a professor in the
Research Institute of Economy of Polish Academy of Sciences and is
an expert in finance, currency and banking. He does not belong to
a political party but has acted as President Kwasniewski's
economic adviser since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Belka is married with two children.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Politics Snares Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
Monday voided a Malaysian consortium's winning bid to purchase the
historic Manila Hotel, touching off a controversy about whether
the country's politics is discouraging foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
In an 11-4 vote, the tribunal ordered the Philippine government
to sell 51 percent of the hotel, or 15.3 million shares, to the
Manila Prince Hotel Corporation, which petitioned the high court
in October 1995 after losing its bid to the Malaysian Renong
Berhad group.
</P>
<P>
The court, which defined the 85-year-old hotel where U.S.
General Douglas MacArthur once lived during the Second World War
as a heritage of the country, cited the "Filipino First" policy in
the country's constitution for its decision.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution mandates that in the grant of rights,
privileges and concessions covering national economy and
patrimony, the state shall give preference to qualified
Filipinos," the court said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors said the ruling represented another
embarrassment for foreign firms eager to enter the Philippine
market.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Court of Appeals issued a 20-day restraining
order against the privatization of the Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System, one of the world's largest privatization project.
The order stopped the transmittal of two joint ventures' winning
bids to President Fidel Ramos for signing.
</P>
<P>
Before this case, there was the awarding of a contract to the
U.S.-British joint venture GE-Marconi to provide a
state-of-the-art radar system. The contract has gone unimplemented
for a year because of a senator's allegations that it was
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Senate President Ernesto Maceda's allegations that
payoffs paved the way for a billion-peso land reclamation deal in
the Manila Bay has delayed and may even kill the project, which
involved Hong Kong's Guoco Holdings and the Bangkok-based
Italian-Thai Development.
</P>
<P>
Then came President Ramos' denial to Hutchison Port Holdings,
the world's largest private port operator based in Hong Kong, of a
winning bid for a container facility in the Subic Bay Freeport, a
former U.S. military base in the country.
</P>
<P>
After a series of such cases, a Western diplomat closely
following the situation was quoted as saying the contracts signed
by the Philippine government seemed not sacred because if the
"wrong group" wins, the losing bidder could put pressure to have
the bidding rescinded.
</P>
<P>
According to Far Eastern Economic Review, the cause of these
reversals is "not corruption but one of the country's greatest
accomplishments -- a democratic if unwieldy government."
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, foreign businessmen must be careful because
they are steeped in legalism. Almost everybody can hold up a deal
by getting politicians involved and winning a bid depends on deft
use of the legal system and political lobbying.
</P>
<P>
Take the hotel case. Manila Prince lost to the Malaysian bid in
October 1995. 10 days later, it matched the bidding price of
Renong Berhad and sent a 33-million-peso (1.25 million U.S.
dollars) check as security to the owner of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
However, the offer was rejected, prompting Manila Prince to
file a case before the court, which issued a restraining order the
next day and made the final ruling this year, putting a blight on
the supposed "level playing field" touted to foreign investors by
the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
"If they become prevalent, these challenges to various bids
could discourage both foreign and local investors," warned Robert
Sears, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"It is a negative move which creates an impression that a
decision is not safe and you can never be sure of a bid award,"
said Guillermo Luz, executive director of the Makati Business
Club, a leading body composed of elite businessmen in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen also voiced their anger over the ruling, which
they said is "shortsighted" and if viewed properly, is gravely
prejudicial to long-term Filipino interests.
</P>
<P>
"Such policy (the Filipino First policy) will marginalize
Filipinos as pariahs in the global marketplace with absolutely no
chance of winning any bidding outside the country," a legislator
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the
constitution is not anti-alien and he voiced confidence that
foreign investments in the country will not be affected by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
"We support the Filipino First policy, but while it requires
that we incline to a Filipino, it does not demand that we wrong an
alien," he said.

consultation, training and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on some of the worst polluting industries such as
paper mills, tanneries, textiles, and food processing factories,
to look for technological breakthroughs, and to choose enterprises
as demonstration projects.
</P>
<P>
"We will further strengthen international co-operation in this
field and encourage more enterprises to participate in the
effort," said Gan Shijun, director of the social development

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's general elections
held on Monday were "fair and free," Loic Bouvard, leader of the
French observers team, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Bouvard, also vice
president of the French National Assembly, said he and his
colleagues observed that "the election process was as fair as it
should have been in all respects."
</P>
<P>
He said that during their visit to several polling stations in
and around Islamabad Monday, they did not hear a single complaint
about rigging or any other irregularity.
</P>
<P>
Bouvard said the election process was strict enough to check
any irregularity.
</P>
<P>
At the end they also witnessed the counting process and it was
also good as polling agents of all the candidates were present
there, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The whole process was foolproof and left no room for rigging
and everything was fine and smooth during the voting procedure,"
said Bouvard.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the low voter turnout, he said that according to
the information available to them, the overall voting ratio was 25
percent which is a low, "but that does not mean that the polls
were unfair."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the low turnout would not undermine the system
and the credibility of the elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of cattle have
died and hundreds of people are at risk following heavy snowstorms
which have hit more than half Mongolia's provinces over the last
month.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent 1,000 tons of hay and 252 tons of
fodder to areas worst hit by the bad weather which has left many
mountainous areas cut off and dozens of roads blocked, the
Government News paper said today.
</P>
<P>
Snow drifts up to 1.5 meters deep in some areas have left
thousands of animals and hundreds of people stranded without food.
</P>
<P>
In Tonkhil county in the southwestern province of Altay, nearly
5,000 cattle had died by the end of January. Thousands more animals
have died in Kobdo province in western Mongolia, and the
southeastern province of East Gobi province, Bayara, a senior
official in charge of disaster relief said.
</P>
<P>
The disastrous weather, which started in early winter, has now
spread to 11 of Mongolia's 21 provinces. Kobdo, Dzavkhan, Sukhe
Bator, East Gobi and Gobi-Altay have been the worst hit.

<HEADLINE> Sand Dunes Besiege Somali Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Somali towns of Merca
and El-Dher are besieged by sand dunes caused by the strong
northeastern monsoon winds hitting the country.
</P>
<P>
Merca, a port town 100 kilometers south from capital
Mogadishu, has been left solitude since two-meter-high sands
cover and close the sole tarmac road leading to the town.
</P>
<P>
The people living there now have to walk about one and a half
kilometers out of the town to reach the bus station for traveling
to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Commercial and ordinary vehicles are also unable to arrive at
the town and unload cargos at the town's natural port.
</P>
<P>
Then these cargos are carried by once military-use four wheel
drive vehicles to the concerned sites where local residents can
reach.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 20 houses in the El-Dher town, 350 kilometers north
of Mogadishu, have been buried in sand dunes, and 30 more
buildings there are under serious sand threat.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 people in El-Dher, mainly children and women,
have been forced to abandon their home, said an aged local
resident named Abdullahi Hassan Shidad.
</P>
<P>
Sand dunes have cut off the south entrance of the El-Dher town
and might soon occupy the town's northern exit, the sole exit
left.
</P>
<P>
Daud Omar Assir, a volunteer helping fight the sand spread
around the town, said sand dunes surrounding the town have
extended five kilometers long from all directions except the
north.
</P>
<P>
The sand, once far away from the town on the direction of the
sea, "now has incredibly made barren a pastoral land of 80
kilometers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two towns are appealing the international community to
help them curb down the sand spread and asking for bulldozers to
remove the sand from the main entrances of the towns.
</P>
<P>
People in El-Dher are currently using easily planted trees to
stop the sand move with expectations that massive operation
against the spread of the sand will come soon into effect. enditem

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League
(PML) led by Nawaz Sharif has won an overwhelming victory over its
rivals by getting a staggering majority of 126 seats so far in the
217-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, 46, is set to become Pakistan's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) is now heading for a two-third majority in the
National Assembly with the support of its allies and others.
Having secured an unexpected high number of the National Assembly
seats, the PML(N) has now also been able to form a single-party
central government.

<P>
Meanwhile, the PML(N) has won 207 seats in the 248-seat Punjab
Provincial Assembly and 27 seats in the 83-seat Assembly of the
North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and will thus form government
with a solid majority in the two provinces.

<P>
The Pakistan People's Party led by former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto has so far won 16 seats in the National Assembly
and secured only two seats in the Provincial Assembly of Punjab,
the PML(N)'s power base.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Disappointed Over Court's Ruling on Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today expressed his disappointment over the Supreme Court's ruling
voiding the sale of the Manila Hotel to a Malaysian firm.
</P>
<P>
"I said I am disappointed. We are losing time because this will
impact in a negative way upon our pro-poor program and our policy
to attract more and more outside investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court Monday declared the Manila Hotel as part of
the country's patrimony and awarded the ownership of the hotel to
Manila Prince Hotel Corporation instead of Malaysia's Renong
Berhad, which already won the bidding in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the court's ruling, plus the recent 20-day temporary
restraining order issued by the Court of Appeals on the
privatization of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System
in Manila, would greatly affect the overall privatization program
of the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the president stressed that he respects the Supreme
Court's interpretation of the law.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court, of course, has its responsibility to
interpret the law and we respect that. But just the same, maybe
the information regarding bidding rules and regulations must be
clearly understood by all proponents," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
approved here today a 30-day extension of the unilateral
suspension of military offensives against all insurgents in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said the president's move is
consistent with an alternative peace plan proposed by Howard Dee,
chairman of the government panel negotiating with the New People's
Army and the National Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
Ramos declared last year a unilateral cease-fire from December
1, 1996, to January 29, 1997, in order to let the Muslims observe
the fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
De Villa, however, said the extended cease-fire would not cover
normal law enforcement functions and would be without prejudice to
actions aimed at protecting the people and the communities as well
as government troops and installations against insurgents' attacks
and atrocities that may take place.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Bombard South Lebanese Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces in
the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon bombarded a
number of Lebanese villages this morning, causing serious damages,
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia fired 155mm and 120mm artilleries at more than 13
villages in south Lebanon and Western Beqaa, the Lebanese
security sources reported.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment started at the midnight and lasted until
9:00 a.m. (0700 GMT), during which the Israeli forces and
their client militia fired more than 250 shells.
</P>
<P>
Several houses in the village of Farrouman were hit and
leveled to the ground, the security sources said on a
condition of anonymity, adding damages were also registered in
other villages.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were called in the bombardment, the security
sources noed.
</P>
<P>
In a retaliation for the bombardment, Lebanese guerrillas
launched this morning a series of attacks at positions of the
Israeli occupation forces and the SLA militia in the border
strip.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas fired rockets and mortar shells at the
Israeli-SLA joint positions at almost every corner of the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the SLA militia confirmed that some a dozen of
their positions were targeted by artillery fire of guerrillas,
but claimed that no casualties were caused in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Lebanese lands in the south in late
1970s and self-proclaimed the established of a
1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in 1985 in a bid to
protect northern Israel from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai announced rejection of
an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon Monday, saying that a
unilateral withdrawal would endanger Israelis living near the
border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said this afternoon that
his government will file a complaint over the morning
bombardment by Israeli forces at south Lebanese villages to a
five-state committee, which supervises a cease-fire on the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
His remarks cames in a press conference he held jointly
with visiting Brazilian foreign minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising representatives of the United States,
France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, was set up under a
cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and the Jewish
state on April 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement bars fighting sides on the last
active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict from hitting
civilian targets or launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
The April understanding put an end to a 17-day Israeli
blitz against Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon in which some
200 Lebanese people, mainly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the violation in south Lebanon in the
morning, Boueiz said that "the Israeli aggression constituted an
undisguised breach of the April understanding."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister saw a "seriousness" in the
escalation, noting that it cames after Israel signed the
Hebron agreement with the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials have feared that the Hebron agreement
could be used by the Israeli government of Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu as a tool for exerting pressure on Lebanon
and Syria.

PARIS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After experiencing ethnic conflicts and a brief but bloody
civil war, Georgia is finally recovering since independence in
1991. But it is still far from its Soviet-era prosperity when its
5.5 million people produced most of the tea, wood and wine for
the U.S.S.R..
</P>
<P>
-- Bulgaria has been totally paralyzed by road blocks and
strikes organized by the opposition. The country's new prime
minister, Nikolai Dobrev, has offered a compromise by promising to
hold early elections in June in exchange for opposition support
for his new government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced on Monday that the
government will restart the privatization process of the Thomson
CSF electronics group by the end of February. While the Lagardere
group remains a candidate to take over Thomson, its
rival, Alcatel Alsthom, is discussing with the Dassault and
Aerospatiale aerospace groups about a joint bid.
</P>
<P>
-- In order to revitalize their economies and steer clear of
Russian influence, the leaders of the former Soviet republics in
the Caucasus region are trying to build a new "Silk Road" which
linked the East with the West via Central Asia some 2,000 years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Self-Claimed Iranian Diplomat Sentenced to 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian who claimed to be a
diplomat and provided false information on Iran's involvement in
the explosion of a Jewish center in Boenus Aires was today
sentenced in absentia to 10 years of imprisonment, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Public
Court of Tehran handed down the sentence upon Manouchehr Motamar
who was charged with forging government documents.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Public Court also ordered
confiscation of 50 million rials (about 16,000 U.S. dollars)
he earned for forging the documents.
</P>
<P>
It said that after the explosion of the Jewish center in
Boenus Aires, which killed about 70 people and injured 150 others
in August 1994, Motamar claimed that he was a former Iranian
diplomat and provided false information proving Iran's involvement
in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The report said that his claims were magnified by the United
States and Israel and later turned into a propaganda outcry
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Since they failed to present acceptable documents in support
of the claims to the court, the Argentine government extended
an official apology to Iran, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to documents made available by his relatives in
Isfahan, Motamer had a shop in the city before turning to an
agent for the U.S. intelligence agency. In addition, several law
suits have been lodged against him on charges of
swindling.

<HEADLINE> Australian Prime Minister Defends Monarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today defended the monarchy by dismissing a republic as
incapable of delivering better government.
</P>
<P>
But he confirmed that he would fulfill an election promise to
hold a constitutional convention on the question this year.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe any republican system of government can
deliver more stable, more effective government than can the
present constitution," Howard told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, I do not believe the present system of
government is flawed," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Howard admitted that a significant number of Australians,
including numerous members of the Liberal and National Parties, do
not share his view.
</P>
<P>
"It is a view which has considerable currency in the Australian
community that there are aspects of the symbols associated with
the present system which are no longer as relevant as they used to
be," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the convention will be held at
the old parliament house in Canberra in November or December with
the government appointing half the delegates and reserving places
for indigenous and young Australians. Remaining delegates will be
elected by a voluntary, probably postal, national vote.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition leader Kim Beazley said Australians should
instead be allowed to vote directly on whether they want a
republic.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Calls for Israeli pullout from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luis Felipe Lampreia stressed here today his country's support
for an implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425,
which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia, who arrived here Monday night for a two-day official
visit to Lebanon, made the remarks today at a joint press
conference held following a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart
Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,100-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon, or more than one tenth of Lebanon's territories,
and has changed it into a buffer zone for the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the Brazilian foreign minister noted
the importance of a "coordination in the United Nations" between
Brazil, currently a member in the Security Council, and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Foreign Minister, on the other hand, reiterated
that "the only solution for the problems in south Lebanon is a
complete Israeli withdrawal to the internationally-recognized
border and an extension of Lebanon's sovereignty to the south."
</P>
<P>
"Israel should know that the peace should only be a
comprehensive one, or it will be a false peace," the Lebanese
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced at the end of their talks that he and the
Brazilian foreign minister signed two agreements, one on culture
and another on air transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also announced that his
government would file a complaint to a five-state committee,
which supervises violations of a cease-fire on the
Lebanese-Israeli border, over Israeli bombardments at south
Lebanese villages this morning.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives of the United
States, France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, was set up under a
cease-fire understanding which Lebanon and Israel reached on
April 26, 1996, and which ended an 17-day Israeli blitz in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "April understanding" bars the fighting sides
on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict from
hitting civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Lampreia went to the Presidential
Palace in the east suburb of Beirut and started a meeting with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian foreign minister is scheduled to have another
meeting today with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia's visit to Lebanon is the first by a top Brazilian
official to this country since the beginning of this century.

<HEADLINE> Airborne Delivery System Restated </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A pregnant woman gave birth to
a baby girl up in the air thousands of meters above the Chinese
countryside unexpectedly recently on a domestic airline flight
from Yiwu, in Zhejiang Province, to Shenzhen, in south China.
</P>
<P>
The drama took place on January 30, when a Mrs. Huang, and her
husband, a jewellery company employee in Yiwu, took off from Yiwu
for Shenzhen to return to their hometown in Guangdong
province. Mrs. Huang was eight months pregnant at the time.
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 pm, Shenzhen airport's control tower was told that a
passenger was about to give birth prematurely and that they should
get ready for the emergency.
</P>
<P>
The baby, however, decided not to wait that long. As luck had
it, there was an elderly gynaecologist onboard the plane who
volunteered to help with the delivery, which took place at 9:10 pm.
</P>
<P>
The mother and infant were reported to be in good condition
after they were rushed to a nearby hospital in Dongguan city. When
other passengers on the flight learned that there was an extra
passenger onboard, they said that it was "a memorable flying
experience" and named the baby "Sky Birth", according to Beijing
Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Although the whole thing went off without a hitch, the aviation
department has restated the warning that any woman who is eight
months or more pregnant will not be allowed to board an airplane,
to avoid any more close calls and possible danger to the baby.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a similar event took place on an Urumqi to
Changsha flight, where a baby was successfully delivered up in the
air.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Targets Zero Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is confident of
realizing the goal of "zero poverty" by the year 2000 using
microcredit as an effective weapon.
</P>
<P>
Its Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa said microcredit or
extension of small sums of loans to the poor for small businesses
could be used as an effective weapon against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would soon launch the Institute for Rural Advancement
to train practitioners and advocates in microcredit in the Asia
Pacific, said Annuar, who represented his prime minister at the
three-day first global Microcredit Summit in Washington which
ended Monday, according to Malaysia's official news agency Bernama
today.
</P>
<P>
The summit launched a nine-year campaign to help 100 million of
the world's poorest families gain access to credit for small
businesses by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Annuar said his government has allocated 200 million ringgit
(about 80 million U.S. dollars) to a trust known as Amanah Ikhtiar
Malaysia (AIM) for eliminating poverty through microcredit
programs.
</P>
<P>
He said the trust's role would be strengthened to allow the
non- governmental agency to extend assistance to those living
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the trust extends microcredit only to the hard-core
poor.
</P>
<P>
Rural development ministers of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations will meet in Kuala Lumpur in July to discuss poverty
eradication in the region, according to Annuar.
</P>
<P>
Microcredit from the trust ranges from 1,000 ringgit (about 400
 dollars) to 10,000 ringgit (about 4,000 dollars) and borrowers
are charged a one-time processing fee of up to 14 percent of the
loan.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich, Poor Worsening in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the rich and the
poor are getting worse and worse in western Germany, said the
latest statistics from Labor Bureau of Bremen.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, in the period from 1989-1992, the
number of people with annual incomes exceeding 1 million marks
(about 610,000 U.S.dollars) rose to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of the poor is on the trend of
sharply increasing, with the people applying for the social relief
hitting 3,300,000.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed to the sluggish economic situation in
Germany, the increasing numbers of bankruptcy enterprises and the
high rate of jobless.
</P>
<P>
The situation in eastern Germany was even worser. In
Brandenburg, where low unemployment rate is often seen, 18 out of
every one thousand people were dependent on relief, amounting to a
total of 45,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sachsen-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern also witnessed more
people living on the government relief, of which the people at the
age of 50 and above and the minors accounted for 50 percent of
the total.

<HEADLINE> Slave Trafficking Attempt Aborted in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An attempt to ferry about 100
Nigerians to Gabon for slave labor was foiled at the weekend by a
village head in Akwa Ibom State in southeast Nigeria, The
Punch reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said Chief Edet Ndarake, head of the Mkpanak
Village in the Ibeno local government led a team of youth and
impounded the slave boat just as it was about to set sail from
the Mkpanak creek.
</P>
<P>
They also arrested two persons believed to be slave
traffickers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mkpanak, a village on the coast of the Atlantic, is fast
gaining reputation as one of the areas in the state where the
illegal slave labor trade thrives most, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Among those saved from their miserable fate are six boys
between the age of 10 to 12, who said they were promised of good
homes and education at their destination.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 teenagers said the slave contractors had promised
them jobs at plantations in Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Chief Ndarake said he had taken the action because "I cannot
allow my domain to be used as an exit point for transportation of
fellow Nigerians to do slave labor in other countries".
</P>
<P>
He said it is shocking to discover that some Nigerians are
still engaged in slave trading in this modern times, long after
it was formally abolished in civilized societies over a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper further disclosed that in 1996 alone, the
authorities in Akwa Ibom State foiled four attempts of slave
trafficking and rescued about 143 persons.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1996, more than 200 persons perished on the high seas
on slave boats. The figure this year has reached 39 so far, the
newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Lower Tariffs on Info-Technology Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will lower tariffs on
information-technology products including computers,
communications equipment and semiconductors from July 1 this year
under the International Technology Agreement (ITA), the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
At the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Singapore last December, South Korea, the United
States, Japan and 11 other countries reached an agreement to
remove all tariffs on information-technology products by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight signatories to the ITA agreed at a recent meeting
in Geneva that all signatories remove tariffs on the import of 202
types of computers and communications machines by 2000.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, however, won a grace period of two to four years
for nine computer and communications products that are liable to
sustain damage from the removal of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Under the moratorium on non-tariffication, Seoul must eliminate
tariffs on three types of computers and wafer measurement devices
by 2004. The moratorium will last until 2002 for six other
products including switching machines for wired phones and digital
communications devices.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Succeeds in Population Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The success of Indonesia's
27-year-old population control program is being highlighted today
with the birth of the 200 millionth citizen in the world's fourth
most populous country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government considered February 4, 1997 a special
occasion as the family control program has succeeded in slashing
the birth rate by more than two thirds.
</P>
<P>
The program has also dismissed the prediction of many
demographic experts that Indonesia's population in 1997 will reach
221 million.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which currently ranks behind only China, India and
the United States in population, will slip to the sixth place by
2050 after being overtaken by Pakistan and Nigeria, according to
U.N. estimates.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception 27 years ago, the family planning program
has made remarkable success, said Aris Annata, a demographic
expert at the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said the population growth rate will drop from 2.1 percent
in the 1980-1990 period to 1.2 percent in 2000-2005 and 0.6
percent in 2020-2025.
</P>
<P>
The rate has decreased by no less than 50 percent compared with
the 1960s when each woman gave birth to an average of 5.6
children, he added.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show Indonesia's birth rate dropped to 1.7
percent in 1996 and the government is seeking a further reduction
to 1.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The government's population control policy was launched in 1970
with the establishment of the National Family Planning Board,
which in 1989 won Indonesia the United Nations' Population Award.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive program spans this vast archipelago of more
than 15,000 islands, promoting the vision of small, prosperous and
happy families.
</P>
<P>
Priority in implementing the program has been given to the most
populous islands of Java and Bali where clinic-based family
planning service and other integrated services should be improved.
In addition, stress has also been put on birth control in other
areas with less developed communications and service
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven years of hard work have brought positive results.
At present, more than 60 percent of eligible couples in the
country have become active family planning acceptors.
</P>
<P>
Observers said a number of factors have converged that
influenced attitudes towards family planning. Firstly, Indonesia's
progress in generating economic growth and reducing poverty has
helped create the desire for smaller families. Since 1970, the
incidence of poverty has declined from almost 60 percent of its
total population to only 11 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Indonesia's leaders, including President Soeharto,
have given the program strong public support and that commitment
has been transmitted to all levels of government.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the remarkable expansion of primary education, which
is now nearly universal, has also had an important role in making
people want smaller families.
</P>
<P>
The program, from the beginning, has also gained financial
support from the United Nations, the World Bank and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
In spite of its success, the family planning program has a
challenging task ahead. Indonesia's population is still growing by
more than 3 million people annually and expected to reach 217
million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
So, on the eve of the birth of Indonesia's 200 millionth
person, State Minister of Population Haryono Suyono appealed to
the nation to maintain the drive to curtail population growth
though family planning.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the slowing of the population growth rate is
expected to lead to "balanced growth" by 2005, or 2010 at the
least.
</P>
<P>
This in turn, he noted, is expected to lead to a zero-growth
Indonesian population, as envisaged by the U.N and the World Bank,
by the middle of the 21st century, when the population is
estimated to stabilize at 350 million.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's success in family planning has also been praised by
many countries, especially the developing countries as well as the
world community. The country's family control agencies have since
1987 trained more than 2,800 representatives from 85 countries on
the management of family planning and contraceptive technology.

<P>
HANOI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will adopt new policies
to boost labor export, Tran Dinh Hoan, Minister of Labor, War
Invalids and Social Affairs of Vietnam said today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on labor issues held here, Hoan said that Vietnam
will form more large labor-export companies, enabling the country
to compete on the world labor market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of more labor-export companies
would help better formalize employment documents, identify
responsibilities of both workers and employers and train
high-quality labors for export.
</P>
<P>
About 12,660 Vietnamese, including 2,000 women, went abroad to
seek jobs last year, compared with 36,000 between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has tried to ease the domestic unemployment problem
through labor export, which has increased since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese labors, traditionally going to the markets of the
former Soviet Union and east European countries, are now exported
to North Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. About
50 percent are employed in South Korea and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Suspending War Games With Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will continue to
suspend the holding of war games with all foreign troops until the
government comes up with a legislation on the status of foreign
troops in the country, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The joint military exercises with other countries remain
suspended until there is an agreement with respect to status of
(foreign) troops in the Philippines," De Villa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to reports that the government has already
lifted the suspension on war games with foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was announced last month after officials of the
departments of defense, foreign affairs and justice agreed to
resolve once and for all the issue on how to handle cases
involving foreign soldiers who would be charged of a crime while
participating in a joint military exercise in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go into joint military exercises any more until all
of these things have been cleared up," De Villa said.
</P>
<P>
But the government will continue to allow port calls of foreign
ships which entail refueling and rest and recreation activities
for a limited period, De Villa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Executive Department will submit to the Senate for
ratification all status of forces agreements that will be forged
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We will only resume the war games after the Senate ratifies
the agreement," De Villa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has not received any complaints from
other countries about the suspension of joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The issues pertaining to criminal jurisdiction of cases
involving foreign troops have been left unresolved for several
years.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has signed memorandums with France,
Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom and South Korea
on joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
But these memorandums did not address the issue on what would
the host country do if a foreign soldier commits a crime while
participating in joint military exercises.

<HEADLINE> Internet to Create New Industries, Says Intel President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation
President Andrew Grove said here today that the Internet would
radically change and create new industries from current
telecommunications, media and services industries.
</P>
<P>
"Such radical changes create opportunities for businesses and
economies which can operate in these new industries," Grove said
in his speech to the plenary session of the annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum (WEF) being held in Davos from January 30 to
February 4.
</P>
<P>
"These changes are already taking place throughout the world,"
he said. The Internet provides a direct link between consumers and
advertisers of goods and services without having to go through an
intermediary like television or print media, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also in his speech, Grove urged the European government and
business leaders to take advantage of their existing
infrastructure and substantial investments in information
technology (IT) as a competitive tool in the race toward
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He warned that without significant national programs and
incentives toward increased utilization of existing technology, IT
investments alone would not be enough to maintain competitiveness
with emerging markets in eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Grove used digital graphics projected to a
big screen to make his statement more direct and demonstrable.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating a typical day in his office, Grove read an
electronic message from his computer and then accessed an Intel
Intranet site using the Intel worldwide data network to gather
more recent information regarding the issues mentioned in the
electronic message.
</P>
<P>
He finally had live video conferences with his colleagues in
different departments of the Intel to discuss issues of
diversity.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Celebrates 49th Independence Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka today celebrated its
49th anniversary of independence throughout the country with the
official ceremony taking place in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
A 21-shot salvo and a guard of honor by the three forces
saluted President Chandrika Kumaratunga in the Independence Square
when she addressed the nation in Sinhalese, Tamil and English.
</P>
<P>
She said that Sri Lanka has made many achievements in various
sectors since the independence.
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out, "these achievements will remain
fragile as long as we do not succeed in conclusively resolving the
most terrible crisis the country has faced in its long history."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka achieved independence on February 4, 1948 after
nearly 450 years of colonial rule by the Portuguese, the Dutch and
the British.
</P>
<P>
It still faces problems, particularly the outstanding issue
between the country's major ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting between government troops and the Tamil rebels
has been going in the north-east of the island since 1983. More
than 55,000 people have been killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
In her Independence Day message, President Chandrika said, "It
is necessary that the outstanding problems which confront Sri
Lanka's nationhood must be solved."
</P>
<P>
She said, "Now, irrespective of race, religion or political
affiliation, let us pledge ourselves on this day on which we
celebrate our 49th anniversary of independence, to devote all
energies in the coming year to the task of molding a united,
peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four Philippine policemen
were dismissed from the service for involving in various crimes,
including kidnappings, a senior police officer announced today.
</P>
<P>
Two other policemen were demoted in rank and four others were
suspended, said Robert Barbers, chairman of the National Police
Commission overseeing the campaign against crimes inside the
police.
</P>
<P>
The 24 dismissed were found to have been involved in
kidnapping, murder, robbery, grave misconduct, extortion, bribery
and immorality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said the disciplinary action against the erring
policemen had already been affirmed by his commission.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said their dismissal manifested the police's resolution
to professionalize its ranks by removing those who are considered
"scalawags".
</P>
<P>
Violent crimes, particularly kidnapping, have been on the rise
in the country since 1995. In 1996 alone, a total of 147
kidnapping cases were reported in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The police have been criticized sharply for its failure to curb
the rise of crimes, and many policemen were accused of having
connection with criminal syndicates.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Removes Subsidy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to remove its subsidies on fertilizers and allow private
businesses to operate in the market, the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Muhammadu Gambo Jimeta was quoted as
saying on Monday in Abuja that the government has decided to do
so since farmers, the intended targets of the subsidies, rarely
benefit from them.
</P>
<P>
Under the old policy, he said, subsidized fertilizers were
cornered by middlemen and then sold to farmers at prices higher
than that set by the government.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Head of State General Sani Abacha in his 1997 budget
speech also regretted the situation and promised to reform the
way subsidies are handled so that farmers can really benefit from
them.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the minister said, the government will
pump the subsidies to other agricultural input that will
eventually be more beneficial to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Such input includes land prepration, improved seedlings,
provision of extension services, credit facilities and irrigation
facilities, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will also allow private business to engage in
the production, importation and sale of fertilizers, which has
hitherto been an exclusive preserve of the government.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that this will help check various abuses
of powers in the distribution of fertilizers.

CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were killed
and ten others injured when a cargo train rammed into a passenger
train in southern Egypt Monday morning, the Interior Ministry has
announced.
</P>
<P>
Today's Egyptian Gazette quoted the security sources as saying
that rescuers had so far pulled out nine bodies and another
eight people had been injured in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports earlier put the possible death toll at
about 30. And the security sources did not explain further why
they put the figure at 15.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the passenger train No. 164 was stopping
at the Al Radissiya Station, about 604 kilometers south of Cairo,
another Aswan-bound train hit it in the back, at about 6
a.m. (04:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The passenger train was heading from the Mediterranean port of
Alexandria to Aswan, a tourist city
</P>
<P>
The two rear compartments of the first train were destroyed in
the accident and the locomotive of the second was wrecked.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were still trying to remove the victims from the
damaged rear cars.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a railway switchman had given the cargo train
the go-ahead signal even though the passenger train had no yet
pulled out of the station.
</P>
<P>
The smashed wagons have been moved away and train service on
the line from Cairo to Aswan has been brought back to normal three
hours after the accident.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy: Syria Willing to Restart Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) special
envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos said that President Hafez Assad of
Syria had told him Syria was willing to restart negotiations with
Israel, the state-run Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
in Tel Aviv Monday night to brief him on his discussions with
Syrian leaders last week.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that he was impressed by Assad's statement,
however, Assad also wanted clarifications of Israel's position.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister David Levy
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Hebrew daily Ha'aretz today,
Moratinos carried a message from the Syrian president to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Moratinos told reporters in Damascus, the
capital of Syria, that President Assad asked him to secure a
goodwill gesture from the Israeli government to resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the request came during talks last Tuesday that
centered on how to resume the negotiations, which opened in
Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"He asked me to get from the Israeli side some kind of
gesture ... some kind of declaration of goodwill from the
Netanyahu government ... and some kind of clarification on what
they mean by resuming the talks on the basis of (U.N. Resolution)
242 and the Madrid principles," Moratinos said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations broke off a year ago after a
series of suicide bombings by anti-Israeli Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli rightwing Likud government has called on Syria
to return to peace talks without pre-conditions. But Syria has
repeatedly declared that Syria will renew the talks only when
Israel agrees to renew the talks from where they left off.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that the Netanyahu government must accept the
late Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's reported agreement to
return the Golan Heights to Syria.

<HEADLINE> Changes in Chinese Dining Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents, with their
usual three-month winter, have long depended on Chinese cabbage as
their traditional winter vegetable. But now, more and more
seasonal vegetables are grown in local greenhouses or supplied by
the southern provinces, with their annual retail volume reaching
three billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
And fresh pork, mutton, beef, eggs, chickens and fish are
available even in freezing weather in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In China's largest metropolis of Shanghai, 33 million tons of
fresh vegetables are in supply every day, while in Nanchang, the
capital city of central China's Jiangxi Province, dozens of
aquatic-products sell in markets year-round.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of
Agriculture, the country's total output of vegetables last year
reached 250 million tons, aquatics-products 28 million tons and
meat 55 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The plentiful daily supply has helped make Chinese urban
dwellers more and more picky about what they would have on the
dining tables, thus leading to changes in traditional dietary
habits.
</P>
<P>
Li Xin, a middle school teacher, considers the importance of
nutrition and convenience when dining. She always buys processed
vegetables, while her husband prefers new tastes and always takes
back home some special dishes she has not eaten before. When they
have guests, they go to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
New and different foods, nutritional awareness and convenience
are becoming the trends in China's dietary habits. As a result,
China has manufactured more new food brands.
</P>
<P>
In some big cities, increasing numbers of vegetable supply
companies are providing processed vegetables. In south China's
Guangzhou alone, 90 percent of the city's 225 markets started to
supply processed vegetables as of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Not only are Chinese buying a wider variety of food, they're
buying it in big amounts, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey by the State Statistical Bureau shows urban
Chinese' per capita expenditure on food was 159 yuan (about 19 US
dollars) each month in the first half of last year, up 1.6 percent
from the previous year after deducting for inflation. And their
food expenditure dropped to 49.8 percent of the total expenditure
from 50.5 percent in the corresponding period of the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Learn Lessons from Mexico Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China should learn a lesson
from the financial turmoil in Mexico and open its capital market
step by step, a senior central bank official has said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of a country's capital market should be based on a
powerful domestic economy and be carried out gradually rather than
in haste, Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of
China, said at a recent national conference attended by heads of
the grassroots departments of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"This is a lesson we should learn from the Mexico crisis," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico opened its capital market before there were the
necessary conditions and it failed to pay enough attention to
productive investment, hence the financial upheaval between the
turn of 1994 and 1995, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Opening the capital market too early and too widely without the
support of a strong national economy will result in grave
consequences, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a correct understanding of the possible harm," he
told the meeting participants. "Now that we have made our Renminbi
yuan convertible under the current account, we must continue to
maintain strict control on transactions under the capital account."
</P>
<P>
He said that China's reform in its foreign exchange system
since 1994 has been successful, adding that China has made the
yuan's exchange rate stand at a level helpful both to exports and
to the inflow of overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China should beef up the study and management of
capital inflows to divert more of them to the right areas and
industries, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in China exceeded 41 billion US
dollars in 1996 and China's foreign exchange reserves by the
year-end reached 105 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Germany Adopts Measures to Prevent Swine Fever from Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The German government issued an
urgent decree today to prevent the swine fever from spreading by
strictly limiting the deal of pigs in affected regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree of the Agricultural Ministry, the regions
affected by the animal disease are not allowed to export pigs to
other European Union (EU) nations within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Since the swine fever has been found recently in Germany's
southern Bavaria State and some other states, about 15,000 pigs
have been slaughtered for fear of spreading of the deadly animal
disease, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Veterinarians Committee is expected to meet on the
issue Tuesday, during which a decision is expected to be taken on
banning export of pigs from Germany.
</P>
<P>
The German government has said it will accept the decision of
the majority of the EU members.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Deposed PM Benazir Bhutto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The deposed Pakistani prime
minister, Benazir Bhutto, has lost her chance to return to the
country's top post in the general elections held Monday.
</P>
<P>
Benazir, 45, who had been ousted twice from the premiership in
six years, is certain to serve as the opposition leader as she did
from 1990 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Benazir was first dismissed on August 6, 1990, by the then
president Ghulam Ishaq Khan under the controversial Eighth
Amendment of the 1973 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari invoked the constitutional power to
end her three-year-old government on November 5, 1996 on the
accusation of mass corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Benazir assumed Pakistan's premiership for the first time in
October 1988 following the PPP's victory in the free elections
after 11 years of military rule. She was, in fact, the first woman
prime minister in the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The PPP lost the general elections held in November 1990 and
Benazir's arch rival Nawaz Sharif was voted to power with a
massive two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the opposition, Benazir launched a street
campaign in March 1993 to oust prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Her
campaign led to a five-month standoff that eventually resulted in
Sharif's resignation halfway through his term.
</P>
<P>
Benazir was again voted to be Pakistan's prime minister in
October 1993, and was sacked half way through by President
Leghari.
</P>
<P>
She filed a petition to the Supreme Court of Pakistan a week
after her dismissal on November 5 last year against the
Presidential Order. The Supreme Court, however, ruled at the end
of last month that the Presidential Proclamation was
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
Benazir is the eldest child of the late prime minister,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who created the PPP and was hanged in April,
1979, two years after being deposed by military strongman Mohammed
Zia-ul Haq on charges of murdering his political foes.
</P>
<P>
Benazir, who said her early training in politics came from her
father, had studied at Harvard and Oxford.
</P>
<P>
She returned to Pakistan in early 1977 to take up a job in the
foreign ministry of her father's government. But the job was
short-lived as Zia-ul Haq toppled her father shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
She then had been arrested nine times and held in detention
center or in prison for more than five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
She played a key-role in the formation of the nine-party
alliance in 1981 -- the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.
The alliance mobilized the people to put pressure on the
government of Zia-ul Haq to hold elections in the country and hand
over power to representatives of the people.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1986, Benazir was appointed by the PPP Central
Committee as co-chairperson.
</P>
<P>
Benazir witnessed the trauma of the hanging of her father and
the mysterious death of her younger brother, Shahnawaz, in 1985 in
France.
</P>
<P>
Her only surviving brother, Murtaza, who was one of her
political opponents, died in a hail of police bullets outside his
home in the southern port city of Karachi in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, former minister of investment,
has been accused by Murtaza's widow of orchestrating the shooting
and has been detained in prison.
</P>
<P>
Benazir has three children, one boy and two girls.

<HEADLINE> Report: US Official Says Israel Should Stay in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official has
reportedly said that his government does not support a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from its self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted the official as saying that an
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon would leave a vacuum in the area
which would probably be filled by anti-Israeli guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
That would be at odds with the U.S. policy of preventing the
current tension in Lebanon from escalating into a major
confrontation, said the official, whose name was not given in the
report.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Monday rejected a call for Israel to unilaterally
withdraw form the "security zone" and be replaced by an
international force.
</P>
<P>
"A unilateral withdrawal seems to us to be problematic,"
the U.S. official said, adding that "there has to be somebody
who has to be responsible for security."
</P>
<P>
"If there is a withdrawal and Katyusha rockets fall into
the northern part of Israel, and Israel goes back into south
Lebanon again, then what have you achieved?"
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official believed that a unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon would also play into Syrian hands, "they (the
Syrians) would be quite happy for Israel to pull out without
anything being negotiated."
</P>
<P>
He said an Israeli withdrawal from the "security zone" must
be part of an arrangement that includes Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The official also revealed that next week, the Clinton
administration would begin efforts to restart the stalled talks
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed doubt over Mordechai's policy in south
Lebanon, which would have Israel, Syria, and Lebanon first
discuss security arrangements in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official confirmed reports that since April
1996, after Operation Grapes of Wrath, Hezbollah has received
30 planeloads of military equipment from Iran, via Damascus,
capital of Syria.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Plants Shut Down Due to Parts Supply Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Toyota Motor Corps said
today it has suspended production in 19 of its 20 plants because
of a fire last week at a factory which supplies brake parts to the
country's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
The factory, burnt down in Kariya, Aichi Prefecture, is run by
Toyota's affiliated parts supplier Aisin Seiki Co.
</P>
<P>
Many factory workers took a paid holiday for today, while some
others used the day for checking and tuning up plant facilities,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said that it will take about a week before
the firm can resume normal production.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that Toyota's output is likely to
decrease by 20,000 autos Monday and Tuesday alone due to the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of production will make it difficult for Toyota
to meet an expected surging demand for cars in Japan this year.
</P>
<P>
Japan's consumption tax will be raised to 5 percent on April 1
from the current 3 percent, and many consumers want to buy new
cars before the tax hike.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Receives 1.6 Million Foreign Tourists in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.6 million foreigners
visited Vietnam in 1996 with a year-on-year increase of 25
percent, the National Tourism Administration said today.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that most of the tourists came from
East and Southeast Asia and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the influx of foreign tourists to the improved
services and facilities as well as better management of the
tourism industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many visitors were attracted by the unique culture and ecology
of Vietnam's central Highlands provinces and the regions along the
Mekong delta.
</P>
<P>
Some other provinces in the country have also begun to develop
tourism industry with the projects of protecting the nature and
historical and cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam adopted an open-door policy in the late 1980s. It has
since signed agreements on tourism promotion with 12 countries and
regions including Singapore, Laos, Thailand and France.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is expected to receive 1.9 million foreign tourists
this year, the administration said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Loses 250 Million Dollars From Copper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM), the copper production monopolizer in Zambia, has
lost 250 million US Dollars in the last three years, because of
declining production.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Zambia Association of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry Executive Member Theo Bull in a latest
paper presented to the National Economic Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
The losses represent a loss of between 5 to 10 percent in the
total value of the conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
The situation has become more worrying than before because
this fearsome result is not even half way appreciated by the
public and apparently by the government itself, Bull said.
</P>
<P>
In the year to March 1995, the ZCCM made a small profit of
724,000 Dollars, but in the year to March 1996, the corporation
suffered a loss of 31.54 million Dollars because of sharp
reduction in production.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM recorded another loss of 76.67 million Dollars in the
second quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate's copper production had declined from
387,000 tons in 1992 to 307,000 tons in 1996, according to Bull's
paper.
</P>
<P>
The copper production marked a temporal increase to 432,000
tons in 1993 but it fell again to 393,000 tons in 1994 and
350,000 tons in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Year of Ox, China Ushers in Auspicious Animal (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For artists, the Year of Ox, starting on February 7, may have
more cultural significance.
</P>
<P>
A number of cities have hosted painting exhibitions and
calligraphy competitions, all on an ox theme.
</P>
<P>
"The ox is the symbol of the nation's qualities, such as hard
work, a plain style and a mild manner, as well as the spirit of
exploration," said Wang Guangqing, an artist well-known for his ox
paintings.
</P>
<P>
These time-honored virtues are becoming more valuable in a
country that is attempting to open its door wider to the outside
and striving to modernize itself, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qi Xiuhua, a 34-year-old farmer, is clipping 1,997 ox
paper-cuts to show her delight over the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
One of her works, "Golden Ox Kicks up Its Hoofs," was selected
by the Ministry of Posts and Communications as the official
pattern for the year's symbolic animal stamp. The market value of
the stamp has risen to several times the original value since it
was distributed early last month.
</P>
<P>
Major Beijing-based newspapers have been busy carrying articles
lauding "the spirit of the old ox," which may be defined as being
hardy and always ready to contribute to society.
</P>
<P>
Some articles criticize people's boastful attitude or tendency
to exaggerate, known in China as "Blowing An Ox."
</P>
<P>
And some called for an early preparation for the spring
plowing, which is expected to usher in a bigger harvest for
1997. According to an old Chinese saying, "In the year of the ox
or horse, it is time to achieve a higher yield."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Year of Ox, China Ushers in Auspicious Animal (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The dragon may be one of the
most widely recognized symbols of the Chinese civilization. But
don't underestimate the ox's contributions to the country's
culture and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese first tamed the wild beasts 6,000 years ago,
oxen have served as the major labor force on farmlands, and over
time China's ox population evolved into one of the biggest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
But their number is declining. While there are no accurate
figures, "more and more farmers are using tractors, which are
elbowing the ox out of modern history," explained Shi Youlong, an
official from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In these final days before the Year of Ox, China's lunar new
year, known as Spring Festival, goods bearing the animal's image
are hard to find in department stores. Shoppers may stumble upon
toy oxen in some stores, but store owners know that modern-minded
Chinese tempted by VCD players, computers and cars are less and
less interested in buying up the old-fashioned goods.
</P>
<P>
Nor does the animal hold its high-ranking position on holidays,
as it did in ancient times, when large numbers were killed as
sacrifices for gods.
</P>
<P>
There is one place where the ox is becoming more popular: the
dinner table.
</P>
<P>
The increased need for meat and milk has been a headache for
government officials, and in the 1980s, Beijing authorities had to
place the problem of a lack of milk at the top of their work
agenda. The problem has been eased over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
"The city now breeds 60,000 milk cows, double the figure of ten
years ago. Beijing urbanites drink a total of 400,000 kilograms of
milk per day," said Xu Zhongliang, head of the Beijing Cow Center.
</P>
<P>
The support of the cow industry is part of the "Vegetable
Basket Program," launched by the government to provide sufficient
and diversified non-staple food for the people.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Ministry figures show that the output of beef has
increased at a two-digit rate every year, much higher than that of
pork.
</P>
<P>
"I often eat beef, it tastes good and contains enough
calories," said Zhang Zeyue, a Beijinger. "And it gives me a new
option."
</P>
<P>
In many newly-opened fast food restaurants, hamburger is often
at the top of the menu, often ordered by young people.
</P>
<P>
However, pork is still the first and most traditional choice
for the majority of Chinese. China has more than 200 million pigs;
the number of ox is one-fourth or one-fifth that amount.
</P>
<P>
But in the long run, according to some experts, the ox industry
will have a more promising future because it is more economical,
as the oxen eat grass, while the pigs compete with man for grain.
</P>
<P>
"In many parts of China, the breeding of oxen has become a very
big industry," said Li Xirong, an expert from the State Planning
Commission.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Reshuffle Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South African policemen
who have not done their duty will be fired in a forthcoming
shake-up, the local daily The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
A major shake-up in the police at all levels is under
consideration to improve security service around the
country, South African Police Service (SAPS) National
Commissioner George Fivaz was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Policemen who did not or cannot perform at required standards
could expect to be replaced, Fivaz said, adding that "heads
should roll if the department does not meet its challenges in
1997."
</P>
<P>
The remarks by the police chief came in response to sharp
criticism by the National Party and the Democratic Party, both of
which called on the government to stop pussy-footing around and
take immediate and effective actions against increasing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the planned shake-up, Fivaz said measures will be
taken to streamline the existing SAPS structures and to work out
systems concerned to evaluate and enforce performance and service
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is in a period of transition from
apartheid to democracy, has been much troubled with increasing
violent crimes such as murders, robberies, hijackings and
rapes.
</P>
<P>
Policemen in the country have undoubtedly played a positive
and important role in curbing the crimes. However, the public
believe that the police should take more responsibility for the
current social disorder.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa to Clamp Down on Rampant Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A tough clamp-down on
illegal firearms, crime syndicates and corruption in the criminal
justice system are the key features of a new anti-crime plan of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Sowetan today quoted Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi, who announced the plan yesterday, as
saying that 1997 would be the "year of service delivery" in an
attempt to bring down rampant crime and establish an accountable
service to the public.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the five-point plan, which emerged from a recent
closed-door meeting of the ruling African National Congress, was
a priority on the 1997 agenda for the South African Police
Services.
</P>
<P>
The plan was focused on a sharp crackdown on illegal firearms;
extending the anti-corruption drive to all sectors of the
criminal justice system; tightening the noose on crime syndicate;
stepping up measures to stop violence against women and children;
and boosting public cooperation with police to curb vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mufamadi stressed that the clamp-down on
firearms would "give us the possibility of maximising the impact
in various categories of crime, including robbery and car
hijacking".
</P>
<P>
Although the initiatives to root out corruption in the police
service had been highly successful in the past year, said
Mufamadi, his ministry now wanted to extend that to include other
sectors of the criminal justice system "because of the
correlation between crime and corruption"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz also
announced a massive clean-up measure of the police force to
revitalise its flagging performance against the increasing crime.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Parliament Approves 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's parliament, by an
overwhelming majority, approved Monday night the 1997 state budget
 totalling 6,433 billion Lebanese pounds (4.13 billion
U.S. dollars) in expenditures, 16 milliond dollars down from the
1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
During the five days of debate, the half-Moslem-Half-Christian
unicameral house witnessed fierce attacks at the economic
policies of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's government.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget was still ratified after the government
made a minor amendment earlier last week at the request of the
parliamentary financial and budget committee.
</P>
<P>
Only one deputy voted against the new budget and 10 others
atstained, which was called by Daily Star, the sole English daily
in Beirut, as a win by the government regarding the budgest debate.
</P>
<P>
The national budget for the fiscal year starting on January
1, 1997 and ending on December 31, 1997, projects a budget
deficit of 36.26 percent, compared with that of 37.7 percent in
last year's budget. The deficit is estimated at 2,333 billion LPs
(1.495 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget, public debt and the interest due
on it stand at 2,700 Lebanese LPs (1.73 billion dollars), or 42
percent of the total expenditure, compared with 32 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget forecasts a slight increase of revenues to
4,100 billion LPs (2.63 billion dollars) from last year's
projection of 4,025 billion LPs (2.58 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It expects that the revenue of taxation will increase to
3,152 billion LPs (2.02 billion dollars) from 3,055 billion
LPs(1.96 billion dollars) in 1996, but revenue from non-taxation
sources will decrease to 708 billion LPs (450 million dollars)
from 740 billion LPs (474 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sale of public properties to meet debt payment is
estamated at 240 billion LPs (150 million dollars), or 10
billion LPs (6.4 million dollars) more than that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The margin in the expenditures is to be met by the revenue
from the domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
Among the expenditures, 738 billion LPs (473 million dollars)
is allocated to the Defense Ministry, with 79.4 billion LPs
(50.9 million dollars) more than that in the 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
The new budget forecasts that the gross domestic product
(GDP) will reach 24,648 billion LPs (15.8 billion dollars) in
1997.
</P>
<P>
It estimates the real economic growth in 1996 at 4 percent,
with a GDP of 20,552 billion LPs (13.17 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Get Wiser With Money (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic reforms have taught
Chinese people to become wiser at squeezing out the largest
possible yield from their expanding pockets. And most often
they're successful.
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when Chinese put all of their surplus money
in banks. Modern-day Chinese have become skillful at weighing the
pros and cons of accessible investment alternatives and are
following a new motto: speculate to accumulate.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that Chinese, whose incomes have been
growing rapidly along with an economic growth rate averaging
around 10 percent, reaped 320 billion yuan (about 38.5 billion US
dollars) in bank interest payments and 120 billion yuan in returns
on securities investment last year. The combined figure was almost
ten percent of the total income of urban and rural Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Though the lion's share of Chinese people's surplus cash still
ends in savings accounts, an increasing proportion is being
invested in stocks, bonds, funds, stamps, antiques and real
estate, observers say, describing the switch as an indication that
Chinese have become wiser with their money.
</P>
<P>
The observers point out that China's successful flotation of a
record amount of treasury bonds last year, at more than 190
billion yuan, explains one point of view of ordinary
Chinese: China's treasury bonds usually carry an interest rate
higher than bank deposits of the same term.
</P>
<P>
China's first issue of government bonds this year, which
started in mid-January, has met with unexpected investor's
enthusiasm and ran out in days in some cities. To cater to a
growing need, China this year plans to float 15 billion yuan in
corporate bonds in addition to a treasury bond issue that is
expected to exceed 250 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Like people elsewhere, Chinese invest in bonds mainly to hedge
against financial risks and to secure a stable economic return.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to get an economic yield higher than bank deposits and
bonds, more and more Chinese are turning to the stock markets,
which were officially established in the early 1990s. There were
more than 20 million stock investors in China by the end of last
year and the actual number is believed to be much larger, as
several people often trade under the same account.

Stock investors told Xinhua that they are confident in the
prospects of China's stock market because of the overall good
national economy.
</P>
<P>
"I have switched one third of my family's bank savings to
stocks," said a retired official surnamed Liang.
</P>
<P>
"While other people who care about short-term gains, I pay more
attention to the medium and long-term yields," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Another investor said he is keen on a combination of investment
instruments.
</P>
<P>
"I have invested in stocks, stamps and circular coins," he
said. "And my gains from stamps and coins are larger than from the
stock market."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are 17 million stamp investors and
several million coin collectors in China, and both numbers are
still on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The stamp and coin markets, nicknamed the "second stock
market," have attracted an increasing number of individual and
institutional investors. Prices of the two products have gone up
steadily since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that a huge and rapidly-expanding amount of
savings deposits, which exceeded 3.8 trillion yuan by the end of
last year, means that individual Chinese will have a greater
potential to make investments in a wider range of financial
products.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Hold Local Elections in Mid-April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to hold elections for local administrative officials
throughout the country in mid-April, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the exact dates for the local polls, to be held for
choosing members of different local bodies in nearly 4,000
villages, 51 municipalities and 75 districts of the country, are
expected to be finalized within this week, an official of the
Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year tenure of current local bodies in Nepal will
expire in mid-April after the last local elections held in 1992.
</P>
<P>
There will be around 14,500 polling centers throughout the
country and more than half of the country's population of 20
million is expected to vote in the local elections, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
But two organizations of local administration bodies have
objected against the Election Commission's decision to hold local
elections as a decentralization law is still awaiting
parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of District Development Committees and the Nepal
Municipalities Association Monday issued a statement demanding the
government to hold the elections only after introducing the
Decentralization Act, which is expected to give more authority to
local bodies.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the government will present a bill on the
Decentralization Act to the parliament during its forthcoming
winter session to be convened later this month.

<HEADLINE> Western City to Relieve Pollution by Removing Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Lanzhou, capital city of
northwest China's Gansu Province, may cure its worsening air
pollution problem by cutting down a mountain in its eastern part,
according to "China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The city, located in a long, narrow deep basin which is only
two kilometers wide at its narrowest spot, is seriously polluted
by the heavy industrial smog and coal burning, which is trapped in
the basin.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a person is smoking in a house with all the doors
closed," said Yu Xonghou, director of the Lanzhou Environmental
Protection Bureau. "That's why the city has decided to consider
such a drastic plan for relief: Blow a gaping hole in the
Daqingshan Mountains, 40 kilometers east of the city."
</P>
<P>
The city will use high-pressure hoses to blast away sandy loess
ridges east of the city, tripling the width of a narrow pass of
Daqingshan Mountain to about six kilometers and lowering the peaks
by 150 meters.
</P>
<P>
It will take an estimated two years and around 100 million yuan
(12 million US dollars) to remove the 30 million cubic meters of
mountain.
</P>
<P>
If a door is opened for the city, fresh air or easterly winds
can blow in to dilute the dirty air and smog. But no one knows if
this "door" in the mountains will work, Yu said.

<HEADLINE> India Makes Efforts to Buy Russian Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian navy is
desperately trying to acquire an aircraft carrier to replace the
decommissioned "Vikrant," The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is grim for the Indian navy as the other aircraft
carrier "Viraat" will also retire after five years, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The navy has opted for the Russian ship "Admiral Gorshkov" but
the price tag is high.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Minister of External
Affairs I.K. Gujral are expected to make efforts to get the ship
at a less price when they visit Russia shortly.
</P>
<P>
Several teams of the Indian navy and government had visited
Russia last year to assess the ship and found it suitable for
Indian conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, however, asked for a price the Indians were
unable to pay.
</P>
<P>
Deve Gowda and Gujral have reportedly agreed to take up the
issue with their Russian counterparts during their coming visits
there, sources said, adding that it is hoped that something
positive will come out of their visits.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's Next Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- There is little doubt that
Nawaz Sharif, Chief of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), will
become the next prime minister of this South Asian country as
early results today gave the PML-N a clear victory over its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, 46, is a law graduate from Pakistan's oldest seat
of learning, the Punjab University.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is a wealthy industrialist whose family owns the Ittefaq
Industrial conglomerate, one of Pakistan's largest industrial
group with interest in metal, sugar and textile sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was inducted into the world of politics in 1981 at the
age of 30 when he was appointed finance minister of Pakistan's
most populous province of Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he became the youngest Chief Minister of
Punjab Province where he developed a well-deserved reputation for
being an able, hands-on administrator.
</P>
<P>
He was reelected to this position in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Sharif led a group of nine parties to victory in the 1990
general elections under the banner of the Islamic Democratic
Alliance following the dismissal of Benazir's first government by
the then president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
</P>
<P>
With a two-thirds majority in the lower house, Sharif launched
a bold economic program involving lavish spending on
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's stint as prime minister, which lasted only for 30
months, was marked by an accent on opening up the economy,
energizing the entrepreneurial skills of the people and working as
a bridge builder among the provinces of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It was during this period that Sharif demonstrated that he was
a doer who delivers.
</P>
<P>
when his elected government was dismissed arbitrarily by Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, on April 18, 1993, Sharif's defiance earned him
popular support across the length and breadth of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
As prime minister of a coalition government, which included
Pakistan's largest party of Islamic fundamentalists, he pursued
economic policies with a free-market orientation and gave a nod
toward extending the influence of Islam.

<P>
However, the fundamentalist Jammat-e-Islami left the coalition
after Sharif supported the United States in the Persian Gulf War
and backed a UN plan to install an interim government in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Since the dismissal last November of the Benazir government,
the PML Chief has emerged as the likeliest alternative to his
political rival, whose popularity fell amid economic troubles and
persistent allegation of corruption by her husband, Asif Ali
Zardari.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has built support as a chummy politician from the PML's
power base, Punjab, a favorite of the business community and a
persistent Benazir critic.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's campaign has focused on the Benazir government's
management of the economy and alleged involvement in corruption.
</P>
<P>
He has promised that if his party comes to power this time, the
first priority will be to revamp Pakistan's economy. He has also
promised free health care and education, subsidies for taxicabs
and new major highways.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has rejected a cut in defense spending, which swallows
about 35 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that this time a return to power by Sharif and
his pro-business party will restore business confidence in
Pakistan's economy.

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Although Yuan Puliang is an
ordinary farmer in Nanzhangloucun village, Shangdong Province, he
speaks German so fluently that he once surprised German natives
visiting in the area.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is one of ten interpreters sponsored by the village to
study foreign languages in universities in China or abroad. Four
of the villagers studied German in language institutes in Munich,
Germany; two studied Spanish in Beijing Foreign Language
University; and two studied Korean in Shandong Normal University.
</P>
<P>
They were selected from among the village's high school
graduates, with tuition split between the village coffers and the
individual students. After two or three years, some returned to
the village; others worked in its enterprises stationed abroad.
</P>
<P>
Nanzhangloucan has had frequent economic exchanges with
Germany, the United States, and Argentina in recent years, and
knows only too well the inconvenience the language barrier can
cause when communicating with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to enable ourselves to communicate freely with
foreign friends, which will help us to start business in the outer
world. It will also broaden the horizon of peasants," said Yuan
Xiangsheng, head of the village.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan said that the Central Bank of Thailand is taking
necessary actions to protect the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
He said on Monday that the government would continue to work to
improve Thailand's economic fundamentals to build confidence among
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index slumped
to its lowest point in five years, dropping 26.41 points, or 3.35
percent, to close at 761.63, and the central bank set the mid-rate
at 25.87 baht to the dollar, a level last seen in mid-1990.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay expressed confidence that the Thai economy remains
strong, adding that the sharp declines of the SET index, 7.1
percent last week and 3.35 percent on Monday, were not due simply
to the weaker baht.
</P>
<P>
Corporate earnings are also a cause for the recent weakness, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts added that some local players were withdrawing cash
ahead of the upcoming Chinese new year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rerngchai Marakanond, governor of the Bank of
Thailand, also insisted that the central bank would defend the
baht at all costs.
</P>
<P>
Although the foreign exchange market appeared peaceful on
Monday, Rerngchai noted that everyone was awaiting the US federal
open market committee meeting to see whether the key US interest
rate would be raised. Tat decision will be known late tonight or
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He believed that an increase was unlikely because inflationary
pressure has eased in the US

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Urged to Adopt Urgent Currency Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bulgarian economist
appealed today for urgent measures to support the crumbling
Bulgarian lev and stop hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
Iva Angelov, who served as an economic adviser to the newly
resigned Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, made the appeal in an
article, warning that unless a system of currency-control
committee was immediately set up, the inflation rate for the whole
year will hit or surpass 10,000-15,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
He stressed if the currency-control measures were not taken,
economic reforms this year or in the coming years would remain an
empty talk, which have resulted in the present all-round crisis in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has been facing a political crisis resulted from the
dispute between the ruling Socialists and the opposition Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF) over forming a government since December
21, when Videnov, a socialist, stepped down as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Bulgaria's inflation rate hit 50
percent a month and unemployment rate reached 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Angelov noted continuing to delay economic reforms would push
the country onto the brink of destruction, with its gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1997 diving by another 4-5 percent over last year
and the number of the jobless rising 350,000-400,000 by 23-25
percent.
</P>
<P>
He urged all political factions to rapidly reach a compromise
and take currency-control measures to allow the lev to directly
link with the U.S. dollar or the German mark so as to fix the
exchange rates, which could bring in contained inflation and
interest rate, increase loans in manufacturing enterprises and
make market prices more predictable.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year the production is expected to recover,
the GDP to realize "zero" growth and inflation to be controlled
within 100-110 percent, the economist predicted.
</P>
<P>
Economists admit that the adoption of currency-control system
would temporarily cause tightened finance and budget and
150,000-200,000 employees in the manufacturing sectors out of job,
but the total number of the jobless would be 200,000-300,000 less
than that under the present situation.
</P>
<P>
They believe that after the setup of the new currency system,
the shortage of foreign currency would be filled by the World
Bank, the foreign exchange market could be stabilized and people's
income would be stable and increasing.
</P>
<P>
However, with a paralyzed government, the widely expected
system of currency committee is hard to start, for a stable
government is needed to negotiate or sign agreements with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Cut Unproductive Imports to Lower Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai economic ministers have
agreed to take further steps to curb imports, in particular
unproductive and luxury consumer goods, to reduce the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
They have requested officials of the finance, commerce and
industry ministries to propose an action plan, according to a
local press report today.
</P>
<P>
The import cuts are likely to affect expensive cars. Vehicles
worth 34.4 billion baht (1.38 billion US dollars) were imported
each year from 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The import slowdown measures may also be applied to cosmetics,
home furniture, alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, fruit,
vegetables, apparel and footwear.
</P>
<P>
Imports of these items totaled 16.2 billion baht (648 million
dollars) for the first 10 months of last year, compared with an
average annual value of 15.33 billion (613.2 million dollars) from
1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government has already cut spending on major military
purchases and huge projects which have low priority.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government aims to reduce current account deficit,
which stood at about 8.2 percent of national domestic product last
year, to 7.7 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich, Poor Worsening in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the rich and the
poor are getting worse and worse in western Germany, said the
latest statistics from Labor Bureau of Bremen.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, in the period from 1989-1992, the
number of people with annual incomes exceeding 1 million marks
(about 1,500,000 U.S.dollars) rose to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of the poor is on the trend of
sharply increasing, with the people applying for the social relief
hitting 3,300,000.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed to the sluggish economic situation in
Germany, the increasing numbers of bankruptcy enterprises and the
high rate of jobless.
</P>
<P>
The situation in eastern Germany was even worser. In
Brandenburg, where low unemployment rate is often seen, 18 out of
every one thousand people were dependent on relief, amounting to a
total of 45,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sachsen-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern also witnessed more
people living on the government relief, of which the people at the
age of 50 and above and the minors accounted for 50 percent of
the total.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Early results of Monday's
general election in Pakistan today gave Nawaz Sharif, Chief of the
Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) a clear victory.
</P>
<P>
With election results still flowing in, the PML-N has already
scored 122 out of 217 National Assembly seats and there is little
doubt that Sharif will be Pakistan's next prime minister,
Political Secretary of the PML-N Mahar Liaquart told Xinhua this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Television also confirmed the news.
</P>
<P>
The PML-N has built a clear lead in National Assembly polling
in the Punjab, the country's largest and most populous province,
which holds 115 National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
The PML-N's arch rival -- the Pakistan People's Party led by
Benazir Bhutto was in the lead in Sindh province, Benazir's
hometown.
</P>
<P>
And the PML-N has swept 80 percent of the National Assembly
seats with its ally the Awami National Party in the North West
Frontier Province, which has 26 National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
A total of 113 National Assembly seats were being contested
because pollings of the two constituencies are postponed due to
the death of a candidate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
While the detailed number of seats in each province is not
available for the moment, Liaquart told Xinhua in a interview
early this morning that the PML-N gained about 100 National
Assembly seats in Punjab alone.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson said here today that Sweden will not be isolated whatever
stance it takes on European Monetary Union (EMU) -- nor will its
absence from the union cast any negative influences.
</P>
<P>
Persson, who is in Vienna on a one-day visit, was speaking
at a joint press conference with his Austrian counterpart, Viktor
Klima.
</P>
<P>
He said Sweden needed a national referendum to decide whether
or not to enter the monetary union, because many people in the
country opposed the idea of entering the union.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party had
decided to hold such a referendum in September, followed by a
parliamentary vote in October or November for a final decision on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Sweden would not be isolated even if it decided not to enter
the union, as there were also strong objections against the union
in Britain and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Persson said the European Union should make equal contributions
to reducing unemployment and promoting environmental protection
as it did in enhancing monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish prime minister said that he and Klima shared the
same views on most major issues concerning the European Union,
except for the EMU entry.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Deadly on Drink and Drugs - But Not Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Marriage brings a sharp drop
in the abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs among Americans, but the
demon tobacco habit hangs on much tighter, a study shows.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Michigan found that becoming
engaged, getting married and having children were all associated
with a steep drop in the use of alcohol and illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
The survey of young people showed that 41 percent of single
subjects reported heavy alcohol use, while 28 percent of the
married reported such behavior.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine and marijuana use registered similar steep declines
after marriage.
</P>
<P>
However, the "marriage effect", as called by many, was often
reversed by divorce, which was associated with a return to bad
habits. But remarriage could drive down drug and alcohol abuse
once again.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found about 18 percent of the group smoked
while single and about 16 percent after marriage. During
pregnancy, some women quit smoking and using alcohol and illicit
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The study, called "Monitoring the Future", collected
information from more than 33,000 young adults.

BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
introduced one-year multiple re-entry visas and three-year work
permits for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The relaxation, expected to be effective within two weeks, has
been approved by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and Interior
Minister Sanoh Thienthong.
</P>
<P>
Veeakorn Kamprakob, a PM's office minister, was quoted today by

caused by short visas and work permits that force foreigners to
seek extensions.
</P>
<P>
The one-year visa will allow foreigners to visit Thailand five
times without having to obtain visas every time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a one-stop service center will be established to
facilitate the issuing of visas and work permits to investors,
particularly those bringing in more than two million baht (80,000
US dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prefecture of Lijiang Recovers from Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- It was just a year ago that a
disastrous earthquake hit Lijiang Prefecture in Southwest China's
Yunnan Province. It killed 322 people, injured 3,700 and caused an
economic loss of five billion yuan (60 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Now the local Naxi people welcome compatriots from Hong Kong
and abroad to look at how they have rebuilt their home city,
today's China Daily quoted He Dunqi, head of Lijiang Prefecture,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Donations from Hong Kong and overseas Chinese amounted to
several hundred million yuan after the earthquake hit on February
3, 1996. The earthquake registered seven on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Dayan, a small town with a history of more than 800 years under
Lijiang Prefecture, has seen great changes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
A 20,000-square-meter cement building which stood at the
entrance of the town has disappeared. Instead of being pulled
apart by the earthquake, it was demolished by local people as they
rebuilt the town.
</P>
<P>
The building was built during the "cultural revolution"
(1966-76) and did not match the style of the ancient architecture
of the town, said He Zixing, magistrate of Lijiang County. It
had been considered "modern rubbish."
</P>
<P>
Seventeen cement bridges were replaced by wooden ones in the
rebuilding campaign to restore the original image of the ancient
town.
</P>
<P>
The local government issued a circular to more than 10,000
households within the town requiring that houses damaged by the
quake should be reconstructed as they looked long ago.
</P>
<P>
Last September, more than two tons of rubbish were
transported out of the town; 38 sanitation workers have been
appointed to collect garbage bags across town.
</P>
<P>
A sewage treatment project with an investment of 9.2 million
yuan will be completed by the end of March, and a drainage system
is under construction.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate is quoted as saying that the town applied for a
place on the United Nations' cultural heritage list in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the prefecture had a good agricultural
harvest last year.
</P>
<P>
The county of Lijiang gathered 132,000 tons of grain and beans
last year, 3,695 tons more than the previous year. This
represented an increase of almost three percent.

"As an added attraction, overseas travellers who book airline
flights to China and then travel in the country will enjoy more
discounted air ticket prices in China this year," CAAC spokesman
and Vice-Minister Bao Peide told China Daily in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"Travellers can buy air tickets for domestic flights at a 30
percent discount in off seasons from January 1 to March 31 and in
December. A 20 percent reduction will be available in peak seasons
from April 1 to November 30," the official explained.
</P>
<P>
In spite of an estimated 10 percent plus growth in passenger
flow, CAAC earlier announced that ticket prices for domestic
flights will not increase this year.
</P>
<P>
Bao, who is also deputy director for the organizing committee
for "Visit China '97" , said the number of overseas tourists is
estimated at more than 40 million and a considerable number of
them will fly on Chinese airlines.
</P>
<P>
To meet the new demand, Bao's administration will raise
aviation service quality to a new high. He invited supervision
from both domestic and overseas passengers. He added that six air
routes, 10 airports, 30 flights and 30 ticket offices have been
selected to lead the effort to create good service in the aviation
sector.
</P>
<P>
CAAC has also publicized 13 concrete measures to provide
convenient ground and in-flight service, which include adding
service facilities in terminals, shortening procedures and
providing better food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister emphasized that "flight safety is of
exceptional importance during this year of travel." He said CAAC
is working to guarantee that the year is free of flight accidents.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, China's aviation sector had set a record
of 30 months of safe flying.
</P>
<P>
Bao said CAAC is co-operating with the International Civil
Aviation Organizing (ICAL) to establish a CNS-ATM communication
system.
</P>
<P>
International air links are planned to South America this year
as well. Efforts will also be made to open several international
air ways to shorten flight time.
</P>
<P>
With government investment in civil-aviation infrastructure
hitting a historic high, the year will see the construction and
completion of many airports. Priority will be given to the
show-case expansion project at Beijing Capital International
Airport, which will open in 1999, as well as eight airports to be
completed and opened to traffic this year.

<HEADLINE> New Ways Urged to Provide Quality Service in Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Pen Peiyun has
urged that new ways be found to upgrade the quality of family
planning services in a move to further control China's rapid
population growth, today's People's Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Pen also called for efforts to step up the reform of the
medical insurance system for urban workers during her inspection
in central China's Hunan Province from January 25 to February 1,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It cited Pen as saying that the birth rate in Hunan has dropped
fastest among all Chinese provinces, but efforts should be
redoubled to hit a higher goal in the family planning work.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has carried out successful public
education campaigns to discuss family planning, including the
medical services available for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The State Councillor stressed that officials and medical
workers involved in the work should be carefully trained to meet
the needs of China's future efforts in the area.
</P>
<P>
Pen also praised the work the province has done in reform of
the medical insurance system, saying experience shows that the new
system of combining social coverage with individual funding can
ensure basic medical support for workers, curb the rapid rise of
medical costs, and help the reform and development of medical
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Expects 5 Billion Dollars From Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela in 1997 expects to
continue profiting from its petroleum exports which are estimated
to exceed 5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Energy and Mining Ministry says the Petroleo
de Venezuela (PDVSA) will continue to take advantage of external
opportunities this year in accordance with the needs of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The goal could be reached because the prices of the petroleum
basket had remained stable since the end of 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan petroleum prices are maintaining stability, at
between 23.51 dollars/barrel at the end of 1996 and 23.09
dollars/barrel at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1996, the price went up considerably -- in
comparison with the two previous years -- from 20.29
dollars/barrel to close at 23.51 dollars/barrel in December.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry is the fundamental source of hard
currency earnings and the basis of economic activities in the
country.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Plants to be Revamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of
Machine-Building Industry has set deadlines for 30 state-owned
debt-ridden auto plants to work out ways to survive intensifying
market competition, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The industry annually turns out 1.45 million vehicles, but they
are producted by 123 auto plants instead of only several
enterprise groups as in western nations, where a single company
turns out millions of vehicles a year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue," it quoted
Zhang Xiaoyu, director-general of the ministry's automotive
industry department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign that will decide the fate of many unprofitable
auto plants, bankruptcy should be eliminated as much as possible
for the plants, which last year produced less than 200 vehicles on
average, he said, adding integrating them into bigger enterprises
or merging with others will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun-based First Automotive Corp, the Hubei-based
Dongfeng Motor Group and the Nanjing-based Yuejin Motor Corp have
successfully expanded by taking in small plants and are further
expanding in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
However, the real challenge will come in the next two years,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's strategy, the automotive industry should
grow into an economic pillar at home and be competitive on the
world market. Several huge enterprise groups, instead of many, are
to prop up by 2010.

Netanyahu's upcoming meetings with Palestine National Authority

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- In another major step to
implement national treatment for its foreign-funded enterprises,
Guangdong will encourage these companies to sell all their
products that meet China's industrial policies to the domestic
market, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A local law that requires inventors to sell a percentage of
their products according to their investment volume will be
eliminated, Huang Zhiwei, vice-director of Guangdong Foreign
Economy and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The new rules were expected to be put out in the next few
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangdong adopted a rule setting the percentage of
products foreign-funded enterprises could sell in China.
</P>
<P>
For example, an enterprise with a minimum capital investment of
less than five million US dollars was allowed to sell 50 percent
of its products in China. Enterprises with more than 15 million US
dollars in overseas investment could sell up to 100 percent of
their products in China.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in mountainous or remote areas with a minimum
initial investment of 1.5 million dollars can sell entire their
products in China.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong received 13.9 billion in foreign funds in 1996. It
expects the new stimulus in 1997 will lend momentum to maintain
capital inflow at the same level as last year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted a moderate way that represents equal competition
and arouses investor' enthusiasm has to be worked out soon to cope

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Muslim League (N)
was still in the lead in both the National Assembly and provincial
assembly results announced early today.
</P>
<P>
According to the results announced at 6:10 a.m. (local time)
today, the PML(N) is taking an upper hand in both national and
provincial assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan People's Party of Benazir Bhutto, who was sacked by
President Farooq Leghari on November 5, won only one seat in the
National Assembly at 6:10 a.m.(local time) today.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) led the pack with 27 out of the 36 announced
National Assembly seats and 65 out of the 124 announced Provincial
seats, according to elections officials.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) leader and Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz
Sharif said, earlier in the day, the results so far for his party
in Monday's elections is very much better than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
And he believed that his party will get a majority seats in the
217-seat National Assembly.
</P>

largest and most populous province in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The party has won at least 90 National Assembly seats in
Pakistan's largest Province of Punjab, a PML(N) official told
Xinhua early this morning from Lahore.
</P>
<P>
And in the countrywide the PML(N) has so far secured 110
National Assembly seats, he said.
</P>

There are 115 National Assembly seats for the Punjab Province.
A total of 113 seats are being contested. Pollings of two
constituencies are postponed due to the death of a candidate on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liaquart claimed that the PML(N) is expected to win about 125
seats countrywide to form a majority government.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Election Commission declined to
confirm it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the PPP Media Department here alleged
that the polling in the Punjab was rigged.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif has won the two National Assembly seats in Lahore,
Punjab, and Abbottabad in the North West Frontier province.

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Public
Health Chen Minzhang has placed tumor prevention and
rehabilitation into the social primary health care program in
order to reduce the number of occurrences of this fatal disease
and provide better services for patients, China Daily reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on medical scientists to expand
research on preventing the disease, which kills some 1.3 million
people annually.
</P>
<P>
Chen spoke last weekend in Beijing during a gathering for some
2,000 cancer patients from beijing and Tianjin. Most of those
attending the gathering have survived more than five years after
initial treatment.
</P>
<P>
The party, sponsored by the Cancer Rehabilitation Society under
the All-China Anti-Cancer Association, was held to exchange
greetings for the Spring Festival and encourage the patients to
continue the battle against malignant tumors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Public Health state that each
year some 1.6 million cancer cases are reported. Cancer has become
the second largest fatal disease in China next to heart disease,
it says.
</P>
<P>
China has currently more than two million people suffering from
malignant tumors, and about one family in 200 is affected by
tumors, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
To date, 39 local organizations for cancer rehabilitants have
been set up across the country and carry out a wide variety of
rehabilitation activities.
</P>
<P>
Li Shufen, division chief in charge of chronic disease control
with the Ministry, is quoted as saying that the ministry has
worked out a five-year national program on tumor control that will
provide anti-tumor education among 60 percent of the urbanites and
30 percent of the rural population by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by the end of this century, more than 95 percent of
new-born babies will be vaccined against hepatitis B, which often
causes liver cancer, the newspaper reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate Monday
night finally ratified the 433.8 billion peso (16.6 billion U.S.
dollars) national budget for 1997 after a more-than-one-month
delay.
</P>
<P>
The contentious budget, which had already passed through the
House of Representatives last week, was approved by the Senate by
a vote of 18-2 and is expected to be signed into law by President
Fidel Ramos within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The final draft of the budget, known as the General
Appropriations Act, was forged last Thursday after two months of
negotiations between the House and Senate panels over the issue of
the Countrywide Development Funds (CDF).
</P>
<P>
But the Senate failed to pass the budget last week after the
minority bloc led by Senator Neptali Gonzales asked for a review
of the final draft.
</P>
<P>
Under the new budget, the Department of Education, Culture, and
Sports gets the lion's share of 56.1 billion pesos (2.1 billion
dollars), followed by the Public Works and Highways, with 53.8
billion pesos (2 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Party Organized for Students Unable to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A grand party was organized in
Beijing yesterday for students who were unable to go home for the
upcoming Spring Festival on Friday, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 students from 21 universities in the capital city
attended the festivity co-sponsored by the Forestry University
of China, the China Communist Youth League Central Committee, the
All-China Federation of Students and the Beijing Municipal Youth
League Committee.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival is a traditionally time of family reunion in
China. Almost every one living away from home wants to take a
train, bus or flight to rejoin their family for the festival.
</P>
<P>
However, financial or other difficulties prevent many Beijing
students from remote or underdeveloped regions from seeing their
families.
</P>
<P>
"But they are not forgotten by their colleges and the
government," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A full dinner and a show with 25 acts, which lasted more than
two hours, were staged. Famous actors Feng Gong and Zhao Benshan
were among the performers.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy and very grateful," said Kun Gaishen, a
third-year student at Capital Normal University. Kun is from an
underdeveloped village in Western Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time I attended such party," he added, who
has not returned home for two years.
</P>
<P>
Moved by the atmosphere at the party, and the students'
difficulties, Feng Gong announced after his performance that he
would aid a poor university student by pay all the expenses for
four years of study.
</P>
<P>
"I missed the chance to go to university," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
"You are all the lucky ones to get this chance. To give a hand
to one of you is within my capability and I should do it," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Now Largest Importer Of Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, which was once the
fourth largest exporter of cotton in the world, has now become the
largest importer of the same product due to poor harvests in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic planning department of Brazil's
National Basic Commodities Company, the country in 1996-97 year
will yield 340,000 tons of cotton although internal consumption
will require 850,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Consultative Cotton Council informed that the
country will have to spend 900 million U.S. dollars this year to
import 561,000 tons of cotton in order to satisfy internal
demand which will mean an increase of 43.8 percent compared with
that of last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Brazil imported 390,000 tons of cotton at a cost of
730 million dollars, a figure equal to 15 percent of this South
American country's trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Agriculture Department sustained that the state's
monopoly of cotton seeds constitutes the main reason for the
poor harvests.

<HEADLINE> 1.22 Million Gansu Farmers Bid Farewell to Poor Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.22 million
poverty-stricken farmers in northwest China's Gansu Province, home
of one of the largest poor populations in China, were able to
improve their circumstances last year and have sufficient food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
With help from the provincial government, the 1996 annual per
capita income of Gansu farmers reached 1,100 yuan (137
U.S. dollars) -- 220 yuan (27 dollars) more than that of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province's total grain output reached 16 billion kilograms
last year.
</P>
<P>
To help the farmers rid themselves of poverty, the provincial
government sent 15,000 officials to the remote mountainous
villages last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials helped farmers upgrade farmland by building
rainwater collection ponds and greenhouses, and applied
water-conservation technology.
</P>
<P>
These methods guaranteed the sound growth of crop in the arid
poor areas, where the farmers have also planted fruit trees that
have brought in much income.
</P>
<P>
Gansu also conducted three large-scale surveys of the poor
population last year, and established records for poor villages
and households.
</P>
<P>
Gansu expects to help the remaining 3.75 million poor farmers
shake off poverty by the end of this century.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhau) -- England announced on Monday that
it still holds the plan to bid for the 2006 World Cup, despite the
fact that Germany was the only candidate of European soccer's
governing body UEFA.
</P>
<P>
UEFA had confirmed last week end that it had endorsed Germany's
bid to host world soccer's festival. Prime Minister John Major
called UEFA's move "outrageous."
</P>
<P>
But UEFA insisted it had backed the German bid as far back as
1993 and expressed "astonishment" that England should now plan to
submit its own candidacy.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the sport's world governing body, said Monday that
England was free to put forward its bid despite UEFA's stance.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody stands the same chance," FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said. "Never before have we had a continent coming in for
one or the other candidate."
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Germans have declared their interest since 1993. But
this is not a case of first come, first served." Cooper added.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will select the 2006 World Cup host in June, 2000. South
Africa and countries from South America are also expected to
submit bids.
</P>
<P>
England last hosted the World Cup in 1966 and they decided to
stage the world event again after the successful staging of last
summer's Euro 96 championships.
</P>
<P>
Germany last hosted the World Cup in 1974.

GUANGZHOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A 93-year-old woman presumed
dead was rescued from near-cremation at a mortuary in this capital
of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
On January 20, the woman, surnamed Li, who suffered from
dementia, fell into a coma at her home. However, she showed signs
of muscle response, and was able to swallow food, according to the
Beijing Evening News.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of January 24, her family discovered she was no
longer able to drink anything, and her limbs had stiffened.
Thinking she was dead, they called the mortuary to come for the
body.
</P>
<P>
That evening, when a mortuary worker tried to tie an
identification tag to Li's hand, he felt her move and realized she
was breathing.
</P>
<P>
The emergency medical care service was called to the scene and
determined the woman had low blood pressure and a rapid heart beat
brought on by diabetes.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Collects More Tax from Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital collected
more than 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) of income
tax from foreigners in Beijing in January, marking a good opening
for the year's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
The capital received 130 million yuan (about 15 million
dollars) from foreigner personal income taxes last month, up 45.3
percent from December 1996, according to the city's foreign
investment tax bureau.
</P>
<P>
Taxation officials said Monday that steady economic growth and
a good investment environment brought more overseas workers to
Beijing, which increased the tax pool and partly contributed to
the rise of personal income tax revenue, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In January, 216 more foreigners working in Beijing than in
December reported their income to taxation authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more taxable income, such as year-end bonuses for
foreign employees, helped boost tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Other factors for the increased revenue are intensified
taxation management and improved services for taxpayers, taxation
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The taxation bureau has tightened control on tax declaration
system, requiring taxpayers to report their income before 7th each
month.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the municipal government received more than 70
percent of the taxes when foreigners declared their taxable income.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate foreign taxpayers, the taxation bureau also
dispatched English-speaking officials to collect taxes from
foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Economic news Briefs in Latin America (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are recent
economic news briefs in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- The governments of Brazil and Paraguay will
build a second bridge to join Foz DO Iguazu in the Brazilian
zone with de Este, a city in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Both governments will sign the corresponding agreements this
June or July
</P>
<P>
The new bridge which will measure 55 meters long and will
cost approximately 40 million U.S. dollars, will relieve traffic
on the La Amistad bridge.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- 11.2 percent of the exports made last year by
Brazil to the Southern Common Market (Mercosur, its acronym in
Spanish) were shipped to Uruguay, the market which absorbed the
smallest amount of Brazilian products.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the goods exported to the countries of
that regional trade bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and
Paraguay) were shipped to the Argentine market and 18.1 percent
to the Paraguayan one.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian exports to its three Mercosur partners totalled 7.305
billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
MADRID -- Spain signed several social security agreements
with Argentina and Chile that update previous ones and recognize,
mutually, the rights of its workers in matters of salaries and
social benefits.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Paraguay and Uruguay signed declarations of intent
-- to begin negotiating agreements similar to those signed with
Argentina and Chile -- with Spain, the country with which they also
signed an administrative agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreements with Argentina and Chile will affect the workers
of mixed Hispano-Argentine and Hispano-Chilean companies in
particular.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The presidents of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay
and Uruguay will inaugurate a new canal in the Parana River in
mid-February that will improve navegation between the Argentine
port of Rosario and the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The canal will measure 9.75 meters deep, 100 meters wide and
about 360 kilometers long which will enable the loads carried in
boats to increase to about 6,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Shipping costs will drop about 4 dollars/ton in spite of the
fact that toll charges will increase 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
ASUNCION -- Paraguay's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow
around 2-3 percent this year, much less than the 4.5 percent
forecast by the government, according to the Paraguayan center
for promoting economic liberty and social justice.
</P>
<P>
This nongovernmental body believes that 3 percent growth will
be the ceiling, taking into consideration the fact that 1997
started off within a not very encouraging context and with no
clear signs of an economic reactivation.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Agricultural groups of the four countries that
make up the Mercosur will meet this week in San Jose, Uruguay to
begin a training course that will enable them to have more
modern unions.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Commission of Rural Development
(CNFR, its acronym in Spanish) in Uruguay, the institution that
is behind this initiative, the training course is necessary
because the world is still changing.
</P>
<P>
Among other preoccupations, the CNFR listed the phenomenon of
globalization, the integration of regional markets and the
modification of trade rules. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> Major Piracy Case Cracked in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Police in Hangzhou, capital
city of East China's Zhejiang Province, reported today they have
cracked its biggest piracy case in history.
</P>
<P>
Eight criminal suspects were apprehended, and 20,000 pirated
video CDs seized, 2,400 of which were pornographic discs.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the police received a anonymous call
reporting that a peddler named Zhang in an electronics store was
selling pirated and pornographic VCDs.
</P>
<P>
The police launched a surprise raid at Zhang's store, and found
10,000 pirated VCDs.
</P>
<P>
They didn't stop there: subsequent investigations revealed a
network of piracy manufacturing, trafficking and sales, involving
40 people in nine counties of two provinces.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal police bureau said that the
local police will be consistent in severely dealing with piracy
and pornography, which is against state law.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Georgia in Joining Council of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today promised his Georgian counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, that
France will support Georgia's candidacy for membership of the
Council of Europe, a European political coordination organ.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the Caucasian region of the former Soviet
Union, which includes Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, "belongs to
European space."
</P>
<P>
He said that although the region is having some difficulties,
"it has already proved that it can profoundly change things."
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1991, Georgia has been troubled by
separatist movements in Abkhazia bordering the Black Sea, and in
the mountainous region of South Osseti, which borders the Russian
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Georgia is reportedly expecting to financially take advantage
of the on-going development of offshore oil fields in the Caspian
Sea, which it also borders.
</P>
<P>
France recently signed a big oil deal with Azerbaijan on the
development of an offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea, and the
reparation of an old 1,000-kilometer-long gas pipeline from Baku
to Poti, a Black Sea port of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, who began a visit today in Paris, will meet some
French enterprise leaders to discuss investment in his country.

<HEADLINE> US Not to Discourage Company to Invest More in Burma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said today that it neither encourages nor discourages Unocal Corp,
the largest U.S. investor in Burma, to expand its petroleum
business in Burma despite U.S. sanctions against that country.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a briefing, "We
don't encourage American investment in Burma.... We don't actively
discourage an American company from going in. But we don't
encourage it either."
</P>
<P>
Unocal announced last Thursday a deal extending its rights to
explore and develop off-shore gas fields. Burns, in reacting to
the move, said, "It's Unocal's decision if it wants to go in."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, wielding the "human rights" baton,
signed into law a bill authorizing a ban on new investment by U.S.
companies last September.
</P>
<P>
Unocal has arranged one-on-one briefings for reporters in
Washington this week to explain its Burma involvement and made the
case against further U.S. sanctions.

<P>
NEW YORK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street posted
marginal gains today despite a strong bond market, where interest
rates fell.
</P>
<P>
But the Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.93 points to
6,806.16. The Dow added about 116 points, giving the blue-chip
gauge a gain of nearly 365 points, or about 5.7 percent, for
January.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-9 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching 463.58 million
shares down from 574.50 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 0.54 to 786.70,
skipping past January 22's record close at 786.23.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.50 to 412.48, just 0.32 shy
of a new high, and the American Stock Exchange composite index
rose 0.94 to 589.71.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.81 to 1,376.04.
</P>
<P>
Broader indicators were mostly positive, but all were little
changed from Friday's closing levels.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury market rallied after the National Association of
Purchasing Management reported that the nation's manufacturing
economy slowed down in January following months of surprising
strength.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
fell as low as 6.73 percent, down from 6.78 percent late Friday.

<HEADLINE> US Supports No Intervention in Zairian Fighting: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) --The U.S. State Department
said today that the United States neither supports any neighbors
of Zaire intervening in the fighting in Zaire, nor supports the
rebel groups fighting to destabilize the Zairian government.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, in answering a
question about U.S. comment on the Zairian authorities bringing in
troops from neighboring countries, said, "The United States does
not support the rebel groups that are fighting to destabilize the
Zairian government.... The United States does not support any
neighbors of Zaire intervening in the fighting in Zaire in an
unhelpful and destabilizing way."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports from Kinshasa said the Zairian government
expected troops from Morocco, Togo and Chad to help its army
contain a rebel campaign that had spread to the mineral-producing
Shaba Province.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States hopes "the fighting could be
brought to an end by a mutual agreement between the Zairian
government and the rebels themselves." That is the U.S. position,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Burns also expressed U.S. concerns over some of the remaining
Rwandan Hutu refugees, who, trapped inside of eastern Zaire by the
fighting between the Zairian government and the rebel groups,
could not cross the border and be back home at Rwanda.

ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's former prime
minister and leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) Nawaz
Sharif has said the results so far for his party in Monday's
elections are much better than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif told the media today that his party will get
majority seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) has won at least 90 National Assembly seats in
Pakistan's largest province of Punjab, a PML(N) official told
Xinhua today from Lahore.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the countrywide the PML(N) has so far secured
110 National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Political Secretary of the PML(N), Mahar
Liaquart, told Xinhua here that the PML(N) has won about 100
National Assembly seats in Punjab alone.
</P>
<P>
Liaquart said it is certain that his party will win an absolute
majority for the National Assembly in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
There are 115 National Assembly seats for Punjab province. A
total of 113 seats are being contested. Polling of two
constituencies is postponed due to the death of a candidate
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liaquart claimed that the PML(N) is expected to win about 125
seats countrywide to form a majority government.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Election Commission declined to
confirm it.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) chief, Nawaz Sharif, has won two National Assembly
seats in Lahore, Punjab, and Abbottabad in the North West Frontier
Province.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed Pakistan Tereek-e-Inssaf led by Imran Khan has
not won a single National Assembly seat in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N)'s arch rival, the Pakistan People's Party, is
expected to  secure five to six National Assembly seats in
Punjab.

<HEADLINE> Zaire Asks Morocco to Help Fight Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zaire intends to ask Morocco to
help it fight the rebels in the eastern part of the country as the
rebels claimed the capture of the strategic port of Kalemie
bordering the Tanganyka Lake in southeastern Zaire today.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a senior Zairean official
as saying in Rabat, where President Mobutu Sese Seko was paying a
visit, that Mobutu would ask Moroccan King Hassan II to send
military aid to his country.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that the question of military aid from Morocco
will be raised during the talks (to be held Tuesday) between King
Hassan II and President Mobutu," said the official who asked for
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Morocco helped Zaire suppress the rebellion of the "Katanga
Gendarmerie" in Kolwezi of the southern province of Shaba in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi rebel chief Laurent-Desire Kabila said today that the
rebels had captured Kalemie, and were going down to conquer Shaba.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu arrived in Rabat from France this morning, and will leave
Morocco for his country Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: Serbia Not Testing Ground for Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic warned today that Serbia would not allow its state to be
a testing ground for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in Belgrade while meeting a delegation of
the Serbian Interior Ministry which has recently cracked down on
terrorist activities in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It should be clear to all those who wish to achieve terrorist
goals through terrorist actions that we would not allow Serbia to
be a testing ground for terrorism," the official news agency
Tanjug quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
On January 22-29, Serbian police launched an anti-terrorist
operation, during which 66 members of terrorist organizations,
including the perpetrators of terrorist actions in Kosovo, were
arrested and three were killed. Police also seized large
quantities of arms and explosive devices, equipment, and documents
which indicate terrorist activities and violence in the province,
90 percent of whose population are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said the citizens of Kosovo, regardless of national
affiliation, have the right to live in peace and freedom and to
resolve political issues with political methods, in public and
democratically, without fear of violence or pressure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian security police halted more than 50,000
opposition protesters in central Belgrade today after an overnight
confrontation in which more than 80 demonstrators were injured,
according to an independent radio in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Police had allowed more than 20,000 student protesters to march
over a Belgrade bridge earlier in the day, after having stopped
and attacked opposition coalition supporters in the same spot late
Sunday night. The tension between the police and demonstrators
was still high.

WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) expanded its financial support last year to
a growing number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
to strengthen legislatures and judicial reforms in the region.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, the IDB approved 11 loans for more than 72 million
U.S. dollars in financing for programs that include the
strengthening of national legislatures and judicial reform,
according to an IDB press release today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the IDB is exploring ways to better identify those
programs this year.
</P>
<P>
The nontraditional financial support for modernization of
national legislatures and judicial reform in the region has become
a priority now because it coincides with a broader agenda to
improve the overall business and investment climate in the region

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Fujimori for Handling Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today praised Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori for skillfully
handling the hostage crisis in the Peruvian capital of Lima.
</P>
<P>
During their 20-minute meeting, Clinton told Fujimori "how much
he appreciated and admired the way he had been handling this
crisis," according to White House deputy press secretary David
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived in Washington Saturday after a meeting with
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Toronto on the
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, about 20 rebels seized the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima, where a cocktail party was being
held, and took more than 500 guests as hostages, demanding the
release of their jailed colleagues. The rebels are now still
holding 72 hostages.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Fujimori and Hashimoto announced that
the Peruvian government will start a dialogue with the rebels but
will not release any jailed rebels.
</P>
<P>
The statement, Clinton was quoted by Johnson as saying, "had
set exactly the right tone."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Fujimori was skillfully walking "a very fine
line, and that is, between resolving this crisis peacefully
without giving into terror," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"He (Clinton) told him that it was a very hard line to walk,
but it's the right one and he (Fujimori) was handling it very
carefully," Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori reiterated that his government will not release any of
the 400 prisoners as the rebels demanded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club, he said, it's
"out of the question" to set free those prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori also told reporters that the U.S. had not provided any
expert on advice over the handling of the crisis. None of the
hostages taken by the rebels are American.

LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Monday, with London and Paris ending lower, depressed
by Wall Street's decline, and Frankfurt surging strongly and
closing at a new record high.
</P>
<P>
Sharp losses on Wall Street helped keep leading British shares
in London depressed ahead of monetary policy meetings on both
sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed down 18.0 points at 4,257.8, with
stronger-than-expected purchasing managers' data and surprise
rises in factory activity and money supply having little impact on
the market.
</P>

In Paris, French shares also failed to sustain its record highs
reached last Friday as investors stayed on the sidelines or took
profit, undermined by an unpredictable Wall Street, with the
CAC-40 index finishing down 8.01 points at 2,508.55, but still
above the 2,500 level.
</P>
<P>
However, the Frankfurt market ended at a record high of
3,062.29, 27.14 points up, as a result of the dollar's rise
against the marks.
</P>
<P>
But dealers warned that the increase was largely on the back of
DAX futures, and questioned whether gains could be sustained ahead
of Tuesday's U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 18.0

lower at 2,508.55. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index finished up
27.14 points at a new record high of 3,062.29.

<HEADLINE> PML(N) Sweeps National Assembly Seats in Punjab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League
(N) led by Nawaz Sharif has won at least 90 National Assembly
seats in Pakistan's largest province of Punjab, a PML(N) official
told Xinhua today from Lahore.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the countrywide the PML(N) has so far secured
110 National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Political Secretary of the PML(N), Mahar Liaquart,
told Xinhua here that the PML(N) has won about 100 National
Assembly seats in Punjab alone.
</P>
<P>
Liaquart said it is certain that his party will win an absolute
majority for the National Assembly in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
There are 115 National Assembly seats for Punjab province. A
total of 113 seats are being contested. Polling of two
constituencies is postponed due to the death of a candidate
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liaquart claimed that the PML(N) is expected to win about 125
seats countrywide to form a majority government.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Election Commission declined to
confirm it.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) chief, Nawaz Sharif, has won the two National
Assembly seats in Lahore, Punjab, and Abbottabad in the North West
Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed Pakistan Tereek-e-Inssaf led by Imran Khan has
not won a single National Assembly seat in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N)'s arch rival, the Pakistan People's Party, may
secure five to six National Assembly seats in Punjab.

<HEADLINE> US Growth Boosts World Drug Sales in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Drug sales in the world's top 10
markets reached 130.1 billion U.S. dollars for the first 11 months
of 1996, up 7 percent on the same period in 1995, boosted by a
surge in the U.S. pharmaceuticals market.
</P>
<P>
A report by IMS International, a specialist pharmaceuticals
market research organization, published today showed that U.S.
drug sales grew to 54.1 billion dollars for the period, an
increase of 11 percent compared with the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Italy also grew quickly, with sales rising 12 percent to 8.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although sales grew by 10 percent in Britain, the total
amounted to only 6.2 billion dollars as the country has much lower
consumption per head.
</P>
<P>
Then follows Germany, where sales grew 7 percent to 15.3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's second biggest drug market, was the main
drag on world growth, as sales there grew only 2 percent to 21.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Drug sales in France also grew slowly, also with a 2 percent
increase to 13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
The report said that by medical area, growth is dominated by
nervous system drugs, and sales grew 14 percent to 18.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also grewing quickly is the smaller market in blood agents,
with sales up 16 percent to 7.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sales of digestive system drugs continued to
accelerate. However, sales of heart drugs rose only 4 percent to
22.6 billion dollars although they remain the biggest single
category of drugs.

agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, was paralyzed by the
first snow of this winter, according to local traffic department.
The traffic of the city was interrupted in the early hours of

<HEADLINE> Forum on Micro-credit and Poverty Eradication to Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A forum on the link
between access to credit and poverty eradication in Africa will be
held at the U.N. headquarters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Department for Policy Coordination and
Sustainable Development said the one-day meeting, entitled the
Africa Advocacy Forum: Micro-credit and Poverty Eradication, is
co-sponsored by several U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Following immediately after the Micro-credit Summit in
Washington, D.C., the meeting will bring to New York several
African practitioners for discussion on how improving access to
credit can help empower Africa's poor, particularly women, to
become more active participants in the development process,
thereby freeing themselves from poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, the majority of the 1.5 billion people who
will live on the less than one U.S. dollar a day will be from
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The briefing will be opened by Under-Secretary-General for
Development Support and Management Services Yongjian Yin. Among
topics to be discussed are the impact that access to micro-credit
could have on food security, women's economic empowerment,
employment and self-employment, and provision of basic social
services.
</P>
<P>
Ways of linking traditional banking systems to micro-credit in
order to facilitate the poor's access to credit will also be
examined.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Iranian Ambassador for Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today lodged a protest
against the Iranian ambassador to Turkey for expressing disputed
religious views, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Ali Tuygan
summoned Iranian ambassador Muhammed Reza Bagheri to inform him
of Turkey's displeasure over Bagheri's remarks made at the
controversial commemoration of the "Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Night" in
the Islamic-governed Sincan city near Ankara on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sincan Mayor Bekir Yildiz invited Bagheri to the function
which was organized by the ruling pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
and Bagheri made a speech to the public.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia report did not carry quotes of the speech.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said today that
Bagheri's remarks were "being studied in the (context of the)
international agreement, convention and tradition" as well as the
code of conduct for diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel as saying that he
had viewed the videotape of the reported speech and seen the
slogans calling for the rise of Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Yuksel said Sincan Mayor Bekir Yildiz praised some extremist
organizations during his speech and had pictures of their leaders
hung.
</P>
<P>
The speech by Bagheri has aroused sharp reactions from junior
partner of the Turkish coalition government True Path Party (DYP)
and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Yildirim Aktuna from the DYP described the
event in Sincan as a scandal, saying that the Sincan mayor
should be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Sharpens Opposition to Balanced Budget Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin today sharpened his opposition to a proposed balanced
budget amendment, saying he objected to it in any form.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything is worth the risk that is associated
with a balanced budget amendment," Rubin told a hearing of the
House Judiciary Committee. "I am very opposed to any form of
balanced budget amendment."
</P>
<P>
He said that was the view of the Clinton Administration as
well.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the amendment should be defeated because it deprives
the U.S. Congress of flexibility, making it more difficult to deal
with military and economic emergencies, increasing the risk of
default on the national debt and raising the possibility of a
temporary halt of all federal payments.
</P>
<P>
He said that the amendment "poses unacceptable risks and
dangers for our nation's economic future and, for this reason,
must not be adopted."
</P>
<P>
A balanced-budget amendment proposed by Republicans was
approved late last month by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S.
Senate. It is expected to go to full Senate floor this month. The
U.S. House of Representatives is also scheduled to vote on the
measure at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The White House has suggested in the past that it would be less
averse to an amendment that protected the Social Security system.
Many Democrats in Congress have said they would support an
amendment that removed the Social Security trust fund from budget
calculations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition to the balanced-budget amendment is
growing among the U.S. economists.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by 1,100 economists including 11 Noble
laureates condemned the proposed balanced budget amendment as
"unsound and unnecessary," according to the New York Times today.

<HEADLINE> Six Workers Contaminated at British Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Six workers at Britain's
Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant were contaminated by
radioactive dust in an accident happened Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The BBC television quoted British Nuclear Fuels Plc (PNFL) as
saying this evening that all the six workers were allowed to
return home after being cleared by medical staff at the Sellafield
plant in Cumbria, northeastern England.
</P>
<P>
A PNFL spokesman noted that the incident was not serious and no
radioactivity escaped from the plant, but an investigation was
under way.
</P>
<P>
"There was a release of an amount of radioactivity into the
local environmental where some people were working," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fairly minor event but because of personal
contamination we take it seriously," he added.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened in part of the plant used to reprocess
fuel from Britain's first-generation Magnox nuclear reactors and
only part of the building was contaminated.

BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana will pay an official visit to Turkey on February 5-6,
NATO's press office announced today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Solana will be received by Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel. He will meet with Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller,
Defense Minister Turhan Tayan and Chief of Staff General Ismail
Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's frustration is growing recently as the date approaches
for the EU to consider enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is studying up to 10 possible
candidates for future membership, but Turkey is not among them.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister warned last week in Rome, after a
meeting of the "5+1," the EU's informal contact with Turkey
composed of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and Spain, that if her country's plea for EU membership was
stalled, Ankara might block plans for NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and the EU require unanimity for enlargement, giving
each member a veto.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Solana would undoubtedly seek clarification of
Turkey's stand on this issue during his talks with Turkish
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: EU Should Play Big Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today asked the European Union (EU) to play, along with the
United States, a crucial role in the peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
He made the request when he met today in the Hague with Prime
Minister Wim Kok and Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo of the
Netherlands, who now holds the EU rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Dutch leaders, the Dutch radio said
Arafat expressed the hope that the construction of a harbor and
the rebuilding in the autonomous Gaza Strip could soon start with
assistance from the EU.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, he also expected that the EU
could exercise its influence to induce Israel to fulfill the "34
yet-to-implement points" in the Hebron Agreement, particularly the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Arafat restated that the EU, as the biggest financial
contributor for the building of autonomous Palestinian territory,
should play an economic as well as a political role for the
development of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A Cooperation Agreement is expected to be signed in Brussels on
February 24 between Palestine and the European Union.
