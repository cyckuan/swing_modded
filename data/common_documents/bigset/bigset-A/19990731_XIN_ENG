<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Commissioners in Zimbabwe's
Constitutional Review Commission Friday said President Robert
Mugabe must reassure the nation that he will not reject the
constitution that will be produced by the commission.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the commission's plenary session here Friday,
commissioner Lawrence Chakaredza told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that although Mugabe made such an undertaking when the commission
was instituted this May, there was need for him to make a public
reassurance so that people will cooperate with the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The people will be more forthcoming if the head of
state makes such a guarantee because it will show that he is
respectful of the commission."
</P>
<P>
"It will be folly for the government to reject what the people
want," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want the president to pledge that he is not going to
interfere with the constitution we are making," Japa said.
</P>
<P>
Member of Parliament Irene Zindi, who is also a member of the
Constitutional Commission, said the plenary was democratic.
</P>
<P>
She said the commissioners' suggestions were considered and
hoped that people would give the best of ideas which would enable
the drafting of a democratic constitution for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commissioners were put into small groups of four
each and will start gathering people's views countrywide from
August 16 to September 15 for inclusion into the new constitution.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations military
observers have carried out the temporary registration of 200
ex-combatants in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, a U.N.
spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference that the temporary registration was done by the United
Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) Military
Observers.
</P>
<P>
"Arrangements are underway for the transfer of Lungi, on the
other side of the estuary, where the complete registration and
disarmament, demobilization, reintegration program will be
conducted," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The three reception sites which had been set up temporarily in
Freetown to cater for the influx of ex-combatants are going to be
closed once they are moved to Lungi, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United Nations was appealing for 35
million U.S. dollars to finance the disarmament of former rebel
soldiers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Silva said last week that the United Nations was appealing to
donors on behalf of Sierra Leone for an initial 35 million U.S.
dollars to demobilize, disarm and reintegrate the rebel soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Former White House Aide Tripp Indicted For Wiretapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- After a yearlong investigation,
former White House aide Linda Tripp was indicted Friday for
secretly taping her phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern who admitted having an affair with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A Howard County grand jury in Maryland indicted Tripp on one
count of illegal interception of a phone conversation on December
22, 1997, after she allegedly had been told by her lawyer that the
ongoing taping was illegal, Maryland State Prosecutor Stephen
Montanarelli said.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, whose tapes led to impeachment of President Clinton,
becomes the only central figure in the Lewinsky scandal to face
criminal charge.
</P>
<P>
She also was charged with allegedly disclosing the contents of
that conversation to Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
Maryland law forbids the recording of phone conversations
without the consent of the other party. Illegal wiretapping is
punishable by up to five years in prison and a 10,000 dollars fine
for each offense.
</P>
<P>
Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Ken Starr under a
grant of immunity from federal prosecution, but that does not
protect her from prosecution by her home state.
</P>
<P>
Starr's investigation of Clinton's sexual relationship with
Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment by the House and
trial in the Senate. Clinton was acquitted in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, who made more than 20 hours of tapes from her home in
Maryland, testified for Starr's grand jury that she taped several
conversations in late 1997 even after an attorney told her it was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, 49, said she began taping her friend's phone calls
to protect herself because she was being pressured by Lewinsky
to lie in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, who became friends with Tripp when they both worked
at the Pentagon, wanted Tripp to deny knowledge of the sexual
relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Tripp's attorney, Joseph Murtha, asked that Tripp be allowed to
surrender voluntarily, rather than being arrested.

<HEADLINE> OAU, Ethiopia Support One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salem said here Friday that
the OAU always supports the "One-China" policy upheld by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"We also appreciate the 'One country, two systems policy' put
forward by the Chinese government," the OAU chief told Chinese
ambassador Jiang Zhengyun in an interview here, a source from the
Chinese Embassy told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The OAU fully understands China's concern about its national
sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is also the stand
taken by the majority of African countries, Salim added.
</P>
<P>
Salim made the remarks when referring to claims by Lee Teng-hui
of Taiwan who described cross-Straits relations between China and
Taiwan as "relations between state and state. "
</P>
<P>
Taiwan as a province of China is an inalienable part of the
territory of the People's Republic of China, said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ethiopia also reiterated that Taiwan is part of
China.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Chinese ambassador Jiang Zhengyun,
Ethiopian Deputy Foreign Minister Tekeda Alemu said that the
Ethiopian government has been maintaining the "One -China" policy
on the basis of the good relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Lee Teng-hui's "two-states theory", Tekeda said
that the Taiwan authorities is playing a game which is at once
dangerous and unrealistic.

<HEADLINE> Russian Scientist Warns Against Space Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- There will be no way to the outer
space in 150 years if the space pollution continues unchecked, a
Russian scientist warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the army and ecology, Doctor of Technical
Sciences Vladimir Lebedev said the outer space might close in 50
years if the pollution rates increase, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian military researchers, who have been studying the
problem of space litter for the past decade, believe that
"self-propelled spreading of space litter is possible in the
future."
</P>
<P>
A collision of two large artificial objects in space will
result in the creation of thousands of new, smaller artificial
objects.
</P>
<P>
Radar has detected about 8,000 objects with a diameter of over
10 centimeters in space, the experts said, adding that there are
70,000 objects with a diameter of one centimeter and more than 3.5
million objects with a diameter of less than 1 millimeter in
space.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebedev sees no easy way to tackle the space garbage
problem other than to "fasten tighter the bolts and nuts of
rocket-boosters."

Speaking at a ceremony at the OAU headquarters here, Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim said that the donation is showing OAU's
concerns about the many thousands of Sierra Leoneans severely
affected by the civil war in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release issued here quoted the OAU chief as saying
that "the peace agreement signed between the parties to the Sierra
Leonean conflict in Lome, Togo on July 7, 1997 had also made
provision for international humanitarian assistance to be
delivered to Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Salim stated that the OAU was considering ways and means for
more concrete assistance to the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean ambassador to OAU Ibrahm Kamara expressed the
extreme gratitude of the government and people of Sierra Leone for
the gesture of the OAU which he described as a "commendable" act
which would help thousands of people in distress.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU had remained steadfast in its efforts to
promote the peace process since 1995 and particularly the OAU was
the first international organization who had come out to condemn
the coup d'etat of May 1997 in Freetown.

</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Italian parliament has approved Wednesday the
draft agreement signed in Brussels in 1997 on the phased
establishment of a European Union-Moroccan free trade zone before
the year 2010,
</P>
<P>
Italy was the last EU state to sanction the partnership accord
with Morocco, following the approval by the parliaments of 14 EU
states.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quoted observers in Rabat as
saying that the agreement with Morocco will be enforced before the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Director of the Yemeni Foundation for Mineral Wealth
and Geological Survey Ismail Al Jund said Yemen plans to hold a
promotion symposium this year to market the minerals discovered in
commercial quantities in the country over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Sanaa press Friday quoted him as saying that resources of
marble, granite, semi precious stones and raw material for cement
industry were discovered in Yemen in the past years.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLA -- The German trading and industrial mission in
Palestine said Germany's aid to the Palestinian National Authority
amounted to about 70 million U.S. dollars last year, Al Hayat
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The director of the mission Abdul Hadi Abu Sharkh said at a
recently held workshop that Germany is engaged in the
Palestinians' projects, such as waste water treatment,
infrastructural and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The United States has expressed interest in

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ready to Involve in Balkan Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Friday that his country is "making a commitment to take
generous, immediate, and unilateral steps to improve market access
for products made in southeast Europe".
</P>
<P>
"I will work with the United States Congress to establish a
trade preference program similar to our Andean initiative, which
will offer duty-free treatment for most of the region's exports,"
he told world leaders here attending the so-called Stability Pact
Summit through a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said nations in the region should be brought into the
World Trade Organization on commercially acceptable terms, and be
provided the technical assistance they need to meet those terms.
</P>
<P>
He also called for promoting private investment in the region's
economies, and supporting the development of the region's private
sector. "To that end, America's Overseas Private Investment
Corporation will establish a 150-million-US-dollar investment fund
for the region and a 200-million-US-dollar credit line," he said.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), the United States will set up a trust fund
designed to help businesses in the southeast Europe become more
competitive and viable, said Clinton. But he said his
administration would first consult with the Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We would be willing to contribute 15 million dollars in the
first year, and to consider up to 50 million dollars overall, as
long as the EBRD targets an additional 80 million dollars for the
region," he detailed the American plan.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we will support the creation of a regional equity
fund of up to 300 million dollars, with financing from the
international financial institutions, to make equity investments
in private enterprises in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also indicated the incoming action by his
administration. "Our Commerce Secretary William Daley will also
sponsor a mission to the region to showcase trade and investment
opportunities and build new business partnerships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the United States is ready to deeply
involve in the economic reconstruction process in Balkan region
through various action plans which were modeled as western powers'
anti-Communism Mashall Plan for rebuilding Europe after the second
World War.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from major western countries and Balkan nations and
heads of main international organizations ended the Stability Pact
Summit this afternoon after issuing a Declaration calling for
integration of Balkans into a single European model. The Stability
Pact, which was initiated and already adopted by the European
Union, has been widely regarded as a new Mashall Plan to promote
western ideology, value and way of life.

<HEADLINE> SADC Ministers Adopt Resolutions on Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of local government
from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) members
have resolved to cooperate on policy initiatives and projects that
seek to deliver basic services and infrastructure especially to
the poor.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions were adopted Friday at the end of a three-day
SADC conference on local government held in Johannesburg, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have also resolved to cooperate on policy
initiatives and projects that will create an environment suitable
for increased municipal partnerships with other key role players
in service delivery and development.
</P>
<P>
Integrated planning to minimize environmental degradation to
enable the region to deal effectively with natural disasters was
another key area the ministers agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
On regional cooperation, information sharing and capacity
building, the SADC local government ministers recognized the need
to cooperate and have therefore resolved to support the formation
of a national associations of local government in countries where
such organizations do not exist.
</P>
<P>
This would be done to promote networking and communication
between local authorities and to enable them to speak with one
voice.
</P>
<P>
Another critical component area of agreement was the
establishment of local government forum within the SADC.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that such a forum should include an annual
conference to enable the continued sharing of ideas and
cooperation on local government matters.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial task team consisting of South Africa, Mozambique,
Zambia and Zimbabwe was established to investigate and recommend a
modus operandi, institutional structure and terms of reference for
the forum.

<HEADLINE> Depleted Uranium "Threatens Balkan Cancer Epidemic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Americans' use of depleted
uranium (DU) weapons in Serbia is likely to cause extra deaths
from cancer, a British scientist warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The use of depleted Uranium shells in Kosovo, fired mostly from
U.S. planes, was endangering the health of returning refugees,
peacekeepers, aid workers and the people of neighboring countries,
said Dr Roger Coghill, a British experimental biologist.
</P>
<P>
Coghill, who runs his own research laboratory in south Wales,
was speaking at a London conference discussing the links between
depleted uranium and cancers in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We know that some one million DU bullets were fired (during
the Gulf War) and many still lie in the Gulf desert, causing
clearly serious cancers and birth defects." he said, adding that
"The connection between the two is biologically extremely
plausible."
</P>
<P>
Coghill said there had been evidence in other parts of the
Balkans of elevated radiation levels during and soon after the
bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Using calculations based on the Pentagon's statement, Coghill
estimated that half of the 500,000 depleted uranium rounds fired
over Kosovo detonated, which he said would have resulted in the
release of about one thirty-thousandth of the amount of radiation
released at Chernobyl in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Coghill said the maximum effect will be reached about six
months after the war, suggesting that the first cancers
</P>
<P>
may start to show up about a year after that.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the Balkan region, I calculate that there will be
an extra 10,150 deaths from cancer because of the use of depleted
uranium." he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) outlined strategic priorities for poverty
eradication in a president statement here Friday at the end of its
1999 session.
</P>
<P>
With poverty eradication as the major focus of the ECOSOC
session from July 5 to 30, the statement said, the participants
from the ECOSOC's 54 members acknowledge that the major challenge
facing the world in the new millennium is the eradication of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on governments, international
organizations, civil society and the business world to join hands
with the United Nations in an all out campaign to fight the
scourge of poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In order to succeed, we must empower the people living in
poverty and ensure that they participate fully in this fight," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOSOC said that about 40 billion U.S. dollars a year are
needed to achieve the international goals related to poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the UN agency vowed to reduce the proportion
of people living in extreme poverty (with an income of less than a
dollar a day) by half by 2015. It is estimated that 1.3 billion
people still live in abject poverty worldwide.

The defense force said majors, lieutenant-colonels, captains
and colonels would be considered for the job.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers should be proficient in English and be willing to be
deployed for periods ranging from six months to a year.

MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it wants
Yugoslavia to join the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Russia "intends to actively participate in the implementation
of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, as it is one of its
co-authors," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important conditions for the success of the
Pact is equal relations between all the countries in the region
without exception.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the Russian Federation wishes Yugoslavia
to join the Pact as soon as possible," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed early June in Cologne, Germany, was designed
to help Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Bosnia, Croatia and
Slovenia. Leaders and representatives from 45 countries were
meeting in Sarajevo, Bosnia, to formulate plans on the
reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin also urged the international community to extend aid
to Yugoslavia, which suffered great damage under NATO's 78-day air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The assistance should not be selective and discriminatory, or
Yugoslavia may face a very serious humanitarian catastrophe in the
Autumn and Winter, Rakhmanin said.

BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The 11-nation euro zone has
registered a trade surplus with the rest of the world in May this
year, Eurostat reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau of the European community said that the

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reiterate Rejection of Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official on
Friday reiterated the Palestinians' rejection of a proposal made
by the Israeli prime minister on the implementation of the Wye
interim peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival in Cairo, Palestinian
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath
said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would not accept
Ehud Barak's idea on delaying troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shaath stressed that the PNA has also turned down Barak's
proposal to combine part of the last October's Wye accord with the
negotiations for a final peace deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in May, Barak has repeatedly expressed
readiness to push the peace talks with the Palestinians forward.
He also said he would carry out the Wye peace agreement, which
calls on Israel to hand over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, he proposed to blend the third and last
phase of pullback with the final status talks after implementing
the second phase.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has rejected the proposal,
insisting that Israel implement the Wye accord "fully and
accurately" before the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Shaath expressed satisfaction with Barak's pledges to advance
the talks with the Palestinians but was critical of him for lack
of deeds to follow his words.
</P>
<P>
"Barak's words are satisfactory but his lack of deeds do not
give us confidence," the Palestinian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Shaath came here to accompany Arafat in a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday to discuss the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu left the country's capital Kigali Friday morning for a
meeting with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni, Rwanda News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
''The present visit is in the framework of regular
consultations between the leaders of both countries on matters of
mutual interests," the news agency quoted a source from the office
of President Bizimungu as saying.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Improve Communication, Navigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Member states of Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have been urged to make
efforts in improving regional communication, navigation and air
traffic management system toward the establishment of a free trade
area on October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the first meeting of aeronautical experts
and directors of civil aviation in Lusaka Friday, COMESA Acting
Secretary General Sindiso Ngwenya said the liberalization of the
COMESA air transport market is part of the on-going COMESA program
on liberalizing trade in goods and services hence a full
liberalization of the COMESA transport market will coincide with
the launching of the COMESA Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
He said the council of ministers, at its 7th meeting held in
Nairobi, Kenya, in May 1999, approved the system and regulations
for implementing the first phase of the liberalization of air
transport market for air cargo and scheduled passenger services
within COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the management system will improve safety
of aircraft when flying over the regional air space, he said,
adding that feasibility study had definitively concluded that the
implementation of the system is not only technically feasible but
financially viable.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the meeting, Zambian Deputy Minister of
Communications and Transport Mann Muyuni called for full
liberalization of the airline industry as the COMESA moves toward
a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline sub-sector is one of the most important
industries in the facilitation of the achievement of economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
"We need to undertake various policy and institutional reforms
so that the region regulatory authorities and airport services
providers are ready to serve the airline industry in the most
efficient manner," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- State Trade Union (STU) of Sao Tome
and Principe has threatened to paralyse governmental organs if the
authorities refuse to increase their minimum salary by 2,150
percent, according to a report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of STU Aurelio Silva said after a meeting
with leaders of other two important trade union organizations that
the proposal of augmenting salary will be delivered to the
government next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Trade Union asked the government to increase the minimum
salary of public officers to 900,000 dobras (about 300 U.S.
dollars) from the current 40,000 dobras (13 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We will paralyse the country," said Silva, "if the government
doesn't accept our proposal."
</P>
<P>
Silva made it clear that the Union will give the government 15
days to prepare for the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The largest agricultural and stock farming company of the
country, Company Santa Margarida, carried out an open-ended strike
last month, with an aim to increase their wages from 11 U.S.
dollars to 50 dollars. The strike is still going on.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Detain 96 Rioters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police held 96
rioters Friday for staging an illegal demonstration in the capital
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The riots happened at areas close to two mosques in the
Kariakoo area in the capital. Two rioters were injured and have
been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Rioters threw stones at people, wounding several policemen and
many civilians in the streets. They have also damaged automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Of the detained, 74 were men and 22 women, Regional Police
Commander Alfred Gewe said, adding that they are being questioned.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Moslems started gathering at the Manyema Mosque
at Ukame/ Mafia street junction around 1:30 p.m. soon after
mid-day Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
They said members of the mosque moved out peacefully after
prayers, but within a few minutes, large crowd of people from all
directions assembled at the mosque.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moslems have warned to gather and demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
Finding that the situation was unusual, patrol police arrived
at the mosque and ordered hundreds of people gathering there to
leave.
</P>
<P>
People there did not retreat, instead they moved toward the
patrol policemen, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
"Few minutes later a contingent of armed Field Force Unit, the
anti-riot force, came with other policemen in a convoy of about
eight vehicles to disperse the crowd," a witness said.
</P>
<P>
"But the irate people started raining stones randomly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said shops were being closed and everybody on the
street started running for safety. Many people got injured while
properties were damaged.
</P>
<P>
As the police and security forces attempted to surround the
mosque, two people inside tried to escape and jumped down from the
mosque fence, but sustained multiple wounds. The two have been
sent to the Muhimbili Medical Center for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said unrest also took place at another Mosque in the
Kariakoo area.
</P>
<P>
The regional police commander said that a police officer,
Pakilo Mwaitebels, was stoned and wounded on the left arm with his
wrist watch dismantled during scuffles with rioters.
</P>
<P>
Gewe said those who have been seized will be taken to court
facing charges of wounding people, damaging property and causing
social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzanian Minister of Education and Culture Juma
Kapuya promised that Moslem girl students in schools will be
allowed to hijab, or wear head scarf, during Friday, the prayer
day.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya, however, later changed his position amid concerns of a
group of members of parliament, who said Tanzania is a secular
country in which students are supposed to wear school uniforms
when attending classes.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya's change of position has caused wide protests from
Moslems, who threatened to stage demonstrations this week.
</P>
<P>
However, Tanzanian government leaders have warned them not to
stage illegal demonstrations, otherwise they will face punishment.
</P>
<P>
About one third of the Tanzanian population are Moslems, one
third are Christians while the rest hold indigenous beliefs.

<HEADLINE> UNDCP Uses Satellite Remote Sensing to Detect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
International Drug Council Program (UNDCP) Friday announced that
it has designated a plan to use remote sensing (RS) and other
space-related technologies to monitor the illicit cultivation of
narcotic crops, particularly the opium poppy and the coco bush
which feed the international drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Initial findings of a joint project, conducted by UNDCP and the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in 1993 and 1994,
established that it was possible to monitor the growth of illicit
crops with the aid of RS technologies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, satellite-based platforms have been developed
and launched which, combined with new innovative image processing
technologies, provide the opportunity to produce accurate high
resolution images enabling the identification of illicit crops at
an economically viable cost.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the
World Drug Problem in June 1998, Member States decided to work
closely with UNDCP to create strategies to eliminate or
significantly reduce illicit cultivation of the opium poppy,
cannabis and coco bush by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The Member States requested the UNDCP to intensify the
collection and analysis of previously incomplete data the extent
of these crops, to aid their elimination strategy and measure its
progress.
</P>
<P>
Taking up the challenge, UNDCP developed a program to establish
an International Network for the Monitoring of Narcotic Crops by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to enable countries affected by illicit
cultivation to assess growth levels of narcotic crops and
determine trends at a national level.
</P>
<P>
During the now completed first phase of this program, UNDCP
reached an agreement with the European Space Agency to place
satellite imagery technology at the disposal of governments for the
purpose of monitoring illicit crops.
</P>
<P>
Some economies of scale were achieved, thus minimizing the cost
of developing RS technology for user countries, UNDCP said. The
provision of technical assistance tailored to the individual needs
of governments is envisaged in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The International Network for the Monitoring of Narcotic
Crops will also validate the methods of monitoring the
cultivation of coca and opium plants with satellite-procured
imagery. It will formulate guidelines for their use in addition
to identifying ways of controlling the quality of the data
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Following this study, governments should be better able to
assess the feasibility, modalities, needs and not lease of all,
the financial requirements for using satellite remote sensing
technology.

<HEADLINE> Annan Gives Message to Sarajevo Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Friday that the Stability Pact Summit being
held here marks a new beginning in the efforts of the
international community to end the Balkan wars of this century.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief delivered the message through Carl Bildt, his
special Balkan envoy. "After a decade of conflict that has taken
us from Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo, we have now returned to
Sarajevo with a strong determination to achieve lasting peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"With this meeting, and with the extraordinary attention and
dedication devoted to overcoming the devastating results of the
last of the Balkan wars," Annan said, "the international community
has the opportunity to honor its pledges towards this region, and
thereby enable the peoples of the region to achieve stability in
their own lives."
</P>
<P>
He said the Sarajevo meeting will give all efforts of the
United Nations "new inspiration and new initiative" so that "we
enter the new century with renewed faith in lasting peace and
prosperity for the entire region".
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, attended by leaders from more than 30
countries, ended here Friday afternoon with a declaration calling
for the integration of the Balkans into a single European model.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton gave a speech to
a group of representatives from certain countries and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact, initiated and adopted by the European Union,
was agreed in principle at the summit.
</P>
<P>
In the Sarajevo Declaration, the leaders expressed their
support for the appointment of Bodo Hombach as the special
coordinator of the Stability Pact by the EU Council, as endorsed
by the OSCE (Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe).
</P>
<P>
"We pledge our full cooperation to the Special Coordinator in
the achievement of our objectives," they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Death Toll in Heat Wave Reaches 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The heat wave hitting the
Midwest and the East in the United States has led to the deaths of
at least 77 people since July 19, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Missouri State has the highest death toll at 27, followed by
Illinois and Ohio with 19 and 10 deaths respectively.
</P>
<P>
This summer's unrelenting heat has been sapping energy from
outdoor workers, drying up crops and turning forests into kindling
across Connecticut State and elsewhere in the nation, according to
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were over 35 degrees centigrade from the Plains to
the East coast in the country.
</P>
<P>
To the north, the weather was even worse. It was 44 degrees
centigrade in Pierre, South Dakota State, topping the record of
42.8 degrees centigrade set in 1933. The temperature was a
record-tying 40 degrees centigrade in Bismarck, North Dakota
State, and an all-time high of 39.4 degrees centigrade in
Dickinson, North Dakota State.
</P>
<P>
The heat was expected to last at least until Friday before a
change in the jet stream brings cooler air from Canada to northern
states.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Rebound in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Friday that sales of new single-family homes rebounded in June,
rising 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 929,000
units, better than expected.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected new homes sales to increase as buyers
scramble to lock in the best deals to beat slowly advancing
mortgage rates. That was the reason existing-home sales hit a
record high in June.
</P>
<P>
This week, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage was 7.70 percent, up from 7.52 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
New-home sales fell 4.1 percent to 901,000 units in May.
</P>
<P>
June's increase in sales pushed prices up as well. The median
price for a new home, meaning half of all homes sold in June for
less and half for more, jumped 4.7 percent to 157,000 dollars, up
from May's median price of 149,900 dollars. June's price was the
highest since February's record of 159,900 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In today's personal income and spending report, the Commerce
Department said that wages rose 0.5 percent in June, while farm
proprietors' income, which fell sharply in May, increased
dramatically, mainly reflecting federal subsidy payments to
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Sovereignty of Afghanistan Must be Respected: Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju Friday said that Afghanistan
is an independent sovereign state and its sovereignty should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here, Kanju said Pakistan fully respects
the sovereignty of Afghanistan, reiterating that Pakistan will not
allow its territory to be used against any other sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"To us Afghanistan is a sovereign country and its sovereignty
has to be respected. We share a long border with the land-locked
country and whatever happens there inevitably affects us," Kanju
added.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, the United States launched a missile
attack targeting Osama's hideouts in the Afghan city of Khost but
failed to cause any major damage to the millionaire who was
accused of masterminding the bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe the United States is planning a fresh
attack on Osama as the ruling Afghan Taliban rejected again its
latest requirement to extradite the alleged terrorist.

<HEADLINE> India Defends Credit Line to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- India said on friday that the
credit line it provided to Iraq earlier this week was within the
framework of relevant U.N. resolutions on sanctions and subject to
prior approval of the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry told the press
here that "this line of credit is no different from similar
agreements signed by several other countries with Iraq."
</P>
<P>
India agreed to provided Iraq with a credit line of 25 million
U.S. dollars for supply of humanitarian goods during a visit this
week by Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister V. K. Ramamurthy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign press quoted Ranamurthy as saying in Baghdad Thursday
that he was aware that the grant would violate U.N. sanctions but
his country would never allow a friend like Iraq to suffer.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman claimed friday that Ramamurthy, who was in
Baghdad for the second meeting of the Indo-Iraqi Joint Commission,
was "misquoted."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Ramamurthy actually reiterated that
India adheres to U.N. resolutions on Iraq and its cooperation with
Baghadad would be in accordance with these resolutions.
</P>
<P>
India has traditionally had good relations with Iraq based on
long-standing people-to-people contacts, the spokesman said,
adding that "while we remain concerned at the suffering of the
Iraqi people, we strictly adhere to all relevant U.N. resolutions
regarding Iraq."
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said that Washington was "seeking
confirmation or clarification from the government of India about
exactly what he (Ramamurthy) has agreed to" in extending the
credit line.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources here said that the credit line was to help
Iraq buy goods including 100,000 tons of wheat besides medical
equipment and tea from India.

Nicholas Goche said Friday that his country's "One China" policy

Zimbabwe believes that Taiwan has always been a part of China,
it can never be recognized as a state, but a province of the

<HEADLINE> India Firm on Position on Talks with Pakistan: Spokesman </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- India Friday stuck to its
position on Pakistan's renewed offer for dialogue, asserting that
it would consider resumption of talks only after Islamabad
reaffirmed the sanctity and inviolability of the line of control
(LOC) and took tangible steps to stop cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We consider cross-border terrorism to be a violation of the
LOC and Pakistan must take tangible steps to stop it and to
dismantle the apparatus of terrorists located in Pakistan and
territories under their control," a spokesman of the External
Affairs Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistan foreign office spokesman reportedly said in
Islamabad Friday that "India needs to commit itself to a dialogue
which should lead to the final settlement of the Kashmir issue."
</P>

The Indian spokesman said that New Delhi had clarified more

process which was based on the Simla Agreement signed in early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dialogue process with Islamabad was
interrupted by "Pakistan's intrusion and aggression and occupation
of the territory on the Indian side of the LOC," the de facto

<HEADLINE> Egypt, EU to Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is to discuss with the
European Union (EU) the role the European bloc can play in helping
reactivate the Middle East peace process, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will meet with Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen to discuss
the issue during her upcoming visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Halonen, whose country is holding EU's rotating presidency for
the second half of 1999, is expected to arrive in Egypt Sunday on
the first leg of her regional tour, which will also take her to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European organization wants to play a key role in
the Arab-Israeli peace talks and keeps close coordination on the
issue with Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty
with Israel and an active mediator in the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he would hold talks with his Finnish counterpart on
the latest developments in the peace drive and means of promoting
the European role in helping advance the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since his elections in May, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has repeatedly expressed readiness to push the peace talks with
the Palestinians forward and resume negotiations with Syria, which
came to halt in early 1996. Barak has also voiced welcome to any
efforts aimed at giving momentum to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he would also discuss with Halonen ways of boosting
the Egyptian-EU partnership within the framework of the Barcelona
process.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona process, or Euro-Med partnership, kicked off
during the 1995 conference in Barcelona, Spain, is aimed at
forging close cooperation in political coordination, economy,
trade, security and social affairs among the EU members and 12
Mediterranean countries, including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and the EU have endorsed the text of their
partnership agreement after nearly four years of negotiations. The
accord provides for more open trade, coordination in many economic
and financial areas, a political dialog and joint efforts to
combat money laundering and terrorism.

PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- France called on Israel on Friday to
fully apply the Wye Plantation Agreements signed with the
Palestinians, which it said is "indispensable" for re-establishing
trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry said that Israel
should not only implement its agreement to pull out troops from
15.2 percent of the territory of West Bank and hand over
administrative power on 13 percent of it, but also should release
Palestinian political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the decision by Israeli and Palestinian
officials to revive the committee of supervision on Wye agreements
on Thursday during their first meeting since Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak came to power on July 16.
</P>
<P>
Israel is trying to persuade the Palestinians to renounce
momentarily their obtaining control of the new parts of
territories in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to implement troop pullout under a final peace
agreement with the Palestinians, which could also include the
dismantling of some Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> UK Economic Recovery Gathers Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The UK economy is growing more
quickly than forecast, pushing away any fears of recession and
showing the economy recovering.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated Friday that
the total output for the second quarter was up 1.2 percent
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures came hard on the heels of revised data on Thursday,
which showed creeping growth of 0.1 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the British economy has now grown in every quarter
since the end of a deep recession in early 1992.
</P>
<P>
A Treasury spokesman said, "These preliminary growth figures
are encouraging, in line with the Budget forecast and show that
the UK is steering a course of stability."
</P>
<P>
City analysts now believe the economy is likely to meet
Chancellor Gordon Brown's 1999 growth forecast of between 1
percent and 1.5 percent, a figure previously thought to be
over-optimistic.
</P>
<P>
It is now commonly believed here that the UK economy is on
course for Chancellor's "soft landing".

<HEADLINE> 9 Iraqis Killed in U.S., British Air-strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and 23
others were wounded Friday when U.S. and British warplanes
attacked several sites in northern and southern Iraq, the Iraqi
armed forces said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the statement as saying that 11
formations of enemy planes made 24 sorties over the provinces of
Dohuk, Irbil and Mosul, bombing civilian facilities, killing six
people and wounding 21 others.
</P>
<P>
The allied planes also attacked a number of civilian targets in
the southern province of Najaf, 160 kilometers south of Baghdad,
killing three people and injuring two others, the INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Iraqi air defense units fought back and
forced the enemy planes to flee back to their bases in Turkey,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time in two weeks that Iraq has reported
fatalities in the airstrikes by allied planes patrolling the
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen civilian were killed on July 18 and eight were killed
on Thursday in the regular U.S.-British warplane attacks on Iraqi
civilian and military targets.
</P>
<P>
The United States-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones
in Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from any possible attacks by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes, Iraq has
declared that it does not recognize the restricted zones because
they were imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain without
the authorization of the U.N. Security Council.

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes conducted
repeated strikes on Iraqi targets in both southern and northern
no-fly zones on Friday, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon released two statements from U.S. Southern Command
in Tampa, Florida, which oversees operations in the southern
no-fly zones in Iraq, and from the European Command in Germany,
responsible for operations over the northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the Southern Command said the attack in
the south involved U.S. Air Force F-16 and Navy F/A-18 Hornets
and F-14 Tomcats as well as British GR-1 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
And the European Command said that U.S. Air Force F-15s and
F-16s dropped laser-guided bombs on anti-aircraft sites in the
northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said after the bombing that nine people were killed and
23 injured in the U.S. air raids.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as saying
six people were killed and 21 injured in the north while three
died and two were injured in the south.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in both southern and norther Iraq were
imposed by the United States and Britain right after the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad would not recognize the imposition of the no-fly
zones and repeated its warning that it would shoot any Western
warplanes invading its sovereign air space.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges End to Fighting in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba called Friday for an end to the continued fighting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
When meeting with visiting Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
here, he said that nobody has the reason to continue fighting
because all the parties including the rebels have agreed with the
cease-fire agreement signed on July 10 by the warring countries
involved in the 11-month war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Congo, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola inked the
pact, so did the presidents from Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi in
Lusaka of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who mediated the cease-fire agreement, said that
Zambia and Tanzania are making efforts to see the agreement also
signed by the rebels fighting to topple Congolese President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the time is up to end the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) and the Movement
for the Liberation for Congo (MLC) did not sign the agreement
because of the disagreement over who would sign on behalf of the
CRD.
</P>
<P>
The CRD split into two factions in May this year, with Ernest
Wamba Dia Wamba who founded the organization being kicked out by
the faction led by Emile Illunga.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Chiluba said that the two countries
have a lot to do to increase their trade and called for
strengthened relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On the protracted war in Angola he called for political
willingness from the waring sides to settle the differences
peacefully. Civil war renewed since last December between the
Angolan government and the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the region does not want to be engulfed by
conflicts but wishes to enjoy a good quality of life and
development.
</P>
<P>
In reply to Chiluba, Mkapa praised the Zambian President for
his efforts in securing the peace agreement to end the war in
Congo.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerns Over Law and Order in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A top U.N. official Friday
said "the major concern at present remains law and order" in
Kosovo and the world body is no longer tolerating the terrorist
acts in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, told a press conference here that it is
intolerable to see that mainly Serbs and some Albanians were
killed after the return of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
in June.
</P>
<P>
"When I left (Kosovo) just over a week ago, every day four to
six inhabitants of Kosovo were being killed," he said. "In recent
weeks, usually Serbs and Roma, but also Albanians, particularly
those who have been accused of collaborating with the former
authorities" in the province.
</P>
<P>
"And often the killings were carried out in a manner that would
contribute to creating a crime of terror," he said. "This is
clearly not something that we can tolerate."
</P>
<P>
De Mello headed the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo before Bernard Kouchner of France took up the post.
</P>
<P>
The top U.N. official also rejected U.S. charges that the U.N.
had contributed to lawlessness in Kosovo by failing to recruit
police quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
"We are deploying an international police force throughout
Kosovo," he said. "I wish the United Nations had battalions of
civilian administrators and civilian policemen on standby in
Macedonia" as the international peacekeepers did.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After all, the purpose of the U.N. deployment in Kosovo is to
promote self-governance, is to promote autonomy to the extent that
these persons, particularly at the municipal level, are doing a
decent job both in terms of their competence, but also in terms of
their inclusive, democratic and multi-ethnic approach to their
jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also, as you know, established the Kosovo Transition
Council not without difficulty," and the Transitional Council is
currently "the supreme administrative body in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Mello and Kouchner, the U.N. special representative for
Kosovo, chaired the first meeting of the Council two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission also started the recruitment of local police
force, and 20,000 application forms have been distributed
throughout Yugoslavia, he said. "Eight thousand applications have
been received the day before yesterday."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. task of recruiting, financing and deploying 3,100
policemen in Kosovo has proven difficult with some 41 countries
volunteering police officers but not sending them immediately.
These include the United States, which has offered a list of 100
names and added 200 more after the criticism of U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The deputy U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a
press conference Friday that the United Nations now has over 350
civilian policemen in Kosovo and some additional 240 from Canada,
Russia and the United Nations are expected to be on the ground
early this coming week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate voted 57-43 Friday
to push through a 10-year and 792 billion dollar tax cut bill
which President Bill Clinton has vowed to veto.
</P>
<P>
The Senate plan would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14
percent, ease the so-called marriage penalty, reduce estate taxes
and increase contribution limits for Individual Retirement
Accounts.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives also passed a similar tax cut bill
of 792 billion dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has repeatedly said he would veto any measure
that closely resembles the Senate bill or a similar House measure
because the tax cuts are too large to leave money for Social
Security and other domestic programs and it will endanger the
nation's economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, both Republicans, met with their top deputies to discuss
the timetable for negotiations to resolve differences between the
two bills of the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
"We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.
That's what the fighting is all about," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
Lott said the goal was to get the bill through the House and
Senate by the end of next week, although it will probably be
September, after the congressional August recess, before it is
presented to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill faced a
certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said the
"large and risky tax cut" could carry America back "to the dark
old days of huge deficits."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than 300
billion dollars and only if it came after the future of Social
Security and Medicare was secured.
</P>
<P>
Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total
nearly 3 trillion dollars over the next decade, but the fight was
over what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of
approximately 1 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to
taxpayers while Democrats insisted that they should be used for
debt reduction and needed spending programs.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Satisfied with Ties With China: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is satisfied with
its friendly relationship with China not only in the military
field but also in political and economic sectors, a high-ranking
Tanzanian officer said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Tanzania People's Defense Force, General Robert Mboma,
 described these bilateral ties as "sincere" when attending a
reception in the Chinese embassy here in celebration of the 72th
anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
"We will not forget China's assistance," Mboma said. "People in
Dar es Salaam and other parts of Tanzania would say the friendship
demonstrated by China has been sincere."
</P>
<P>
Mboma said many Tanzanian army men, including himself, received
training in China.
</P>
<P>
The Charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy, Liu Youfa, who
hosted the reception, said the ties between the armed forces of
the China and Tanzania is an important part of the friendly
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in the past decades, the Chinese PLA has been
dedicated to developing its relationship with the armed forces of
other states, especially developing countries, on the basis of
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania's Minister of Defense and National Service
Edgar Maokola-Majogo will visit China at the end of this year. The
visit, he said, will strongly push the friendship between China
and Tanzania to a new level.

LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ignored new
U.S. inflation fear Friday to make modest advances despite an
uncertain start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Profit taking and a strong showing in the bank and oil sectors
helped to sustain London blue-chip gains for the entire session on
the day.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark FTSE 100 closed up 114.4 points, a gain of 1.87
percent, at 6,231.9 on provisional volume of 950m shares.
</P>
<P>
The index was lifted a strong performance from the banking
sector, prompted by strong results from Lloyds TSB. First-half
pre-tax profit at Britain's largest retail bank climbed 16 percent
to 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French FM Ends Mile-Stone Visit to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine ended on Friday a two-day mile-stone visit to Algeria,
which marked the returning to normal relations by France and
Algeria after years of troubles.
</P>
<P>
The visit could also be a prelude to a state visit by President
Jacques Chirac to Algeria widely expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine had on Friday a five-hour meeting with Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who assumed presidency in
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that France has a very strong
political will to ``recast'' its relations with Algeria, after
Bouteflika made some declarations and gestures aimed at improving
relations with Western countries while seeking a national
reconciliation at home.
</P>
<P>
He announced that France would re-open two consulates in the
Algerian port city of Oran and the eastern city of Annaba on an
unspecified date in near future.
</P>
<P>
The two consulates were closed in 1994 by France in fear of
terrorist attacks by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also said that the French national air company Air
France is expected to resume its flights to Algiers soon.
</P>
<P>
``The French government wishes that we can resume the flights
as quickly as possible. The decision of last resort depends on the
president of the air company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Air France suspended its flights to Algeria after an Airbus
passenger plane of the company was hijacked by Islamic militants
at the airport of Algiers in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
A resumption of flights by Air France will mean a recognition
by France of the improvement of security situation in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also said that France will open a cultural center in
Algiers at the beginning of 2000, which will be opened to Algerian
college students and scholars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday voted unanimously to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a further period of
six months until January 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted on the mandate extension, the Security
Council "reiterates its strong support for the territorial
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon
within its internationally recognized boundaries."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called upon all parties concerned to
cooperate fully with the U.N. force "for the full implementation
of its mandate."
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the Security Council "condemns all
acts of violence committed in particular against the Force, and
urges the parties to put an end to them."
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement, issued at the same time, said the
Security Council "expresses its concern over the continuing
violence in southern Lebanon, regrets of loss of civilian life,
and urges all parties to exercise restraint."
</P>
<P>
"The Council notes with deep concern the high level of
casualties which UNIFIL has suffered and pays a special tribute to
all those who gave their lief while serving in UNIFIL," the
presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
In his July 21 report to the Security Council, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "During the past six months,
the situation in the area remained volatile and continued to give
cause for serious concern."
</P>
<P>
As of June 1999. UNIFIL comprised 4,495 troops, they were from
Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, Nepal and
Poland.
</P>
<P>
"Since the establishment of UNIFIL, 227 members of the Force
have lost their lives," Annan said, "A total of 338 were wounded
by firing, or by mine or bomb explosion."

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Light Plane With 16 People Hijacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A commercial light plane of the
Venezolana Avior airline has been kidnapped by drug traffickers or
Colombian guerrillas, local sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft with 16 passengers aboard disappeared Friday
morning when it was about to land 20 miles from the Guasdalito
airport, about 650 kilometers southwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ignacio Arcaya said the aircraft, YV 466
Charli, Beechcraft 1900D, with seats for 19 people, took off
Friday morning from the Simon Bolivar Airport in Maiquetia, and
made a stop in the state of Barinas, from which it continued its
flight to Guasdalito.
</P>
<P>
The two-motor plane, piloted by Capt. Hector Hernandez, lost
contact with the control tower at 09:45 local time.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the plane disappearance is not known, but
according to Arcaya, the local authorities have two hypotheses: a
crash or a possible hijacking, either by common criminals, or by
the Colombian guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking version is acquiring credibility, because the
aircraft lost contact in the border areas with Colombia, where
there are guerrilla groups or paramilitary.
</P>
<P>
Air Force and National Guard helicopters are combing the zone
where the Avior light plane disappeared.
</P>
<P>
There is a contradiction about the number of passengers aboard.
The Globovision television network said, quoting Victor Delgado,
Civilian Transit director, that they are 16, including two pilots,
while the RCTV network says that the lost persons are 21.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Gold Mines Lose 63,000 Ounces of Gold for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC)
Group, one of the leading gold producers in the world, lost
approximately 63,000 ounces of gold at the Obuasi mine during the
industrial action by workers last May, an AGC report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
 However, operations have normalized and officials of the
company said production levels are set to improve gradually,
saying: "about half of the Obuasi production shortfall was offset
by 30,000 ounces better than the forecast production at the
Bibiani, Siguiri and Iduapriem mines," all owned by Ashanti.
</P>
<P>
 Total gold production for the second quarter stood at 744,772
ounces, which was below the forecast performance, compared with
705,875 ounces produced in the first quarter of 1998, the Ghana
News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics in the second quarter report of AGC said the
company, however, registered a six percent increase in its
earnings, making 16.4 million dollars compared to the 15.5
million dollars realized during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
 Turnover for the first six months of the company was 284.1
million dollars compared with the 277.3 million dollars in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
 The report said Ashanti has concluded an agreement with the
Ghana Mine workers' Union and Ministry of Employment and Social
Welfare that will make Ashanti reduce its work force by more than
2,000.
</P>
<P>
 The retrenchment, the report noted, has been accepted by the
Obuasi work force, and will be enforced over six months' period
from September 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to reduce Obuasi's operating cost by about seven
million dollars, a figure, equivalent to nine dollars per ounce at
current production levels.
</P>
<P>
 The report said Ashanti has increased its level of hedging
protection to 11 million ounces. Fifty percent of reserves are now
hedged at an average price of 389 dollars per ounce, protecting
the group against the current difficult gold market.
</P>
<P>
The first gold production will be on target in the second half
of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Haul of Ivory Seized in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan security officers seized a
haul of elephant tusks Thursday, the largest since ivory trade
was outlawed worldwide 10 years ago, sources of the Kenya Wildlife
Service (KWS) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 45 seized pieces of ivory were Friday displayed at Maralal
Town in northern Kenya where two suspects are being questioned in
connection with the recovery, said wildlife experts.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, some of the tusks on display had
bullet marks.
</P>
<P>
They noted the Maralal town was notorious for wildlife poaching
in the past decade, saying the haul could signal renewed poaching
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
KWS Chairman Charles Njonjo said at his headquarters here that
"security should be improved countrywide and poachers wiped out"
and he also appealed

to the public to assist security officers to track down the
poachers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya supported the world to ban ivory trade 10 years ago
following decimation of its wildlife resources at the hands of
poachers. Its elephant population had dropped to about 19,000 by
then from an estimated 600,000 in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The present population of elephants in the country has
increased to an estimated 28,000, said the KWS officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the KWS acting Director Nehemiah Rotich, the black
market price of a kilogram of ivory is 2,000 shillings (about 30
U.S. dollars) and an average tusk weighs 32 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed their fears of renewed poaching
activities since the International Convention on Endangered
Species allowed South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe to dispose of
part of their ivory stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
Kenya remains committed to the ban. Its worry is that
legalizing trade would spark poaching.

<HEADLINE> Ontario Sees Tripling of Hazardous Waste Imports From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Canada's southeastern province of
Ontario is becoming a chemical garbage dump for the U.S.,
according to a local newspaper "Ottawa Citizen" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hazardous waste imports from the U.S. nearly tripled between
1994 and 1998, from 85,000 tons to 230,000, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Ontario's exports of hazardous waste to the U.S. over the same
period rose by 40 percent to 145,000 tons from 105,000, it added.
</P>
<P>
Local environmentalists attribute the imbalance to lax Ontario
disposal standards in the face of the tightening U.S. standards.
</P>
<P>
But Ontario Environment Minister Tony Clement insists most of
the responsibility lies with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is urging federal Environment
Minister Christine Stewart to investigate ways to curb imports of
hazardous waste, the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> No Explanation Can Cover up Aim of "Two States" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China will not accept the attempt
by Lee Teng-hui to separate Taiwan from China with the statement
of "special state-to-state relations," according to a special
commentary co-written by the "People's Daily" and Xinhua News
Agency here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) in a speech made on July 12 demanded
that his counterpart, Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), clarify remarks made by Li Teng-hui and
himself on redefining the relations of the two sides as "state-to-
state," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities made no response for 18 days. Yesterday
afternoon, they faxed ARATS a letter and a written speech by Koo
Chen-fu, which not only repeated Lee's "two states" statement but
also added the words "fully reflecting the will of people in
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The written speech totally violates the "one China" principle
already reached by both sides of the Taiwan Straits in 1992, and
was of course rejected by ARATS, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
An ARATS official said that the written speech, which further
promulgated the "two states" statement, will be strongly opposed
by all people in China and cannot be accepted by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
People have taken note that Koo's written speech canceled out
the first part of Lee Teng-hui's remarks redefining relations
between the two sides as "state-to-state, or at least special
state-to-state relations," and also said such "special
relationship" will lay a basis for equality between both sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the "special state-to-state relations" statement is a
"two states" statement, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Koo's written speech tried to defend Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state relations" statement by cooking up several
explanations such as "both sides share a similar culture and a
special sentiment." If Lee Teng-hui has a sincere understanding of
these explanations the only conclusion should be the 'one China'
principle rather than "special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
Now that the "two states" statement has totally destroyed the
basis of bilateral contacts, exchanges, and dialogues between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits and distorted cross-Straits
relations into "relations between the two countries," isn't it
ridiculous to talk about the reunification of China? the
commentary asked.

"We persistently advocate that we will realize the
reunification of the motherland by peaceful means. In the course
of negotiations, the two sides should negotiate on matters of
reunification on an equal footing under the 'one China' principle,
" the article said.
</P>
<P>
To terminate the state of separation between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits and achieve the goal of reunification is the
sacred historical mission and unremitting pursuit of the Chinese
people. Two generations of CPC leadership, headed by Deng Xiaoping
and Jiang Zemin, have made unremitting efforts to seriously
implement peaceful reunification and the "one country, two systems
" policies.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one China in the world and the status of Taiwan
as a part of China remains unchanged. China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity brook no separation," the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to split China, Lee Teng-hui attacks the "one
China" policy without restraint.

<HEADLINE> Pak Seeks World Sanctions if India Refuses Talks on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Saturday that the
world community must reject India's diversionary tactics and exert
pressure including threat of sanctions if New Delhi continues to
refuse a meaningful dialogue with Pakistan on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz here
at a press conference upon his return from a tour of Helsinki,
Bucharest and London.
</P>
<P>
"If the world is interested in resolving the Kashmir issue, it
must forcefully reject India's diversionary tactics and exert
maximum pressure including threat of international sanctions if
India continues to refuse a meaningful dialogue with Pakistan on
Kashmir," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said India insists that Kashmir is a bilateral issue and
has to be resolved between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
However, at the same time, India sets preconditions for the
resumption of bilateral dialogue, like the complete withdrawal of
"freedom fighters" from India-held Kashmir, the inviolability of
the Line of Control in Kashmir and stopping all abetment of cross
border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Aziz described New Delhi's preconditions for the dialogue as
"totally unrealistic." He queried, "How can a meaningful dialogue
take place in the face of these double standards?"
</P>
<P>
He said that even when passions and tensions were not so high,
dialogue with India in the past 10 years over the Kashmir issue at
different levels proved totally futile.
</P>
<P>
He said during his meetings with European officials, there was
considerable appreciation of Pakistan's view on India's persistent
aversion to any outside involvement in the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said all the European leaders whom he met were deeply
concerned about the dangerous consequence of the non-resolution of
the Kashmir dispute and the continuing differences between
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of nuclear capability by both countries has
added, in their view, a new and ominous dimension to the
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that Pakistan has committed to composite dialogue
with India but wants settlement of the Kashmir issue on priority.
</P>
<P>
"The impression (created by India) that the other issues can be
taken first and Kashmir later is no longer feasible because of the
explosive nature of the Kashmir issue," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"First progress should be made on Kashmir and then on other
issues," the Pakistani foreign minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the eight-point agreement signed by the foreign
secretaries of the two countries in June 1997 and endorsed under
the Lahore Declaration also spelt out issues relating to peace and
security and strategic restraint regime.
</P>
<P>
"These issues can also be taken on priority," said Aziz.

ISTANBUL, July 31 (Xinhua) -- World champion Elena Zhupina of
Ukraine won her second diving gold at the European championships
on Saturday after beating Dolores Saez de Ibarra in the final.
</P>

back two and a half somersaults and half twist. The dive gave her
78.30 points, the highest score of the final.

Zhupina felt the pressure but still put up a good dive, earning
73.92 points from a back one and a half somersaults with 3 and a
half twists.

<HEADLINE> Exposure of Li Hongzhi, a Serious Political Struggle (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an imperative task to strengthen ideological and
political education on the Marxist outlook, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Every Communist should have a clear stand, recognize the
political nature and serious harm of Falun Gong, and be identical
with the Party Central Committee ideologically, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Li Hongzhi's doomsday preaching is to whip up public
opinion for achieving his political ambition. He said that no
government can solve current problems, only Li Hongzhi can solve
them because he is the master of the universe. These remarks
negate social reality and show a strong anti-government and anti-
societal tendency, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Falun Gong organizations have spread rumors
and created incidents which jeopardized social stability. Falun
Gong's sabotage of social order is a disturbance by an organized
force. If it is not curbed forcefully and in a timely manner, such
anti-societal force will shake the power basis of our socialist
country, it stated.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has been spread abroad as well as in China. It
expands its influence through the media and the Internet in a bid
to exert pressure on China from hostile forces in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Falun Gong has a profound social and international
background. It is a political struggle between the CPC and
domestic and international hostile forces to win over the masses.
"We will make a historic mistake if we fail to understand the
nature of this struggle," the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Approaching Opposition's Key Air base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Saturday managed to push forward to within five kilometers
of the opposition's key air base, sources from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban forces, after a fierce fighting, approached Bagram of
Parwan province, the location of the only air base under the
control of the anti-Taliban forces led by former defense minister
Ahmad Shah Masood of the Jamiat-i-Islamai group, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control nearly 90 percent of the war-ravaged
country, launched a major offensive Wednesday in a bid to wipe out
the opposition and extend their strict Islamic rule over the rest
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been fighting mainly on five battlefields --
the so-called Old Road, the New Road, Koh-i-Safi, the twin
districts of Tagab and Nejrab as well as Ghorband, all north or
northeast of the capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The frontlines ring the southern and western perimeter of the
Panjsher Valley, the last stronghold of the anti-Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
Masood and his troops, mainly Tajiks and ethnic Hazaras, Uzbeks
and Turkmen, have heavily fortified themselves in the Panjsher
Valley, where they have been fighting five years against the
ethnic Pushtun Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban still hold Nejrab, one of the seven known entries
into the valley, which they seized Wednesday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soldiers have reportedly been killed in three-day
battles and more than 1,000 others are estimated to have been
injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition forces claimed they repulsed a
Taliban assault in Dar-i-Safi in the northern province of
Samangan, killing 28 of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
Hussain Sohail, a spokesman for the Northern Alliance, said
Saturday that the opposition was ready for peace talks and warned
the Taliban that they could not achieve a military victory.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the Taliban's call Friday for surrender, saying no
unilateral cease-fire is possible.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two warring parties earlier this month
in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, failed to yield a cease-fire agreement.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Meet on Israeli Plan for Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ended talks Saturday that was
said to focus on Israel's plan for a delayed implementation of the
Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat did not speak to reporters after their
meeting in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, 220
kilometers northwest of Cairo, which came two days after Mubarak
discussed the Israel's proposal with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak in the same city.
</P>
<P>
Arafat later held talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa at a tourist resort in the west of Alexandria. Neither man
spoke to the press afterwards, and Arafat flew to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement, Israel should pull back from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank. After implementing the first stage
of the three-phase withdrawal, former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu shelved the accord.
</P>
<P>
Since election in May, Barak has repeated his promise to carry
out the deal. But meanwhile, he proposed to blend the third phase
of pullback with the negotiations for a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat opposes the plan, saying that he wants Wye to be
implemented as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday, Arafat is to chair a meeting of the Central
Committee of Fatah, the party led by him and the main movement in
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held in Cairo because Israel will not
allow three of the committee's members to enter the Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> New Material Evidence of Nanjing Massacre Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The remains of 21 more Chinese
victims of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre were exhumed today in the
Jiangdongmen area of Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
With those found last year, there are now five layers of
remains at this site, and we can see what the Japanese invaders
did to the Chinese during the massacre through an examination of
these remains. Some of the victims' heads were cut off, and a 10-
cm-long rusty reinforcing bar was found pierced through the pelvis
of a female victim. Most of the dead were young men.
</P>
<P>
From April to September last year, a total of 50 bodies were
found in the area, and historians confirmed that they were Nanjing
Massacre victims after examinations and medical tests.
</P>
<P>
Qi Kang, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
a well-known architectural designer, has designed a hall for the
remains in collaboration with his postgraduate students.
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Hall to the Nanjing Massacre Victims will organize
a group of archeologists to continue excavating the area. The
remains will be preserved as material evidence of the atrocities
committed by the Japanese troops during their invasion of China.

<HEADLINE> Using Scientific Philosophy to Conquer Fatalistic Theory of Falun Gong: Officials and People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Officials and people from all
walks of life in China today refuted the fatalistic philosophy
propagated by Falun Gong, and vowed their determination to build a
scientific philosophy to conquer the blindness of superstition.
</P>
<P>
Hong Xiaonan, associate professor at Dalian Engineering
University in northeast China's Liaoning Province, said that the
book "Wheel of Law" written by Li Hongzhi spread a doomsday theory
that is anti-human, anti-society, anti-government, and anti-
science.
</P>
<P>
The theory intends to wear down people's determination and make
them subservient to Li, he said, as Li aims to apotheosize himself
by playing the part of savior.
</P>
<P>
Song Jiaren, head of the branch hospital of the Medical College
of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, noted that
Falun Gong spread an obvious fatalistic theory, one that goes
against medical science.
</P>
<P>
It regards illness as an adversity resulting from a previous
life, and the illness as the way of removing the adversity, he
said. As a result, many Falun Gong practitioners do not see
doctors or receive medical treatment while they are ill. This
delay of medical treatment in hospitals has lead to hundreds of
deaths, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Weiming, a senior engineer with the seismic bureau of
Ningxia, said that the theory of a global explosion and a coming
doomsday spread by Falun Gong is contrary to astronomic
observations and scientific results. The irresponsible idea that
only the practice of Falun Gong can help escape from these "
disasters" is just a daydream.

Zhang Jisheng, a scientific official in Ningxia, emphasized
that it's worth pondering over the topic of the fatuity of Falun
Gong's superstitious activities, which are meant to take advantage
of people's desire for good health.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen the promotion of scientific knowledge
among the people to overcome fatuous superstition," the official

<HEADLINE> Using Scientific Philosophy to Conquer Fatalistic Theory of Falun Gong: Officials and People (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two scientific researchers in north China's Shanxi Province,
who published an article critical of the fatalism of Falun Gong,
pointed out that this fatalistic theory is an attempt by Li to
make practitioners believe that he can dominate people's fate and
that they all must be controlled by him. He wants to realize his
ulterior political purpose by obtaining eminent domain over people
's mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
Guan Zhiwei, a former Falun Gong practitioner, said he withdrew
from the practice of Falun Gong last June and supports the central
government's ban on the illegal organization.
</P>
<P>
Guan, a medic in south China's Guangdong Province, said he
realized the true face of Li Hongzhi from a series of illegal
activities organized by Li such as attacks on news media units and
governmental departments.
</P>
<P>
Li always played the savior and let us worship him, Guan said,
this demonstrates that Falun Gong's nature is based on fatalism.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar attended by scientists and educators in Chongqing
Municipality in southwest China, the experts and scholars strongly
condemned the fatalistic theory of Li Hongzhi and said they will
insist on teaching students a Marxist scientific world view.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong fallacies will have no corner to exist on campus,
and with wider popularization of modern scientific and
technological knowledge, more and more people will see clearly the
true nature of Falun Gong, they concluded.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Beijing today hosted a seminar attended
by 40 medical experts who refuted Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong. They
called on people to receive timely medical treatment when they
fall ill, and rid themselves of the deception and malicious cult
of Falun Gong through promoting scientific knowledge.

<HEADLINE> 11 Military Personnel Killed in PKK Attacks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Eleven military personnel were
killed in attacks by the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
late Friday night in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A group of PKK rebels killed six village guards and wounded
another when they accompanied four telecommunication workers to
fix telephone in the Kirkgecit village of Gurpinar town of van
province that borders Iran, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Later, the PKK rebels released the telecommunication workers
they captured in the attacks, it added.
</P>
<P>
The agency also said that five soldiers were killed and 13
others wounded when a military vehicle hit a mine, planted by the
PKK near Kirkgecit village.
</P>
<P>
The military vehicle hit the mine on its way to reinforce the
village guards, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that the injured were rushed to Van Military Hospital
by helicopter for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The PKK attacks on
government targets continue after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was
sentenced to death by Turkey's Ankara State Security Court last
June.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between the Turkish security forces and the PKK
rebels have claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Handwritten Instructions Show Evidence of Falun Gong Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A newly discovered application
carrying handwritten instructions by Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi
approving the establishment of a Falun Gong guidance group in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, has provided
fresh evidence for the fact that Falun Gong has a tight
organization.
</P>
<P>
The instructions, written on April 15, 1994 on the margin of
the application for Li's approval of the establishment of the
Nanhua District Falun Gong Guidance Group submitted by a group of
Falun Gong practitioners in Nanjing, read: "I agree that you set
up a Falun Gong guidance group in your district. You may contact
the general station in Wuhan." Wuhan is capital of central Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
An examination by the local public security department shows
that the instructions are in Li's own handwriting.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Jiafang, Ran Yinluo, and Zang Chunlei, all
former members of the group, about 70 Falun Gong practitioners
from Nanjing, led by Liu Ruwen, a retired doctor, went to Hefei,
capital of east China's Anhui Province, to attend Falun Gong
courses given by Li Hongzhi in April 1994. On April 15 of the same
month, Liu submitted the application to Li who gave the approval
the same day.
</P>
<P>
China's central government banned Falun Gong as an illegal cult
on July 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
Investigations indicate that Falun Gong was not registered
according to law and had been engaged in illegal activities,
advocating superstition and spreading malicious fallacies,
hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, and
jeopardizing social stability.

On July 24, the daily temperature in the Tianjin urban area
reached a record 39.5 degrees centigrade, and was as high as 40
degrees in some outlying areas.
</P>

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China today condemned recent
United States and British airstrikes against civilian targets in
Iraq, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the U.S. and Britain have continuously launched
airstrikes on civilian targets in the no-fly zones in southern and
northern parts of Iraq in recent days, causing serious casualties
and property loss, and noted that China condemns this.

China believes that the U.S. and British military action
against Iraq is not conducive to the settlement of the Iraqi issue,
and has also called for an immediate halt to the military action,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of the establishment of the no-fly zones
in Iraq, and we hold that Iraq's sovereignty and territorial

should be peacefully solved based on the U.N. Charter, the
relevant U.N. resolutions, and norms governing international
relations," the spokesman stated.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Plans 5 More Marches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The opposition alliance led by the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will organize five more road
marches in the next two months to muster support against what they
called the government's "misrule," The Daily Star said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After completing the proposed road marches in August and
September, the alliance also plans to announce the "Dhaka
Siege" program on November 7 to dislodge the Awami League
government, The Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance comprises the major opposition parties
-- the BNP, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islam and the Islami
Oikya Jote.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the siege program is "Let's Go to Dhaka and
Besiege the Autocrat." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and chiefs of
other opposition parties during the July 25-27 road marches called
upon people to prepare to go to Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The BNP will carry out road marches from Dhaka to the Sylhet
division in the northeast, to the Khulna division in the southwest
and to the Barisal division in the south, a policy-maker of the
BNP was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there will be two one-day road marches from Dhaka to
Manikganj (northwest) and Bhairab (northeast), and like the road
marches held last May and this month, the three road marches will
be led by the chiefs of the partners of the alliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the political atmosphere in the country will become hot
gradually and will gain full force in October.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has unearthed eight
skulls of human beings and an assortment of bones believed to
belong to victims of the slave trade in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
The remains have been unearthed from a grave in Pangani town,
some 190 kilometers north of Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, the
Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The skulls and bones were discovered in a one-meter-deep grave,
situated on a plot near the historical one-story building now
housing the District Education Office, less than 10 meters from
the seafront.
</P>
<P>
The remains were found when the Tanzania Telecommunications
Company Limited workers were digging a foundation for a telephone
tower.
</P>
<P>
The district cultural officer, Leonard Sekibaha, took a piece
of bone for examination in the northern town Moshi to determine
when the owner was buried, the report said.
</P>

Pangani, like Bagamoyo, was once a famous auction center for
the infamous slave trade and some relics of the horrible trade are
still available to date.

<HEADLINE> Possible Cause of Detonator Explosion Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The mixed transportation of two
contraindicated detonators might be the cause of the explosion in
Changshou County, Chongqing Municipality in southwest China, which
killed 14 and seriously injured 18 others on July 27.
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, experts from the public security
departments of Chongqing Municipality, neighboring Yunnan Province,
and the government of Changshou County believe the truck may have
violated State regulations on the transportation of explosives by
carrying 285 kg of two contraindicated detonators.
</P>
<P>
Also, the boxes containing the detonators were not tightly
secured during transportation. A possible collision of the two
detonators in the course of transportation may have caused the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Experts have ruled out the possibility that the explosion was
caused by any individual.
</P>
<P>
The truck started out from Yunnan Province, and suddenly
exploded as it passed the residential area of Fengcheng Township
in Changshou County.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian today solemnly warned Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan
authorities here "not to underestimate our firm resolution to
safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity, not to
underestimate our courage and strength against separation and
Taiwan's independence."
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist

Central Military Commission, and state councilor, made the remarks
during a reception today marking the 72nd founding anniversary of

<P>
He noted that China will continue to seek a solution to the
Taiwan issue in accordance with the basic principles of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"However, going against the will of the entire Chinese people
and the tide of history, Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities
have brazenly redefined cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state
relations," thus going further and further down the dangerous road
of dividing the country," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister: PLA to be Leaner, Stronger with Chinese Characteristics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian stressed here today that "we should do everything within
the framework of the overall military strategy for the new
historical period and unswervingly take the road of building a
leaner but stronger army with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and state councilor, made the remarks
during a reception today marking the 72nd founding anniversary of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
"We should implement the strategy of building a strong army
through science and technology and enhance its combat
effectiveness by relying upon scientific and technological
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should keep up with the trends in military development in
the world, more vigorously carry out studies on military theories
suited to Chinese conditions, strengthen defense-related
scientific and technological research, and gradually upgrade our
weaponry and equipment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi reiterated the hope that efforts should be made to "
effectively strengthen the PLA's defense capabilities and combat
effectiveness in war with modern technologies, especially for hi-
tech wars."
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the training of military personnel, Chi
emphasized that "a contingent of new-type, well-educated, and well-
disciplined military personnel" should be brought up to "lay a
solid foundation for building the PLA in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Chi also said that the PLA should intensify efforts to make
itself politically and ideologically sound, and should "keep to
its nature, purpose, and inherent quality."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be strict with the army, and run the army
in accordance with law, so as to build a more regular army," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Expedition Team Discovers Anchored Buoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists on the Snow
Dragon, the expeditionary vessel carrying 124 Chinese scientists
and journalists to the North Pole, discovered an anchored buoy
early today while on an inspection tour of the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
The buoy was later confirmed to be an ocean supervising device
that uses satellites to transmit data about the changing ocean
environment.
</P>
<P>
The buoy consists of two parts, one under water and a data
transmission antenna above the water, and is located at 59 degrees
14 minutes 59 seconds north latitude, and 178 degrees 46 minutes
47 seconds west longitude.
</P>
<P>
The number 70435 is printed on the buoy, and there is a signal
light on a small floating ball trailing behind the buoy. The buoy'
s anchor is believed to lie about 2,500-meter-deep in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
According to scientist Zhao Jinping aboard the ship, the
anchored buoy is mainly used to monitor sea changes for weather
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese expedition team has already recorded the number,
location, and time of the discovery of the buoy for later
communications with any concerned foreign counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The expedition, China's first government-sponsored Arctic
expedition, will take more than two months to complete, with the
scientists aboard expected to return home in late September.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister Reviews Last Year's Army Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) successfully approached its goal of downsizing the army
by 500,000 last year, according to Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and state councilor, made the remarks
during a reception today marking the 72nd founding anniversary of
the PLA.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA is reorganizing and restructuring itself in phases in
a planned manner with the main objective of downsizing the army by
500,000, which will be another step forward toward developing 'a
leaner but stronger and more efficient' composite force," said Chi.
</P>
<P>
Chi added that the PLA has made progress in "building a
revolutionary, modernized, and regular army" in line with the
general requirements of "political soundness and military
competence, a fine style of work, strict discipline, and adequate
logistic support" as put forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
On the PLA's implementation of the decision to disengage the
PLA and the Armed Police forces from business activities, Chi
pointed out that "the PLA has promptly shut down its commercial
enterprises and handed them over to local authorities."
</P>
<P>
The PLA's victory over last summer's devastating floods added
another glorious chapter to the history of the army, Chi said.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi

and the new 'gunboat policy,'" he indicated, adding that "we

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Lagos State Sees 839 Murders in 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The crime seemed to be on the rise
in the past years in Nigeria's economic hub Lagos state, with
police having officially listed at least 839 murder cases for the
period of 1990-97, The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released recently by police show that no fewer
than 378, 720 persons had been held as suspects, in connection
with 399,604 various criminal acts during the period.
</P>
<P>
The offenses range from murder and armed robbery to kidnapping,
rape and indecent assault, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The two major capital offenses - murder and armed robbery,
which usually attract death sentence, have seen a continuous
soaring in the past years, according to the police statistics.
</P>
<P>
The rising crime rate in Nigeria's major cities is a great
concern for the new civilian government, which has adopted such
measures as establish quick-action police force and expanding
police recruitment to combat the trend.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and years of corruptive rule of the military regimes
are believed to be at the root of the crime surge.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Sleazy Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Film and Censors
Board Friday issued a ban on locally packaged films with occult
themes in a bid to check the growing sleaze in video entertainment
and the negative influence on society.
</P>
<P>
Video productions banned by the board as having negative
cultural tendencies are those with themes on occultism and
cultism, fetishism, witchcraft, voodooism, devilish spiritualism,
uncontrolled tendency for sexual display, bloodiness, incest,
violence as well as poisoning, the Guardian newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By that token, the stage seems set for tighter ethical control
of the burgeoning industry believed to be highly influential in
societal acculturation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached following the board's review of past
approvals, upon which it was discovered that films hitherto
brought for "registration, examination, assessment, analysis,
evaluation and classification" revolved mostly around negative
themes.
</P>
<P>
Movies already in the market without prior approval by the
board will henceforth be sanctioned in accordance with the
relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to the censors board, films and production "which
continue to exploit mainly these themes or topics ... will no
longer receive approval for public release, in view of the obvious
imbalance."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the board is dissatisfied with the manner in which
several of the productions were packaged, particularly with the
"noticeable deficiencies or defect in their presentation".
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the censors board, Ademola James, said
that such films were purely motivated by the excessive desire for
profit by movie makers, marketers and investors.
</P>
<P>
"Pandering to unsavory public taste is not in consonance with
the artistic excellence and positive image projection which all
movie makers should strive to maintain," he noted
</P>
<P>
"Operators and practitioners who choose to defy this warning by
putting such negatively oriented movies in the market without
prior submission to the board will have the full weight of the law
applied against them," James said.

<HEADLINE> Unilever Confident of Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- We consider China a very large
potential market, and as a European enterprise with one of the
largest investments in the country, we expect a bright future,
Chris Mason, marketing manager of Unilever (China) Ltd., said here
today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The original company, known as Lever Brothers, set up their
largest soap factory in the Far East in Shanghai as early as 1924,
and the modern company established Unilever (China) Ltd. on the
original factory site in 1986, the first Western enterprise
dealing in daily consumer products to return to the Chinese market
after China's implementation of the reform and opening-up policy
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise now has a number of joint ventures in Shanghai,
Beijing, Guangzhou, and Hefei, producing food and detergents. It
has also established a research center at the Shanghai Institute
of Organic Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
Unilever also signed an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal
government in 1997 on the establishment of a research fund,
offering 300,000 US dollars to the Shanghai Municipal Science and
Technology Commission over a three year period.
</P>
<P>
The success of Lux in the Chinese market shows that China has
become one part of the international market, said Chris Mason.
</P>
<P>
Lever Brothers, established in 1894 with headquarters in London
and Rotterdam, now has 300 cooperative firms in 90 countries
worldwide, with an annual sales volume exceeding 50 billion U.S.
dollars. The company was ranked tenth among the 500 largest
enterprises in 1998 in terms of net profit.

<HEADLINE> Exposure of Li Hongzhi, a Serious Political Struggle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The influential Chinese bimonthly
magazine Qiushi (Seeking Truth) said in its seventh special issue
that China's ongoing struggle against the Falun Gong organization
is an ideological and political struggle which has a bearing on
the fundamental faith of Communists.
</P>
<P>
Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, disseminates idealism and theism,
negates all scientific truth, demands that practitioners act in
accordance with the doctrine of Li Hongzhi, and prohibits them
from following other theories, said a commentary in the bimonthly
published here today.
</P>
<P>
In other words, Falun Dafa forbids people from believing in any
scientific truth, including Marxism. This obviously violates China
's Constitution and poses a grave challenge to the fundamental
guiding ideology of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
government, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proven once again that if Marxism doesn't occupy the
ideological sphere, non-Marxism or anti-Marxism will be bound to
seize it. So long as one fails to grasp Marxist scientific outlook
and methodology, it is impossible for one to have firm ideals and
faith, distinguish right from wrong, the beautiful from the ugly,
or the benevolent from the evil, and then one is bound to deviate
from the principle of Party spirit, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Falun Gong has attained its goal of
infiltrating the minds of some Party members and cadres by taking
advantage of a lack of political sensitivity to transform their
world outlook. When they start practicing Falun Gong, their ideals
and faith will waver, and they will deviate from Marxism and Party
principles.

<HEADLINE> Arab Popular Forces Conference Condemns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Popular Forces
Conference on Friday concluded with a statement condemning
U.S.-British aggression on Iraq and continuation of
U.N. sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
The final session of the non-governmental organization's
meeting was attended by Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and other Iraqi senior officials,
the Iraqi News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the conference stressed that the
continuation of the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq and the
imposition of the so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern
Iraq contradict all international values and norms.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, 17 Iraqi civilians were killed and
dozens of others injured in U.S. and British air raids on civil
and service installations in the two no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Security Council to live up to their legal and ethical
responsibilities and seriously work for the lifting of the embargo
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Terming the continuation of the U.N. embargo on Iraq as an
"American decision," the statement said Arab nations should work
together to beat up the decision.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting demanded to put an end to the
American and British military presence in the Gulf which they said
targets the independence of regional countries.
</P>
<P>
They called for holding an Arab summit to draw up a strategy
for defending the interests and rights of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the necessity of releasing Iraq's assets
frozen in Arab banks, the participants also urged the U.N. to
stop the deduction of the compensation sums and U.N. committee
costs from Iraqi oil revenues and allocate all Iraq's oil
revenues to meet its people's needs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which started on Friday evening, was initiated by
the Jordanian National Mobilization Committee in Defense of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Send 60 Police Officers to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to send 60 Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC), Northern Ireland's police force, to help keep
order in Kosovo, a British newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 60 RUC men have been chosen because they are the British
policemen with the most appropriate experience, the Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike mainland British police, the RUC are accustomed to
routinely carrying weapons, patrolling with the military and
working with divided communities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guardian, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
who visited the Kosovo capital of Pristina on Friday, would make
an announcement about it on Saturday during another brief trip to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Serbian forces has left the province without
a police service.
</P>
<P>
"We regard policing as a key function in Kosovo, and we want to
encourage others to follow suit and put people on the ground," a
British official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The relevant U.N. plans call for a force of 3,200 officers in
Kosovo. Member sates have already pledged 2,100, but only a
handful are in place in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Friday night in south
Lebanon by Lebanese guerrillas' attacks, the militia's official
radio Voice of the South reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the two militiamen were injured by shrapnels of
shells fired at their post at Sujod in the central sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Shiite Muslim group Amal led by House Speaker Nabih
Berri claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its fighters
launched rocket and machine-gun operations against a number of
Israeli posts Friday, scoring direct casualties.

Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements, including the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the pro-Syrian
Amal, have been fighting to oust Israeli forces and SLA out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> 4 Jordanians Get Minor Prison Terms for Alleged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Four Jordanians have been sentenced
to minor prison terms ranging from five to 12 months for killing
two women in separate incidents to cleanse their honor, the
semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Suleiman, 19, was sentenced to 12 months in prison
Thursday for killing his 21-year-old sister in February in the
southern Jordan Valley. His sister was six-month pregnant out of
the wedlock.
</P>
<P>
The court also handed down a five-month prison term to each of
another three men after declaring them guilty of murdering their
17-year-old relative Maha Walid in the Wadi Hajar district on
February 7.
</P>
<P>
The three men, who were Wadi's father, uncle and brother, shot
dead the girl for allegedly leaving home with strangers and
engaging in sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
Also, the girl's aunt, Tarfah Shehadeh received three months of
imprisonment for providing the gun used in the killing.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Jordanian young women died each year for alleged sex
affairs in the so-called honor killings, which were often carried
out by their fathers, brothers, husbands or other male relatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the Code of Penalties of the kingdom pardons or
reduces the penalties for men convicted of the honor killing.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from human rights groups, a special committee
under the Ministry of Justice has proposed to remove the clauses
in the code which it said benefited the honor killers.
</P>
<P>
The move has yet to be approved by the parliament and then by
a royal decree.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Strives for Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- When Joseph Estrada took oath as
Philippines' President on June 30 last year, he promised to
eradicate poverty of the country during his six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Over one more year passed, what has his government done for
some 20 million poor Filipinos?
</P>
<P>
As two-thirds of the country's poor people live in rural areas,
the most important aspect of the government's poverty eradication
program is to transform the country's agriculture and fisheries
into "technologically advanced and globally competitive sectors."
</P>
<P>
A major measure to realize this object is to expand linkage
between farms and markets, and between rural and urban areas,
through construction of roads, power, transport,
telecommunications and other infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
In the past one year, the government built 582 kilometers of
roads and 10,069 lineal meters of bridges, provided electricity to
1,221 villages and installed 165,000 new telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The government also distributed more than 266,000 hectares of
land to 175,000 landless farmers to accelerate the country's land
redistribution process under the agrarian reform program.
</P>
<P>
The second measure is to help the poorest families in the
country. The government has identified 100 poorest families in
each province and city and asked concerned government agencies and
the private sector to set up livelihood programs for them.
</P>
<P>
The third measure is to provide teachers, policemen, soldiers,
government employee, wage earners and squatter families with
"decent, affordable shelters."
</P>
<P>
To carry out the housing plan, the government allocated 80
percent of it's housing funds to the poorest sector of the
population and only 20 percent to those who can afford to buy
housing units, a reversal of the previous administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
In line with this commitment, the government has set aside
about 21 billion pesos (525 million U.S. dollars) for its
socialized housing program.
</P>
<P>
From July 1998 to March 1999, the government provided 127,886
units of housing assistance which benefited some 74,000
households.
</P>
<P>
The government is also pushing for the passage by the congress
of a measure that would increase the capital of the Home Insurance
Guarantee Fund from 2.5 billion pesos (62.5 million dollars) to 50
billion pesos (1.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the government reoriented the country's preferences
towards industries, enterprises and technologies to provide more
job opportunities for the poor.
</P>
<P>
For example, the government is paying more attention to
encouraging investments in labor-intensified small and
medium-scale industries, specially in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The fifth aspect Measure is to provide more education
opportunity for poor children. During the past year, the
government held 1,500 pre-school classes for poor kids in the
country's 20 faraway provinces, enabling almost 100,000
five-year-old kids to attend preschool classes free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The government likewise spent 760 million pesos (19 million
dollars) to help 380,000 kids go to private high schools and is
now working on a plan to provide textbooks for other cash-strapped
students.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is confident that through the
implementation of the pro-poor policies, more poor Filipino masses
will be placed in the mainstream of national development.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Launches HIV/AIDS Action in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has launched a
strategic plan aimed at reinforcing action against HIV/AIDS in
Africa, citing that the scourge is not only affecting health but
development.
</P>
<P>
Harold Wackman, the World Bank's Kenya country director, said
that the institution is putting HIV/AIDS at the center of its
development agenda through the plan entitled "Intensifying Action
against HIV/AIDS in Africa: Responding to a Development Crisis."
</P>
<P>
The plan will help to increase resources and technical support
for HIV/ AIDS prevention efforts, to inform African countries with
expanded knowledge of AIDS and push HIV/AIDS into the center of
national agendas.
</P>
<P>
"More than 11 million Africans have died, and another 22
million are now living with HIV/AIDS. This is two-thirds of all
the cases on the earth," the Daily Nation newspaper Saturday
quoted Wackman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The 21 countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world
are in Africa," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He warned that AIDS was swiftly undoing the development
achievements of African countries in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Wackman attributed ignorance, inaction and lack of resources to
the deteriorating spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.

</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Strengthen Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is taking
steps to strengthen environmental protection, Environment and
Natural Resources Minister William Harrington said in Lusaka
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act is being
amended to empower inspectors of the Environmental Council of
Zambia to arrest and prosecute companies and individuals
defrauding the environmental regulations, said Harrington.
</P>
<P>
Anyone found in illegal timber dealings would pay fines,
according to an amended act.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted the minister as
saying that other types of punishment were being discussed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Harrington said that the act enacted in 1990 did not empower
the environmental council to arrest. This had rendered the
council toothless, thereby making the environment vulnerable to
degradation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said this had in turn made serious threats to
bio-diversity in the southern African country and that the economy
was under serious threat because it depended on the environment.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the new act which would be presented in
Parliament soon would help solve the problem through the powers to
be vested in the environmental council.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendment would serve as model to meet
socio-economic development needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Harrington bemoaned the high number of companies breaking the
environmental regulations, saying that the new regulation was
required to provide a permanent control mechanism.

<HEADLINE> HK Deficit Stands at 22.7 Billion HK Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong recorded a deficit of
22.7 billion HK dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) in the first
three months of the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Saturday in its financial results for the
three months ended June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure for the first three months of the current financial
year amounted to 59,504.3 million HK dollars (7,628.8 million U.S.
dollars) and revenue to 36,762.1 million HK dollars (4,713.1
million U.S. dollars), resulting in a deficit of 22,742.2 million
HK dollars (2,915.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fiscal reserves stood at 411,560.2 million HK dollars (52,
764.1 million U.S. dollars) by June 30, a decrease of 22,742.2
million HK dollars compared with the balance of 434,302.4 million
HK dollars (55,679.8 million U.S. dollars) on March 31, 1999, the
end of the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that the government's accounts were
prepared on a cash basis and reflected the incidence of receipts
and payments during the period.
</P>
<P>
"The results remain in line with our expectations, based on the
budgeted deficit for the year of 36.5 billion HK dollars (4.7
billion U.S. dollars) as announced by the financial secretary in
his Budget Speech on March 3," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Prepares National Plan to Combat Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will spend 22 million
Jordanian dinars (some 30.8 million U.S. dollars) in a three-year
national action plan to combat drug abuses and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The plan, prepared by the National Higher Committee to Combat
Drugs, is also aimed at rehabilitating drug addicts and launching
public education campaigns against drugs, Jordan Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be carried out by the committee in close
cooperation with police, ministries of health, administrative and
social development.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Jordan will also put its borders under
stricter control and strengthen its cooperation with Arab and
international agencies involved in the battle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has witnessed a rise in the number of drug abusers, and
at least 16 people died during the past three years due to
narcotics overdoses, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The use of hashish is common among drug abusers because of its
relatively low costs, but heroin abuse has also been on the rise
among Jordanians in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Police seized 54 kilograms of hashish, seven kilograms of
heroin, 62 kilograms of opium in May and June alone this year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials blamed the rise in drug abuses on the lack
of family control over the youngsters, failure of educational
campaigns to promote public awareness of the dangers of drugs and
the growing problem of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate of the desert kingdom stood at more than
16 percent annually in the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Repatriates 1,474 Ethiopian Refugees From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has concluded the repatriation
of 1,474 refugees from camps in northern Kenya to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The last plane load of 55 Ethiopian refugees left Kenya Friday,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-flight repatriation of the Ethiopians began on July 15
and was completed Friday, according to UNHCR officials.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials said the refugees volunteered to go back to
their country after their government accepted them.
</P>
<P>
Prior to departure they were inoculated against yellow fever,
supplied with tents, given 60 U.S. dollars each and food rations
to last three months.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are victims of the 1977 border war between
Ethiopia and Somalia in 1977. They took refuge in Somalia which
lost the war but ran into Kenya in 1991 when Somalia lapsed into
anarchy after the collapse of the central government.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Marcos Paulo and Ronaldinho
scored two goals in each half to pace Brazil for its third
straight win over New Zealand, securing its top spot in the group
and booking its semifinal berth in the Confederations Cup in
Guadalajara Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Paulo made an unexpected shot from afar in the injury time of
the first half, beating goalkeeper Michael Utting aghast, while
Ronaldinho fired a free kick to the right of the goal in the 87th
minute.
</P>
<P>
After the all the preliminary matches concluded, Brazil that
booked its semifinal berth even before the game, will play Saudi
Arabia in a Sunday semifinal while Mexico plays the United States
that eliminated Germany 2-0 early today.
</P>
<P>
Brazil fielded in many new starters for the game against New
Zealand that alway kicked out of the tournament prior to the game,
even Ronaldinho who scored in all the three group matches, was
sent in as a second half substitute.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's defense seemed to crumble in the second half but
they also wasted two great scoring opportunities in a battle
expected to be won by the Brazilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Andre Agassi had an
easy sailing as his opponent surrendered after injury, while
Michael Chang was toppled by a low-ranked Australian in the
quarterfinals of the Mercedez Benz Cup tennis tournament in Los
Angeles on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Agassi led 5-4 in the first set when Lleyton
Hewitt sprained his left ankle and asked to stop the game for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Aussie returned to the court to hit a few balls
before he told the umpire he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
Agassi thus will face another Aussie Andrew Ilie in the
semifinal, who beat unseeded Frenchman Anthony Dupuis 6-7 (6/8), 6-
4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Sampras also meets an Aussie in the semifinal, a
qualifier James Sekulov who eliminated Michael Chang 2-6, 6-2, 6-2,
after his victory over South African Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
"By far this is the best I've played against him," said Sampras,
who had lost the last four of five meetings against Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
"Knowing I lost to Wayne four times in a row, I came out pumped
up, almost too much so," he added.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Williams Advances into Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Second-seeded Venus Williams
beat sixth-seeded Anna Kournikova 6-1, 6-3 in a teenager-
quarterfinal of the Bank of the West Classic in California Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The American Williams, ranked fourth in the world, used a
powerful serve and hard ground strokes to beat Russian Kornikova,
ranked 13th in the world, for the fourth straight time.
</P>
<P>
"I believe when anyone tries to hit with me, that's when you're
going to lose," said the 18-year-old Williams who enjoyed a 36-6
record this year.
</P>
<P>
After Kournikova broke serve to tie the second set at 3-3,
Williams kept winning all the way to seal the competition in
merely 67 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Williams thus will play fourth-seeded Amanda Coetzer, who
rallied for a 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory over eighth-seeded Sandrine
Testud.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Davenport recorded another remarkable win of 6-3, 6-3
over Cornia Morariu and will play her semifinal opponent Amy
Frazier who advanced with a 7-5, 6-0 victory over Luxembourg's
Anne Kremer.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the world's top-ranked player, recorded four aces in
the same game.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro May Hold Referendum on Standing in Yugoslavia: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, 30 July (Xinhua) -- President Milo Djukanovic of the
Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro declared in Sarajevo Friday that
the Republic of Montenegro may hold a referendum on its standing
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Montenegro will soon present guiding principles
to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to help re-define relations
with it, Djukanovic said. The basic principles are "equal
participation, democracy and legal system within the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not
accept the principles, a referendum will be held to decide the
Republic of Montenegro's "legal standing."
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic said the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should open
to the European integration. The Republic of Montenegro insists on
establishing an "open, democratic and multi-nationality country"
so as to join the integration of Europe either with Serbia or
alone.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic was invited to participate in the Southeast Europe
Stability Pact Summit in Sarajevo, but Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic was excluded.

NAIROBI -- Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC) Group, one of the
leading gold producers in the world, lost approximately 63,000
ounces of gold at the Obuasi mine during the industrial action by
workers last May, an AGC report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, operations have normalized and officials of the
company said production levels are set to improve gradually,
saying "about half of the Obuasi production shortfall was offset
by 30,000 ounces better than the forecast production at the
Bibiani, Siguiri and Iduapriem mines," all owned by Ashanti. (

<HEADLINE> Cuba Enjoys Harvest Day at Pan American Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuba enjoyed a harvest
day while the traditional force United States suffered a shutout
defeat on the last day of the athletics competitions of the 13th
Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
But the Cuban triumph on the athletics field, which saw them
rush in half of the ten golds at stake, inflicted little impact in
the medals standings, with the United States still taking a firm
grip on the top place with a total of 62 golds.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Canada are still battling out for the second place,
with the former taking a temporary lead on a 32-26-28 record.
Canada was third with a 28-29-36.
</P>
<P>
With the Pan Am athletics competitions wrapped up here today,
Cuba has taken the place of the United States as the No.1 track
and field country in the Americas. The Cuban athletes churned out
a total of 11 golds, against 10 for the United States, to lead the
final athletics medals table.
</P>
<P>
The United States, mostly composed of second-choice athletes,
had a nightmare in University of Manitoba Stadium today, denied
any accesses to what might be called their back-yard territory.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's five golds were even more remarkable as three of them
were companied by Pan Am record-breaking performances, from the
women's 100m hurdles, men's 110m hurdles and men's 4X400m relay
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the glamour event of men's 4X100m relay, Brazil achieved a
stunning win over the heavily-favored Olympic champions Canada,
shattering the 24-year-old Games record to win gold in 38.18.
</P>
<P>
Canada, with former men's 100m world record holder Donovan
Bailey running the first leg, came in a disappointing second
before a packed home crowd at University of Manitoba Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica established a new Games record to chalk up the gold in
the women's 4X100m relay, winning in 42.62 against the old best
time of 42.90. And in the men's 4X400m relay, the Jamaican
foursome squeezed the Pan Am record down to 2:57.97 to take the
gold.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the United States struck two more golds and
Guatemala broke duck in the medal count when the Pan Am shooting
competitions wrapped up here today.
</P>
<P>
On a day which saw the rawing competitions concluded, South
American rowing force Argentina came ashore with a pair of golds,
boosting their medals tally to eight.
</P>
<P>
In cycling, the United States wheeled away three more cycling
golds while Canada's so-called "Golden Girl" Tanya Dubnicoff
followed her 500m time trial win on Tuesday with a women's sprint
gold, driving the packed crowd at the Red River Exhibition Park to
a boisterous ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
In the finals of water polo, Canada beat the United States for
women's title while the American men's team made a late
consolation by defeating Cuba 11-7 to win gold.
</P>
<P>
In the volleyball semi-finals, Cuba beat their bitter rivals
the United States 25-20, 25-21, 25-23 to reach the final, where
they faces Brazil, a 25-20, 25-13, 25-12 winner over the Dominican
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Bank Floats Industrial Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's nationalized Agrani
Bank has floated a bond to raise 5 billion taka (about 101 million
U.S. dollars) as part of a government program to finance new
industrial ventures.
</P>
<P>
The step taken by the government followed a prolonged liquidity
crunch in most local banks blamed on huge amount of bad debt and
low rates of savings, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first step of the government's plan to raise the
:;44:93@@6.84
capital for industrialization, Finance Minister A.M.S. Kabria was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will expand the program after assessment of the success of
the project and hope to raise the amount to 20 billion taka (about
404 million dollars) by next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of the bond will be directly invested by the Agrani
Bank while others will use the rest of the capital for lending
money for industries on a long-term basis, he said, calling upon
all people including industrialists to avail the attractive
package for their own profit and benefit of the country.
</P>
<P>
The savings rate in Bangladesh is lower than in neighboring
India and Pakistan, which has been a major constraint of
investment causing a "vicious cycle: low income-low savings-low
investment-low income," he observed.
</P>
<P>
The national savings rate has stagnated below 12 percent of the
country's 34 billion-dollar gross domestic product (GDP), and so
the banks have no enough capital for term investment, which
warranted the need for floating the bonds, the first ever in the
country, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Sonali Bank will also float next month dollar
bonds worth 100 million dollars for expatriate Bangladeshis in the
Middle East and elsewhere, a bank official disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Argentine, Brazilian Presidents to Discuss Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and visiting Argentine President Carlos Menem
have agreed to meet Wednesday in Montevideo to discuss ways to
resolve the two countries trade conflicts and promote bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Argentina and Brazil grew tense after Buenos
Aires announced in July restrictions over imports from Brazil,
involving textile and steel products, electric appliances, paper
and shoes.
</P>
<P>
The Argentines adopted protectionist measures in order to
protect its trade balance from an onslaught of Brazilian imports
made cheaper by the mid-January devaluation of Brazil's currency,
the real.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Brazil reacted by temporarily suspending trade talks
with Argentina
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Argentine government and the opposition agreed
to support the accord reached by presidents Menem and Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the disputes between the two member countries
have thrown the fledgling Mercosur customs union into one of its
worst crises since it went into effect in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, or the Southern Common Market, comprises Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivia and Chile are associate
members.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Hails Trade Agreement With Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Argentine politicians hailed
the agreement reached Friday with Brazil to restore the bilateral
trade relations, terming it as a good news for the regional
Mercosure trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached early Friday morning in Brazil by
Argentine President Carlos Menem and his Brazilian counterpart
Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Carlos Corach said the agreement saved the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur), which is comprised of Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Bolivia and Chile as
associate members.
</P>
<P>
Describing the accord as a good one, General-secretary of the
Presidential Palace Alberto Kohan said now Mercosur can forge
ahead again.
</P>
<P>
Fernando de la Rua, a leader of the country's opposition
alliance, also expressed his satisfaction with the agreement,
which aims at clearing the trade conflicts between Argentina and
Brazil within Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua said that the economic bloc "must be for the good of
everybody and not to destroy any one."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Argentina and Brazil grew tense after Buenos
Aires announced in July restrictions over the flooding imports
from Brazil, involving textile and steel products, electric
appliances, paper and shoes. Brazil, in response, broke off all
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
During their Friday meeting, the two presidents also decided to
discuss ways in Montevideo, Uruguay, next Wednesday to settle the
remaining trade problems and promote the bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> Giant Extrasolar Planet Discovered by European Astronomers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A giant extrasolar planet near a
star located 56 light years away from the Earth has been
discovered by astronomers from the Europe South observatory
situated north of Chile's capital of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
The mass of the planet is 2.26 times greater than Jupiter, the
largest planet in the Earth's solar system, and its distance from
the star is almost the same as that of Earth from the Sun, local
media quoted the astronomers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The planet, christened "Iota Horb", moves in a 329-day orbit
around the "Hiota Horologuii" star in the Horologium constellation.
The star also has a mass 1.03 times greater than the earth's sun,
said Marton Kurster, an astronomer from the Europe South
observatory and one of the discoverers of the planet.
</P>
<P>
Kurster said the distance between Iota Horb and its star is
almost equal to the distance between the earth and the sun.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not yet known whether the planet has a satellite
or some form of life.
</P>
<P>
Extrasolar planets are not visible from the earth, but they can
be detected by observing the influence they have on their own suns.
</P>
<P>
Iota Horb increases to 21 the number of extrasolar planets
discovered near other star systems since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Receives Authorization to Sell Meningitis Vaccine to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has authorized
the sale of a Cuban vaccine against meningitis type B to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba has never prevented the United states (from purchasing
the vaccine)," local media quoted Cuban Public Health Minister
Carlos Dotres as saying. It would be an injustice for children,
the main victims of the disease, to do so, he added.
</P>
<P>
The media reports said that Smithkline Beecham PLC, a British
pharmaceutical company, announced that after one year and a half
of talks, Washington finally agreed to authorize the Cuban vaccine
for sale in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Smithkline has laboratories in Belgium, which are owned by a
United States branch, which are subject to prohibition decrees
against Cuba by the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the British firm will form a joint
enterprise with the Carlos J. Finlay Institute of Havana after the
license is granted by the U.S. Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. expert said in July last year that adequate development
and marketing of the Cuban vaccine would prevent 1,000 to 2,000
cases of meningitis B from developing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Dotres said that Cuban scientists developed the VAMENGOC-BC,
the only effective vaccine in the world against the disease in
1985, and it is considered by many investigators as the most
advanced product against meningitis type-B.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has sold millions of doses of that vaccine since that time
to several countries including Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian President Dismisses U.S. Congressmen's Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares rejected here Friday allegations by some U.S.
Congressmen that the Panama Canal is controlled by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The president said the allegations, quoted Friday by the local
press, lack objectivity and foundation.
</P>
<P>
Dana Rohrbacher, one of the congressmen, said the canal,
instead of reverting to Panama, is now in Chinese hands, referring
to investments by Hutchinson, a Hong Kong company, in Panamanian
ports, and the increase of business by the Chinese shipping
company COSCO in Panama.
</P>
<P>
"We are simply accustomed to those kinds of opinions, absurd in
many cases," the president told the press after an official
ceremony marking the withdrawal of the U.S. Army from this country,
held at the Fort Clayton military base.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares said Rohrbacher's opinion does not represent
the United States government's position at all.
</P>
<P>
These absurd remarks reflect a lack of intelligence, said Perez
Balladares.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president defended the promotion of private
investments his government is successfully carrying out in areas
being returned to Panama by the United States since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The areas have attracted numerous investments from China, Spain,
the United States, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, and from Panamanian
investors to develop ports, tourism centers and industries.
</P>
<P>
The canal will completely revert to Panama from the United
States by the end of 1999, according to an agreement signed by the
two countries in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Upsets Canada to Win Men's 4X100 Relay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazil shocked the
heavily-favored hosts Canada for an upset men's 4x100 relay
victory on an exciting evening of the Pan American athletics
finals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian quartet shattered the 24-year-old Games record to
win the gold in 38.18, shaving 0.13 seconds off the previous best
mark set by the United States in the 1975 Mexico City Games.
</P>
<P>
Olympic and world champions Canada, with former men's 100m
world record holder Donovan Bailey running the first leg, came in
a disappointing second before a packed home crowd at the
University of Manitoba Stadium. Their time was 0.31 seconds short
of Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica won the bronze at 38.82. The world record for the blue
riband event of athletics stood intact as 37.40, which was set by
the powerful U.S. squad seven years ago in the Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Defending Olympic champion Bailey, who was vilified in the
local media after turning down the invitation to run the men's
100m and not showing up in the opening ceremonies, failed to
redeem himself on what would have been a perfect opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica established a new Games record to chalk up the gold in
the women's 4x100m relay, winning in 42.62 against the old best
time of 42.90.
</P>
<P>
The United States was beaten into second place with a time of
43.27, Cuba following up in 43.52.
</P>
<P>
In the men's high jump, world record holder Javier Sotomayor of
Cuba won an expected gold, but his 2.30m winning mark was no match
for the world record of 2.45m he set six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor's woman teammate A.Y. Lopez Pedroso posted a new
Games record of 12.76 seconds to win the women's 100m hurdles
while men's 110 hurdles race also saw a record-breaking
performance, with another Cuban Anier Garcia Ortiz winning in 13.
17.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1,500m race, home favorite Graham Hood contributed
only the second athletics gold to the host Canada. T he unfancied
athlete made a move in the last 200 meters, crossing the line with
a personal best of three minutes 41.20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 4x400m relay, the Jamaican foursome squeezed the
Pan American record down to 2:57.97 to take the gold, Brazil
following second with its season's best mark of 2:58.56 and the
world record holders the United States third with a dismal 3:00.94.
</P>
<P>
Cuba registered the squad's best time of 3:26.70 to win the
women's 4x400m relay.
</P>
<P>
Women's discus gold went to Brazil's E.M. Adriano, whose mighty
toss turned out to be her personal best of 60.92 meters.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Treasures Friendship with ROK: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam continues to treasure its
friendship and cooperation with the Republic of Korea (ROK), said
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh
Cam during his talks Friday with visiting ROK Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Hong Soon Young.
</P>
<P>
Hong Soon Young is on an official visit to Vietnam from July 28
to July 31 at the invitation of his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen
Manh Cam.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Hong Soon Young, Cam asked the ROK to
cooperate with Vietnam to speed up the implementation of

high-level bilateral agreements reached last December regarding
the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) loans,
non-refundable aid, increase of investment and labor cooperation,
education, training and exchange of youths' visits.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to soon sign the supplemented EDCF
preferential loans for Vietnam's Thien Tan Water Supply Plant (7.3
million U.S. dollars) and Ba Ria Power Plant (7.1 million dollars)
and disburse an EDCF loan for a vaccine-producing project.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on early signing an agreement for a
second-phase non-refundable aid of 400,000 dollars to help Vietnam
build a stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The ROK, Hong Soon Young said, will pay attention to Vietnam's
request for developing a new urban area in Hanoi, facilitating
Vietnamese exports to the ROK and recruiting more Vietnamese
workers as the ROK's economy is recovering.
</P>
<P>
Cam and Hong Soon Young also informed each other of their
respective countries' situation and exchanged views on
international and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong and Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai received Hong Soon Young in Hanoi on Friday on separate
occasions.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Reaffirms Commitment for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana
said Friday that his government will continue to maintain its
commitment for peace despite the standstill in talks with the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Spanish daily "El Pais," Pastrana said
that he and Manuel Marulanda, the top leader of the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), "are willing to sit
down and to negotiate."
</P>
<P>
"There is a personal commitment between Marulanda and I" for
peace, said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Colombian government and FARC, the
largest rebel group in the country, started at the beginning of
the year, but they were suspended after the cancellation of the
dialogue scheduled for July 19 during a strong guerrilla offensive.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is confident that the guerrillas would
declare in December a cease-fire as a peace gesture.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana reiterated rejection to foreign intervention in
Colombia in response to reports of a possible incursion of U.S.
forces against the guerrillas and drug traffickers in Colombia. He
also rejected the view that the guerrillas and the drug
traffickers are the same people.

<HEADLINE> 23 Rebel Suspects Arrested by Sri Lankan police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 Tamil rebel suspects
have been taken into custody by Sri Lankan police for questioning
here since the suicide bomb attack on Neelan Thiruchelvam on
Thursday, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were rounded up in different parts of Colombo as
the police and armed forces tightened security with road blocks,
police patrols and searches, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam, vice-president of the Tamil United Liberation
Front and a parliamentarian, was killed instantly Thursday morning
in a suicide bombing attack at a stone's throw from his home in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The bomber jumped off the back of a motorcyclist and onto his
car as it approached a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the move followed reports that several members
of a group of rebel suicide members sent to Colombo by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to attack people in their
hit list were still at large.
</P>
<P>
They said those in the rebel hit list include several
government ministers, Tamil politicians and defense officers.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a civil war against the government
for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country
since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Scientists Succeed in Vitiligo Test in Monkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A team of Cuban researchers
succeeded, for the first time in history, to cause the symptoms of
vitiligo to appear in a primate to which they had administered the
plasma of patients afflicted with that ailment, announced a Cuban
scientist.
</P>
<P>
Vitiligo patients' blood plasma contains a substance that
interferes with the normal process of pigmentation in the fur of
an African green monkey, Professor Carlos Miyares Cao, was quoted
by the official newspaper Gramma as saying.
</P>
<P>
Miyares Cao, who discovered a substance extracted from human
placentas and used it for the treatment of vitiligo, directed the
experiment at the Placentary Histotherapy Center in Havana.
</P>
<P>
The loss of pigment in the primate's fur started 17 days after
it received the first doses of plasma; the first symptoms showed
in its face and abdomen and -- almost simultaneously -- in the
limbs.
</P>
<P>
Vitiligo is an ailment that causes the loss of pigment in the
skin of the patients, mainly in the face and the hands.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this decade, the Placentary Histotherapy
Center researchers, for the first time, made their tests in black
mice, with which they obtained a biological model to cause
vitiligo in animals.
</P>
<P>
The scientists separated the plasma into fractions of high and
low molecular weight, and they confirmed that the former is the
one that causes the loss of pigment.
</P>
<P>
According to clinical studies, 70 percent of the patients said
they suffered an emotional shock as the detonator of the ailment.
</P>
<P>
Theories about the start of vitiligo say that the malady has
neurogenic (of nervous origin), autocytotoxic (because of toxic
activity provoked by the melanocite itself), and auto-immune
causes, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
About 120 million to 180 million people in the world, almost
three percent of the total population, suffer this ailment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Headquarters Moves from Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Southern Command bases
along the banks of the Panama Canal were removed from the Central
American country on Friday after 88 years of the U.S. military
presence.
</P>
<P>
"With the departure of the South Army, our mutually-benefited
relationship with the Panama Republic concludes," General
Commander of the U.S. Southern Command Charles Wilhelm said in a
closing ceremony at the parade ground on Soldier's Field in Fort
Clayton.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm's Southern Command, the administrative head for all U.S.
armed services for the Latin America-Caribbean region, moved out
of Panama in 1997. Friday's ceremony ended the presence of U.S.
Army South in Panama. Those headquarters will move to Fort
Buchanan in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 1,000 U.S. military personnel remain in Panama, most
of them in the base at Corozal, an installation just south of
Clayton, near the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal. Even these
soldiers are steadily departing week by week.
</P>
<P>
Until the mid 1990s, more than 10,000 U.S. army men were based
in Panama and every year some 7,000 to 8,000 passed through the
jungle combat training missions. At the height of the U.S.
presence, during World War II, about 65,000 U.S. troops were based
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. soldiers came to the country in 1903 and the
first U.S. soldiers permanently assigned came in 1911 to guard
construction efforts of the Panama Canal, which started in 1914.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1977 treaty signed by President Jimmy Carter and
Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos, the United States has been
gradually turning over its 183,000 hectares of holdings in the
Canal Zone and military bases to Panama.
</P>
<P>
Major bases, such as the army's Fort Sherman and the air force'
s Albrook installations, have already been handed over, along with
most of the Panama Canal headquarters, installations and
residences.
</P>
<P>
There are only a few hundred U.S. soldiers remaining in the
country until the Panama Canal is handed over at the end of this
year.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ben Olsen and Joe-Max Moore
scored goals to lead the United States past Germany into the
semifinals of the Confederations Cup soccer tournament Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Olsen opened the scoring for the United States in the 23rd
minute when he took a pass from Morosely Balboa and shot it to the
left of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. In the 49th minute, Moore made it
2-0 by driving a free kick into the top right corner of the goal.
</P>
<P>
The Americans mounted a strong defense in the penalty box, and
Balboa repeatedly cleared the ball during German offensives.
</P>
<P>
The United States showed surprising strength against Germany,
traditionally one of the world's best teams.
</P>
<P>
The Americans defeated the Germans 3-0 in February in Florida,
and many had said another loss to the Americans would be
humiliating.
</P>
<P>
In the last group match, Brazil leads New Zealand 1-0 by
scoring the goal in the injury time of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Brazil would almost undoubtedly finish first in group B, which
would allow it face Saudi Arabia in a semifinal game on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will play Sunday's semifinal against Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sees Malaysia, Hong Kong as Rivals in Asiad Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's lobbying team for the
2006 Asian Games hosts sees Malaysia and Hong Kong, China as tough
rivals in the bidding in October 2000, the Jakarta Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The team's vice chairman Enny Hardjanto said that Malaysia had
recently hosted the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur while
Hong Kong, China was better known as a commercial city.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be serious in preparing ourselves to bid to be the
Asiad host. We must make the bidding package professionally and it
must contain a full explanation of Indonesia's preparations, from
the facilities to other sectors," she said.
</P>
<P>
Except Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia, Qatar, Syria,
Uzbekstan, India are also bidding to host the 2006 Asiad.
</P>
<P>
The National Sports Council (KONI) vice chairman and the
Olympics Council of Asia (OCA) member Mohammad Bob Hasan said
Indonesia would have to face a tough battle to win the bid.
</P>
<P>
"In the 1998 Asiad, Thailand only had Kaohsiung in Chinese
Taipei as a rival. But now we are facing six contenders," he said.
</P>
<P>
KONI plans to campaign for the bidding during the 20th
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam from August 7 to
15. It had planned to campaign at a cocktail party but the
decision was changed to a breakfast meeting on August 6.
</P>
<P>
"About 100 representatives of the Olympics Council of Asia
members, the 10 participating countries' contingents and sports
federations are expected to attend the breakfast," said spokesman
Ahmed Solichin.
</P>
<P>
During the breakfast, Enny will deliver a 10-minute speech on
Indonesia's preparations for the Games and display a videotape
showing of the country's scenery and sports facilities and plans
for staging the event.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a 2.5 billion rupiah (365,000 U.S. dollars)
budget for the bidding proposal to the OCA in October next year.
</P>
<P>
"If we are appointed as the host, we must provide abound 2
billion dollars to stage the event. The money, mostly, will come
from TV rights and official sponsors," Enny added.

<P>
ASUNCION, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay fired national soccer
coach Ever Hugo Almeida as players complained his style was too
rigid and dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
Soccer officials said late Thursday that Almeida's contract had
been terminated because he was "disagreeable and not because of
incompetence."
</P>
<P>
"After talking to national team players after the Copa America,
the association has decided to rescind the contract with Ever Hugo
Almeida," association official Guillermo Battilana said.
</P>
<P>
However, Almeida said he was suprised by the announcement and
denied he had been brusk with players.
</P>
<P>
"The association directors lie when they say there were
relationship problems because I didn't mistreat anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy by the fact that they released me because I was
disagreeable as opposed to being ineffective. Since I took over in
January, we have played 14 games. We won eight, tied four, and
lost two."

WINNIPEG, Canada, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States wheeled
away three more cycling golds while Canada's so-called "Golden
Girl" Tanya Dubnicoff came on target again here in the 13th Pan Am
Games.
</P>
<P>
Winnipegger Dubnicoff, the soon-turned national darling and Pan
Am Games flag bearer, followed her 500m time trial win on Tuesday
with a women's sprint gold, driving the packed crowd at the Red
River Exhibition Park to a boisterous ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old veteran cyclist, who is leading the cycling
World Cup overall standings, is the most successful female in the
history of Canadian track cycling.
</P>
<P>
As eight-time Canadian champion, Dubnicoff has won two Pan Am
gold medals (1991, 1995), two Commonwealth Games gold (1994, 1998).
She won the 1993 World Championship in sprint cycling after just 5
months in the sport.

<P>
CARACAS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A Venezuelan commercial light
airplane went missing Friday morning and authorities suspected it
was hijacked by Colombian guerrillas, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, taking off Friday morning from the Simon Bolivar
Airport in Maiquetia, lost contact with the control tower at 09:45
local time (1345 GMT) while it was about 32 kilometers from the
Guasdalito Airport, its intended destination, which is located 650
kilometers southwest of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the disappearance is under investigation. Local
authorities suspect a hijack because the aircraft disappeared in
the paramilitary border areas where Colombian guerrillas are
active.
</P>
<P>
The number of people aboard is not clear. A civilian transit
director said there were 16 persons aboard, including two pilots,
while a local television network said 21 persons were missing.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan Air Force and National Guard helicopters are
combing the area for the missing plane.

<HEADLINE> Anelka "Will not Play for Arsenal Again" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- English football club Arsenal
manager Arsene Wenger said he is convinced that want-away striker
Nicolas Anelka has played his last game for the club.
</P>
<P>
Anelka has been ordered to return to Highbury after his 23
million pounds transfer to Lazio fell through over the Frenchman's
failure to reach personal terms with the Italian club.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger was in defiant mood on Friday and insisted the 20-
year-old frontman was no longer welcome in his team.
</P>
<P>
"What is 99% sure now is that he will not play for us any more,
" Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
"What is important at the moment is the club and my team - not
Nicolas Anelka any more, because he cannot fight for us."
</P>
<P>
"It is more important for me to make 250,000 people happy than
one - that's my target."
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a strong team, we have a strong squad and we
are determined to do well in Europe and in England."
</P>
<P>
"We lost a very good player, but that happens to every club,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal boss believes the farce over Anelka's non-movement
indicates that there is an urgent need to reform the international
transfer system.
</P>
<P>
Anelka's two brothers, who act as the player's advisers, have
been criticized for their roles in the deal and their massive wage
demands.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only the behavior of Anelka that's a little bit
surprising," Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the whole transfer system has to be rescheduled
and changed. FIFA has a lot of work to do."
</P>
<P>
"I was closely involved in that deal, and there are some
surprising things going on at the moment in the transfer market."
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps FIFA has lost control and the rules are not respected
any more," he added.

WINNIPEG, Canada, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States struck
two more golds and Guatemala broke duck in the medal count when
the Pan Am shooting competitions wrapped up here today.
</P>
<P>
World champion Glenn Dubis and his woman teammate Jayme Dickman

ahead of second-placed American Armando Ayala.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Fury at New Sports Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- English football club Manchester
United are adamant they will not play in next season's FA Cup
despite the new Sports Minister Kate Hoey expressed hopes they
would reverse their decision to pull out.
</P>
<P>
And United chief executive Martin Edwards dismissed as "
disgraceful" accusations that the club have treated their
supporters "shabbily".
</P>
<P>
The Treble-winners withdrew from the FA Cup to take part in the
FIFA-organised World Club Championship in Brazil in January.
</P>
<P>
Ms Hoey, who took over from Tony Banks on Thursday, insisted
that it was "imperative" that United defend the trophy.
</P>
<P>
But a defiant Edwards responded: "We won't be having a re-think.
We made the decision weeks ago and that decision stands.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just our decision, it was a joint decision with both
the Government and the Football Association.
</P>
<P>
"For a new Sports Minister to suddenly enter the arena at this
late stage and tell us we are treating our supporters shabbily and
should go back in the FA Cup is a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
"I suggest she does her homework and I suggest the Government
gets its act together, because we did this in support of the last
Sports Minister."
</P>
<P>
Mr Banks had strongly defended United's decision to pull out of
the competition, but Ms Hoey immediately nailed her colours to a
different mast
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Hoey said: "I think it is
something that should not be happening. Manchester United should
be playing in the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I still hope that something will happen that will make them
able to play in it after all.
</P>
<P>
"I am just amazed that they have actually treated their
supporters in what I would say was quite a shabby way."
</P>
<P>
But she added: "The people I really criticise are the FA. The
FA can still put matters right by saying to Manchester United they
must play in the FA Cup."
</P>
<P>
The FA threw down the gauntlet to Ms Hoey to offer a solution
to United's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We remain open-minded as to the solution," FA spokesman Steve
Double said.
</P>
<P>
"However what is important, above all, is that somebody must
present a viable solution.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance has always been that we are open-minded on it.
United have stated publicly that do not want to enter a weakened
team in the Cup," the spokesman added.

STOCKHOLM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Kenyans failed to realize
their goals of breaking the world records at the Grand Prix here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japheth Kumuati clocked 2:15.45, namely 3.27 seconds shy of the
oldest record of two minutes 12.18 seconds in the 1,000 meters set
by British Sebastian Coe in Oslo on July 11,1981.
</P>
<P>
Noah Ngeny ran to his victory in 4:47.88, but failed to break
the 1,500m record by a margin of 2.20 seconds set by Algerian
Noureddine Morceli in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Paul Tergat was also off the pace as he attempted to eclipse
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie's 10,000 meters mark of 26:22.75.
However, he still won in 27:10.08.
</P>
<P>
But Sweden's Olympic and world champion Ludmila Engquist, who
has been battling breast cancer for more than a year, delighted a
cheering home crowd by winning the 100 meters hurdles in 12.68
seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I felt that the whole of Sweden was with me today and with
that sort of support I knew I couldn't fail," said the 35-year-old
Russian-born athlete.
</P>
<P>
American sprint queen Marion Jones romped home to her 19th
successive victory, but was dismissive of her 22.07 win in the 200
metres.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Michael Johnson's world championship hopes
were in doubt after he pulled up clutching his thigh less than
midway through the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Maurice Greene easily won the 100 meters in
9.87 seconds from Obadele Thompson of Barbados.
</P>

Other highlights included a strong showing from South African
Hestrie Storbeck-Cloete, who won the women's high jump with a 1.97

8), in the quarterfinals of the Croatia Open ATP tournament on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Norman, eighth seed of the tournament, won five games in a row
to take a 6-2, 1-0 lead. Moya performed better in the second set,
but not enough to beat Norman. After the match, Moya commented
that Norman was currently very confident, but he was not.
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal, Ivan Ljubicic, an 20-year-old home
player, surprisingly defeated third-seeded Dominik Hrbaty of
Slovakia 6-0, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4. He will face Norman in Saturday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Ljubicic, for unknown reasons, didn't shake hands with Hrbaty
at the end of the match, prompting the Slovak to angrily tell
reporters that "tennis is the gentlemen's game. He obviously isn't
a gentleman."
</P>
<P>
In the other two quarterfinals, Jeff Tarango and Albert Portas
beat their opponents respectively and will meet in the semifinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Qingdao Beer Group, the largest
beer producer in China, today merged the Huangshi City Beer
Factory in Hubei Province, expanding its business into central
China.
</P>
<P>
The newly established company is called the Qingdao (Huangshi)
Beer Company. The Huangshi City Beer Factory had been developing
slowly due to a lack of capital.
</P>
<P>
Li Guirong, chairman of the board of directors of the Dingdao
Beer Group, said they intend to increase the factory's annual
output to 80,000 tons within the next few years from the present
45,000 tons by introducing new technology and processing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Li said the group, set up as early as 1903 in east China's
Shandong Province, has its products on the market in over 40
countries and regions, and is the best-known Chinese brand in the
world. The company annually exports about 400,000 standard cartons
of beer, and has now set up 17 beer breweries throughout China,
with domestic market-share and exports both number one in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Greek-Turkish Talks to Continue in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Turkey agreed here
Friday to hold the next round of their talks at senior officials'
level in September.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here, senior foreign ministry
officials of the two countries said that they would hold the next
round of talks in September over the same issues after a prior
review of the ideas and proposals put forward by each side
separately.
</P>
<P>
On July 26 and 27, senior diplomats of the two neighboring
countries held the first round of their talks in Ankara, Turkey,
on the issues of tourism, the environment, trade and economic
cooperation while the second round of such talks took place in
Athens on July 29 and 30 on combating organized crime, illegal
immigration, drug-trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said in the joint communique that their talks in
Ankara and Athens were held in "a positive, professional and
relaxed atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
They agreed on the target of close cooperation in the fields
under discussion. To that end they exchanged views and reviewed
the possibilities of promoting that cooperation in a specific
manner.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the first at this level since 1994, were agreed to
in late June between the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers,
George Papandreou and Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
Although Greece has agreed to begin talks with Turkey, it has
refused to discuss with Ankara the issues concerning Athens'
sovereignty over the eastern Aegean Sea.

<HEADLINE> UNDCP Uses Satellite Remote Sensing to Detect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
International Drug Council Program (UNDCP) Friday announced that
it has designated a plan to use remote sensing (RS) and other
space-related technologies to monitor the illicit cultivation of
narcotic crops, particularly the opium poppy and the coco bush
which feed the international drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Initial findings of a joint project, conducted by UNDCP and the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in 1993 and 1994,
established that it was possible to monitor the growth of illicit
crops with the aid of RS technologies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, satellite-based platforms have been developed
and launched which, combined with new innovative image processing
technologies, provide the opportunity to produce accurate high
resolution images enabling the identification of illicit crops at
an economically viable cost.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the
World Drug Problem in June 1998, Member States decided to work
closely with UNDCP to create strategies to eliminate or
significantly reduce illicit cultivation of the opium poppy,
cannabis and coco bush by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The Member States requested the UNDCP to intensify the
collection and analysis of previously incomplete data the extent
of these crops, to aid their elimination strategy and measure its
progress.
</P>
<P>
Taking up the challenge, UNDCP developed a program to establish
an International Network for the Monitoring of Narcotic Crops by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to enable countries affected by illicit
cultivation to assess growth levels of narcotic crops and
determine trends at a national level.
</P>
<P>
During the now completed first phase of this program, UNDCP
reached an agreement with the European Space Agency to place
satellite imagery technology at the disposal of governments for the
purpose of monitoring illicit crops.
</P>
<P>
Some economies of scale were achieved, thus minimizing the cost
of developing RS technology for user countries, UNDCP said. The
provision of technical assistance tailored to the individual needs
of governments is envisaged in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The International Network for the Monitoring of Narcotic
Crops will also validate the methods of monitoring the
cultivation of coca and opium plants with satellite-procured
imagery. It will formulate guidelines for their use in addition
to identifying ways of controlling the quality of the data
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Following this study, governments should be better able to
assess the feasibility, modalities, needs and not lease of all,
the financial requirements for using satellite remote sensing
technology.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ready to Involve in Balkan Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Friday that his country is "making a commitment to take
generous, immediate, and unilateral steps to improve market access
for products made in southeast Europe".
</P>
<P>
"I will work with the United States Congress to establish a
trade preference program similar to our Andean initiative, which
will offer duty-free treatment for most of the region's exports,"
he told world leaders here attending the so-called Stability Pact
Summit through a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said nations in the region should be brought into the
World Trade Organization on commercially acceptable terms, and be
provided the technical assistance they need to meet those terms.
</P>
<P>
He also called for promoting private investment in the region's
economies, and supporting the development of the region's private
sector. "To that end, America's Overseas Private Investment
Corporation will establish a 150-million-US-dollar investment fund
for the region and a 200-million-US-dollar credit line," he said.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), the United States will set up a trust fund
designed to help businesses in the southeast Europe become more
competitive and viable, said Clinton. But he said his
administration would first consult with the Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We would be willing to contribute 15 million dollars in the
first year, and to consider up to 50 million dollars overall, as
long as the EBRD targets an additional 80 million dollars for the
region," he detailed the American plan.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we will support the creation of a regional equity
fund of up to 300 million dollars, with financing from the
international financial institutions, to make equity investments
in private enterprises in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also indicated the incoming action by his
administration. "Our Commerce Secretary William Daley will also
sponsor a mission to the region to showcase trade and investment
opportunities and build new business partnerships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the United States is ready to deeply
involve in the economic reconstruction process in Balkan region
through various action plans which were modeled as western powers'
anti-Communism Mashall Plan for rebuilding Europe after the second
World War.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from major western countries and Balkan nations and
heads of main international organizations ended the Stability Pact
Summit this afternoon after issuing a Declaration calling for
integration of Balkans into a single European model. The Stability
Pact, which was initiated and already adopted by the European
Union, has been widely regarded as a new Mashall Plan to promote
western ideology, value and way of life.

<HEADLINE> Depleted Uranium "Threatens Balkan Cancer Epidemic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Americans' use of depleted
uranium (DU) weapons in Serbia is likely to cause extra deaths
from cancer, a British scientist warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The use of depleted Uranium shells in Kosovo, fired mostly from
U.S. planes, was endangering the health of returning refugees,
peacekeepers, aid workers and the people of neighboring countries,
said Dr Roger Coghill, a British experimental biologist.
</P>
<P>
Coghill, who runs his own research laboratory in south Wales,
was speaking at a London conference discussing the links between
depleted uranium and cancers in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We know that some one million DU bullets were fired (during
the Gulf War) and many still lie in the Gulf desert, causing
clearly serious cancers and birth defects." he said, adding that
"The connection between the two is biologically extremely
plausible."
</P>
<P>
Coghill said there had been evidence in other parts of the
Balkans of elevated radiation levels during and soon after the
bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Using calculations based on the Pentagon's statement, Coghill
estimated that half of the 500,000 depleted uranium rounds fired
over Kosovo detonated, which he said would have resulted in the
release of about one thirty-thousandth of the amount of radiation
released at Chernobyl in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Coghill said the maximum effect will be reached about six
months after the war, suggesting that the first cancers
</P>
<P>
may start to show up about a year after that.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the Balkan region, I calculate that there will be
an extra 10,150 deaths from cancer because of the use of depleted
uranium." he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) outlined strategic priorities for poverty
eradication in a president statement here Friday at the end of its
1999 session.
</P>
<P>
With poverty eradication as the major focus of the ECOSOC
session from July 5 to 30, the statement said, the participants
from the ECOSOC's 54 members acknowledge that the major challenge
facing the world in the new millennium is the eradication of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on governments, international
organizations, civil society and the business world to join hands
with the United Nations in an all out campaign to fight the
scourge of poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In order to succeed, we must empower the people living in
poverty and ensure that they participate fully in this fight," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOSOC said that about 40 billion U.S. dollars a year are
needed to achieve the international goals related to poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the UN agency vowed to reduce the proportion
of people living in extreme poverty (with an income of less than a
dollar a day) by half by 2015. It is estimated that 1.3 billion
people still live in abject poverty worldwide.

MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it wants
Yugoslavia to join the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Russia "intends to actively participate in the implementation
of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, as it is one of its
co-authors," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important conditions for the success of the
Pact is equal relations between all the countries in the region
without exception.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the Russian Federation wishes Yugoslavia
to join the Pact as soon as possible," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed early June in Cologne, Germany, was designed
to help Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Bosnia, Croatia and
Slovenia. Leaders and representatives from 45 countries were
meeting in Sarajevo, Bosnia, to formulate plans on the
reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin also urged the international community to extend aid
to Yugoslavia, which suffered great damage under NATO's 78-day air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The assistance should not be selective and discriminatory, or
Yugoslavia may face a very serious humanitarian catastrophe in the
Autumn and Winter, Rakhmanin said.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The 11-nation euro zone has
registered a trade surplus with the rest of the world in May this
year, Eurostat reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau of the European community said that the
euro zone chalked up a trade surplus of 2.7 billion euro (2.8
billion U.S. dollars) compared with 5.4 billion euro (5.67 billion
U.S. dollars) in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The same month a year ago saw a trade surplus of 8.7 billion
euro (9.1 billion dollars) for the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The European statistical bureau also reported that the
15-nation European Union had registered a trade deficit of 1.4
billion euro (1.47 billion dollars) with the rest of the world in
May this year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the European Union posted a 3.3-billion-euro
trade surplus with the rest of the world in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU trade growth with most of its major trade partners was
weak or falling in the first four months of the year. EU exports
to China and Hungary were the exceptions. Exports to China and
Hungary both grew by 16 percent during this period.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop in exports was registered in Russia where EU
exports decreased by 55 percent. The next sharpest drop was in
Norway at 10 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations military
observers have carried out the temporary registration of 200
ex-combatants in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, a U.N.
spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference that the temporary registration was done by the United
Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) Military
Observers.
</P>
<P>
"Arrangements are underway for the transfer of Lungi, on the
other side of the estuary, where the complete registration and
disarmament, demobilization, reintegration program will be
conducted," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The three reception sites which had been set up temporarily in
Freetown to cater for the influx of ex-combatants are going to be
closed once they are moved to Lungi, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United Nations was appealing for 35
million U.S. dollars to finance the disarmament of former rebel
soldiers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Silva said last week that the United Nations was appealing to

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- After a yearlong investigation,
former White House aide Linda Tripp was indicted Friday for
secretly taping her phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern who admitted having an affair with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A Howard County grand jury in Maryland indicted Tripp on one
count of illegal interception of a phone conversation on December
22, 1997, after she allegedly had been told by her lawyer that the
ongoing taping was illegal, Maryland State Prosecutor Stephen
Montanarelli said.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, whose tapes led to impeachment of President Clinton,
becomes the only central figure in the Lewinsky scandal to face
criminal charge.
</P>
<P>
She also was charged with allegedly disclosing the contents of
that conversation to Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
Maryland law forbids the recording of phone conversations
without the consent of the other party. Illegal wiretapping is
punishable by up to five years in prison and a 10,000 dollars fine
for each offense.
</P>
<P>
Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Ken Starr under a
grant of immunity from federal prosecution, but that does not
protect her from prosecution by her home state.
</P>
<P>
Starr's investigation of Clinton's sexual relationship with
Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment by the House and
trial in the Senate. Clinton was acquitted in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, who made more than 20 hours of tapes from her home in
Maryland, testified for Starr's grand jury that she taped several
conversations in late 1997 even after an attorney told her it was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, 49, said she began taping her friend's phone calls
to protect herself because she was being pressured by Lewinsky
to lie in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, who became friends with Tripp when they both worked
at the Pentagon, wanted Tripp to deny knowledge of the sexual
relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Tripp's attorney, Joseph Murtha, asked that Tripp be allowed to
surrender voluntarily, rather than being arrested.

<HEADLINE> Russian Scientist Warns Against Space Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- There will be no way to the outer
space in 150 years if the space pollution continues unchecked, a
Russian scientist warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the army and ecology, Doctor of Technical
Sciences Vladimir Lebedev said the outer space might close in 50
years if the pollution rates increase, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian military researchers, who have been studying the
problem of space litter for the past decade, believe that
"self-propelled spreading of space litter is possible in the
future."
</P>
<P>
A collision of two large artificial objects in space will
result in the creation of thousands of new, smaller artificial
objects.
</P>
<P>
Radar has detected about 8,000 objects with a diameter of over
10 centimeters in space, the experts said, adding that there are
70,000 objects with a diameter of one centimeter and more than 3.5
million objects with a diameter of less than 1 millimeter in
space.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebedev sees no easy way to tackle the space garbage
problem other than to "fasten tighter the bolts and nuts of
rocket-boosters."

join what he called "the European family."
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the appeal during the Sarajevo Summit on Balkan

<HEADLINE> UNDCP Uses Satellite Remote Sensing to Detect  Illicit Drug Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
International Drug Council Program (UNDCP) Friday announced that
it has designated a plan to use remote sensing (RS) and other
space-related technologies to monitor the illicit cultivation of
narcotic crops, particularly the opium poppy and the coco bush
which feed the international drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Initial findings of a joint project, conducted by UNDCP and the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in 1993 and 1994,
established that it was possible to monitor the growth of illicit
crops with the aid of RS technologies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, satellite-based platforms have been developed
and launched which, combined with new innovative image processing
technologies, provide the opportunity to produce accurate high
resolution images enabling the identification of illicit crops at
an economically viable cost.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the
World Drug Problem in June 1998, Member States decided to work
closely with UNDCP to create strategies to eliminate or
significantly reduce illicit cultivation of the opium poppy,
cannabis and coco bush by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The Member States requested the UNDCP to intensify the
collection and analysis of previously incomplete data the extent
of these crops, to aid their elimination strategy and measure its
progress.
</P>
<P>
Taking up the challenge, UNDCP developed a program to establish
an International Network for the Monitoring of Narcotic Crops by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to enable countries affected by illicit
cultivation to assess growth levels of narcotic crops and
determine trends at a national level.
</P>
<P>
During the now completed first phase of this program, UNDCP
reached an agreement with the European Space Agency to place
satellite imagery technology at the disposal of governments for the
purpose of monitoring illicit crops.
</P>
<P>
Some economies of scale were achieved, thus minimizing the cost
of developing RS technology for user countries, UNDCP said. The
provision of technical assistance tailored to the individual needs
of governments is envisaged in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The International Network for the Monitoring of Narcotic
Crops will also validate the methods of monitoring the
cultivation of coca and opium plants with satellite-procured
imagery. It will formulate guidelines for their use in addition
to identifying ways of controlling the quality of the data
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Following this study, governments should be better able to
assess the feasibility, modalities, needs and not lease of all,
the financial requirements for using satellite remote sensing
technology.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ready to Involve in Balkan Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Friday that his country is "making a commitment to take
generous, immediate, and unilateral steps to improve market access
for products made in southeast Europe".
</P>
<P>
"I will work with the United States Congress to establish a
trade preference program similar to our Andean initiative, which
will offer duty-free treatment for most of the region's exports,"
he told world leaders here attending the so-called Stability Pact
Summit through a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said nations in the region should be brought into the
World Trade Organization on commercially acceptable terms, and be
provided the technical assistance they need to meet those terms.
</P>
<P>
He also called for promoting private investment in the region's
economies, and supporting the development of the region's private
sector. "To that end, America's Overseas Private Investment
Corporation will establish a 150-million-US-dollar investment fund
for the region and a 200-million-US-dollar credit line," he said.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), the United States will set up a trust fund
designed to help businesses in the southeast Europe become more
competitive and viable, said Clinton. But he said his
administration would first consult with the Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We would be willing to contribute 15 million dollars in the
first year, and to consider up to 50 million dollars overall, as
long as the EBRD targets an additional 80 million dollars for the
region," he detailed the American plan.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we will support the creation of a regional equity
fund of up to 300 million dollars, with financing from the
international financial institutions, to make equity investments
in private enterprises in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also indicated the incoming action by his
administration. "Our Commerce Secretary William Daley will also
sponsor a mission to the region to showcase trade and investment
opportunities and build new business partnerships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the United States is ready to deeply
involve in the economic reconstruction process in Balkan region
through various action plans which were modeled as western powers'
anti-Communism Mashall Plan for rebuilding Europe after the second
World War.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from major western countries and Balkan nations and
heads of main international organizations ended the Stability Pact
Summit this afternoon after issuing a Declaration calling for
integration of Balkans into a single European model. The Stability
Pact, which was initiated and already adopted by the European
Union, has been widely regarded as a new Mashall Plan to promote
western ideology, value and way of life.

<HEADLINE> Depleted Uranium "Threatens Balkan Cancer Epidemic"  Says Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Americans' use of depleted
uranium (DU) weapons in Serbia is likely to cause extra deaths
from cancer, a British scientist warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The use of depleted Uranium shells in Kosovo, fired mostly from
U.S. planes, was endangering the health of returning refugees,
peacekeepers, aid workers and the people of neighboring countries,
said Dr Roger Coghill, a British experimental biologist.
</P>
<P>
Coghill, who runs his own research laboratory in south Wales,
was speaking at a London conference discussing the links between
depleted uranium and cancers in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We know that some one million DU bullets were fired (during
the Gulf War) and many still lie in the Gulf desert, causing
clearly serious cancers and birth defects." he said, adding that
"The connection between the two is biologically extremely
plausible."
</P>
<P>
Coghill said there had been evidence in other parts of the
Balkans of elevated radiation levels during and soon after the
bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Using calculations based on the Pentagon's statement, Coghill
estimated that half of the 500,000 depleted uranium rounds fired
over Kosovo detonated, which he said would have resulted in the
release of about one thirty-thousandth of the amount of radiation
released at Chernobyl in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Coghill said the maximum effect will be reached about six
months after the war, suggesting that the first cancers
</P>
<P>
may start to show up about a year after that.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the Balkan region, I calculate that there will be
an extra 10,150 deaths from cancer because of the use of depleted
uranium." he said.

<HEADLINE> ECOSOC Outlines Strategic Priorities for Poverty  Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) outlined strategic priorities for poverty
eradication in a president statement here Friday at the end of its
1999 session.
</P>
<P>
With poverty eradication as the major focus of the ECOSOC
session from July 5 to 30, the statement said, the participants
from the ECOSOC's 54 members acknowledge that the major challenge
facing the world in the new millennium is the eradication of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on governments, international
organizations, civil society and the business world to join hands
with the United Nations in an all out campaign to fight the
scourge of poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In order to succeed, we must empower the people living in
poverty and ensure that they participate fully in this fight," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOSOC said that about 40 billion U.S. dollars a year are
needed to achieve the international goals related to poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the UN agency vowed to reduce the proportion
of people living in extreme poverty (with an income of less than a
dollar a day) by half by 2015. It is estimated that 1.3 billion
people still live in abject poverty worldwide.

MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it wants
Yugoslavia to join the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Russia "intends to actively participate in the implementation
of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, as it is one of its
co-authors," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important conditions for the success of the
Pact is equal relations between all the countries in the region
without exception.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the Russian Federation wishes Yugoslavia
to join the Pact as soon as possible," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed early June in Cologne, Germany, was designed
to help Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Bosnia, Croatia and
Slovenia. Leaders and representatives from 45 countries were
meeting in Sarajevo, Bosnia, to formulate plans on the
reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin also urged the international community to extend aid
to Yugoslavia, which suffered great damage under NATO's 78-day air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The assistance should not be selective and discriminatory, or
Yugoslavia may face a very serious humanitarian catastrophe in the
Autumn and Winter, Rakhmanin said.

BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The 11-nation euro zone has
registered a trade surplus with the rest of the world in May this
year, Eurostat reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau of the European community said that the
euro zone chalked up a trade surplus of 2.7 billion euro (2.8
billion U.S. dollars) compared with 5.4 billion euro (5.67 billion
U.S. dollars) in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The same month a year ago saw a trade surplus of 8.7 billion
euro (9.1 billion dollars) for the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The European statistical bureau also reported that the
15-nation European Union had registered a trade deficit of 1.4
billion euro (1.47 billion dollars) with the rest of the world in
May this year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the European Union posted a 3.3-billion-euro
trade surplus with the rest of the world in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU trade growth with most of its major trade partners was
weak or falling in the first four months of the year. EU exports
to China and Hungary were the exceptions. Exports to China and
Hungary both grew by 16 percent during this period.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop in exports was registered in Russia where EU
exports decreased by 55 percent. The next sharpest drop was in
Norway at 10 percent.

NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks slumped Friday
for the second consecutive day amid continuing fears that the
Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to prevent inflation.

</P>
<P>
A bigger-than-expected rise in labor costs in the second

The Federal Reserve already nudged short-term rates up by a
quarter of a point at the end of June and in the past several

Federal Reserve would act "promptly and forcefully" to curb
inflation if the new data show that the pace of labor cost and
price increase will be picking up.
