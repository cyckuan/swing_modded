<HEADLINE> Botswana's Economic Diversification Working: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Botswana government's
efforts to diversify the economy away from reliance on diamond
revenues seem to be effective, South African Press Association
Friday quoted a think-tank report as showing.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana Institute for Policy Analysis (Bipa) reports a
rise, though slight, in the rate of investment and considerable
potential for tourism to contribute more to the economy.
</P>
<P>
National accounts data for 1997/98 shows a one-percentage-point
increase in investment when measured against the GDP, to 25
percent of the GDP from 24 percent in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
"It is to be hoped," said the Bipa report, "this indicates the
economy is moving in the right direction in terms of policies
directed toward enhancing investment."
</P>
<P>
Examining tourism, Bipa economists concluded that over the five
years to 1997, the number of holiday visitors grew by 80 percent
or nearly 14 percent a year, making tourism the likely fastest
growing industry in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"This exceeds the five-percent-a-year growth recorded for the
tourism industry internationally," they said.
</P>
<P>
"And if the trend in visitor arrivals does reflect the growth
of the tourism sector as a whole, this sector grew faster than any
other sector of the Botswana economy over the period."
</P>
<P>
As a sign of economic diversification, overall non-mining GDP
is quoted as growing eight percent annually over the two years to
June 1998, compared with five percent per annum over the two
pervious years and three percent a year before then.
</P>
<P>
Bipa noted that the demand for power might correlate to
economic activity, in the nine-month period from July 1998 to
March 1999, electricity consumption increased by 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bipa also highlights an unfortunate parallel to this
development.
</P>
<P>
Little employment growth is being recorded except for that in
the government sector. Jobs have been lost in other sectors of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
An encouraging sign is that statistics show employment growth
could have finally have taken off, with a 5.4 percent rise in
formal sector employment between March 1997 and March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The diversification policy is driven by Botswana's need to
create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
As defined by a 1995/96 official survey, 55.5 percent of the
950,793 citizens of Botswana over the age of 12, 19.2 percent were
classified as unemployed, 44.5 percent were not unemployed.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy will meet with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine in Paris on May 18 to review diplomatic efforts to advance
the Kosovo peace process and discuss bilateral relations with
France, announced the Department of Foreign Affairs in a release
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy will examine with Vedrine the initiatives taken by
Canada and france at the G-8, at the United Nations and in other
forums aimed at achieving progress toward a diplomatic settlement
of the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian foreign minister looks forward to reviewing the
results of Vedrine's and French President Jacques Chirac's
diplomatic mission to Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
"Canada and France are working closely at NATO, in the Security
Council and in the G-8 process," said Axworthy in the release.
</P>
<P>
"We share with France the values and objectives that are behind
NATO's actions, and we are both actively engaged in moving forward
the diplomatic process in support of the general principles
adopted last week by the G-8 Foreign Ministers," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
At their May 6 meeting, the G-8 Foreign Ministers agreed on key
principles for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis. Canada
is determined to see the conflict settled according to the
conditions established by the international community and through
the United Nations Security Council, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Dollar Subsides in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The demand for foreign exchange
like U.S. dollar has subsided in Uganda recently as a result of
the central bank's renewed efforts to stabilize the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in the shrinking sum of dollars bought by the
 commercial banks from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday evening, the Bank of Uganda
said that of the eight million dollars it offered to the foreign
exchange market, only 3.6 million dollars were bought by the
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"This signals that demand pressures for U.S. dollars have
subsided significantly," the press release added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it noted, the central bank will continue to monitor
developments in the foreign exchange market and will take
necessary action to maintain stability in the market.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan shilling began to depreciate against the dollar in
July of 1998 and it plunged in the first few months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between them was 1230:1 one year ago while it
 decreased to 1600:1 this week.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the falling currency to the
decrease in foreign exchange inflows caused by falling coffee
exports, recent EU fish ban and the instability triggered by the
latest spate of bomb blasts in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the falling trend of the currency, the central bank
pumped lots of dollars into the foreign exchange market. In April,
it sold 25.6 million dollars and it has sold out 18 million
dollars so far this month.

<HEADLINE> S. African Parties Sign Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) and the largest black-based opposition
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Friday signed a historic peace pact
aimed at ending years of bloody conflict between their supporters.
</P>
<P>
The pact was signed by IFP Chairman Lionel Mtshali and ANC
Deputy President Jacob Zuma in Durban, South African Press
Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
ANC and IFP leaders urged their rank and file to support the
pact, which among other things calls for political tolerance,
particularly in the run- up to the general election next month.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 people have died in political violence in
KwaZulu-Natal province over the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the agreement was the culmination of efforts to end
violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
The six-page pact made it possible for ANC President Thabo
Mbeki and his IFP counterpart, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to address a
joint rally in the province in the next few weeks, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Mtshali described the event as a milestone in the country's
history and singled out Buthelezi and Mbeki for making it
possible.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned against viewing the pact as a preliminary to
a merger or link between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that we, the IFP,
are contesting the forthcoming elections on our own, with the
objective of becoming the next government of South Africa and of
increasing our majority in KwaZulu-Natal."
</P>
<P>
The IFP was not entering elections on the basis of having
engineered any deals with any party in respect of post-electoral
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we seek is to transform the manner in which the two
parties conduct their politics of conflict between enemies into
the politics of normal democratic discourse," he said.
</P>
<P>
KwaZulu-Natal, currently ruled by the IFP, could fall into the
hands of the ANC after the election, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had repeatedly called for a merger with the IFP since
December 1997, but the IFP turned out to be less enthusiastic.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Army Takes Goiter Message To People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean National Army Friday
began a program to bring goiter awareness to the public, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The program which would be taken to different provinces in the
southern African country is mainly targeted at children in primary
schools who are most vulnerable to the condition caused by lack of
iodine in food.
</P>
<P>
Program coordinator Robson Kutya said that many people in
Zimbabwe are not aware of the condition which is characterized by
an out-growth on the throat.
</P>
<P>
Kutya said goiter is among common health conditions that could
cause mental and physical retardation among children.
</P>
<P>
"The army is carrying out this exercise to compliment
government's efforts of fighting against diseases and other health
complications which could be easily avoided," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has an average goiter prevalence of 44 percent caused
by an iodine deficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government in the early 1990s passed a legislation to
ensure that all salt imported into the country was iodized.
</P>
<P>
An iodine deficiency control program was also adopted during
the same period after a national survey revealed high levels of
the prevalence of iodine deficiency.

<HEADLINE> 40% of School-age Children Can't Afford Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- About 650,000, or 40 percent of
school-age (seven to 13 years) children in Zambia are not in
school because their parents cannot afford, according to the
country's 1999 human development report obtained here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The social and economic security of Zambian children has come
under threat as the country's economy declines, the report points
out.
</P>
<P>
It says that the number of children not going to school would
increase further by next year because of the growing number of
child-headed households.
</P>
<P>
Streetism is also on the increase with recent estimates of the
population of street children being placed at 75,000, the report
notes.
</P>
<P>
It says that household economic security is also affected by
poverty and loss of formal employment due to retrenchments.

MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said here Friday that Russia will withdraw from
negotiations on Yugoslavia if NATO starts a ground operation in
the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin again called for an immediate end to the air raids on
Yugoslavia, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations on the Kosovo crisis shall involve all
parties to the conflict and one of the key tasks in the settlement
is to ensure the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Serb
police troops from Kosovo, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stepashin believed that the Kosovo status shall be
excluded from the negotiations for the settlement period.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that the peacemaking troops shall enter the
region under the U.N. flag and, possibly, involve contingents of
NATO member-countries, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese And U.S. Presidents Hold Phone Talk (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At the request of U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Chinese President Jiang Zemin tonight held a phone
talk with him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his sincere regrets for the tragedy that
happened in Belgrade and his personal condolences to the injured
staff and family members of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised that there would be an investigation of the
incident and that he would let the Chinese people know the truth
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-U.S. relations are very important, adding
that he would make the utmost effort to deal with the tragedy to
bring bilateral relations back to normal development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Clinton that he had received his recent letter and
information about his talks with Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese
ambassador to the U.S., earlier today and said that he had noticed
the apology President Clinton had made once again. The Chinese
government has solemnly expressed its stance and made its demands
clear in its statement and relevant representations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia was a serious incident that had shocked the world and
one that caused a great number of casualties and reduced the
embassy building to debris.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is a serious infringement on Chinese sovereignty
and a gross trampling on the U.N. Charter and norms in
international relations and added that it was an unexpected
disaster for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government takes good care of the life and safety
of its citizens, he said, and China is a country with 1.2 billion
people and every Chinese life is cherished. This is the most
fundamental human right that the Chinese government must protect,
he explained.

<HEADLINE> Feature: For Palestinians, Israeli Election is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- For Mr. Ramzi, a 25-year-old
Palestinian living in East Jerusalem, whoever will win the
upcoming Israeli elections makes no difference to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"They are all enemies of the Palestinians," said Ramzi, a
security guard of the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters
of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), referring to the
five candidates for Israeli premiership in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
A permanent resident of the traditional Arab East Jerusalem,
Ramzi, who did not give his surname, has no voting right in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
But asked whom he would vote for if he had the right
of voting, Ramzi said, after a moment of hesitation, that he
prefers Ehud Barak, the One Israel candidate.
</P>
<P>
"He is more open-minded than (Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu and will make the Middle East peace process easier,"
he said. Barak and Netanyahu are the two front-runners in the
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had done nothing helpful for the Palestinians and
the peace process since he came to power in 1996, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu administration has stepped up its efforts to
demolish Palestinian houses, confiscate their land and annul their
residencies in order to tighten control of East Jerusalem,
spattered one of Ramzi's colleagues, who was standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
Israel annexed East Jerusalem soon after capturing it from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Ramzi is one of the roughly 100 security guards in the
Orient House, which has become a flash point between Israel and
the Palestinians over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu issued a closure order of three offices in the
Orient House last month, saying they have links with the
Palestinian National Authority, which is banned from operating in
Jerusalem under signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israel's High Court issued a junction earlier this week to
delay the decision on whether to close the Palestinian offices
until after the elections, averting a possible violence.
</P>
<P>
On this sunny Friday afternoon, the stately Ottman-style
Orient House basked in the sunset, quiet and peaceful. A large
Palestinian flag hanging in front of the facade flattered in
the breeze.
</P>
<P>
But a billboard posted with letters and statements in
protest of Israel's decision to close the offices, in Arabic,
English and Hebrew, reminded of the trails of the tensions
occurred there only a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of attempting to
provoke tensions in Jerusalem to boost his flagging campaign. He
is trailing Barak in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
"Barak is more moderate on the Israeli-Palestinian relations,
and he may get the stalled peace process back on track,"
Ramzi said, adding that most of the 200,000 Palestinians in
East Jerusalem share his views.

buy weapons at gun shows, reversing its position taken earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans pushed through the provision they claimed
would establish a system of background checks for all buyers of
firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
However, Democrats, who had failed to get the
Republican-controlled Senate to support for a similar measure two
days earlier, said the new Republican version was full of
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
The vote came after a clash over the role the powerful National
Rifle Association(NRA) has played in the legislation, which was
brought to the Senate floor less than a month after the Colorado
High School shootings which killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Charles Achumer accused Republicans of
faking an effort to pass tougher gun laws, at the behest of the
NRA.
</P>
<P>
"The new Senate Republican bill is still riddled with
high-caliber loopholes," President Bill Clinton said at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
"National Rifle Association hasn't had a thing to do with it,"
said sponsor of the legislation Orrin Hatchand, Republican
Senator and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Senate killed a Democratic proposal that would
have required weapon buyers to undergo a background check at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, people buying guns from licensed dealers
have to go thorough criminal background checks, but that
requirement does not apply to more informal vendors at gun
shows.

<HEADLINE> China Moves into Sudirman Cup Final (Updated with women's double) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China is on the brink of winning
their third Sudirman Cup title when they defeated arch-rivals
South Korea 3-2 in a semi-final match here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttlers won the men's singles and doubles, mixed
doubles, but lost the women's singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
China started their campaign through the mixed doubles when Ge
Fei and Liu Yong rallied from first set down to edge Kim Dong Moon
and Ra Kyung Min 10-15, 15-10 and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
With one point in hands, former world champion Sun Jun, top
player in the Chinese team, gave a performance well below his par,
winning the men's singles after one set down at 9-15, 15-6 and 15-
7 against Ahn Jae Chang.
</P>
<P>
It had been expected that China would have the match at 3-0
after the third game in which Gong Zhichao met South Korean Kim Ji
Hyun. In their seven previous meetings since 1997, Gong Zhichao
had a dominating winning record with five victories and two
defeats.
</P>
<P>
However, Gong Zhichao, silver medalist at the last Asian Games
in Bangkok, Thailand, met a strong challenge from Kim Ji Hyun, and
lost the game at 9-11, 11-1 and 3-11.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's doubles, China's Zhang Jun and Yu Jinghao
well played above standard, trouncing South Korena duo Lee Dong
Soo and Yoo Yong Sung with ease at 15-3, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the two pairs met each other at a
major tournament.
</P>
<P>
The women's doubles had been a routine play in which Zhang Ning
and Gu Jun lost to Ra Kyung Min and Chung Jae Hee 15-8, 12-15 and
11-15.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles had been a crucial game for both China and
South Korea, which finished second in the last Sudirman Cup
championships in Glasgow, Scotland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
After playing to a deadlock of 1-1 draw in the first two sets,
South Korean duo of Kim Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min had a flying
start in the third and final one, leading their Chinese rivals 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of several errors by Kim and Ra, Liu Yong and
Ge Fei trailed the score to 8-13 and 11-13.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the point of live-or-die, Kim and Ra made successive
mistakes when serving and the Chinese shuttlers jumped to lead the
score 14-13 and took the game through smash by Ge Fei, women's
doubles Olympic champion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Liu Xinmin attributed the pair's win to strong
mentallity. "The Chinese pair are at the same level with the
Koreans, Only those who have strong metallity in the match could
win," he said.

<HEADLINE> State Councilor Makes Handicapped Helping Day Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Ismail Amat spoke
via TV today to express his concern for handicapped people all
over China, on the 9th Handicapped Helping Day.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme is "no obstacle and eyesight is the first
priority". Ismail Amat said that no obstacle for handicapped
people is a basic need of modern civilizations, but that China is
far from meeting the needs of handicapped persons by providing
facilities in spite of the achievements and that more measures are
needed to improve things.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has now more than 9 million blind people and
more than 300 million waiting for eye operations.
</P>
<P>
The "eyesight as the first priority" project of the Ministry of
Health and Chinese Association of Handicapped People has plans for
1.75 million cataract operations and increased information about
preventing blindness. The project has given more than 700,000
cataract sufferers their eyesight back.

<HEADLINE> French Writer Disputes Media Reports About Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- French writer and philosopher Regis
Debray has disputed the reports by the French media about what has
happened to the Kosovo ethnic Albanians over the past 50 days.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to French President Jacques Chirac published
in the newspaper Le Monde on Wednesday, Debray, who has recently
visited Yugoslavia including Kosovo, said that France could be
taking the wrong road by participating in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that what he had seen during his week-long stay in
Yugoslavia in early May did not correspond with what Chirac said
about the on-going war, nor what the media said.
</P>
<P>
"You are a man of the field. You don't appreciate at all the
intellectuals who fill our newspaper columns with grandiloquent
and unanswerable guesses. Nor do I. I stick to the fact," he said
in his letter to Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Debray, who was once advisor of former French President
Francois Mitterrand, said that at his request, the Yugoslav
government let him travel alone in a car across the country,
including Kosovo, to see by himself from May 2 to 9.
</P>
<P>
He said that the stories told by some refugees in Macedonia and
Albania could be exaggerated, because many of them are people
sympathetic with the Kosovo Liberation Army or even members of the
separatist group.
</P>
<P>
The French media have widely interviewed the refugees and each
evening, the television reports are filled with these interviews.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Liberation published on Friday,
Debray said that he wants to trigger a debate in France on whether
the war against Yugoslavia is just or not.
</P>
<P>
"I am neither advocate nor procurator of anyone. I am just
trying not to sacrifice thinking to emotion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French weekly Mariane will publish next week a report on
the war in Yugoslavia by Debray.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's domestic
exports classified to the wearing apparel industry in the first
quarter of 1999 rose by 3 percent to 8.6 billion HK dollars (1.1
billion U.S. dollars) compared with the same quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of domestic exports classified to the
machinery, equipment, apparatus, and parts and components
industries decreased by about 19 percent to 7 billion HK dollars (
897 million U.S. dollars), according to the government figures
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The value of domestic exports related to the above-mentioned
four major industries accounted for 74 percent of Hong Kong's
total domestic exports of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Notable decreases in the value of domestic exports were
recorded for the paper and paper products, printing and publishing
industry, the professional and optical equipment industry, and the

<HEADLINE> S'pore Airlines' Profit Declines in Fiscal 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Both the Singapore Airlines (SIA)
Group and its parent airline company registered a decline in their
profits in the financial year 1998-99 ending on March 31 although
their capacity production increased in the period, the group said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises the airline company, its subsidiary and
associate companies.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the financial year 1997-98, the SIA Group's
operating profit fell by 144 million Singapore dollars or 14.5
percent to 854 million Singapore dollars (one Singapore dollar
equals to 58 U.S. cents), while profit before tax contracted by 55
million Singapore dollars or 4.7 percent with earnings per share
at 80.6 cents, a drop of 0.4 cent or 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The airline company's operating profit for 1998-99 was 549
million Singapore dollars, a 27.3 percent fall compared to
1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998-99, the airline company's revenue rose by 106 million
or 1.5 percent to 7075 million Singapore dollars while its
expenditure increased by 312 million Singapore dollars or five
percent to 6526 million Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the previous financial year, the airline company's
profit before tax dropped to 882 million Singapore dollars, down
14.5 percent, while its profit after tax fell by a smaller amount
of 106 million Singapore dollars or 11.5 percent to 814 million
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for 1999-2000, SIA said in its annual financial
results that the outlook for passenger traffic is still uncertain
and it will depend on the performance of East Asian economies and
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yields will continue to be under pressure from price
competition, particularly on the Asian routes because of excess
capacity, it added.
</P>
<P>
SIA budgeted a 4.5 percent growth in its passenger capacity and
a 6.5 percent growth in cargo capacity, focusing on growth
markets, particularly in Europe and the South West Pacific and the
continued strong export from Asia to Europe and America.

<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC)
pledges Thursday cooperation with the incoming civilian government
to achieve social stability.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the organization said they would not demand new wage
 increases in the coming year after suspending Thursday a
nation-wide strike on a minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The strike was launched on April 13 aimed at pressing the
employers and governments to accept a minimum wage of 3,000 Naira
(about 31.6 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
John Odah, NLC deputy general secretary, said Thursday that
twenty state governments had agreed to accept the new wage.
</P>
<P>
However, the labor leaders also said they will keep a close
watch on the actualization of their achievements. They warned
government to refrain from deducting workers' benefits via other
means such as the mandatory housing insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo said earlier his government
would focus on enhancing the purchasing power of ordinary
Nigerians.

<HEADLINE> Annan Appoints Regional Coordinator for U.N. Aid in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has appointed Martin Griffiths as the Regional
Coordinator for United Nations Assistance in the Balkans based in
Skopje of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the appointment of the regional coordinator is
to ensure that the U.N. aid efforts will be made in a united and
coordinated way, said Annan here Friday at the U.N. high-level
meeting on the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The regional coordinator's responsibilities will include
ensuring effective linkages between different sectors of
assistance, coordinating the overall U.N. system operational
response to the crisis, identifying gaps in assistance and
ensuring they are covered, and looking ahead to ensure that the U.
N. is prepared not only for the immediate needs, but for medium-
term developments, according to Annan.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day high-level meeting ending Friday, heads of
the U.N. agencies also discussed in depth the longer-term
developmental and reconstruction challenges posed by the crisis in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the U.N. development agencies, the Bretton
Woods Institutions and NGOs must pool their efforts to offer the
kind of advanced planning needed to lift the region out of the
present dismal state," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Any rehabilitation plan has to focus on the long-term, at
least five years, and should strive toward integration of the
regional economies into the European markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was announced on Thursday that a U.N. humanitarian team of
around 15 officials is scheduled to leave for Yugoslavia on
Saturday for a 12-day fact-finding mission which will include a
visit to Kosovo.

Chinese, Colombian Presidents Hold Talks
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, in talks with his Colombian counterpart
Andres Pastrana Arango at Beijing's Great Hall of the People
Friday afternoon, said that NATO wantonly attacked the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia in an act of humiliation, a trampling on the
U.N. Charter and international relations, and a gross infringement
on Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called the NATO act a rare atrocity in the history of
international relations and one of hegemony and power politics and
said that the Chinese government and people expressed utmost
indignation and condemned the barbarous act.
</P>
<P>
He told Pastrana that the Chinese people support the
government's stand, demonstrating their patriotic enthusiasm and
lofty sense of justice and that this reflects the glorious
tradition of the Chinese nation uniting together in defense
against foreign interference.

Pastrana said that Colombia's government and people support

China is governed according to law and all the protest
activities after NATO attacks on Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
were in accordance with the law, he said, pointing out that the
Chinese treat the planners and those responsible for the attack
differently from the vast majority of Americans. China also
provided the necessary protection for embassies of the related
countries in China, including the United States embassy, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador in Athens,
Dragomir Vucicevic, Friday called for an immediate end to NATO's
bombing of his country, which has killed 1,200 civilians and
injured 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Vucicevic said that NATO's
bombing also caused extensive damage to the country's roads,
bridges, public buildings and power plants.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the NATO bombing had already exceeded 100
billion U.S. dollars while half a million people had lost their
jobs and over two million had no source of income, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S.-led NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade on May 8, the ambassador attributed the
criminal act to the strategy adopted by the aggressor to
discourage efforts, such as those of China, aimed at bringing an
end to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of diplomatic and consular missions in Yugoslavia
was an act of barbarity against the people, Vucicevic said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns NATO Bombing of Kosovo Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday condemned a NATO air strike against the Kosovo village of
Korisa that reportedly caused the death of more than 50 innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, which has more than once warned NATO's leadership that
military action against Yugoslavia may have extremely grave
consequences, resolutely condemns the new crime of the alliance,"
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, at least 50 people, mostly women,
children and elderly, were killed and over 100 wounded in a
cluster bomb attack by NATO warplanes in the Kosovo village of
Korisa early Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We call on NATO's strategists to stop this madness
immediately," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been more than a month and a half since NATO air forces
started an unprecedented bombing of Yugoslav territory, and
civilians are becoming its victims with ominous regularity. The
number exceeds 1,200 people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reiterated that talks are the only way to solve
the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian State Duma speaker Gennady
Seleznyov said Friday that Russia may initiate "a public
Nuremberg-like trial" in response to NATO's aggression in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the lower house of parliament said he regards
NATO's actions in the Balkans as terrorist in nature.
</P>
<P>
"And it is precisely a terrorist organization," the speaker
said, adding that he is convinced that NATO is in "for a big
trial," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov accused the NATO military of "spitting on all
conventions" by using pellet bombs and massacring innocent
civilians.

Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Erastus Mwencha
Friday outlined the organization's priorities in the next five
years.

He noted that the COMESA has made steady progress in the
integration of trade and investment in the region in the fields of

<HEADLINE> U.N. Habitat Commission Adopts New Vision for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The 17th session of the U.N.
Commission on Human Settlements concluded Friday by adopting 23
resolutions on Habitat's strategic vision, work plan, organization
reform and budget.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which meets every two years, is the governing
body of the United Nations Center for Human Settlements
(Habitat).
</P>
<P>
The commission mandated the Habitat to implement a new
strategic vision through two programs: "Adequate Shelter for All"
and "Sustainable Urban Development".
</P>
<P>
The programs will be advocated through two global campaigns,
one for Secure Tenure and the other for Urban governance.
</P>
<P>
The work program in the biennium 2000-2001 will concentrate on
those issues that help countries achieve the goals of the Habitat
Agenda, the global action plan adopted by the world's governments
in June 1996 in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The work program will focus on activities that reduce poverty,
improve shelter, promote governance, promote healthy living
environment and improve the status of women.
</P>
<P>
The commission recognized that Klaus Toepfer, the Acting
Executive Director of Habitat, had taken steps to streamline and
harmonize the financial and administrative management of the
center, which is part of U.N. -wide process of reform launched by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A budget of 23,019,600 U.S. dollars for the Habitat and Human
Settlements Foundation was approved by the commission in a bid to
enable the center to implement its work program for the biennium
2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The commission further supported proposals for strengthening
the Nairobi location of the center, noting that Habitat and the
United Nations Environment Program are the only two UN
headquarters located in a developing country.
</P>
<P>
The commission also backed proposals for maximizing cooperation
between the two Nairobi-based organizations while "maintaining
the two organizations as separate U.N. organizations with
separate Executive Directors".

fulfilling our duty as a responsible NATO member" in the air
strikes against Yugoslavia.

A poll published by the local daily The Jerusalem Post Friday
showed that if a second round of voting were to take place now,
Barak would beat Netanyahu by 50 percent to 43 percent, with 7

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks 202 Million Dollar Sanction in EU Beef Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States, escalating
its brewing trade war with the European Union (EU), asked the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday to authorize 202 million
U.S. dollars in sanctions against the EU for banning imports of
U.S. hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The request to the World Trade Organization came one day after
the European Union ignored a WTO deadline to end its 10-year ban
on hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU notified the World Trade Organisation on Thursday that
it would not comply with the organisation's decisions ordering
Brussels to end a decade-long ban on U.S. beef from cattle treated
with artificial growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
European officials said they remain concerned about potential
health risks from eating the beef, and interpreted the WTO's May
13 deadline to only require an assessment of health risks.
</P>
<P>
The United States insisted that the Thursday deadline meant the
EU had to lift its ban on the controversial beef imports.
</P>
<P>
"Starting today, we are moving ahead with steps necessary for
the WTO authorization to suspend trade concessions," U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This authorization will allow us to impose one hundred percent
tariffs on specific EU agriculture and consumer products as early
as mid-June," he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that "we
take this course as a last resort."
</P>
<P>
Under WTO settlement procedures, the U.S. request for tariffs
must be granted by June 12 unless the EU claims that amount
exceeds the harm caused to U.S. exports. If the EU makes that
claim, the matter will go to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade officials have indicated that the specific EU goods
targeted for steep duties would not be revealed until after the
WTO completes arbitration and decides on a final amount.
</P>
<P>
The amount of retaliatory duties was much lower than the 900
million dollars initially proposed by Washington in March, and
well below the 500 million dollars in annual lost sales of beef
estimated by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
</P>
<P>
Washington also signaled that despite the tough talk it was not
too late to negotiate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said the United States remains willing to discuss an
interim compensation package as long as the EU promises to open
its market. Under that arrangement, the EU would temporarily
compensate the United States for lost sales as a result of the
import ban, rather than face retaliation.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones
approved by the government to make cattle grow faster and bigger.

LUANDA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The troops of the rebel movement
UNITA attacked the town of Kungula Friday morning, some 12
kilometers from the capital city of Uige Province and held it for
several hours..
</P>
<P>
The Angolan news agency reported that the Angolan government
launched counter-attack immediately and recaptured the town not
far away from Uige City.

The UNITA forces Wednesday also attacked a village called
Cahondo, 40 kilometers north of the provincial capital of Mucaba
Province, killing six villagers and wounding more than 20 others.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Portuguese Agnecia Lusa Friday quoted a press
release issued by the UNITA as saying in Lisbon that its forces
downed an Antonov- 26 carrier heading for eastern Lunda-Norte
Province Thursday, killing all the crew members.
</P>
<P>
The press release did not say whether the plane was used for
civilian or military purpose.

However, analysts here said that the plane was probably used to
 transport living necessities or mining equipment to the province
where the UNITA guerrillas are active.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Commended for Rejecting Banditry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni,
who is currently on a tour of the northern part of the country,
has commended people there for rejecting banditry for the past 11
years.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks while addressing a public rally in
the northern district of Lira Friday afternoon, according to a
press release issued by the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
He told the rally that the stand taken by the people of Lango
on banditry has resulted in immense gains in development.
</P>
<P>
The banditry in the north in general has gone down
tremendously, a situation the Ugandan president attributed to the
improvement in army equipment as well as putting in place
necessary infrastructure at the border.
</P>
<P>
The local people were also assured that the government has
taken definitive measures to ensure banditry is brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of the country, especially the districts of
Gulu, Kitgum and Lira, has suffered a lot from attacks by rebels
of the Lord Resistance Movement led by Joseph Kony.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, operating from bases in southern Sudan, kill, maim
and abduct civilians in order to defame the government.
</P>
<P>
The complicated features of the terrain which harbors the
rebels make it difficult for the government forces to comb the
area for remnants of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
With the referendum and general elections approaching, the
government is making renewed efforts to restore peace in this
region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Ruling Party Praises Opposition's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of
Tanzania's ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM -- Revolutionary
Party of Tanzania) Friday praised the reconciliation of the
opposition Civic United Front to settle the political conflicts in
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held in Zanzibar, the ruling party committee said
that the improvement of political relations between the two
parties will benefit both and will do good to people in the isles.
</P>
<P>
"It was not an easy task, but through determination and
commitment, the understandings for national interest have been
recorded," said a statement issued by the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under Salmin Amour who was seeking a second
term as president of the isles, claimed a narrow victory over the
Civic United Front in the 1995 elections, but Western donors
questioned the result.
</P>
<P>
Amour has refused to hold another ballot, saying that his
mandate will extend until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In protest, the donors have frozen all but essential
humanitarian aid programs on the islands as a result of the
dispute in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Following the dispute that led to a wave of conflicts,
including the opposition party's refusal to attend parliament
sessions and arrest of 17 of its members on treason charges, the
Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, and other
international mediators, have made great efforts to make the two
parties at odds reconcile.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the two parties announced in Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam that they will sign an agreement to resolve
the political impasse because of the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Measures to end the impasse include reform of the Zanzibar
Electoral Commission, promotion of human rights and good
governance, reform of the judiciary, the immediate restoration of
normal political life in Zanzibar by dialogs rather than inciting
ethnic hatred, hostility and political intolerance.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have agreed to put the past behind them and in
the higher interest of Zanzibar, to work together a spirit of
national reconciliation, and ensure that the elections scheduled
for 2000 and all subsequent elections are free of controversy and
in which the will of the electorate will be respected.
</P>
<P>
Western donors have welcomed the move and expressed wishes to
resume aid pending the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Friday's statement, signed by the secretary-general of the
ruling party, Philip Mangula, also commended Zanzibar people for
their patience and tolerance during the whole period of the
misunderstandings between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
It said that Tanzania's multi-party system is not aimed at
exacerbating fightings or inciting chaos in society, but intends
to bring political competitions through policies and strategies.
</P>
<P>
It added that people's hearts should be won through convincing
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party committee said the successful achievements
recorded by the two parties will now throw the doors wide open for
the better cooperation between each other.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, comprising Unguja and Pemba, as well as a number of
smaller islands, joined Tanganyika in 1964 to form the United
Republic of Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kariba Lake, the second largest
man-made lake in the world, recorded one of its highest water
levels this year compared only to two periods in its history, the
Zambia News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The lake recorded 486.34 meters above the sea level Friday and
the figure is still rising as water continues from upper Zambezi
watershed in the north of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The highest ever recorded figure was in 1977 when water level
in the lake rose to 487.84 meters above sea level. In 1963, the
water level reached 486.84 meters above seal.
</P>
<P>
The lake's worst all time low water level was in 1995 when
477.5 meters above sea level was recorded.
</P>
<P>
When the 6,000-square-kilometer lake, made between 1955 and
1958, attains maximum water levels, the Zambezi River Authority
decides what to do with the extra amount of water.
</P>
<P>
It is either released down stream to beef up the Kafue Gorge
Hydro Power Plant or released to Kariba plants on either side of
the dam.
</P>
<P>
Kariba North Bank Plant Manager Reginald Sibanda is all smiles
this year as he expects to generate more power both for domestic
consumption and for export.
</P>
<P>
The total power generated on the Zambian side per annum is
1,608 megawatts, of which 1,200 megawatts are consumed locally and
the remaining part is exported to Zimbabwe and South africa.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, there are plans to export power to Kenya and
Tanzania before long.

</P>
<P>
Erastus Mwencha, Secretary-General of the Common Market of
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Friday described these as
the two principal objectives of the impending COMESA meetings.

industry, transport and others, Mwencha told the reporters at the
Kenyatta International Conference Center, venue of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Another one is to make preparations to launch the free trade
area in the year 2000, he said, adding the preparations mean that
"we have to go through country by country to establish problems
-- where they are and how to tackle them in order to realize the
free trade area in 2000."
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that during the meetings, an economic forum
would be held as an opportunity to sharpen the COMESA's focus to
share the experiences with delegations from other regions.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting delegations from the United Kingdom,
Americans and Asia. We will exchange views on how they have
overcome some of their challenges that we anticipate to meet on
our way forward," Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
During the COMESA summit scheduled on May 24 and 25, the
leaders of the member states will review progress in the
implementation of COMESA programs in trade liberalization and
facilitation, creation of an environment to enable COMESA to be a
common investment area.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also review progress in the areas against a
backdrop of rapid development in the global trading and investment
climate, Mwencha added.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department reported
Friday that consumer prices increased in April by an unexpectedly
sharp 0.7 percent, the biggest monthly jump in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
The big advance was led by a record 6.1 percent spike in energy
prices, including a 15 percent leap in the price of gasoline. But
prices for many other products and services, from food and
clothing to housing and medical care, also increased.
</P>
<P>
The energy prices jump was the largest monthly gain since 1957,
the Department said. Gasoline prices was also the biggest monthly
gain since 1935.
</P>
<P>
The core prices, which exclude the volatile energy and food
categories that are the most closely watched by economists, rose
0.4 percent, the most since January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The April leap in the Consumer Price Index followed smaller
increases of O.1 percent in both January and February, and 0.2
percent in March. It pushed the annual rate of inflation felt by
consumers so far this year to 3.3 percent, compared to a 1.6
percent rise for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, world economic turmoil had pulled energy prices down
sharply. So the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed this Spring to limit production of oil. Many economists
expected the prices to rise, because military fuel demands for the
conflict in Yugoslavia are tightening energy markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices of other goods also have been expected to rise as other
countries begin to recover from nearly two years of global
financial turmoil and world demand picks up. But April's price
hikes were sharper and more widespread than most economists had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Fuel oil prices also jumped 3.8 percent and electricity costs
rose 0.2 percent. So far this year, energy prices are rising at a
24.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Affected by climbing energy costs, transportation prices rose
2.4 percent, the most since 1981 and airline fares were up 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said energy prices jump may be temporary. But they
warned it could lead to more widespread inflation, since oil and
gas fuel so many industries.
</P>
<P>
The only category of products where prices declined was
communications equipment, including a 1.4 percent drop in the
price of computers.
</P>
<P>
Competition from discount-priced imports coming into the United
States from economically troubled countries is continuing to keep
prices in that category low.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected figures shocked financial markets, immediately
turning traders' attention toward next week's meeting of Federal
Reserve policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said the Fed was unlikely to act abruptly to
change interest rates at its meeting next Tuesday, but that it
might signal its intentions to possibaly bump up borrowing costs
later this year by adopting inclination toward higher rates.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing a growing wariness about the coming Fed meeting, a
report from this U.S. central bank Friday hinted of a quicking
pace in the factory production.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said in the report that production by U.S. factories,
mines and utilities increased 0.6 percent in April, the most since
August 1998. That followed an upwardly revised output growth of
0.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The production figures suggested the briskly growing economy
may not be headed for a slowdown anytime soon.

<HEADLINE> Africa Declares Millennium Bug An Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of high-level African
officials and technical managers Friday declared the millennium
bug an emergency which should be given priority at all regional
meetings.
</P>
<P>
In a six-point resolution adopted by representatives from 45
African states and organizations, the three-day conference in
Ghanaian capital Accra urged African governments to identify and
commit resources to resolve the millennium problem.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or Y2K problem, is an expected flaw in
computer systems that may result in a complete shut-down or
malfunctioning of computers at the beginning of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most African nations, considered to be emerging economies, are
prone to the Y2K problem as a result of the rapid technological
changes sweeping across the continent, the Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference called on African governments
and regional organizations to engage the political and diplomatic
machinery to bring the Y2K issue on the agenda of the meetings of
regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the conference resolved to establish an African
Y2K Coordinating Body in the form of a working group and an
African Action Group.
</P>
<P>
The Action Group will promote and improve external
communications, media exposure, and raise awareness on the actual
Y2K situation in Africa, among others.
</P>
<P>
The conference, first of its kind in Africa, was under the
auspices of the African Regional Y2K Conference Steering Committee
and funded by the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says to Probe Bombing of Refugee Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO said here Friday that it
gives reporters details about the bombing of a Kosovo refugee
convoy in which over 100 civilian people were reportedly killed
and injured.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Shea, the spokesman, told reporters that NATO is
conducting investigation into this killing.
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is what we do every time, these are or there
are such reports, which is to have a full and thorough
investigation. We are doing it at this moment. As soon as we know
the story, I will give you the details, but I don't have that
yet," he replied to a questioner in a daily news briefing at NATO
headquaters.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports today, 54 civilians were killed
and 61 injured by NATO attack using banned cluster bombs in Korisa
near Prizren in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
So far, the civilian death toll caused by NATO is close to
2,000 and injured near 10,000. Meanwhile, experts in the Law
circle said cluster bombs are outlawed "although NATO has used
them throughout the period of the Kosovo conflict".
</P>
<P>
A report also said today that Judge Louise Arbour of
International Criminal Tribunal of former Yugoslavia has confirmed
that all parties to the Kosovo conflict, including NATO, fall
within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is in the process
of preparing a very detailed dossier with very precise data
confirming all the outlaw acts by NATO and naming various NATO
officials as the accused including US President Bill Clinton,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques
Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana and NATO Supreme Commander in
Europe, US general Wesley Clark.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Mine Workers' Union of Ghana
Friday called on the government to ratify the convention of the
International Labor Organization on the safety of miners so as to
demonstrate its concern for the health and safety of those working

with skills not readily available locally are recruited so as to
reduce cost.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urged the government to encourage the
introduction of employees share ownership plans to ensure a sense
of belonging and increase productivity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Community in New York Stages Anti-NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 ethnic Chinese
rallied near the United Nations headquarters here on Friday to
protest NATO's act of attacking the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
last Friday with five precision missiles.
</P>
<P>
Waving Chinese national flags and holding pictures of the three
Chinese journalists killed in the attack, the demonstrators
chanted slogans to voice their strong indignation and condemnation
of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy, and demanded
punishment of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour demonstration, organized by Ad-hoc Committee of
Overseas Chinese Against NATO Atrocities, began with the concerted
singing of the Chinese national anthem and ended with another
well-known Chinese song in praise of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators include Chinese students, garment factory
workers, businessmen and scholars in New York. Chinese students
from Chicago, Philadelphia and New Jersey also took part in the
peaceful rally, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued by the organizers said, "We demand truth
and justice regarding the bombing of the Chinese Embassy. We
call for an immediate end to NATO bombing in all of Yugoslavia.
We call on peace-loving people everywhere, including those in
NATO countries and in Kosovo, to unite to bring peace to the
war-torn land."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also sent separate letters to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
condemning the missile attacks on the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, both at home and abroad, as well as the world
community were shocked and angered by the NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, that left three Chinese
journalists dead and more than 20 embassy staff members injured.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to Annan, the Coalition Against NATO's Atrocity
said, "The attack was a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter,
international law and the Vienna Convention. It has stirred up an
international uproar and a storm of protest in China. It has also
incensed ethnic Chinese throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
"NATO's launching of an air war on a sovereign state, bypassing
the United Nations, was a serious mistake in violation of the U.N.
Charter," the letter, dated May 14, said, "It has not mitigated,
but instead, aggravated ethnic conflict in that part of the
world."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo conflicts broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
"We attach great importance to the role of the United Nations.
We hope that the world organization can bring the Balkan conflict
to a just end, and help clean up the aftermath of the bombing of
the Chinese embassy, so that world peace and stability can be
better served," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
In another letter to President Clinton, the Coalition Against
NATO's Atrocity said, "You have apologized to the Chinese on more
than one occasion, and called it a 'tragic mistake'. But the
apology came late and sounded perfunctory. Calling it a simple
mistake resulting from 'faulty intelligence' -- the use of an
outdated map -- is hardly credible."
</P>
<P>
"We therefore request that your Administration and NATO make an
open and solemn apology to the Chinese, and more importantly,
conduct a thorough investigation of the matter, and bring those
responsible to justice," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of ethnic Serbs and Greece, who are living in New York,
came to show their solidarity with the ethnic Chinese
demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> French Sinologue Regrets NATO Bombing of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The famous French sinologue and
former Gaullist minister, Alain Peyrefitte, has expressed his
regret over the NATO bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Friday, Peyrefitte said that as
an old friend of China's, he was shocked by the bombing of Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
``Personally I prefer to believe that it is an accident, rather
than a deliberate attack on China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Peyrefitte, who is president of the editorial committee of the
daily Le Figaro, said that although this event would inevitably
harm Sino-U.S. relations, he hopes that China and the United
States can continue to develop their relations.
</P>
<P>
``A fine Sino-U.S. relationship is good for world peace and
stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as he has written in numerous editorials, NATO
should stop the military campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's FM Reacts to BBC Report on Rawlings' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian Foreign Ministry
Friday slammed a BBC report that President Jerry Rawlings is sick,
the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Joseph Awa Laryea
said that Rawlings is in sound health and going about his duties
with " characteristic enthusiasm, vitality and efficiency."
</P>
<P>
Although Rawlings for a short period of time toward the end of
last year experienced a few health problems, he has long since
fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has made the reaction to statements made by a
member of the opposition, Kwesi Pratt, on a BBC Network Africa
Program which was aired Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Pratt made a number of "derogatory, wild
and false" statements about the present health state of the
president, which sought to create the impression that on account
of poor health, he is unable to discharge his duties effectively
as Head of State.
</P>
<P>
Pratt's statements "are false and constitute a clear instance
of attempts by some members of the opposition to discredit and
slur the president and his government," the Ghanaian foreign
ministry pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It recalled the various activities and foreign trips undertaken
by Rawlings in recent times, which included his official visit to
Guinea, the United States, France and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Since January, Rawlings has also received many dignitaries, the
ministry noted, citing the visits by the Nigerian Head of State
Abdulsalam Abubakar, Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao, Nigerian
President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo and foreign ministers of Canada,
France and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Tajik Amnesty Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday hailed the Tajik
parliament's approval of a bill granting amnesty to dissidents as
an effective step to restore peace and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said the
bill is one of the principled decisions made during the Tajik
peace negotiations, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

The Tajik parliament on Friday voted unanimously to grant

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Israel's Likud Party's Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ruling Likud Party has
adopted one chapter called "peace and security" as part of its
platform as how to move the Middle East peace process forward is
one of the major policy issues for each of the 32 parties
contesting the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
In general, the Likud promised to cement the existing peace
agreements with the Arab states and strive to achieve peace
agreements with all neighbors with the aim of reaching a
comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreements will cover the establishment of diplomatic
ties, borders open to free movement, economic cooperation and the
launching of joint projects in the fields of science, technology,
tourism and industry between Israel and Arab states, the platform
said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states' desire for peace will be measured by their
efforts to curb hostile activities by terrorist organizations from
their territory and to dismantle their infrastructure, the
platform said.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian track, it said the Likud will
safeguard the state's vital interests in the negotiations with
the Palestinians and in implementing the signed agreements,
including the Wye River Memorandum signed with the Palestinians
last October.
</P>
<P>
According to the platform, the Palestinian Authority must wage
a systematic war on terrorism organizations and their
infrastructure, halt incitement against Israel, confiscate all
illegal weapons and reduce the size of the Palestinian police if
it wants the Likud to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, it said the
Likud's objective is to safeguard Israel's vital interests as a
secure and prosperous Zionist and Jewish state and to minimize
the security dangers implicit in the 1993 Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
The Likud's principles for permanent status arrangement with
the Palestinians include a rejection of a Palestinian Arab state
west of the Jordan River and a refusal of Palestinian proposals to
divide Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
To ensure this, the Likud will not permit the Palestinians to
conduct diplomatic activities in the Orient House and will
continue to increase Israeli police in East Jerusalem and to
further expand Jewish habitation in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
While promising to keep all Jewish settlements in the
territories, the platform also indicates the Jordan Valley and
the territories with settlements shall be under Israeli
sovereignty and the Jordan River be Israel's permanent eastern
border.
</P>
<P>
The Likud will continue to seek the renewal of peace talks with
Syria without preconditions while strengthening the Jewish
settlements on the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
It will act to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution
425 to pullout Israeli troops from Lebanon while ensuring
appropriate security arrangements so as to defend the citizens
in north Israel and guarantee the security of South Lebanese
Army members.

LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain is stepping up participation
in NATO by preparing another 2,300 troops for eventual deployment
in the Balkans, Armed Forces Minister Doug Henderson said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The troops will be deployed in that region once NATO's air
campaign against Yugoslavia has come to a successful conclusion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I can state that three more infantry battalions, in addition
to gunners and engineers, are being prepared," Henderson told
reporters during the daily Ministry of Defense briefing.
</P>
<P>
"This comes to nearly 2,300 additional people," said the
minister. He added that "no decision has yet been made to deploy
those forces."
</P>
<P>
"It is prudent planning for the successful end of the (NATO)
air campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already deployed 6,300 troops in Macedonia and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Henderson confirmed that 12 British Tornado bomber planes were
to be redeployed from their base in Germany to a French air base

CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Palestinian self-rule areas are losing about 600
million U.S. dollars annually because of the reliance on the
Israeli currency and the non-existence of Palestinian currency,
said Chairman of the Monetary Department of the Palestinian
Authority Fouad Basesso who is on a visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side put the losses at 400 million dollars, said
Basesso in a statement carried by Saturday's "Alam Al Yom"
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Basesso conveyed a verbal message from Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat to Arab League Secretary-General Dr. Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on the Palestinian currency issue. The message dealt
with the prospects of issuing the Palestinian currency, a
component part of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Royal Moroccan Airlines has embarked on a plan
to purchase seven more planes besides the nine planes it had
earlier ordered from the Boeing Group at a total value of 400
million U.S. dollars in a bid to modernize its aircraft fleet.
</P>
<P>
The airlines received the first plane on Thursday, a newly
developed Boeing 737/700, Saturday's Arab daily "Al Hayat"
reported. The new generation planes will be used for medium-range
trips to Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Labour Force and Immigration
said that Libya is still in need of skilled and trained Egyptian
labour for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The actual needs for a formal working force, through secondary
and personal contracts, include such professions as doctors,
teachers at university, secondary-school and technical levels, as
well as auxiliary medical workers and pharmacists for Libya's
hospitals and to operate modern medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training in
Tripoli said that job opportunities are avilable for technical
labour force to operate heavy and advanced machinery and for the
construction of bridges and future projects in the light of recent
developments and Libya's open-door economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The report said Egyptians account for some 40 percent of
Libya's university professors, 22 percent of employees of national
companies, 2 percent of the labour force of domestic oil companies
and 2 percent of foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The estimated number of seasonal Egyptian labour in Libya is
some 300,000.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The number of Franco-Saudi joint ventures in Saudi
Arabia amounts to 57, 14 of which are industrial ventures and 43
of diverse functions.
</P>

share is 67.18 percent and the French side 31.77 percent.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Civil affairs departments at the

year 2000, the Minister of Civil Affairs, Dorji, said in a recent

nominated directly by villagers and the committee election should
be open and the voting closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
There needs to be a democratic debate mechanism so that all
affairs closely related to villagers' welfare can be decided
according to majority's will, he said, and the villagers need ways
to apply their supervisory decisions and to express their rights.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also urged civil affairs departments at all levels

<HEADLINE> Beijing's College Students Comment On U.S. Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The NATO attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia has caused Chinese college students to take
another look at the United States, which many used to think of as
the promised land.
</P>
<P>
Some are saying that the U.S. bomb attacks have given them
insight and helped them understand the United States in a truer
way. Guo Zhaozhi, who is in the sociology department of Beijing
University, said he used to admire the United State for its
development from a colony to the world's leading economic and
military power, but now, considering the U.S. bombs, he often asks
himself whether he was wrong or the United States was.
</P>
<P>
He says he believes that the NATO attack fully exposed the U.S.
to the world.
</P>
<P>
Liang Jun, a student in the Chinese department at People's
University, says that the United States values its own life very
much, but adopts a different approach to other nations.
</P>
<P>
In the American movie "Saving Private Ryan", the U.S. army
sends a team of men to find an ordinary soldier to save him
because all his brothers have been killed, and it moved many
Chinese college students.
</P>
<P>
But, Sun Qiuning, a student in the Law Department of Beijing
University, says about the results of the NATO missile attack, "
Seeing the son carrying his mother's ashes, I came to understand
what hypocrisy it."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missiles that destroyed two Chinese families are the
essence of American freedom, democracy, and human rights, says Lu
Chenfei, a student at Beijing University, and, that "democracy"
belongs to the privileged class, while "freedom" is related to
hegemony, and "human rights" are only for American citizens.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities in Beijing have returned to normal in
the past few days and once again the classrooms and libraries are
full.
</P>
<P>
Wu Lei, a Beijing University student, says that hard study is
important for contributing to the motherland in the future and
students need to put their patriotism to work.

"The NATO's acts violated the U.N. Charter and the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations as well as the basic norms
governing international relations and infringed on Chinese
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade was "deliberate," adding that the NATO wanted to sound
China out and see how China would react.
</P>

He stressed that following the disintegration of the Soviet
Union, the United States becomes the sole superpower in the world
which pursues and practices hegemonism and power politics
globally.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China's comprehensive national strength
increased obviously, he noted, pointing out that the United States
does not want to see the emergence of a strong China, thus taking
a preemptive strategy on China.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed in
two separate but related incidents in Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku Province, on Saturday, according to Antara News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred in the Mardika district where
security forces resorted to their firearms to end a fight between
youths from Mardika and Batumerah villages.
</P>
<P>
The second incident occurred near the headquarters of the newly
formed Pattimura Military Command not long after the fracas in the
Mardika area.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd carrying the body of Frangky Pitris, a youth who
died in the Mardika incident, marched toward the Pattimura
Military Headquarters' building but was fired upon by security
forces in front of the office of the local Military Police
detachment.
</P>
<P>
The detachment's office told Antara News Agency that a total of
18 people who had been among the marchers had been shot and taken
to hospital. Five of them had died and three were in critical
condition and being prepared for surgery.
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Subagyo, who had gone to Ambon
especially to inaugurate the Pattimura Military Command, expressed
deep regret about the incidents.
</P>
<P>
He said he had instantly issued orders to troops in Ambon and
surrounding areas to take measures to prevent further security
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The incidents occurred only two days after the signing of a
peace pact by representatives of the various ethnic and religious
groups in Maluku who had been locked in a protracted and violent
strife since last January.

A series of riots in some areas in Maluku Province during
January through March claimed hundreds of lives and forced
residents to flee their homes, mostly to the neighboring island
of Sulawesi.

<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim, but Maluku
is a predominantly Christian province.

ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban have
recaptured a strategic district in central Bamiyan Province from
the rival Northern Alliance, consolidating their hold on the whole
province.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces overran the district of Yakawlang, routing
opposition forces after an overnight offensive," a source from the

</P>
<P>
Bamiyan Province is largely dominated by Afghanistan's minority
Shiite Muslims, who are aligned with the Northern Alliance led by
former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief
Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban first captured Bamiyan city last September.
However, in a dramatic move the Northern Alliance forces
recaptured the city on April 21 this year, but the city fell into
the Taliban's control again on May 9.

The Taliban forces have been trying to consolidate their hold
on the whole of Bamiyan Province after they captured the

<P>
The Ministry reported that Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
and Shandong provinces and the cities of Shanghai, Beijing, and
Tianjin have a minimum living standard guarantee system for their

<HEADLINE> Yemen Calls on Iraq to Implement U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yemeni Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader Ba-Jamal
Saturday urged Iraq to implement United Nations resolutions
related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Kuwaiti First Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah, Ba-Jamal said that Iraq's compliance with related U.N.
resolutions was essential for the security in the region as
well as for Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important issue. Arab solidarity is one of
the pillars of peace and stability in the region. We made
this point clear during the meeting of Arab foreign ministers
held in Cairo last February," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni official also said that his country was willing to
play a major role in solving the issue of releasing over 600
Kuwaitis and third country nationals allegedly held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said "we discussed this with Sheikh Sabah and agreed
that this important humanitarian issue should be solved."
</P>
<P>
On the future of Kuwaiti-Yemeni ties, Ba-Jamal said both
sides agreed during the talks that "relations should return to
normal and grow stronger."
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni top diplomat arrived here earlier in the day for an
official visit aimed at mending Yemeni-Kuwaiti ties affected by
the 1990-1991 Gulf war sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait down-graded its diplomatic representation in Yemen after
Sanaa opposed the idea of forming an international coalition to
drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, a Yemeni foreign ministry official said here last
Sunday that his country was misunderstood because Yemen insisted
on "an Arab solution to the crisis aimed at sparing the region
from future problems."
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jamal, the highest-ranking Yemeni official to visit Kuwait
since 1991, will inaugurate the re-opening of the Yemeni Embassy
Sunday before wrapping up his two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> American Says He's Safe In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- "I'm sound and safe in Beijing and
want to come back," says a member of a U.S. science and technology
delegation visiting China as he was getting ready to board the
plane for the United States today at Capital International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Before he left, he asked for a Chinese flag, saying he wanted
to take it back as a gift, according to Zhou Lin, the President of
Beijing's Zhoulin Bio-Spectrum Technology Inc.
</P>
<P>
The American and 6 other technical personnel from several U.S.
companies arrived here on May 9 to visit Zhoulin Bio-Spectrum
Technology because of the 3 patents it got in the U.S. last year.
</P>
<P>
But, they were asked to leave China as soon as possible by the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing when students started holding
demonstrations in major Chinese cities to denounce the NATO
missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7 that
killed 3 and wounded more than 20.
</P>
<P>
At first, the Americans said they were worried about their
safety because the U.S. media had said that Americans could be
beaten by the Chinese like during the Cultural Revolution (1966-
1976), he said, but they calmed down quickly and he insisted on
continuing with his inspection tour and added sightseeing trips to
the Forbidden City, the Great Wall and other scenic spots around
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Americans said that what they have seen here is not like
what the U.S. media reported and that they will tell the truth to
the American people when they return home.
</P>
<P>
This morning, many overseas visitors from the United States,
Canada, and northern Europe visited the Forbidden City and the
Summer Palace and Xinhua reporters saw more than 10 foreign
tourist delegations within 10 minutes at the south gate of the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
Tour guide Yu Lili told reporters that her delegation arrived
on Friday and said that these Americans had been afraid that their
itinerary would be affected by the student demonstrations but now
they are feeling calmer after having seen the stable and amiable
atmosphere in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> India Censures Developed Countries' Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- India on Saturday strongly
criticized developed countries for their increasing protectionist
tendencies against imports from the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a national apparel summit here, caretaker Textile
Minister Kashiram Rana said, "When India is committed to
liberalization, free trade and global opportunities for growth of
all players, we do not encounter today a situation commensurate
with its hope and aspirations."
</P>
<P>
"The trade liberalization process, using platform of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to boost growth in value and volumes of
exports of developing and developed countries, has not proceeded
on intended lines. The world is turning toward protectionism more
than ever. It needs a WTO that works," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Textile Secretary Shymal Ghosh said here Saturday
that while India was being asked to reduce the tariff and
non-tariff barriers, its exports to the developed markets were
facing troubles due to non-tariff barriers and higher peak
tariffs.

world's largest service club organization, plans to help more
cataract sufferers in China as an example of blindness prevention
for the rest of the world, according to Tam Wing Kun, chairman of
the "Sight First China Action" (SFCA) project.
</P>

The SFCA project is the biggest effort of its kind in the world.
The project's planners expect to restore the sight of 1.75 million

<HEADLINE> AFG Proposes Action Plan for Asian Bond Markets Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANGKAWI, Malaysia, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The APEC Financiers
Group (AFG) Saturday proposed a plan of action for the development
of Asian Bond Markets to APEC's finance ministers for their
consideration and adoption.
</P>
<P>
The APEC finance ministers began their two-day meeting here
Saturday and the AFG, which comprises private financiers, had a
dialogue with them in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On the plan for Asian Bond Markets development, the AFG has
identified some priority actions to promote liquidity and
efficiency, including the need to kick-start the market by issuing
government bonds, promoting the use of bond issues by statutory
bodies and encouraging tax neutrality for bond issues, according
to a press statement issued by the AFG meeting secretariat after
the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The AFG proposed that the infrastructure to develop the Asian
Bond Markets should include implementing a one-stop approval
system, promoting market making and trading on the Exchanges,
enhancing the legal standing of bondholders in default situation
as well as developing and supporting benchmark yield curves.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the private sector should play a greater role in
the revitalization of the financial system, the AFG proposed that
the finance ministers reaffirm the AFG as the primary two-way link
between APEC finance ministers and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the finance ministers to enhance the quality and
frequency of interaction, provide its support for the AFG's
proposed knowledge engine/infrastructure, ensure the consistency
of the AFG representation at national level and assist with
funding.
</P>
<P>
"Critical to the enhancement of the AFG's role is the
establishment of a knowledge engine to facilitate sharing of best
practices and experience throughout the APEC's financial
community," it said.
</P>
<P>
To be effective in its role, the AFG also requires a stronger
infrastructure in the form of a permanent functional secretariat
which will use the knowledge engine to make the AFG an effective
"virtual community," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The AFG also proposed to investigate the possibility of
partnership with existing engines, for example the World Economic
Forum, review the establishment of national level secretariats
with member associations and also establish a funding mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for an action plan for the Asian Bond Markets
development was one of the three major proposals the AFG forwarded
to the APEC finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the other two proposals covered the
following: institution of training and educational programs for
financiers of APEC economies, and enhancing the private sector's
contributory role in revitalizing the financial system of APEC
member economies.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are framed in the context of the regional
financial crisis and the pivotal role played by financial
institutions in today's economy, AFG Chairman Amirsham Aziz said,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The AFG held its fifth meeting on Friday to finalize the
proposals before its dialogue with the APEC finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Financiers Group was established in 1994 to advise the
APEC finance ministers on capital and financial market development
issues.

basic norms governing international relations and infringed on
Chinese sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO is a gang of bandits with no humanity," the
statement said, warning the NATO that "the Chinese people are not
to be bullied and would never yield to hegemonism and power
politics."

<HEADLINE> Half of S. African School-kids Try Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Fifty percent of the high
school pupils in South Africa's Gauteng Province are experimenting
with drugs with 10 percent of those, are regular drug abusers,
Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
This year, at least 3.8 million South African school children
will experiment with drugs, and of those, one in six will become
dependent, said social workers, psychologists and other people
working with teenage drug users.
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago, six percent of high school pupils were abusing
drugs; now it is as many as 30 to 50 percent, and within four
years, 90 percent of pupils will be experimenting," said Drugwise
social worker Tanya Singer, who works with schools to educate
pupils about drugs.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a 15-year-old drug user, who is currently
undergoing counselling, as saying that drug abusing is so common
that "if you don't, you are seen as a square".
</P>
<P>
Another school social worker, Leonie van Straaten, said drug
dealing is rife among youngsters.
</P>
<P>
She said children as young as 13 were selling drugs to their
peers. " Some even sell at the schools."
</P>
<P>
The other common selling places are shopping centers, where
youngsters hang out at night.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old drug user said it would never take him more
than 10 minutes to "score" drugs at any time of day.
</P>
<P>
"I could get Ecstasy, coke (cocaine), rocks (crack cocaine),
acid, heroin or dagga (marijuana) for you now if you wanted," said
the teenager, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
School children are starting drugs younger and younger and drug
dealers target youngsters because they are vulnerable, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Some drug dealers give extremely addictive crack cocaine to
youngsters for free for the first time, knowing they will come
back for more, said a social worker.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo said that food production and the development of the
agricultural sector will form the corner-stone of his
administration when he takes office on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect was speaking at the palace of the Emir of
Katsina during his recent thank-you tour of the northwest zone of
the west African country, the Daily Times newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If we can produce enough food to feed ourselves, half of the
problems of the country is solved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have eliminated poverty and if we are able to
eliminate hunger, the condition of poverty is already removed," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Obasanjo, 1999 is the year of the beginning of
restoration to the country of all those things which have been
lost over the years.
</P>
<P>
He urged farmers in the most populous African country to embark
on large- scale farming to produce more food for self-consumption
and then export the surplus to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
His government will immediately find ways of making fertilizer
available to farmers by stopping the activities of middlemen who
buy the commodity at subsidized rates and then re-sell to farmers
at exorbitant prices, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow that to happen again. We are looking into
what should be the best way, if we are subsidizing fertilizer, to
get it to the farmers and not to a third party," said the
president-elect.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Demand Explanation for Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government will ask
for the explanation from the Swazi government on the latter's
repatriation of Mozambican citizens residing in the landlocked
country.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here Friday by Mozambican Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Co-operation Leonardo Simao, according to the Noticias
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Simao said the repatriation has infringed a general accord
signed by a joint cooperation committee between the two countries
and that his government will propose a discussion with Swaziland
on the effectiveness of the accord, which has laid out the rights
and obligations of their nationals residing in each other's
country.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that early this week, Swaziland forcefully
repatriated about 300 Mozambican citizens illegally residing on
its territory. Most of the Mozambicans didn't even have the time
to collect their clothing before the repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Jacinto Maguni, a first secretary of the Mozambican embassy in
Swaziland, said Mbabane didn't give any notice before the
repatriation, so that the Mozambican side had no idea how many
people are to be sent back or when and therefore cannot prepare
for their return.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the two sides are preparing for a
special meeting which will be based on the general accord.

<HEADLINE> Duma Starts Vote on Impeachment Proceedings Against Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, started an open impeachment vote Saturday on
five charges against President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The voting started at 15:00 local time (11:00 GMT). The voting
procedure was expected to last until 16:50 local time (12:50 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the lower house of parliament,
said the results of the impeachment vote would be known at 18:15 (
14:15 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The five charges against Yeltsin include: breaking up the
Soviet Union in 1991; using force against parliament in 1993;
launching the bloody war in Chechnya; ruining the armed forces,
and bringing about genocide against the Russian people through
policies that impoverished the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers predict that only the charge on the Chechen war
stands any chance of gaining the required 300 votes to set the
impeachment process in motion.
</P>
<P>
Any of the five charges will need 300 votes to be approved and
forwarded for review to the Supreme and Constitutional courts.
Then they will have to receive a two-thirds vote in the Federation
Council, the upper house of parliament, for Yeltsin to be removed.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the impeachment effort is likely to fail in the
courts or the Federation Council.

<HEADLINE> OAU Warns of Refugee Crisis Caused by DRC War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for African Unity
(OAU) Saturday called on the international community not to forget
the refugee crisis arising from the war in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Anssane Igodoe, Niger's permanent representative to the OAU,
made the call on behalf of the pan-African organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugee situation in the neighboring countries of
DRC is very serious and the material and health problems have
constituted a heavy burden on the countries, which are facing
economic difficulties themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said OAU sends its delegations to the countries from time to
time to assess the situation and bring contributions to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, out of 27,000 refugees who fled to the north of Zambia
from DRC war, only 10,000 have been attended to because of limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
Igodoe also pressed for a political solution to the war in DRC
to root out the cause of the refugee crisis.

<P>
MACAO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Many people in Macao who had voted to
choose the first chief executive of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said the election will usher in a new
era when Macao residents will truly be the masters of their own
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, all the 199 members of the Selection
Committee for the first government of the Macao SAR held a plenary
meeting to select the first chief executive of the Macao SAR by
means of secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah got 163 votes and the other running candidate
for the chief executive, Stanley Au Chong Kit, obtained 34 votes.
</P>
<P>
"For hundreds of years, Macao residents did not have the right
and chance at all to choose the head of Macao," said Pan Hun Veng,
secretary-general of the Macao Association of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the result of the election is satisfying and
represents the wish of most Selection Committee members and Macao
residents and that the election had truly followed the principle
of "Macao people governing Macao."

Leong Heng Teng, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Macao,
held a similar view. "As a resident of Macao, I feel very excited
that we are able to participate in the selection of our own leader.
"
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of election will be of great significance to
promoting social progress and developing democracy in Macao," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the failure of Stanley Au in the election, Leong
said Au did his best in his campaign activities and he likewise
made marked contribution to the society.
</P>
<P>
Pai Wan Leung, 93, is the oldest member in the Selection
Committee. He could not hide his excitement right after the voting.
</P>
<P>
"It is unprecedented. It is the beginning of a novel history in
Macao," he said, explaining that all Macao governors had been sent
from Portugal under the colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Lam Chong, director of the Correio Sino-Macaense newspaper,
said that the election has created a form of election with strong
local characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The 199 members of the Selection Committee were chosen from
Macao's 450,000 residents and are widely representative. And the
election result is able to reflect the desire of the residents, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think general election can be achieved in the future with
the fine operation of the SAR government and a higher sense of
civil rights among the residents of Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Chou Kei, chief editor of the Jornal Va Kio newspaper,
said the whole process of choosing the first chief executive of
the Macao SAR is favorable to the long-term development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Macao residents are prompted to make more thorough thinking
about local affairs in the course of the campaign activities of
the two chief executive candidates. In the meantime, the platforms
of the candidates were enriched by including the views of the
public," Tang said.

by bombing Thursday night the village of Korisa in Kosovo, where

ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Three soldiers of the Turkish

</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of terrorists had ambushed a
military vehicle carrying soldiers on duty near Mesudiye town
of Ordu province, killing three soldiers and wounding another.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists escaped after attacking the military vehicle
belonging to the Gendarme Commandership in the region.

<HEADLINE> Forests Erode by 3 Percent Annually in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's 2.56 million hectares of
forestland, susceptible to severe water erosion, are eroding at
the rate of 3 percent a year, soil scientists here said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Erosion was caused by water flow, nutrient depletion, water
logging, salinity, acidification, burial of fertile land by sandy
alluvial soil and riverbank erosion, the scientists told a seminar
on "Land Degradation and Soil Pollution in Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by the Soil Science Society
of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council.
</P>
<P>
Erosion was taking its cruel toll on the country's soil, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the causes for dropping soil fertility, they said
intensive land use, introduction of high-yielding varieties,
mono-cropping practices, inadequate and imbalance use of chemical
fertilizers were depleting the nutrients of soil as well as
striking an imbalance in nutrients.
</P>
<P>
On the water logging problem, they said it might stem from
flooding for a considerable period of time or congestion in
drainage, improper infrastructural development, seepage of water
from neighboring irrigated areas, topographical position or tidal
flooding.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal areas, about 830,000 out of 2.85 million
hectares of cultivable land were affected by different degrees of
salinity, they said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, Commerce and Industries Minister
Tofail Ahmed urged scientists to find out ways to check the pace
of land degradation and environment pollution.

<HEADLINE> Russia Duma to Vote on Yeltsin Impeachment Proceedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, or lower
house of the parliament, is set to vote on whether to start
impeachment proceedings against President Boris Yeltsin shortly
after noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Duma impeachment committee has proposed five charges
against Yeltsin: breaking up the Soviet Union in 1991, using force
against parliament in 1993, launching the bloody war in Chechnya,
ruining the armed forces and bringing about genocide against the
Russian people through policies that improvised the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers predicted that only the charge on the Chechnya war
stands any chance of gaining the required 300 votes to set the
impeachment process in motion.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, 386 of the 441-member
Duma -- nine seats are vacant -- attended the Saturday session.
The Duma by 301 votes decided on an open impeachment vote using
name ballots that would start at 12:30 local time (08:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Any of the five charges would need be supported by 300 votes to
be approved and forwarded for review to the Supreme and
Constitutional courts. Then, they would have to receive a two-
thirds vote in the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, for Yeltsin to be removed.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the impeachment effort is likely to fail in the
courts or the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between the State Duma and the president has
been made tenser by Yeltsin's dismissal Wednesday of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was popular in the lower house. The
firing has energized impeachment supporters.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has nominated Sergei Stepashin, first deputy prime
minister and interior minister in the Primakov cabinet, as the
next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's nominee three times, the
constitution says the lower house of parliament must be dismissed
for new elections.
</P>
<P>
However, under the constitution, the Duma cannot be dismissed
once it votes impeachment charges, which leaves it unclear what
would happen if impeachment passes and the Duma refuses to endorse
a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is scheduled to meet next Wednesday to discuss
Stepashin's candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Anti-NATO Sentiment Running High in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SKOPJE, Macedonia, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Anti-NATO sentiment is
running high in Macedonia, where about 18,000 NATO troops are
deployed and are preparing for a possible invasion of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO forces in Macedonia have caused a lot of problems for us.
Now you can see NATO military vehicles moving everywhere in our
country," a Macedonian youth told Xinhua in downtown Skopje,
capital of Macedonia, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"What NATO has done and is doing to the Yugoslavian people is
totally unfair and unacceptable," a middle-aged man said. "
Everybody who is human should not have done that."
</P>
<P>
"They are bombing schools, factories, hospitals and other
civilian targets and killing innocent people in Yugoslavia. They
are crazy," the man said.
</P>
<P>
A young supporter of the small Democratic Party of Serbs in
Macedonia (DPSM) said that the Macedonian protesters set the U.S.
embassy in Skopje on fire after NATO started air strikes on
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"The Macedonian government told NATO that Serbs from Yugoslavia
set the U.S. embassy on fire and ran away. But this is not true.
It was done by our Macedonians." he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the days immediately following the beginning of NATO air
strikes, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the U.S.
embassy to protest against the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia." the
young man recalled.
</P>
<P>
The roads to the U.S. embassy have been closed by police ever
since the incident.
</P>
<P>
A humanitarian organization affiliated with the DPSM has been
trying to help Serb refugees who have come to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Boro Stojanovicth, a program coordinator for the organization,
said that there are about 10,000 members in the organization and
an office is set up in almost every Macedonian city to receive
donations for the Serbian people who are suffering under barbaric
NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
"The International Red Cross from Geneva dose not help the Serb

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister Calls for Abandoning Ill Habits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of
Community Development, Women Affairs and Children has urged people
in the country to abandon ill habits for the sake of improving
family life.
</P>
<P>
"You must abandon a habit of delivering children while you are
unable to provide them with food, shelter, education, clothes and
treatment and therefore increasing poverty in families," Nagu gave
a special message to the World Family Day which falls on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The message, delivered Friday in the capital Dar es Salaam,
underlined good parental care and hard work as the starting point
of raising children.
</P>
<P>
"I can call upon all families to work hard. Presently, you can
not secure money easily as you used to do in previous years.
Without toiling you can not earn a single cent," Saturday's Daily
News quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister called on Tanzanians to abolish other
unhealthy practices which are likely to ruin women's health and
national development.
</P>
<P>
She criticized the tendency of men to marry more than one wife,
which contributed to increasing poverty in families and the spread
of communicable diseases including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The minister also blasted early marriages, the killing of
elderly people, circumcision, abuse of women and children, as well
as bhang smoking, prostitution and theft.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for African Population Control to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo has called on the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) member states to focus their efforts on socio-economic
programs that include clear understanding of population factors to
reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Southern African Ministers'
Conference on Population and Development (SAMCPD) in Lusaka
Friday, the vice-president said all SADC members needed to respond
to the challenges emanating from population related issues.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted Tembo as saying the
 community had made substantial progress in the adoption of
population related development policies.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to note, for example, that Zambia initially adopted
a population policy in 1989 and has since revised it to march with
the times," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was important for SADC to concentrate on
common social values because it based its existence on full
economic integration that provided for cross border trade and free
movement of factors of production including human resources.
</P>
<P>
The southern African region had one of the highest population
growth rates in the world of about three percent per annum, he
said, adding that with the given population growth rates, the
region faced the possibility of doubling it's population in the
next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has resulted in government failing to meet the
demands in the provision of social services such as health,
education, water and sanitation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high levels of poverty and fast population growth rates
demanded seven percent annual economic growth rates if SADC was to
effectively reduce the poverty levels.
</P>
<P>
"The population time bomb is therefore a serious threat to our
 collective development efforts. We need to increase investments
in the economy and have a clear institutional framework for
coordinating population and development issues," he added.

<HEADLINE> "Sight First" Benefits 710,000 Cataract Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 710,000 cataract-
afflicted patients across China have had their eyesight restored
thanks to a national project to provide free ophthalmic operations
for the patients, according to the China Disabled Persons'
Federation (CDPF).
</P>
<P>
A total of 59 national and national medical teams were sent to
488 remote and poor counties of the country to remove cataracts
for 711,000 patients according to the "Sight First China Action"
project, which was jointly launched by Ministry of Health, the
CDPF and the Lions Clubs International in 1997, said chairman of
the CDPF Deng Pufang.
</P>
<P>
The biggest effort around the world to treat and prevent
disease-related blindness, the SFCA project has also organized
ophthalmologic specialists to compile teaching materials and to
run training courses for some 4,000 local eye doctors, Deng told a
meeting here today to review the success of the project.
</P>
<P>
Ophthalmic units with complete facilities and qualified doctors
and nurses were established in 12 counties. Two nationwide surveys
are being conducted to collect information of eye illnesses and
ophthalmic service.
</P>
<P>
The project is also supporting the establishment of an eye-
disease database while publishing a dozen pamphlets to spread
knowledge of blindness-prevention among ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
By setting up production lines of artificial lens in Suzhou
late last year, which is used by patients following operations,
the project now is able to provide such inexpensive lens in a bid
to rise the implant rate of such lens by three times, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year project plans to conduct 1.75 million operations,
and lead to a gradual decrease of cataract cases in China from the
year 2001. The cross-the-century goal is expected to be achieved
after a total of 250 medical teams are sent down, ophthalmic units
are launched in 100 county hospitals, and 11,000 eye doctors in
rural areas are trained, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a magnificent feat in China because it not only
challenges blindness, but also brings sight and hope of life to
the blind who are living in darkness and bitterness," said Peng
Peiyun, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Cataract-related blindness has been preying upon some four
million Chinese in total, and 400,000 more people become new
cataract patients each year. However, only 200,000 operations
could be carried out annually due to lack of ophthalmic service
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Urges Iran to Solve Islands Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Saturday welcomed Iran's overture to the Arab
world, but urged it to solve the islands dispute with the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"Iranian President Mohammed Syed Khatami's visit to three Arab
states this week, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, is a positive
step toward improving ties," said the English daily Gulf News.
</P>
<P>
But for Iran to fully gain the trust of the Arab world, it will
eventually have to come to terms with the UAE, the paper added in
its editorial entitled "cooperation is key".
</P>
<P>
The paper urged Iran to respond to the UAE's repeated call for
an amicable solution to the dispute over the three islands of
Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, located near strategic shipping lanes in
the Gulf, are claimed by both countries but have been controlled
by Iran since Britain retreated from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
"Having solved its border dispute with Oman, the UAE has the
record to prove that it can live up to that kind of cooperation,"
the paper said, urging Iran to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Oman signed a border agreement on May 1, ending the
demarcation of 350 kilometers of borders between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising Iran's overture, the paper said President khatami's
visit to the three Arab countries was expected to launch
Iran-Arab relations in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with Iran could bring prosperity to all, and will
benefit every country directly or indirectly," it said.
</P>
<P>
Ending the visit to Syria, Khatami is due to start his landmark
tour to Saudi Arabia Saturday, which is expected to further
improve the relations between the Gulf's two oil and political
superpowers.
</P>
<P>
Iran's relations with Gulf countries have been improving since
Khatami came to power in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Air Tanzania to Fly to Middle East &AMP; Beyond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Air Tanzania Corporation
(ATC) will begin its flights late May to the Middle East following
the signing of a code- sharing agreement with the Gulf Air here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ATC acting Managing Director Emmanuel Kimaro told a press
conference here that Tanzania's national flag carrier will resume
the Dubai, Muscat and Jeddah flights beginning on May 29.
</P>
<P>
He said the code-sharing agreement with the Bahrain-based
regional carrier enables ATC to put its code on Gulf Air's flights
linking Dubai and Muscat with Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Code-sharing involves an alliance between two airlines whereby
one airline's designated code is placed on a flight operated by
another airline alongside that airline's code.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Gulf Air will be allowed to operate on
the Dar es Salaam-Dubai route whose rights are currently held by
ATC.
</P>
<P>
In return, Gulf Air will offer ATC seats on its Dar es
Salaam-Muscat- Dubai route.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air, equally owned by the governments of Qatar, Oman,
Bahrain and Abu Dhabi emirates in the United Arab Emirates,
provides unparalleled services to all major points in the Gulf as
well as more than 50 destinations world wide.
</P>
<P>
The president and chief executive officer of Gulf Air, Dr.
Sherikh Al- Nehyan, reiterated his support for closer cooperation
with ATC, saying the code-sharing agreement would strengthen the
network of both airlines and build Gulf Air's presence in East
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"ATC passengers will from now on ease their travelling plans by
booking flights at ATC's sales points to the Gulf and beyond to
destinations served by Gulf Air, connecting their flights in
Bahrain, Muscat or Dubai," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Gulf Air passengers from Bahrain, Dubai,
Muscat and beyond will be able to connect their flights at Dar es
Salaam to destinations served by ATC, he added.
</P>
<P>
ATC is one of East Africa's premier Airlines serving eight
domestic points in Tanzania as well as eight other cities
throughout East Africa and southern Africa including Johannesburg,
Harare, Lusaka, Entebbe, Kigali, Bujumbura and Nairobi.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The average per share profit for B
share companies in China fell by nearly 60 percent in 1998,
according to Shanghai Shenyin-Wangguo Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The company's calculations, based on the reports of corporate
results of 106 B share companies of the total of 107, show that
the average per share yield of these B share companies fell below
0.10 yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
B share companies that incurred losses also expanded in number
to 17, seven more than last year. More than half of these
companies reported per share losses of more than 0.50 yuan. Only
one company which hasn't publicized its corporate results claimed
it expects heavy losses in 1998.
</P>

restructuring of state industries, and impact from the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 companies reported per share yield of more than 0.40
yuan, led by Shenzhen Konka with a per share yield of 1.102 yuan.
Ten of such companies will pay shareholders dividends of more than

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Face Water Catastrophe: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese minister has warned that
his country would face "catastrophic" water shortages if greater
care is not taken to preserve existing supplies, the Daily Star
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman Traboulsi, Minister of Electricity, Hydraulic Resources
and Oil, voiced his concern in a water and electricity management
session held here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon would face severe water shortages in the
next 15 years as demand of water is expected to double the current
figure by 2015.
</P>
<P>
Total available water currently reaches 2,200 million cubic
meters per year with demand amounting to 1,485 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
This winter season from November, 1998 to April, 1999, Lebanon
suffered the worst drought since 1952 due to considerably
decreased rainfall.
</P>
<P>
According to hydrologists, rainfall averaged only 50 percent
of the annual standard this season.
</P>
<P>
"We are heading for a catastrophe if we do not remedy the
situation," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Remedial measures include awareness campaigns to warn againist
wasting and polluting water.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that a 600 million U.S. dollars project to
save water by building dams and networks is expected to finish in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is only one big water dam with a storage
capacity of 220 million cubic meters in the country's eastern
Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
Traboulsi hoped that the new dam will help alleviate water
shortages for a limited period of time.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Saturday that National Democratic Front (NDF) rebels must end
12 years of efforts and forge a peace pact with the government by
December this year.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio interview, Estrada said that his government
is ready to resume formal peace talks with the rebels and end the
war for peace.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to resume the peace process, but I want to give a
deadline of only up to December. The peace talks have dragged on
for too long," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the government formally informed the NDF
that it was ready to resume peace talks with the group following a
three-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
Estrada suspended the talks in February when the rebels
abducted an army general and an army captain. He approved the
resumption of the talks after the NDF released the hostages, but
stressed that the peace talks should take place in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada admitted that despite efforts of the government to
accommodate requests of the rebels, the peace efforts have yet to
show solid results.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- There should be an independent
international trial for those who are responsible for the attack
on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, organizer of the
International Action Center (IAC) said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Thursday, Malcolm Cannon, who
leads IAC's Washington Office, said that the IAC, a leading U.S.
anti-war organization, supports the request of the Chinese
government for a thorough investigation into the brutal act.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, the U.S.-led NATO attacked the Chinese Embassy from
different directions with five missiles, four of them exploded.
</P>
<P>
"We should find out which officials in the U.S. government were
responsible for this calculated and deliberate decision to attack
the Chinese embassy," Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
"The officials who were found responsible should be severely
punished for their criminal behavior," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and NATO claimed that they were using a map dated in
1992 in targeting and "accidentally" bombed the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the claims, Cannon said with a scornful smile: "
Any tourist map shows the Chinese embassy in downtown Belgrade.
The U.S. embassy officials have on many occasions visited the
Chinese embassy and know exactly where it is."
</P>
<P>
"They initially said that the bomb was astray and so many times
they made the same mistake and now they are saying that the
mistake was that they targeted the wrong building. They tell lies
about the whole thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cannon said that by attacking the Chinese embassy, the United
States is to send out a message to the world -- "Don't bother to
aid Yugoslavia because we will bomb your embassy, we will bomb
your population."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the real purpose of NATO to attack Yugoslavia,
Cannon said the U.S.-led alliance is definitely not for protecting
humanity.
</P>
<P>
"We have never accepted any reasons that the U.S. has given for
this war," Cannon said, "We think this is a war to control this
region which they regarded as a critical region to the world."
</P>
<P>
When the Kosovar Albanians fled to Germany to ask for refugee
status, they were rejected because the German foreign office said
in a secret document that there is no ethnic cleansing at all in
Kosovo, Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
"Even they are saying the opposite things, they don't believe
themselves. What they said internally is totally different from
what they say externally," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cannon believed that the United States is trying to break up
Yugoslavia, which defies Washington, and tries to turn it into a U.
S. colony. All other countries have applied to join NATO in the
region, but Belgrade has not.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aim is to maintain a "one-superpower world order," and
it will not permit any country to say no to it, Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to terrorize the population. This bombing is
international terrorism against civilian population to change the
policies of their government...even in their (the U.S. government
own definition, the bombing is terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the past 50-over days, the U.S.-led NATO attacked both
military and civilian targets, including factories, power plants,
TV stations and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the three Chinese journalists killed in the embassy
bombing, Cannon said the attack "shows that the United States is
trying to cut off free information coming out of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also planned to cut off the Internet access to
Yugoslavia because a lot of independent information is coming out,
Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
"So the only information the people will get will come from the
U.S. media sources," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Yugoslav journalists were killed in NATO bombing at
the end of last month. A NATO spokesman claimed that TV stations
and other media in Belgrade were bombed because they were "one-
sided" and were not "real free media." But Cannon said the U.S.
media are "extremely biased and extremely one-sided."
</P>
<P>
"Those media sources are tied one way or another to the defense
contractors," he said, noting that the General Electric Corp. (GE)
is tied to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the
Westinghouse has the Colombia Broadcasting Company (CBS).
</P>
<P>
"These two major defense contractors will certainly support
this war, " Cannon affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Cannon, who has organized a series of anti-NATO demonstrations,
said the killing of the three Chinese journalists is "a deliberate
policy" of the United States -- cut off the free information.
</P>
<P>
When referring to freedom of speech, Cannon said "we never
believe that there is freedom of speech in the United States. To
get freedom of speech in this country, you need a couple of
million of dollars to buy your own TV station."
</P>
<P>
"There is freedom of speech for the rich and powerful, but for
the poor people, there is no freedom of speech," he said. "You can
see that with information coming out of the press which is
extremely biased and extremely one-sided."
</P>
<P>
He cited a very brief news story in the U.S. leading newspaper--
The Washington Post. The story quoted the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo as saying they fled their country because of NATO's bombing
when asked why they crossed the border into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
However, Cannon said, the newspaper "buried" the story so deep
and made it so tiny that nobody can even see it.
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't they give a front page coverage instead of it being
just buried in a little article in the back of the Washington Post
that nobody really sees it?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"This is the way they control the information in this country
and this is why there isn't even broader opposition to the war in
the United States," he indicated.
</P>
<P>
Despite his strong criticism of the U.S. government, Cannon did
not feel that he betrayed his country.
</P>
<P>
He said the war in Yugoslavia is only in the interests of a
small group of "rich and prosperous people." "I feel we stand for
the real interest of the people of the United States... who have
no interest in bombing another country or in targeting a
population which have no conflict with at all."
</P>
<P>
Cannon urged the U.S. government to spend the billions of
dollars that they are spending on the war to pay for education,
housing and social security.
</P>
<P>
IAC was established by former Attorney-General Ramsey Clark in
1992. It has dozens of offices across the United States. Cannon
is one of the hundreds of volunteers who work for the organization.
</P>
<P>
It will organize a big demonstration in Washington on June 5 to
demand the U.S.-led NATO stop bombing Yugoslavia immediately. Tens
of thousands are expected to participate the protest, Cannon said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Chief Slams S.Africa over Unfair Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was accused Friday by
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) of
pursuing protectionist economic policies and other unfair trade
practices at the expense of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted COMESA
Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha as saying that South Africa's
unfair trade practices are hurting the weaker economies of its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
South African High Commissioner to Nairobi Griffiths Memela
denied the accusations by saying they are based on "inaccurate
tariff information."
</P>
<P>
Memela argued that entrepreneurs from South Africa's
neighbors, including Kenya, are not "agressive enough" to
penetrate the southern African economy.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is an open market economy. All countries are
allowed to market their products in South Africa. This means that
products will have to compete equally with products coming from
elsewhere," Memela said.
</P>
<P>
However, both COMESA and South Africa agreed to solve their
difference through dialog.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Ismail has called on all the countries surrounding the the
war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to pool resources
together and end the nine-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
"We want a more comprehensive peace process and the whole of
this part of Africa should be involved in finding this peace. We
don't want peace to only come between the Congo and Rwanda or
Uganda and DRC, while other parties are still fighting," he said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
When meeting his Zambian counterpart Keli Walubita, Ismail
called for inclusion of his country on the defense and foreign
affairs committees constituted in Lusaka to draw up modalities
leading to a ceasefire in the DRC, the Zambia Daily Mail reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said africa needs peace to interact and that the continent
should fight for a place in the United Nation Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Sudan supports the peace efforts made by Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba for the DRC, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Walubita pledged that his country will continue pursuing peace
not only in the DRC but also for the stability of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Minister has visited Malawi, Zimbabwe and
is expected to visit two other countries including Angola during

<HEADLINE> Syria Begins to Supply Water to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Syria has started to pump some 8
million cubic meters of water to Jordan this summer to cope with a
projected 10 percent water shortage in the desert kingdom, Jordan
Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 7:00 (9:00 GMT) Friday, Syria began supplying
Jordan with 750 cubic meters of water per second from Syria`s
Basel Al Assad Dam, seven kilometers north of the
Syrian-Jordanian boarder, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Syria will supply a total of the 8 million cubic meters to
drought-stricken Jordan in the coming four months, and has agreed
to increase its water supply if necessary, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Syria agreed to provide water to Jordan in April during a
landmark visit to Damascus by Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah`s visit to Syria officially ended strains in
bilateral relations over the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Assad had been at odds with late Jordanian
King Hussein Ibn Talal over the treaty as his country is still at
war with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
However, Assad declared a three-day mourning in Syria for
Hussein, who died of cancer on February 7, and paid a surprise
visit in years to Amman on February 8 to attend the funeral of
Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and four others wounded by Lebanese
guerrillas' attacks in south Lebanon Saturday, the Orient radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen suffered heavy casualties when their outpost at
Beit Yahoun village in the wester sector of the occupied border
zone in south Lebanon was hit by mortar rounds and rockets of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, two Israeli warplanes blasted the
outskirts of Beit Yahoun and fired at least four rockets at the
targets. There has been no immediate report of casualties from
the raid.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment on another two villages adjacent to
Beit Yahoun wounded two Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army announced in Jerusalem that an Israeli
soldier was also seriously wounded in the pre-dawn violence in
south Lebanon where it set up a self-declared security zone in

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents in UAE Kill 631 in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DAHBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 631 people died, and
9,629 were injured in road accidents in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) in 1998, Khaleej Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting police sources, the paper said road accident fatalities
in the UAE had increased in recent years due to the growth of
population and the increase in the number of cars as well as other
causes.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the past 20 years the number of
cars registered in the UAE has increased 20 fold. It is now
estimated that there are 750,000 cars in the country, or one for
every three persons.
</P>
<P>
According to studies conducted by experts in the Gulf region
and other countries, 85 percent of accidents are caused by
drivers' lack of control over their vehicles or because of their
psychological or health problems, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Failure to abide by traffic rules and regulations is a main
cause of deadly crashes, the studies show.
</P>
<P>
They also show that more than 250,000 people die every year,
and over a million people are injured around the world in car
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Traffic problems in developing countries are especially
serious, imposing a heavy burden on their economies. Losses
caused by traffic accidents in developing countries constitute 1
percent of their Gross Domestic Product, the studies said.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Contribute to Regional Prosperity, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANGKAWI, Malaysia, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China, as an important
member economy in APEC, Saturday pledged to contribute to the
prosperity and stability of the region through its own
development.
</P>
<P>
China's best contribution to the resolution of the
international financial crisis lies in the sound development of
its domestic economy and stabilization of RMB exchange rate,
Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said at the sixth APEC
Finance Ministers' meeting which opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that maintaining a stable exchange rate of RMB is
one important policy of the Chinese government and "in the
foreseeable future, it is unnecessary and unlikely for RMB to be
depreciated."
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government will stick to the course of
reform and opening to the outside world, and efforts will be made
to maintain sound and sustainable development both in the economic
area and in the social area.
</P>
<P>
"This will not only lay down a solid foundation for steady and
rapid growth in China in the future, but also allows China to make
its due contribution to the stability of Asia and the world
economy as a whole," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic situation in Asia, Xiang said China
is optimistic about the recovery of Asian economies, confident in
the future. He noted that conditions of recovery are emerging in
the crisis-affected economies recently.
</P>
<P>
"We believe a full recovery in the Asian region hinges as much
upon the efforts of individual economies as upon joint actions by
the international community, especially the active support of the
developed economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the interest rate relaxation by the developed economies
in Europe and North America helped the recovery of market
confidence as well as stabilization and development of the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the developed economies will continue to implement
fiscal and monetary policies facilitative for sound growth of the
global economy, and open more of their markets to the developing
economies in the region while maintaining their domestic growth,
saying such efforts will help bring about an accelerated recovery
in the crisis-affected economies.

<HEADLINE> NATO Creates Largest Humanitarian Disaster in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO had created the largest
humanitarian disaster in the Balkans since World War II under the
name of humanitarianism, a senior Chinese official said here late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, made the statement before the United Nations Security
Council adopted a resolution concerning the humanitarian situation
in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China was deeply disturbed by the current
humanitarian crisis in the Balkans and China had profound sympathy
for the over 700,000 Kosovar refugees who had been left homeless
and separated from their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
What was equally of concern to China was that bypassing the
United Nations and without authorization of the Security Council,
the U.S.-led NATO had launched military attacks against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and thus unleashed a regional
war in the Balkans, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the country, including Serbs, ethnic Albanians,
Hungarians and Slovaks, were living in miserable and inhuman
conditions, and oil refineries and chemical plants had been
leveled by NATO bombing, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, poisonous gas and pollutants were threatening the
health and lives of hundreds of millions, especially children, in
the country and Europe at large, Qin continued.
</P>
<P>
Qin pointed out in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in
different regions in the Balkans, the Security Council should not
apply double standards.
</P>
<P>
An immediate cessation of NATO's bombing against FRY should be
the prerequisite for any political solution to the Kosovo crisis,
and also the minimum condition for relieving the humanitarian
crisis in the Balkans, he added.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Reiterates ILO's Domain Over Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Labor ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Saturday reiterated that the
promotion of labor standards and workers' rights should be the
domain solely of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and
not of any other international body and that the ILO declaration
and its follow-up mechanism should not be used for trade
protectionist purposes.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique, issued at the end of the two-day 13th ASEAN
Labor Ministers Meeting here Saturday, stressed that it would
therefore be unnecessary and inappropriate for other international
bodies to discuss and include the promotion and compliance of core
labor standards with the view to linking them with trade and
non-labor related matters.
</P>
<P>
The ILO, which is the only tripartite international
organization with high-level representation from governments,
employers and workers throughout the world, is the relevant body
to promote and deal with issues relating to labor standards and
workers' rights, it said.
</P>
<P>
On ILO reform, the communique expressed strong support and
expectation that the ILO be further streamlined to make it more
effective, stressing the need for allocation of more resources to
stimulate activities in the ASEAN region as well as in all ILO
members by intensifying technical cooperation and assistance.
</P>
<P>
The communique urged the ILO to review its conventions,
particularly the earlier ones, to better reflect the current
social and economic conditions of all ILO members.
</P>
<P>
With regard to child labor, the communique also reiterated
ASEAN's position that ASEAN does not condone child labor.
</P>
<P>
The communique welcomes in principle the proposed convention
and a recommendation on "Child Labor" which called for the
prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Africa Declares Millennium Bug An Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of high-level African
officials and technical managers Friday declared the millennium
bug an emergency which should be given priority at all regional
meetings.
</P>
<P>
In a six-point resolution adopted by representatives from 45
African states and organizations, the three-day conference in
Ghanaian capital Accra urged African governments to identify and
commit resources to resolve the millennium problem.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or Y2K problem, is an expected flaw in
computer systems that may result in a complete shut-down or
malfunctioning of computers at the beginning of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most African nations, considered to be emerging economies, are
prone to the Y2K problem as a result of the rapid technological
changes sweeping across the continent, the Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference called on African governments
and regional organizations to engage the political and diplomatic
machinery to bring the Y2K issue on the agenda of the meetings of
regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the conference resolved to establish an African
Y2K Coordinating Body in the form of a working group and an
African Action Group.
</P>
<P>
The Action Group will promote and improve external
communications, media exposure, and raise awareness on the actual
Y2K situation in Africa, among others.
</P>
<P>
The conference, first of its kind in Africa, was under the
auspices of the African Regional Y2K Conference Steering Committee
and funded by the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> New Container Terminal to Be Built at Chittagong Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A new mooring container terminal will
be built at the Chittagong Port, the biggest sea port of
Bangladesh, as the Executive Committee of the National Economic
Council has approved the proposal for the project, the Independent
daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With a cost of 7.86 billion taka (about 162 million U.S.
dollars), the project is aimed at meeting the requirement of
massive growth of container traffic at the port and reducing the
dwell time of vessels.
</P>
<P>
After the commissioning of this terminal, the Chittagong Port
Authority will be able to earn 1.38 billion taka (about 28.5
million dollars) per annum at its present tariff rate, according
to the proposal. It will also be able to handle 192,000 TEU
(twenty foot equivalent unit) containers and 900,000 tons of
general cargo at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Three feeder vessels and two container-carrying vessels will be
able to handle containers and general cargo at a time at the
1,000-meter berths when the terminal is completed.
</P>
<P>
With setting up of the new mooring container terminal at the

<HEADLINE> COMESA Meeting in Kenya to Focus on Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The COMESA meetings which will be
held in Kenyan capital next Thursday will focus on the progress
the regional body has made and its further preparations for the
establishment of a free trade area scheduled in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Erastus Mwencha, Secretary-General of the Common Market of
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Friday described these as
the two principal objectives of the impending COMESA meetings.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives is to review progress what COMESA has
made in those cooperative areas such as trade, agriculture,
industry, transport and others, Mwencha told the reporters at the
Kenyatta International Conference Center, venue of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Another one is to make preparations to launch the free trade
area in the year 2000, he said, adding the preparations mean that
"we have to go through country by country to establish problems
-- where they are and how to tackle them in order to realize the
free trade area in 2000."
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that during the meetings, an economic forum
would be held as an opportunity to sharpen the COMESA's focus to
share the experiences with delegations from other regions.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting delegations from the United Kingdom,
Americans and Asia. We will exchange views on how they have
overcome some of their challenges that we anticipate to meet on
our way forward," Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
During the COMESA summit scheduled on May 24 and 25, the
leaders of the member states will review progress in the
implementation of COMESA programs in trade liberalization and
facilitation, creation of an environment to enable COMESA to be a
common investment area.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also review progress in the areas against a
backdrop of rapid development in the global trading and investment
climate, Mwencha added.

<HEADLINE> China Manages to Overcome Fallout Effect of Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANGKAWI, Malaysia, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China managed to
overcome the fallout effect from the Asian financial crisis with
the economic performance reaching the general targets of gross
domestic product growth at 7.8 percent and inflation under 3
percent in 1998, Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the impact from the regional financial crisis,
export growth dropped drastically to 0.5 percent in 1998, he said
at the sixth APEC Finance Ministers' meeting which opened here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said the government will take concerted fiscal and
monetary policy efforts to beef up investment in infrastructure
and stimulate the domestic demand in order to support a sustained
growth and address the severe challenges from a weak domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Counter-cyclical fiscal policies have been implemented to
stimulate domestic demand, he said, adding "economic restructuring
is a long process."
</P>
<P>
He said China has also successfully taken a series of reform
measures in the area of financial management system.
</P>
<P>
Xiang pointed out that concerns as to whether China will slow
down its pace to open the financial sector after the Asian
financial crisis are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
"In 1999, China will further open up its financial sector
progressively to a level consistent with its development in the
economic and financial arena so as to promote competition and
mutual benefits on a fair and equitable basis," he pledged.
</P>
<P>
The two-day sixth APEC finance ministers' meeting here is
mainly to discuss the economic and financial situation in the
region, to deliberate on the future work program aimed at
strengthening APEC's economic and financial cooperation, and on
reforms of the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
APEC, formed in 1989, now comprises Australia; Brunei; Canada;
Chile; China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; South Korea;
Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; the
Philippines; Russia; Singapore; Chinese Taipei; Thailand; the
United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Daily Lashes Out at NATO's Hegemony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The pursuit of hegemony by the U.S.-
led NATO will eventually end in failure, said China's leading
newspaper People's Daily on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary entitled "Evildoers Doomed to Meet Destruction,
" the daily strongly condemned the bloody raid by NATO missiles on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, in which three Chinese
journalists were killed, more than 20 people injured and the
embassy building severely devastated.
</P>
<P>
Besides the indignation blazing across China, the commentary
noted that the anger, strong condemnation and profound condolences
were expressed by some 120 countries and dozens of state or
government leaders, not to mention the much louder calls for
justice by various political parties and the Chinese communities
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese saying "A just cause gains great support, an unjust
one gains little" again proved the truth in itself, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the definitions of aggression by a U.N. resolution
adopted in 1974 and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,
the commentary justified that the NATO bombing of a sovereign
state and raiding another sovereign state's embassy are "acts of
sheer aggression."
</P>
<P>
As members of the United Nations and the signatories of the
Vienna Convention, "the U.S.-led NATO brazenly violated these
universally-accepted norms governing the international relations --
this is nothing less than an international crime," the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
Running against today's world trend which features peace for
people, development for state and progress for the world, "the U.S.
-led NATO waged a war against a Balkan country, bringing about a
grave disaster to the Yugoslav people." "This constitutes a severe
threat and challenge to the course of peace and justice of the
region and the world," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Under great pressure from both China and the public opinions of
the world, the U.S.-led NATO had but to apologize for its attack
on the Chinese Embassy. But "meanwhile, they made up various
excuses in an attempt to shake off the responsibility (which they
were held for the attack), and stubbornly stick to the continuous
bombing of Yugoslavia. This indicated that they will still walk on
the path of their unjust course."
</P>
<P>
The world has been developing towards multi-polarity following
the Cold War, noted the commentary, but the United States, which
has posed itself as the only superpower in the world, wantonly
used force against those countries that are "not obedient", by
taking advantage of its strong economic, technological and
military strength.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the U.S.-led NATO, there are no such things as
the United Nations, international norms and laws existing in the
world but themselves, and they regard themselves as the No. One
authority on the earth, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
According to this hegemonic logic, it went on, power is the law
and "I" am the world dictator.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quoted a politician of a superpower as once
claiming unscrupulously that the current world must have a leader
and that leader was the United States, and that wherever U.S.
values and interests were challenged, it was able to have them
changed.
</P>
<P>
What a naked hegemony it shows to the world, the Chinese paper
slammed.
</P>
<P>
History has already proved, and it will, that hegemonism had
never had a good end, the commentary warned, citing for instance
the British empire where "the sun never sets" and which was once
extremely arrogant and aggressive in history. Such an empire has
no longer existed nowadays.
</P>
<P>
In another example, the paper continued, the Nazi Germany,
which had once occupied the whole Europe during World War II, has
not escaped the fate of perdition either.
</P>
<P>
The United States, too, had lifted rocks only to drop them onto
its own feet by launching two wars in the Korean Peninsula and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Those who do unjust are doomed to destruction, the commentary
concluded, and the mighty tide of the world is roaring ahead.
Those who move in the same direction will prosper and those who go
against will perish.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S.-led NATO continues to go its own way, it is doomed
to meet severe punishment of history, the commentary warned.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Spends 3.6 Billion Yuan on Building highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The landlocked Tibet Autonomous
Region in southwestern China spends a total of 3.6 billion yuan on
building highways during the last five years of this century so
that over 80 percent of its townships have access to highway
transport.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the region's highways are expected to exceed
25,900 kilometers in length, linking all the villages in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Highway is dubbed as "rainbow" in Tibet because of its vital
role in transportation there. More than 90 percent of the cargo
are transported by highway in the area, where water and rail
transportation is lacking.
</P>
<P>
Although there was not a single inch of highway before 1949,
Tibet has since then built or upgraded more than 24,000 kilometers
of highway with a total investment of more than four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
For the present, Tibet has basically formed its highway network
centered around its capital Lhasa which includes five national
highways, 15 backbone highways and 315 branch highways.
</P>
<P>
All the 74 counties in the region now have access to highway
transport, and highways now link Tibet with six neighboring
countries and regions.

and employment impact of the financial and economic crisis,
expressing concern over the delay in the release of funds for the
program.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique, issued at the end of the two-day 13th ASEAN

<P>
The communique stressed the importance of continuing action at
the national and international levels in order for ASEAN to get
back fully on the path of sustained development and growth.
</P>
<P>
The communique expressed appreciation to the ASEAN secretariat
for formulating an ASEAN program to address the labor and
employment impacts of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Funding and technical assistance from various international
donor institutions have become even more important to the member
countries in view of the Asian financial and economic crisis, it
said, requesting the ASEAN Secretariat to explore alternative
funding sources to implement the program and encouraging member
nations to consider cost-sharing arrangements for the
implementation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Institutions Raise Fresh Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai financial institutions have
already raised about 350 billion baht (9.6 billion U.S. dollars)
in fresh capital and another 350 billion baht will be drawn in by
the end of next year, Bank of Thailand Governor Chatumogol Sonakul
was quoted Saturday by The Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Conference on Central Bank Policies held
in Macao Friday, Chatumogol said the fresh capital brings the
total recapitalization amount to about 700 billion baht (19.2
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He indicated a degree of satisfaction over the pace of Thai
banking recapitalization, according to The Nation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor focused his address on the soundness
of the Thai financial system, saying the most important problem
facing the Thai banking system was impaired asset quality, or bad
debts.
</P>
<P>
To overcome this problem and help the Thai economy to recover,
he said the authorities were encouraging banks to undertake debt
restructuring and simultaneously undergo recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
With a low interest rate environment and the passage of new
bankruptcy laws, the process of restructuring corporate debt will
become easier.
</P>
<P>
As of March 1999, some 160 billion (4.4 billion dollars) of
non-performing debt had been restructured, with another 1.1
trillion baht (30.1 billion dollars) still to be dealt with in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
On banking recapitalization, Chatumogol said the authorities
had adopted a flexible approach by allowing banks to rely on
innovative financial instruments in their capital increases, which
they can do by themselves or with help from the government's
capital support program.

<HEADLINE> Outcry from Friend of Chinese Journalists Killed in Belgrade (by Gu Zhenqiu, Ding Baozhong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- "Although I am not strong enough
to bring back the lives of my best friends, I can stand up to
demand justice for them," said Gong Junchuan, the best friend of
the couple journalists who were killed by the U.S.-led NATO attack
on Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
With tears running down her face, a bespectacled Gong, who is
studying in the New York-based Colombia University, told Xinhua
Friday, "I cannot believe the fact that they have left us forever
when I first heard the tragic news."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO attacked the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia
with five precision missiles on May 7, killing three Chinese
journalists and injuring more than 20 embassy personnel. Among
the dead were Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, the couple from China's
intellectual-oriented Guangming Daily. The other, Shao Yunhuan,
was a Xinhua correspondent based in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The loss of best friends is the saddest thing in my life, I
want to ask the U.S.-led NATO, the perpetrator of this tragedy,
where is your concept of humanitarianism" when you are killing
innocent civilians?
</P>
<P>
"The two beloved ones left us all of a sudden before we could
have any chance to bid farewell, leaving behind them the deep
sorrow of their families as well as the Chinese as a whole," she
said, "They loved each other, and they also loved life and the
world, but they were killed when they were just in the beginning
of their happy life."
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine how sad their parents, sisters and brothers
were when they were struck by the tragic news," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gong was invited to act as a bridesmaid when the two
journalists got married on October 1, 1998." The picture of their
wedding is still vivid to me at present," she said, "They were
just in the beginning of their happy life when their lives were
snatched away by NATO."
</P>
<P>
Gong, her husband and Xu Xinghu developed their friendship when
they were studying at the Beijing University of Foreign Language
Studies because Gong's husband and Xu both came from a village in
Danyang County, Jiangsu Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
The two couples, when in the Chinese capital of Beijing, used
to get together to spend their holidays.
</P>
<P>
"We spent many happy times together," Gong said with a sob.
</P>
<P>
Xu and Zhu were assigned to work in Yugoslavia as
correspondents for the Guangming Daily, a major newspaper in China,
in July 1998. Just a few days before the New Year's Day in 1999,
the couple sent Gong an E-mail New Year card from Belgrade,
greeting her a happy new year.
</P>
<P>
"They said in the card that they were looking forward to
meeting me sometime in the future," she said, "Unfortunately, they
could never carry out their wish now."
</P>
<P>
Gong was among more than 1,000 ethnic Chinese who attended a
recent peaceful rally outside the United Nations headquarters to
protest against the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Carrying signs that read "Empty Apology Is Not Enough," "NATO
equals New American Terrorist Organization" and "The Chinese
People Can't Be Bullied," and waving the red Chinese national flag,
the ethnic Chinese living in the New York area chanted slogans to
call for truth and justice regarding the NATO attack on the
Chinese Embassy.

WASHINGTON -- The United States, escalating its brewing trade
war with the European Union (EU), asked the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Friday to authorize 202 million U.S. dollars
in sanctions against the EU for banning imports of U.S. hormone-
treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The request to the World Trade Organization came one day after
the European Union ignored a WTO deadline to end its 10-year ban
on hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU notified the World Trade Organisation on Thursday that
it would not comply with the organisation's decisions ordering
Brussels to end a decade-long ban on U.S. beef from cattle treated
with artificial growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
European officials said they remain concerned about potential
health risks from eating the beef, and interpreted the WTO's May
13 deadline to only require an assessment of health risks.
</P>
<P>
The United States insisted that the Thursday deadline meant the
EU had to lift its ban on the controversial beef imports. (US-EU-

CARACAS -- The price of the Venezuelan oil basket dropped by 88
U.S. cents to 14.04 U.S. dollars per barrel this week, the Mines
and Energy Ministry (MEM) announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
MEM said in its weekly bulletin that the drop was attributed
mainly to the reduction of operations of refineries in the United
States and Europe, which resulted in a reduced demand for crude.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that affected the oil price was the weakening of
gasoline consumption in the U.S. market, which was affected by the
high level of inventories.
</P>
<P>
Between January and February, oil prices dropped sharply in the
country, forcing the government to cut its budget by 1.6 billion
dollars, which had been scheduled at 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The basket dropped 5.75 dollars per barrel in 1998, causing a
loss of 43.5 percent (6 billion dollars) in government revenue. (

JAKARTA -- The Indonesian government and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have signed the latest in a series of letters
of intent which confirms that Indonesia's crisis-hit economy has
bottomed out, the Indonesian Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary indications suggest that the economy has now
bottomed out and stabilization is being consolidated," the report
quoted the letter of intent which was signed here on Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, IMF has revised upwards its forecast
for Indonesia's gross domestic product in 1999/2000 fiscal year to
between zero and 2 percent, compared to the earlier forecast of
between minus 1 to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has also revised downward its inflation forecast for
Indonesia to between 8 and 10 percent, down from an earlier
estimate of 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian officials said the signing of the new letter of
intent will pave the way for the disbursement of another 460
million U.S. dollars of bailout money from the IMF. The IMF so far
has disbursed some 9.5 billion U.S. dollars of its more than 12
billion dollar loan commitment. (Canada-EU)

uncertainties remain, he added.
</P>

"We need to remain vigilant to the challenges and risks that
remain. We must be resolute in our efforts to promote and achieve

prospects of the poor and the vulnerable segments of our society
that continue to bear the severest brunt of the financial crisis,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The sixth APEC finance Ministers' Meeting will center on three
priority areas -- strengthening financial systems, promoting
capital market development and strengthening social safety nets.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers are expected to discuss and
exchange views on the economic and financial situation in the
region, to deliberate on the future work program aimed at
strengthening their economic and financial cooperation, and to
consider the finalization of various initiatives which had been
focused on efforts to strengthen financial systems.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they are also expected to exchange views
with the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank on global developments and
their implications for the region, who are present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They will review the efforts carried out so far to strengthen
prudential regulation of financial institutions in industrialized
economies to promote safe and sustainable capital flows, and
review the progress of efforts to improve standards of
transparency and disclosure for private sector financial
institutions involved in international capital flows.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as host of the finance ministers' meeting, is looking
forward to concrete and practical outcomes on key aspects relating
to reforms of the international financial architecture.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Gem Exporters to Vie for Italian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight Sri Lankan gem exporters of
free sized and calibrated stones will vie for the Italian jewelry
market for the first time next week, the Export Development Board
(EDB) officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exporters will try to get direct access to the Italian
market under a special contract promotion program organized by the
EDB with the assistance of the Sri Lankan embassy in Italy, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan exporters will have one to one meetings with
manufacturers in Naples, Milan and Vicenza under this promotion.
</P>
<P>
The contact promotion program comes in the wake of a study
carried out by the Sri Lankan embassy under the EDB's market
diversification and will be conducive to developing contact
directly with Italian manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Italy is a major manufacturer fulfilling nearly 62 percent of
the worldwide jewelry demand.
</P>
<P>
Although Italian jewelry manufacturers are familiar with the
wide variety of Sri Lankan stones and use them extensively, there
has been no direct contact with these manufacturers since they
purchase Sri Lankan gems through Thailand and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There was an increase in the demand for free sized and
calibrated stones in the Italian market estimated to be around one
billion U.S. dollars a year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is a major gem exporting country, world famous for
its sapphire, ruby and cat's eye.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
announced today that it has launched a number of new measures to
further standardize its internal management and control mechanism.
</P>
<P>
These new measures came with the establishment of Cinda Asset
Management Corp., which will take over and manage the non-
performing assets of the CCB.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CCB said that the recently published report
on the bank's profits in 1998 indicates that the CCB's
profitability is improving. The formation of Cinda Asset
Management Corp. will help the CCB shake off its non-performing
loans, setting a solid foundation for the CCB to become a well-
managed bank with good profits.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CCB has for the first time made quantified
appraisal on the operating and management conditions of its
branches, and such comprehensive appraisal will be unswervingly
carried on as it is key to improving the operating and management
mechanism of modern commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The CCB has already carried out reforms on its credit business
management system, restructuring its credit business institutions
and separating business operation from risk supervision.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the CCB will draw on international
experiences to reform its internal auditing system.

<HEADLINE> Oil Basket Price Drops in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Venezuelan oil
basket dropped by 88 U.S. cents to 14.04 U.S. dollars per barrel
this week, the Mines and Energy Ministry (MEM) announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
MEM said in its weekly bulletin that the drop was attributed
mainly to the reduction of operations of refineries in the United
States and Europe, which resulted in a reduced demand for crude.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that affected the oil price was the weakening of
gasoline consumption in the U.S. market, which was affected by the
high level of inventories.
</P>
<P>
Between January and February, oil prices dropped sharply in the
country, forcing the government to cut its budget by 1.6 billion
dollars, which had been scheduled at 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The basket dropped 5.75 dollars per barrel in 1998, causing a
loss of 43.5 percent (6 billion dollars) in government revenue.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Allows 99 Pc Foreign Ownership in Banking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia Friday issued new
banking rules which include a regulation allowing 99 percent
foreign ownership in the country's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners could either enter local banks through the stock
market or through direct investment, said Bank Indonesia director
Subarjo Joyosumarto.
</P>
<P>
But he added that local investors must hold at least a one
percent stake in banks.
</P>
<P>
"Banks partly owned by foreign banks can put foreigners on the
board of directors and board of commissioners, but at least one
member of the board of directors and commissioners must be an
Indonesian citizen," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The new banking rules follow legislative approval last year of
the country's new banking law.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said foreign ownership in local banks could help
accelerate the recovery efforts of the country's ailing banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
The entry of foreign professionals into local banks would be a
positive contribution to improving efficiency of the banking
industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo also said that foreign banks could now open branches in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks, except for those who had been here since the
Dutch colonial times, were previously barred from opening branches
in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Subarjo said that only the world's 200 largest banks in
terms of assets with minimum credit ratings of A either from
Standard and Poor's Corp. or Moody's would be allowed to open
branches in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The minimum capital for a new foreign bank was set at 3
trillion rupiah (385 million U.S. dollars), he said, adding that
the minimum capital requirement was the same for opening up a new
local bank.
</P>
<P>
The previous minimum capital requirement was 250 billion rupiah
(31.25 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Separately, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin Friday said
President B.J. Habibie would sign on Monday the country's new
central bank law.
</P>
<P>
Under the new central bank law, which ensures independence of
Bank Indonesia, the president appoints the board of governors and
its deputy governors.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Cargo Ships Sink Worldwide From 1990 to 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 cargo ships sank
all over the world from 1990 to 1997, the World Maritime
Organization (WMO) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The organization that regulates international maritime
activities said these accidents killed 654 sailors and crew
members of different nationalities and caused losses of 1.52
million gross tons of cargo, mainly wheat, lumber, scrap iron,
coal and metals.
</P>
<P>
"The investigations of these accidents revealed that ships
prone to sink are those loaded with high density cargoes with
flags of convenience, and those that were in operation for more
than 15 years old," said the WMO.
</P>
<P>
In an annex to its report, the organization noted that when the
hold of a ship starts flooding by the prow, the bulkheads between
the holds usually can not bear the water pressure, especially when
they contain high density cargo, such as iron.
</P>
<P>
"The pressure produces a domino effect among the bulkheads,
which causes a rapid flooding along the ship that can sink it in a
few minutes."
</P>
<P>
The WMO recommends shipping companies, as a preventive measure,
to have better prepared crews, and issued new requisites for
mariners.
</P>
<P>
Panama, a world leader in maritime fleet, issued a rule to
prevent technical deficiencies, dangerous rusting of ships and
legal infractions in major ports of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian Maritime Authority (AMP) said the country has 1,
283 registered cargo ships so far, followed by Cyprus with 520 and
Liberia with 473.

<HEADLINE> Italy Asks NATO to Explain Dumping of Bombs into Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
on Friday urged NATO to provide all information necessary to
explain why bombs not used in its air strikes against Yugoslavia
were dumped into the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has officially asked NATO command for "
all the information necessary to shed light on the recent
discoveries of explosive devices in the international waters of
the Adriatic Sea," said a communique issued by the premier's
office.
</P>
<P>
It said that the bombs fished out of the sea on Thursday by
Venetian fishermen were not Italian-made nor used by Italian
military forces, but that they might have been dropped by NATO
planes returning from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that, according to NATO procedures, any such
action had to take place in certain designated areas and the bombs
had to be deactivated.
</P>
<P>
Fishing in areas "potentially affected by such events" had been
forbidden since Monday, it said, adding that further measures were
now being taken to ensure that NATO procedures were being strictly
observed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bombs hauled out of the Adriatic by Venetian
fishermen were made by the United States and have been used by the
U.S. and British air forces for the last five years, Italian
judicial sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, experts found that the bombs were
those used to arm F-16, F-18, F- 117, B-1 and B-2 fighter-bombers.
These warplanes are believed to have played a key role in NATO's
air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO reportedly admitted Friday that bombs which allied
warplanes had not used during their raids for technical reasons
had repeatedly been dropped into the sea which separates the
Balkans from Italy.

<HEADLINE> Panama Seizes Over 10 Tons of White Cocaine in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Drug Prosecutor
Rosendo Miranda said Friday that more than 10 tons of "white"
cocaine were seized in Panama last year, indicating a hard blow to
Colombian and Panamanian mafia cartels.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian anti-drug authorities have confiscated during
the last four years more than 74 tons of drugs, mostly cocaine and
marihuana, and almost 400 persons were given sentences for drug-
related crimes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that Colombian drug traffickers used the services of
expert chemists to produce a kind of "black cocaine" to export to
the United States, Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Miranda, who obtained the information from a document sent by
the Spanish police about the chemical composition of the "black
cocaine" and the Colombian cartels' tricks of operation, explained
that the chemical elements of "black cocaine" were used to escape
detection by police and anti-drug dogs' sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
"Black cocaine" is made of ferric cloride and acids.
</P>
<P>
Miranda, who had alerted anti-drug trafficking agencies in
Panama, said that in cargo documents the "black cocaine" is
intentionally disguised as a legal merchandise under the names of
"iron files," "toner" or red pigment for industry in general.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Sign Upbeat Letter of Intent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have signed the latest in a
series of letters of intent which confirms that Indonesia's
crisis-hit economy has bottomed out, the Indonesian Observer
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary indications suggest that the economy has now
bottomed out and stabilization is being consolidated," the report
quoted the letter of intent which was signed here on Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, IMF has revised upwards its forecast
for Indonesia's gross domestic product in 1999/2000 fiscal year to
between zero and 2 percent, compared to the earlier forecast of
between minus 1 to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has also revised downward its inflation forecast for
Indonesia to between 8 and 10 percent, down from an earlier
estimate of 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian officials said the signing of the new letter of
intent will pave the way for the disbursement of another 460
million U.S. dollars of bailout money from the IMF. The IMF so far
has disbursed some 9.5 billion U.S. dollars of its more than 12
billion dollar loan commitment.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's board of directors will meet at the end of this
month, when they are expected to approve the latest disbursement.
The IMF aid will be accompanied by the release of 500 million U.S.
dollars in loan under Japan's Miyazawa Plan.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic indicators showed signs of recovery during
the first quarter of this year. The economy expanded by 1.34
percent over the three-month period. Inflation in April was minus
0.68 percent, better than 0.18 percent deflation in March.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates declined from 36.5 to 29.9 percent as of
Wednesday. The rupiah also has stabilized at 8,000 against the
U.S. dollar despite the lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The positive developments have prompted both the Indonesian
government and the IMF to review the country's economic reform
programs and express renewed optimism at a quicker than expected
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hard hit by the economic crisis which began
in July 1997. The country suffered an economic contraction of more
than 13 percent in 1998 coupled with hyperinflation and
shyrocketing interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Seeks WTO Permission to Retaliate Against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Friday that it will
be requesting authorization from the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to retaliate against the European Union (EU) for its continued ban
on imports of Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a WTO panel made it clear that the EU ban on beef
produced with growth hormones is not based on science and
therefore is inconsistent with the EU's WTO obligations.
</P>
<P>
This finding was later confirmed by the WTO Appellate Body in
1998, and a WTO arbitrator gave the EU until May 13, 1999 to lift
the ban. The EU has not met its deadline; therefore, Canada is
exercising its WTO rights to suspend trade concessions to the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Canada plays by the rules, and expects others to do so as well,
" said Canadian International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi in a
release.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO has ruled twice in our favor, yet the EU has failed to
comply with the ruling. This is unacceptable," added the minister.
</P>
<P>
Marchi said Canada would be seeking authority to increase
tariffs on selected products imported from the EU for
approximately 70 million Canadian dollars (47.6 million U.S.
dollars) worth of lost beef exports due to the ban. Under WTO
rules, Canada has until June 12 to request this authority.
</P>
<P>
"Access to European markets is important to the growth of the
Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector," said Agriculture and
Agri-Food Minister Lyle Vanclief.
</P>
<P>
"Our first preference is to resolve this dispute in a trade-
enhancing manner; however, if we cannot find a mutually agreeable
solution, we will not hesitate to exercise our WTO rights," added
the Canadian minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO settlement process, if a WTO member does not
comply with a WTO ruling, members can either reach an agreement on
compensation or the aggrieved member can retaliate. Despite
discussions in recent weeks, Canada and the EU have not come to an
acceptable agreement on compensation.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Vehicle Sales Picking up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region are starting to
pick up steam after a slump in the past two years, a Philippine
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star said that total vehicle sales in Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines in the first three months
of this year rose nearly 14 percent compared with the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Combined vehicle sales in the four ASEAN countries reached
132,956 units in the first quarter, up from 116,685 units a year
ago, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Malaysia's automotive market performed strongly,
driven by heavy demand for national car models Proton and Perodua
cornering 82 percent of the market.

Sales in the country during the period more than doubled from
27,968 units to 62,404 units with the Proton and Perodua cars
leading the field, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Creator of Micro-Sculpture Presents New Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Cui Liangen is famous in this
capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for
his superb skill in creating works of micro-sculpture.
</P>
<P>
Two of his ivories were enlisted in the Guinness Books of
Records in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he engraved 156 figures and bridges, rivers, ships,
houses and trees on a square of ivory no larger than a finger nail,
depicting the urban life in the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127).
</P>
<P>
Cui cultivated a love for painting in childhood, and began to
learn carving at the age of 12, engraving figures, flowers and
insects on a piece of ivory the size of a grain of rice.
</P>
<P>
He has created more than 400 works that were displayed at two
personal exhibitions held in 1983 and 1989. More than 20 of his
carvings are now treasured in national museums in the United
States, Germany, and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Miniature sculpture is a way to carry forward the national
culture of China. It sets high demands on one's power of grip,
eyesight, and the ability to hold one's breath," said Cui, who is
a member of Chinese Artists' Association and vice-president of the
Urumqi Folk Arts Research Association.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Break Spills Oil into Amazon River Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,500 barrels of oil have spilt
from a damaged pipeline in the Tipuco zone, 48 kilometers from
Bagua City, in the north of Peru.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities quoted by the press on Friday as saying that
the spill covered several kilometers of the road that penetrates
into the jungle and mixed with the waters of the Maranon River,
one of the main Amazon River branches.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was caused Thursday by heavy rains and enormous
landslides that destroyed 30 meters of the pipeline, which runs
along the Maranon River.
</P>
<P>
Another 400 meters of pipeline was seriously damaged by big
rocks and tons of mud. Some of the residents of nearby communities
are gathering the oil for domestic use.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said technicians need five days to repair the
pipeline because the rains could delay the work.
</P>
<P>
The 865-kilometer-long pipeline was built between San Jose de
Saramuro, in the department of Loreto and the Bayovar oil port, in
the Piura department.

MACAO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The first chief executive of the

<HEADLINE> Life and Death Through the Eyes of Chinese War Correspondents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Huang Wen, Xinhua's photographer in
Belgrade, said on an international call recently that she was
shocked, and so must be the rest of the world, that she couldn't
believe that the nightmare really had come true.
</P>
<P>
Huang was busy reporting with another colleague when the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed by U.S.-led NATO last
Friday, killing three journalists, injuring more than 20 embassy
staff and destroying the embassy complex.
</P>
<P>
She drove in a hurry to the Chinese embassy to use her camera
to record the survivors' tears and resentment. "As a colleague and
friend of Shao Yunhuan, who died in this tragedy, I feel nothing
but anger," she said. "Everyone, man or women, has an equal risk
to face in war."
</P>
<P>
After Shao, a woman correspondent of Xinhua, Huang is the only
female Chinese photographer in Belgrade. She explained that a war
correspondent has to face two challenges every minute: To live to
work and to obtain information and manage to send it back in time.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of May 8, Hu Xijin, deputy editor of Global
Times, was awakened by a call from Lu Yansong, People's Daily's
Belgrade correspondent, telling him of the NATO missile attack. He
published a special edition of Global Times on May 9 with his
colleagues and the paper sold out immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hu was People's Daily's Belgrade correspondent in 1993, when
Shao Yunhuan was sent by Xinhua to the battlefield in the former
Yugoslavia. Shao and her husband would invite Hu for a get-
together now and then, making Hu feel at home, although he often
sensed the desperate loneliness as a war correspondent.

Hu recalled that in his war experiences, the shadow of death
seemed to be far away when he focused on his reporting close at

the most dangerous areas to get scoops and the sense of
accomplishment conquers the fear of death.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Selection Committee for 1st Macao SAR Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Selection Committee for the First
Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
mainly responsible for choosing the first chief executive of the
Macao SAR to be established on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a decision passed by the National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, on March 31, 1993, the
Selection Committee shall select the first chief executive through
local consultations or through nomination and election after
consultation, and report the selected candidate to the central
people's government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee shall be composed of 200 permanent
residents of Macao representing various social quarters.
</P>
<P>
The same decision also stipulates that the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao SAR is responsible for establishing the
Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member Preparatory Committee was organized in Beijing
in May 5, 1998. Among the members, 60 come from all walks of life
in Macao and the remaining 40 are officials and scholars from the
inland areas. Last September, the Preparatory Committee held
consultations among Macao residents to solicit their opinions on
forming the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
At its fourth plenary session last November, the Preparatory
Committee adopted a detailed method for forming the Selection
Committee. The method made it clear that the formation of the
Selection Committee shall follow the principle of impartiality,
justice, openness, democracy and honesty, and members of the
Selection Committee must be broadly representative.
</P>
<P>
Between January 26 and February 14 this year, 2,291 Macao
residents from various social sectors applied for membership of
the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The list of the applicants was later submitted to the
Preparatory Committee for examination and nomination.
</P>
<P>
On April 10, the Preparatory Committee decided on the 200
members of the Selection Committee by secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee convened its first plenary meeting on
April 23 to nominate candidates running for the office of the
first chief executive of the future Macao SAR. By mid April, nine
Macao residents had applied to run for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
As Selection Committee members Edmund Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au
Chong Kit had applied to run for the first chief executive, they
had to resign from the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Preparatory
Committee prior to the first plenary meeting of the Selection
Committee, Stanley Au, a Macao banker, was replaced by Wong Yau
See, who also comes from the industrial, commercial and financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
However, no one can replace Edmund Ho for he serves as a deputy
to the National People's Congress. According to relevant
regulations, NPC deputies in Macao naturally become Selection
Committee members.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there are only 199 members on the Selection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the first plenary meeting of the Selection Committee, Edmund
Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au Chong Kit won more than 20 nominating
votes and became candidates for the first chief executive.
</P>
<P>
At the second plenary meeting of the Selection Committee on May
7 and 8, the two candidates gave speeches expounding their views
on handling local affairs, and answered questions raised by the
committee members.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee is scheduled to choose the first chief
executive on May 15 through secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR will hold a meeting
on May 16 to examine the qualifications of the selected candidate
and then report the selected figure to the central government for
appointment.
</P>
<P>
In addition to choosing the first chief executive, the
Selection Committee will also select certain members of the first
Legislative Council of the Macao SAR, and select Macao SAR
deputies to the National People's Congress.

MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Build Waste-Water Treatment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen in south
China will begin construction of a waste-water treatment project
designed to prevent waste water from flowing into the Shenzhen
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will cost 650 million yuan, and
designing is underway for construction to begin within the year.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, built in 1960, plays an important role in
improving the quality of water of the Dongshen water supply
project which supplies 1.1 billion cubic meters of water to Hong
Kong a year, 70 percent of Hong Kong's total water consumption.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the water-supply project also supplies 493 million
cubic meters of water to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, and
150 million cubic meters of water to the city of Dongguan in
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Due to economic development in the Pearl River Delta over the
past two decades and the drastic increase of industrial activity
and population, various polluting sources around the water-supply
project are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The new treatment facility will be capable of collecting and
treating all polluting and industrial waste water around the
reservoir, experts say, adding that the reservoir's water volume
will not be affected.

<HEADLINE> Denmark to Meet China in Sudirman Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Denmark became the first
European country to advance into the final of the Sudirman Cup
mixed team championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Danish shuttlers, which remained third in last five
editions of the championships, edged Indonesia 3-2 in a semi-final
match to set up a showdown with defending champions Chinese
players in the final, which is slated for Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Danish squad, led by top world men's singles player Peter
Gade Christensen, took the semi-final match through the men's and
women's singles as well as the women's doubles while the
Indonesians, a shuttle power in the world, won the men's and mixed
doubles games.
</P>
<P>
After conceding the mixed doubles in the first game, Gade
Christensen leveled the score at 1-all by beating Taufik Hidayat
15-4 and 15-1 comfortably.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians jumped to lead the games once again through the
men's doubles by Tony Gunawan and Candra Wijaya, who beat Jens
Eriksen Jesper Larsen 15-12, 15-7, but they could just keep the
lead for a mere 30 minutes when Danish Camilla Martin trounced
Cindana Hartono 11-4 and 11-6.
</P>
<P>
In the decisive game of the women's doubles, Rikke Olsen and
Helene Kirkegaard outplayed Deyana Lomban and Indarti Isolina 17-
16 and 15-7 to establish Danish win.
</P>
<P>
In another semi-final match earlier on Friday, China
overwhelmed South Korea 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttlers won the men's singles and doubles, mixed
doubles, but lost the women's singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
China started their campaign to make a hat-trick of Sudirman
Cup champion through the mixed doubles when Ge Fei and Liu Yong
rallied from first set down to edge Kim Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min
10-15,15-10 and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
With one point in hands, former world champion Sun Jun, top
player in the Chinese team, gave a performance well below his par,
winning the men's singles after one set down at 9-15, 15-6 and 15-
7 against Ahn Jae Chang.
</P>
<P>
It had been expected that China would have the match at 3-0
after the third game in which Gong Zhichao met South Korean Kim Ji
Hyun. In their seven previous meetings since 1997, Gong Zhichao
had a dominating winning record with five victories and two
defeats.
</P>
<P>
However, Gong Zhichao, silver medalist at the last Asian Games
in Bangkok, Thailand, met a strong challenge from Kim Ji Hyun, and
lost the game at 9-11, 11-1 and 3-11.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's doubles, China's Zhang Jun and Yu Jinghao
well played above standard, trouncing South Korean duo Lee Dong
Soo and Yoo Yong Sung with ease at 15-3, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the two pairs met each other at a
major tournament.
</P>
<P>
The women's doubles had been a routine play in which Zhang Ning
and Gu Jun lost to Ra Kyung Min and Chung Jae Hee 15-8, 12-15 and
11-15.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles had been a crucial game for both China and
South Korea, which finished second in the last Sudirman Cup
championships in Glasgow, Scotland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
After playing to a deadlock of 1-1 draw in the first two sets,
South Korean duo of Kim Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min had a flying
start in the third and final one, leading their Chinese rivals 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of several errors by Kim and Ra, Liu Yong and
Ge Fei trailed the score to 8-13 and 11-13.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the point of live-or-die, Kim and Ra made successive
mistakes when serving and the Chinese shuttlers jumped to lead the
score 14-13 and took the game through smash by Ge Fei, women's
doubles Olympic champion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Liu Xinmin attributed the pair's win to strong
mentality. "The Chinese pair are at the same level with the
Koreans, Only those who have strong mentality in the match could
win," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a relegation match of Division one, Sweden defeated Malaysia
4-1 to remain in the division while Malaysia was relegated to
Division two in next Sudirman Cup two years later.
</P>
<P>
While in the clash between top two finishers of Division two,
England edged Thailand 3-2 to win a position in Division one in
next tournament in 2001.

</P>
<P>
A source from the recent symposium on new-materials development
said Beijing hopes to realize 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in sales income from the new-materials industry next year.
</P>
<P>
The annual sales income is expected to reach 65 billion yuan (7.
8 billion dollars) by the year 2010, when the new-materials
industry has become an industrial pillar of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the industry will focus on new materials
for electronics, information, environmental protection, energy,
and building.
</P>
<P>
The city will establish an information service platform for
development of this industry and encourage risk investment in the
development of the new materials.
</P>
<P>
The present materials industry mainly produces low value-added
and energy-intensive products which also cause serious pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Beijing has some 250 factories producing over 100
kinds of new-material products. They reported a combined sales
income of five billion yuan (602 million dollars) in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Chinese in New York Ask U.N. to End  Conflicts in Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Chinese, who are living in
the New York area, Friday sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, condemning the NATO missile attacks on the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia and calling for more U.N. role to end
conflicts in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the letter, read at a
peaceful rally, held Friday near the U.N. headquarters to protest
the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy by the U.S.-led NATO.

</P>
<P>
We, Chinese-American living in the New York area, were shocked
and angered by the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
on May 7, that left three Chinese journalists dead and twenty
embassy staff members injured. The attack was a flagrant violation
of the U.N. Charter, international law and the Vienna Convention.
It has stirred up an international uproar and a storm of protest
in China. It has also incensed ethnic Chinese throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
You have also expressed shock and sadness over that serious
incident, and called for a quick negotiated end to the conflict in
Yugoslavia. We commend you for your efforts.
</P>
<P>
NATO's launching of an air war on a sovereign state, bypassing
the United Nations, was a serious mistake in violation of the U.N.
Charter. It has not mitigated, but instead, aggravated ethic
conflict in that part of the world. Bombing civilian targets have
resulted in increasing casualties and destruction of the
infrastructure on which normal life depends. It has not helped the
Albanian refugees, a large number of whom were killed in NATO
raids. We strongly urge that the United Nations work to bring the
sides together and reach a negotiated settlement under U.N.
auspices. But it is obvious that no negotiation can begin when
intensive bombing is going on. Bombing must stop, so that serious
negotiations can begin.
</P>
<P>
The aftermath of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy complicates
the peace effort. All indications show that it was not a simple
mistake of misidentification as NATO and the United States have
claimed. They must conduct a thorough investigation and announce
to the world what really happened and bring the culprit(s) to
justice. And open and solemn apology to China is in order.
</P>
<P>
We attach great importance to the role of the United Nations.
We hope that the world organization can bring the Balkan conflict
to a just end, and help clean up the aftermath of the bombing of
the Chinese Embassy, so that world peace and stability can be
better served.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Chinese in New York Calls for Truth, Justice in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Chinese, who are living in
the New York area, Friday sent an open letter to U.S. President
William Clinton, demanding truth and justice regarding the
U.S.-led NATO's May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the letter, read at a
peaceful rally, held near the United Nations headquarters, to
protest against the NATO missile attacks.
</P>
<P>

<P>
President William J. Clinton
</P>
<P>
The White House
</P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. 20036
</P>
<P>
Dear President Clinton,
</P>
<P>
We are Chinese-Americans living in the New York area, loyal
citizens of the United States. We are shocked and angered by the
NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7 that
resulted in three deaths and a score wounded. The attack was in
flagrant violation of international law and the Vienna Convention.
Its seriousness cannot be exaggerated. It has stirred up an
international uproar and a storm of protest in China. It has
also incensed ethnic Chinese the world over.
</P>
<P>
You have apologized to the Chinese on more than one occasion,
and called it a 'tragic mistake'. But the apology came late and
sounded perfunctory. Calling it a simple mistake resulting form
'faulty intelligence' -- the use of an outdated map -- is hardly
credible. The site of the embassy building is well known in
Belgrade. It is clearly marked on tourist maps. That something is
known to tourists should be unknown to American intelligence is
mind-bogging. In fact, the American military attache was a
frequent visitor to the embassy before the U.S. closed its
diplomatic mission in Belgrade. To claim that the Chinese Embassy
was misidentified as the Yugoslav Federal Directorate fo Supply
and Procurement -- two buildings on different sides of the main
highway and hundreds of meters apart -- is simply unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
We therefore request that your Administration and NATO make an
open and solemn apology to the Chinese, and more importantly,
conduct a thorough investigation of the matter, and bring those
responsible to justice. There are people, especially in the
intelligency community, who would like to undermine U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
We love this country. And we prize our tradition of
safeguarding peace and justice. We believe a good working
relationship between the United States and China. for which you
have worked untiringly, is extremely important to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
We therefore ask that NATO halt the bombing immediately, and
work for a peaceful settlement through negotiations under the
auspices of the United Nations, and work hard to mend relations
with the People's Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks plunged Friday
in renewed fears of higher interest rates triggered by steep rise
in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 193.87 points or
by 1.74 percent at 10,913.32. The index rose 106.82 at 11,107.19
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 29.76 at 1,337.80 while the technology heavy Nasdaq
index fell 54.14 at 2,527.86.
</P>
<P>
The stocks were pushed lower after the U.S. Labor Department
reported that consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, the
biggest monthly increase in nearly nine year. The higher inflation
sank the stock market because investors worried that the Federal
Reserve would raise interest rates to cool off the economy when
its Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the government reports sent a contradictive signal
that inflation was under control. The reports show the producer
price index's core rate which strips away volatile food and energy
costs, rose 0.1 percent in April, retail sales rose 0.1 percent in
the same month and unemployment will remain at 4.3 percent this
month.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 12.90 to 638.45 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 11.58 to 788.81. The Russell 2000 index
fell 7.71 to 443.13.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 676 up, 2.411 down and 467
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 723.69 million shares from 785.34
million in the previous session.
